The long leather tail of the bullwhip connected with her quivering flank and a sharp crack echoed back to him.</p><p>She released a low-pitched grunt but remained still, staring at him with defiant brown eyes.</p> <p>Stubborn.</p><p>Again he lifted his arm. He put more force behind the blow, hitting the same spot, but harder.</p><p>Her whole body quivered.</p><p>\u201cFor Christsake, quit fuckin\u2019 around with her. Throw a goddamn rope around her neck and make her come.\u201d</p><p>Ben McKay squinted at the lone cow, her hooves mired in the mud. He sighed, spurred his horse through the creek and stopped ten feet in front of the immovable cow. After switching out his whip for his rope, he twirled and let fly. The loop circled her neck and he tugged to tighten it. He\u2019d done this so many times he didn\u2019t have to spur his horse; Bongo just moved forward.</p> <p>The cow, given the choice between choking or moving, stumbled forward.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s horse danced impatiently at the top of the rise, as his rider watched Ben drag the cow up the incline. \u201cDon\u2019t know why in the hell she likes that damn creek,\u201d Quinn remarked. \u201cShe\u2019d stay there until it froze over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Bongo picked up the pace and Ben led the cow through the gate. As soon as Quinn closed off her only avenue of escape, Ben released the rope. He dismounted and approached the cow slowly. \u201cNow don\u2019t go getting any ideas about running off.\u201d She stood still while he slipped the loop from her neck. Then he slapped her hard on the rump and she lumbered toward the rest of the herd.</p><p>Quinn waited while Ben mounted up. They poked along, soaking in the last rays of the sun\u2019s warmth. Indian summer had stretched through the first week of October. They\u2019d take temperate days while they could because winter in Wyoming seemed to last more than half the damn year.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019re your plans for the weekend?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>\u201cGoin\u2019 to Gillette. I\u2019ll be back Sunday sometime.\u201d He pushed up his hat and looked at Quinn. \u201cUnless you and Libby need me back early for chores on Sunday morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah. We can handle it. Aren\u2019t you gonna be around to watch the PBR Sunday afternoon? It\u2019ll be the last time Chase rides in the regular season.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten about that. His bull riding younger brother had pulled his head out of his ass and had made a good showing on the PBR tour the past few months. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because at the last poker game you volunteered your house as a place for us all to get together to watch.\u201d</p><p>Ben stopped his horse. \u201cDefine all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll...meaning all our McKay cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Was I drunk when I volunteered?\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughed. \u201cNope. You were sober enough to exclude kids and wives in the invite. Besides, you own the biggest TV of any of us. And if you sweet talk Keely, she\u2019ll bring food.\u201d</p><p>His cousin Keely loved McKay events with the boys, since she was the only female McKay in their generation. \u201cI\u2019ll call her on my way out of town.\u201d</p> <p>When they reached Quinn\u2019s place, Ben asked, \u201cWe usin\u2019 the horses for anything early next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple things we need to check in the northwest corner that\u2019s easier to get to on horseback than with the ATVs. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to leave Bongo here until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>Ben dismounted and unhooked the cinch strap.</p><p>\u201cIs there a woman in Gillette you\u2019ve been keeping secret?\u201d</p><p>Ben tossed the saddle over the split rail fence. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be a secret if I told you now, would it?\u201d</p><p>Quinn dropped his saddle next to Ben\u2019s. \u201cWhy do you drive to Gillette to get laid and get drunk when there are plenty of places around here? And plenty of women who\u2019d be happy to be in your bed for more than a weekend.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and removed the wet saddle blanket, draping it over the rail. \u201cWho\u2019d you hear that from? Tell? Or Dalton?\u201d</p><p>Quinn pitched Ben a currycomb. \u201cNeither. I heard that from my wife.\u201d</p><p>Ben brushed Bongo with long strokes. \u201cTrouble in paradise? Has Libby been hanging out at Ziggy\u2019s bar again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. No, a couple of the new, single teachers have asked her about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeachers? Definitely not my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He patted Bongo\u2019s withers. \u201cI have a hard time believing a teacher would make a good student.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Thinking out loud always got him in trouble. \u201cNothin\u2019. I\u2019m just touchy about all of our damn family members, including your wife, thinking I need to be paired up and married off now that Chase and Ava have tied the knot. Not everyone wants to be chained down with a wife and kids.\u201d From the corner of his eye, he noticed Quinn bristle. \u201cSorry. Between our married relatives lookin\u2019 at me like a loser terminal bachelor, and the single chicks at the local bars angling to tame one of the last wild McKays, I\u2019m better off finding my hookups in Gillette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta be honest, it\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re hooking up with women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that? You worried I\u2019m secretly craving cock?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give a shit if you were. But it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you with a date you can\u2019t blame me for wondering what kind of woman is worth the drive.\u201d</p><p>An obedient woman.</p><p>Not that Ben could explain that, either. He grinned. \u201cA woman who doesn\u2019t want more than a night or two.\u201d</p><p>His brother laughed. \u201cDaylight\u2019s a\u2019wastin\u2019. Get a move on. I\u2019ll finish up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, bro. See you Sunday.\u201d</p><p>Ben sped home. A shower and a change of clothes put him in a good mood and he whistled while he packed for the weekend. House secured, he headed to the barn to refill the dogs\u2019 food and water bowls. Ace and Deuce leveled baleful looks at him. \u201cYou mutts are spoiled livin\u2019 in the house.\u201d He petted their heads. \u201cBe good guard dogs, \u2019kay?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Ben cruised down Main Street in Gillette and parked in the back lot behind the Rawhide Bar. When he crossed the alley, the streetlight sizzled and popped before it flickered out, putting the doorway in shadow.</p><p>The left door was the back service entrance to the Rawhide Bar. But the slightly recessed door on the right was the entrance into the Rawhide Club\u2014not that it was marked as such. A keycode was required to enter, a code that changed every weekend. Ben scrolled to the text from Cody and punched in the number, watching as the green light flashed.</p><p>A short set of stairs ended at a wide landing. The door was manned by security on Friday and Saturday nights. Because security and anonymity were paramount to club members, Ben was surprised the door was propped open with a barstool and he could wander in, unimpeded.</p><p>The large main room, decorated in gold and red, harkened back to brothels in the Wild West. An ornate horseshoe-shaped bar dominated the back corner. The floor to tin ceiling barback consisted of gilded mirrors and glass shelves. A sizeable brick and slate fireplace took center stage on the opposite wall. Several old-fashioned velvet, leather and brocade couches were placed in a semi-circle in front of it. Other chairs and loveseats separated the outer space into individual seating areas. Room dividers also created intimate, hidden spots. At the far back of the room was a hallway that split into two sides.</p><p>The high-pitched whine of the vacuum cleaner stopped and Sully strode into view. \u201cBennett!\u201d He pulled him in for a one-armed man hug. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too. I was beginning to wonder if I was the only one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Cody\u2019s cleaning up a mess in the hallway. Murphy is next door, counting the till. Want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>Sully slipped behind the bar. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I haven\u2019t been around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Been slow in the club.\u201d Sully popped the top on a bottle of Moose Drool.</p><p>Ben settled on the stool. \u201cWhat about the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bar side always stays busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s gotta make Cody and Trace happy.\u201d He took a pull off his beer. \u201cWhat\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p><p>Sully shrugged and loosened his tie. \u201cNot much. Keeping my head above water at the day job. I sling drinks one night a week at the bar to give Cody a break. I\u2019ve been on overseer status at the club most Saturday nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still makin\u2019 time with that redhead from Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last two times I\u2019ve seen her haven\u2019t been on club nights. She comes into the bar side, tosses back a couple of appletinis, we shoot the breeze, and she\u2019s gone before closing time.\u201d</p><p>Ben frowned. \u201cThink she wants to see you outside of the club?\u201d Most female club members didn\u2019t hang out in the Rawhide Bar. The reason they\u2019d joined the club was to avoid random, disappointing hookups with half-drunk men after last call. Being a member of the Rawhide Club guaranteed they\u2019d get laid since that was the club\u2019s objective\u2014providing a place for no-strings-attached, safe and consensual sex.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Sully rested his elbows on the bar. \u201cI like her. The sex is great. She\u2019s not heavy into the Dom/sub stuff, which is fine with me.\u201d</p><p>Sully\u2019s attitude surprised Ben. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last couple months I\u2019ve realized that while I enjoy certain aspects of this club, it\u2019s not a permanent lifestyle choice for me. I know Murphy and Layla are happy living the life twenty-four/seven. I suspect Cody and Trace will eventually find a permanent submissive. No judgment from me. But Christ, Ben, I don\u2019t wanna put a damn slave collar on a woman. I don\u2019t want her to kneel at my feet. All I want is a lover who\u2019s sexually open-minded and lets me call the shots when we\u2019re getting busy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben pointed his beer bottle at Sully. \u201cWhich is why we both joined this club in the first place. Neither of us was finding that open-mindedness in the regular dating world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a reminder, because I remember those days, pretending a quick fuck-and-suck hookup satisfied me. I got goddamn tired of feelin\u2019 like a deviant for what I did want from the women who shared my bed. So while I understand where you\u2019re coming from, I also ain\u2019t gonna kid myself that I\u2019ll ever find the type of woman I want outside of a club like this.\u201d</p> <p>Sully whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s a harsh answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a no bullshit answer. It was...liberating when I stopped lying to myself that my membership in this club was temporary.\u201d</p><p>Sully\u2019s astute gaze pinned him in place. \u201cYou looking for a permanent sub too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I was, I doubt I\u2019d find one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSays the lawyer,\u201d Ben drawled. \u201cSo, why haven\u2019t you asked the redhead out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared to. What if I find out she\u2019s a kindergarten teacher who reads to the elderly in her spare time?\u201d Sully dropped his voice. \u201cWould I be able to fuck her as hard and raw as I did before? Or what if the attraction only makes sense in the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya. Which is why I haven\u2019t played with a woman from this club, outside the club, for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while?\u201d Sully repeated with confusion.</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me after what happened with Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hell, I\u2019d forgotten about her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWish I could,\u201d Ben muttered. Zoe had been sweet at first, and he\u2019d even taken her to his house\u2014which was a rarity. Didn\u2019t take long to discover she needed far more pain in her sex play than he was comfortable dishing out. Zoe preferred to be caned. Not occasionally, but as a prelude to every sexual encounter. And she hadn\u2019t wanted the marks only on her ass; she\u2019d demanded them on her legs, arms and back.</p><p>When Ben refused to beat her that severely, Zoe turned nasty, threatening to blab far and wide about Ben\u2019s sexual appetites. That\u2019s when he\u2019d discovered she lived in his hometown. Ben feared how much damage that type of rumor could do to him\u2014a man who fiercely guarded his privacy, especially within his enormous family and within the conservative ranching community. The only reason she hadn\u2019t blabbed was under threat of expulsion from the club. And luckily, she\u2019d been scarce in recent months. Still, Ben had asked himself if the misstep he\u2019d made with her had been his fault. If he\u2019d just talked to her honestly, would it have had a positive outcome for both of them?</p><p>The incident reinforced Ben\u2019s decision to keep the two halves of himself separate: Bennett, the sexual dominant, and Ben, the laid-back rancher. The women who appealed to Bennett would never find a permanent place in Ben\u2019s life. Inside the club he never spoke of his life outside the club.</p><p>One thing the incident hadn\u2019t changed? The fact Ben liked sexual variety. He liked devoting a few nights to a woman, figuring out what she needed, giving it to her and heightening the sexual experience for both of them. He knew that\u2019s why he excelled at domination games: he didn\u2019t get complacent. Or attached.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Bennett. You still with me, man?\u201d</p><p>Ben glanced up from his beer. \u201cYeah. Just thinking. Wondering what\u2019s in store for me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you asked,\u201d Cody said behind him.</p><p>He faced his buddy who owned the Rawhide Bar. \u201cAlready planned something for me? I\u2019m hoping it involves a hot blonde and a pair of handcuffs.\u201d</p> <p>Cody snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s a door upstairs that\u2019s sticking, floor trim that\u2019s come loose, and a couple other things that are beyond my handyman abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou been saving shit jobs for me so I\u2019ll feel useful when I show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. We all know you\u2019re useless.\u201d He and Sully laughed when Ben flipped them off. \u201cSeriously, I could use your carpentry skills.\u201d</p><p>Ben drained his beer. \u201cLet\u2019s get it done before the club opens, so floor trim ain\u2019t the only thing I\u2019m nailing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cWhat does one wear to a sex club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking as a submissive, I wear whatever I\u2019m told to wear. Or more to the point, what I\u2019m told not to wear.\u201d</p><p>Depressed by her dull clothing choices, Ainsley focused on her friend Layla. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a submissive, so am I supposed to adorn myself like a badass dominatrix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Miz Hamilton, did you bring a selection of latex and leather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be shocked if a bank executive openly admitted owning fetish wear.\u201d Layla smiled impishly. \u201cBesides, the Rawhide Club is a private club, like the Elks Club or the Moose Lodge.\u201d</p><p>Before Ainsley could retort, Layla bounced off the bed and inspected the clothes hanging in the tiny hotel room closet. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a corset?\u201d</p><p>She doubted a girdle counted. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Layla rummaged inside her mini-suitcase and tossed out pieces of lingerie. \u201cI have exactly what you need to get appropriately dolled up.\u201d She draped a red and black polka-dotted push up bra over her shoulder, then a matching g-string, followed by a lacy black peignoir and a red satin kimono.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a little obvious I\u2019m on the prowl for sex if I waltz in wearing my underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend, what part of looking sexy to get you hot sex is confusing? That\u2019s why this club is in existence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it is a sex club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley groaned and flopped on the bed. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe she should\u2019ve stayed home and organized her spice cupboard.</p><p>No. You need to add spice to your life\u2014specifically your sex life\u2014not keep it bottled up in your kitchen.</p><p>Layla bounced on the bed beside her. \u201cWhat\u2019s really going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t? I mean, what if Dean was right?\u201d Beg any decent man to tie you up and spank you during sex and he\u2019ll be out the door.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, your ex-husband was a tool. He blamed you for his...ah...shortcomings.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley snickered.</p><p>\u201cLook, sweetie, we\u2019ve been friends for a long time. You settled for Dean. You were over thirty, panicked about being unmarried and alone, and picked the first guy who wasn\u2019t a total troll. Your sex life with him was as predictable as every other part of your life with him. It wasn\u2019t a good match, no matter how hard you tried to convince yourself otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Thanks for the pep talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe club may not be your thing. But you won\u2019t know unless you try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy is okay with me just observing?\u201d The other club she\u2019d visited had strict policies about guest expectations. She hoped she didn\u2019t stand out like some wide-eyed wannabe tonight, although technically, she was.</p><p>Layla smirked. \u201cI handled Murphy. You are my old friend, Angel, from my banking days.\u201d Her phone buzzed and she said, \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s thoughts drifted to her failed marriage as she stared at the hotel room ceiling. During the first year of wedded bliss, both she and Dean were so smug about how theirs was a true partnership. Neither had more control financially, emotionally or physically over the other. They were equals. They both held upper level management jobs in the banking industry. They shared the household chores. They took turns cooking and doing laundry.</p><p>The only change during their second year of marriage was their sex life became more perfunctory. But they\u2019d talked about it, Dean assuring her that desire fades. Reminding her that friendship, companionship, open communication, common interests and mutual career goals were far more important than sex.</p><p>During their third year of marriage, what Ainsley thought she\u2019d loved about Dean began to drive her crazy. His insistence on everything being a joint decision. From where they ate dinner, to the type of wine they drank, to which place changed the oil in their cars. When he asked for her help in choosing a spring vacation destination, she\u2019d suggested that he surprise her. He argued surprises weren\u2019t fun. She argued meticulous planning wasn\u2019t fun. That\u2019s when they started to argue about a lot of other things.</p><p>Ainsley realized while she appreciated some aspects of a well-ordered life, there was something missing in hers. Passion. Excitement. Spontaneity.</p><p>One night, in year four, she\u2019d decided to rev up their sex life. She stripped in the living room in front of the TV, dropped to all fours and asked Dean to fuck her from behind.</p><p>Flustered by her crude demand, Dean refused.</p><p>She tried again a few weeks later, on the way home from a cocktail party. Tipsy and feeling naughty, she tried to give Dean a blowjob in their Volvo.</p><p>Flustered once again, Dean refused.</p><p>The following month her attempt to entice him into light bedroom bondage using his Brooks Brothers\u2019 ties netted the same result: a big fat no. As did her suggestion that he punish her wanton, wicked ways with a spanking.</p><p>At that point Dean suggested she needed counseling.</p><p>At that point Ainsley suggested he needed Viagra.</p><p>And that\u2019s when their supposedly perfect marriage fell apart. Not only because Ainsley craved variety in the bedroom, but the way she\u2019d voiced her concerns to her husband\u2014he wasn\u2019t seeing to her needs\u2014had put Dean on the defensive. He became cruel. Cutting. Condescending. What she saw as an attempt to improve the intimacy in their marriage Dean saw as her attempt to force him into becoming a type of man he wasn\u2019t. A type of man he\u2019d never be.</p><p>So for all her bold talk, in the last year and a half since her divorce, Ainsley hadn\u2019t done a single thing to take charge of her sexuality except increase her collection of vibrators.</p><p>One night after an extra glass of liquid courage, she\u2019d asked Layla for advice on how to kink up her sex life. Because Layla\u2019s relationship with her longtime squeeze, Murphy, was kinky indeed\u2014Layla was a fulltime submissive and Murphy was her dominant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019d been difficult wrapping her head around the concept; Layla willingly ceded control to Murphy in all aspects of her life\u2014not just sexually. When Layla had lived in Denver, Ainsley had known Murphy worked in a club, but not what kind of club. But she\u2019d never imagined a sex club, because she had no flipping clue places like that even existed outside fictional novels.</p><p>She planned to get a real education about it tonight.</p><p>She scooped up Layla\u2019s risqu\u00e9 lingerie and slunk into the bathroom. She stripped and added a piece at a time, ignoring the pooch in her belly. Next week she really had to start working out again. The kimono hit mid thigh and adequately covered her jiggly ass. Five minutes after her thirty-seventh birthday her body had started to sag like an ugly old couch. Not that she\u2019d ever in her life been a toned size two.</p> <p>Now is not the time to revisit your body issues. Think sexy, act sexy, be sexy.</p><p>Once she\u2019d tugged on her outfit, she pinned up her hair, securing it with a hairnet. She unzipped the bag and slipped the wig from the Styrofoam dummy\u2019s head, settling it onto her own.</p><p>After jabbing a million bobby pins into her scalp, Ainsley angled closer to the mirror, smoothing flyaway strands with her fingers. The sleek wig was shoulder length, coal black with jagged ends dyed blood red. It was funky, hip and fun. No one would mistake it for her real hair, but wasn\u2019t that the point of tonight? To be daring and eccentric? She was fully incognito in this get-up. She doubted her cats would recognize her.</p><p>Two raps on the door were her only warning before Layla burst in. \u201cAre you... My God, what the fuck is that thing on your head?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly the reaction she\u2019d hoped for. \u201cI\u2019m embracing my inner Sydney Bristow.\u201d</p> <p>Layla grabbed her upper arms and circled her slowly before stopping in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSo? Do I look ridiculous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It just shocked me. But I\u2019ve gotta say, the wig is perfect with the clothes I brought. Wow, A, you look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScouts honor. You always look nauseatingly well put together. I like seeing this other side of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other side? Nuttier? Sluttier?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYounger. More playful. Now don\u2019t glare at me. I know you\u2019re a professional woman and all, but, girlfriend, there\u2019s no reason not to show a little skin after that bank vault closes. You\u2019re sporting one of those curvy hourglass bodies that men go wild for.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that \u201chourglass figure\u201d phrase a euphemism for...fat?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide it. Flaunt it.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley wasn\u2019t the flaunt it type.</p><p>Or maybe you are. Age and size ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but numbers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hit the road. The club is about to open and Murphy is getting all snappy and threatening because I\u2019m not there.\u201d</p><p>Here was the opening she\u2019d waited for. \u201cLayla, can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have time to do your make-up before we go.\u201d She pointed to the toilet seat. \u201cSit.\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley closed her eyes when Layla hovered over her with brushes, powders and eyeliner. \u201cThanks, but that wasn\u2019t the question I meant. I want to know about your relationship with Murphy. He seems awfully controlling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the definition of a dominant.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to find the wording that wouldn\u2019t piss off her friend but would also give her the information she\u2019d always been too shy to ask about. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like, hurt you or anything if he doesn\u2019t get his way, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking if he beats me if I\u2019ve done something to piss him off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Layla swept a long, wet line of make-up across Ainsley\u2019s eyelids near her lash line. \u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy has never raised his hand to me in anger. It would destroy him to hurt me. But you have to understand that his use of whips, floggers and other instruments are part of our life. I ask him to restrain me and leave welts and marks on my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pain takes me to a place where I can truly let go of the control I\u2019ve tried to maintain in all areas of my life since I was a little girl.\u201d</p><p>Could a little pain really do that? Make Ainsley forget everything? Allow her to exist solely in the moment? Not worry about anything except when the next smack or lash would land? Why did that appeal to her so much? And why was she so embarrassed to admit that to anyone? She\u2019d even led Layla to believe she wanted to explore her dominant tendencies, when submission interested her far more.</p><p>Isn\u2019t the whole point of this to learn who you really are? If you\u2019re capable of letting go? How can you be honest with anyone else when you\u2019re still lying to yourself?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had some bad things in my past,\u201d Layla said softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Layla. I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knew because I excelled at keeping stuff hidden. But it was crippling me. I didn\u2019t talk about it at all. My way to deal with it was with physical punishment. Making myself hurt as bad on the outside as I did on the inside. That\u2019s how I ended up hanging out at hardcore bondage clubs and letting any man or woman use me as their whipping post. But I\u2019d reached the point where I didn\u2019t feel pain. One night I hooked up with a Dom who started to beat me severely and I didn\u2019t do anything to stop him. But Murphy stepped in. He became my savior in so many ways.</p><p>\u201cAfter he cleaned me up, he took me to his place. This big bear of a man was a total stranger to me and I felt safer with him than I\u2019d felt with anyone. I slept for twenty-four hours straight. When I woke up, he wouldn\u2019t allow me to put up my usual defenses. He talked to me. He made me talk to him.\u201d Soft bristles swept over Ainsley\u2019s cheekbone. \u201cThere was something about his voice that encouraged me, soothed me, made me want to please him, made me trust him. Anyway, I told him things I\u2019d never shared with anybody. Things even I\u2019d forgotten. And after I went through a whole box of tissues after sobbing for hours, and my throat was raw from talking for hours, he scooped me into his arms and just held me. For hours.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley withheld her questions, hard as that was.</p><p>\u201cMurphy had been a Dom for a decade at that point. He\u2019d never considered taking on a sub fulltime until he met me. His brother Rafe is a counselor. After my meltdown I spent time talking to Rafe alone, and with Murphy. While all this soul searching stuff was going on, I fell in love with Murphy.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cTotally, completely in love with the gentle giant who had such a code of honor that he didn\u2019t touch me at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did that last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months. Murphy took me to clubs where I could see other kinds of play. Play where a Dom administering pain was a preface for sexual pleasure for the sub. Without getting into too many details, it made me hot. And wet. Two things I\u2019d never felt when the whip scored my skin. When he saw my reaction, he knew I was ready to experience the difference with him. It changed my life. So, the long answer to your question is no, Murphy would never abuse me. He gets me. He loves me. We give each other exactly what the other needs.\u201d She sniffled again. \u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley looked at Layla.</p><p>\u201cBe honest with me. Why are you interested in experiencing any of this? I see a look of revulsion in your eyes, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more confusion than revulsion. I don\u2019t know why some of this appeals to me so much.\u201d She glanced away with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cThere. That wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d Layla asked.</p><p>Yes. \u201cI\u2019m relieved your story has a happy ending. I never understood why you just quit your job so abruptly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it seemed fast on the outside, but things hadn\u2019t been going well at the bank for awhile. I was more than ready to walk away and start my life over with Murphy. Our relationship might not be the norm, but it works for us. What is normal? And who the hell has the right to define what it is anyway?\u201d Layla smiled slyly. \u201cAnd yes, I am happy. And I want you to be happy too.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley doubted she\u2019d ever find happiness in a man whipping her on a regular basis.</p><p>Judgmental much? You\u2019re just scared of the unknown.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. You\u2019re driving.\u201d At the door, Layla said, \u201cOops, I forgot one thing.\u201d She handed Ainsley a gold wristband. \u201cSince you\u2019re still on the fence about what you want, at least try and act like you deserve to wear this tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley squinted through the windshield at the building across the street. Rawhide Bar was burned into a gigantic wooden sign and outlined with rope-like neon tubing. \u201cThis is just a bar.\u201d</p><p>Layla sighed. \u201cWhat were you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA buzzing neon sign with an arrow pointing the way to a dark and dirty sex club, hidden in an alley. Scantily clad, red-lipped women smoking cigarettes and eyeing their next sexual conquest while the greasy bouncer swigged from a flask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disappoint you, but the Rawhide Bar has been here for over a hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has? How\u2019s that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rawhide is two separate entities. The club portion harkens back to the days when a brothel operated out of the hotel side. Of course, they couldn\u2019t call it a brothel, so they called it a gentleman\u2019s club. The owners charged a membership fee, and the city provided the Rawhide with its own charter that\u2019s still in effect today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Cody and Trace\u2019s great-grandfather was the founder. So when the boys of this generation decided to bring back the club aspect in a discreet and exclusive manner, it was all perfectly legal because the charter never expires as long as an original family member owns the building and business inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered how a place like this survived in a smaller town like Gillette without rousing local suspicions. So neither their father nor their grandfather ran any type of club from here when they were in charge?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Depression hit them pretty hard. Then the country went to war. I guess they had a bi-weekly poker club for a few years in the 50s and 60s, complete with cocktail servers who dressed like Playboy Bunnies. Who knows what else went on in the private rooms? They turned the hotel side into a flophouse in the 70s and 80s during the oil boom. Then after the energy bust, that side sat idle until Cody and Trace\u2019s dad retired and moved to Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet the Rawhide Bar survived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly because it is a regular local bar that anyone can wander into and buy a drink. The club part is completely separate.\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley pulled her coat around her skimpy clothes. \u201cAnd who makes up the majority of the members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few locals. Most are from out of town. Some from out of state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do potential new members hear about this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, since members have to sign a bunch of privacy and nondisclosure forms. Clientele recommendations come from managers of clubs like this in other parts of the country. Some members will talk to Murphy about someone they think might be a good fit for the club. Then Murphy investigates them. If he has enough interested parties, we host a guest night. In the last two years we\u2019ve gained thirty new members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problems with Jim Bob blabbing at the town diner that he saw Betty Sue getting screwed silly by a man who wasn\u2019t her husband?\u201d</p> <p>Layla laughed. \u201cNot in the six years we\u2019ve been here. But there are stringent rules, because a place like this is so hard to find, especially in rural America. The members are very protective of this place and the people they\u2019ve connected with here. I know several female members who trust a Dom with a flogger or a whip, but they haven\u2019t exchanged last names. First names only. No sharing of personal information unless it\u2019s mutually agreed upon. And then only if Murphy is aware they\u2019ll be meeting outside the club. There isn\u2019t a lot of bullshit because all the members are here for the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex with varying levels of kink. Sex without strings.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley met Layla\u2019s curious stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice job distracting me and stalling for time. I bet I sounded like a tour guide, breaking down every single thing and providing historical footnotes.\u201d Layla struck a pose. \u201cAnd here we have a spanking bench covered in the softest cowhide. Look at the manacles, lined with rich Cordovian leather. Only the best at the Rawhide Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you notice the words to that TV ditty are kinda dirty?\u201d Ainsley belted out, \u201cHead \u2019em up, move \u2019em in, move \u2019em out...Rawhide!\u201d</p> <p>Layla groaned. \u201cI am so glad there\u2019s no karaoke at this place.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cLet\u2019s mosey on in and find us a cowboy to ride until our hides are raw.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Ben was contemplating sub choices when a flash of red caught his eye. He swiveled on his barstool to watch the siren in the silk kimono saunter through the room.</p><p>Oh hell yeah, his night had just improved tenfold.</p><p>She perched on the edge of her barstool, every inch of her so prim and proper Ben\u2019s fingers itched to muss her up.</p><p>After he watched her for a few minutes, he asked Murphy, \u201cWho is the hot number in red with Layla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Angel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngel,\u201d rolled off his tongue. Perfect name for her. Sipping his beer, he focused entirely on her. Lush body, lush mouth. Great smile. Expressive eyes. She was off-the-scale sexy in his opinion. So why the hell was the woman wearing a wig? Not a subtle one, but a sleekly styled black wig, the last inch of hair dyed candy-apple red. Was she trying to look dangerous? Hip? Naughty?</p><p>Be interesting to coax the truth from her. Some very interesting extraction techniques popped into Ben\u2019s head.</p><p>She must\u2019ve sensed him staring at her because she turned and met his gaze head on. Their eyes remained locked for several long moments as Ben waited for her to lower her gaze\u2014as he was accustomed. But she returned his intense eye-fuck full bore until Layla demanded her attention.</p><p>Holy shit. Dismissive wasn\u2019t a reaction Ben usually got, especially not in here. And that intrigued the hell out of him. Casually, he said to Murphy, \u201cIntroduce me to her.\u201d</p><p>Murphy sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Has she already picked someone for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Ben faced Murphy. \u201cThen exactly what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>A devious smile appeared. \u201cShe\u2019s not here as a sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a guest?\u201d Ben frowned.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here as special entertainment?\u201d That\u2019d explain her wacky get-up. Some clubs in bigger cities had themed nights where members dressed up. Cody and Trace had threatened to try it at the Rawhide, but Ben secretly didn\u2019t believe that\u2019d fly in Gillette, Wyoming. Then again, he hadn\u2019t been around to voice his opinion in the last month.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not here to bartend, waitress or clean the bar.\u201d</p><p>Which left one other possibility but Ben couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it. \u201cShe\u2019s here as a...Domme?\u201d After Murphy nodded, Ben\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNo. Fucking. Way. A Domme. In the Rawhide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know she\u2019s had experience as a Domme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s defiant stare-down notwithstanding, Ben demanded, \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>That hard look entered Murphy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve told you as much as I can, Bennett\u2014\u201d he emphasized Ben\u2019s preferred official club title, \u201c\u2014the rest you\u2019ll have to get from her. And you know the rules since you had a heavy hand establishing them, so tread lightly. I have no issue throwing your ass out if you think you\u2019re above the rules.\u201d</p><p>As designated club head master, Murphy screened all applicants thoroughly. He kept the club balanced with the ratio of Doms to subs. He ran the club with an iron fist and a closed mouth. Which sucked balls right now, because Ben wanted to know everything about this supposed Domme.</p><p>Of course the goddamn rules came back to bite him in the ass the one time he needed to break one. Besides the first rule\u2014everything that happened in the Rawhide Club was consensual\u2014and the second rule\u2014complete confidentiality and discretion among all members inside and outside the club\u2014there was a third rule that stated\u2014the members who wanted to publicly or privately play decided their own roles within the club: dominant, submissive or switch. Each designation had its own power and demanded its own respect.</p><p>But then again...the fourth rule\u2014you pay, you play\u2014meant if she came to the club on a regular night, then she was expected to participate.</p><p>Oh hell yeah. He could totally push that rule if it came down to it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the gleam in your eye,\u201d Murphy half-snarled.</p><p>How could Murphy see that? Because Ben couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the intriguing Angel. Hot damn. The sensual way she moved screamed of a submissive enticing a Dom, not a confident Domme luring an entranced sub.</p><p>\u201cBennett?\u201d Murphy prompted. \u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>Ben drained his beer. \u201cI wanna play with her.\u201d It\u2019d been years since he\u2019d had such an overwhelming urge to possess a woman. To tempt, to treat, to teach, to punish...all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cThe gold bracelet she\u2019s wearing means I can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Colored rubber bracelets were how members differentiated their designations. Gold bracelets denoted a dominant and required proof of previous experience as a dominant. Silver bracelets signified a submissive. A white bracelet meant the member was a switch\u2014ready to play either role. A black bracelet meant in a committed relationship and off limits.</p><p>However, any member could request to change their designation, after discussing the reason for it, with either Murphy or Cody, the only two officially designated Masters at the Rawhide Club.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of what the bracelet means, Murph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Ben slipped the bracelet over his hand and slid it across the bar top. \u201cGive me a white bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no. This is ridiculous. Come on. What\u2019s the deal with you tonight?\u201d</p><p>Cody and Sully sensed tension and joined them at the bar, flanking Ben on either side. Cody spoke first. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that Bennett wants to exchange his bracelet,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Bennett, you\u2019re that bored with the selection of subs tonight? You\u2019re willing to let one of these guys beat you and fuck you?\u201d Sully asked with an edge of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d He rested his elbows on the bar and they followed suit to keep their conversation private. \u201cI don\u2019t need to point out the woman wearing the gold bracelet, since she\u2019s the only woman I\u2019ve ever seen with a gold bracelet in this establishment. But I know better than to violate club rules and publicly question her right to wear it. So I asked Murphy to clarify why she deserved that status and he refused to provide details.\u201d</p><p>Cody nonchalantly cast a glance over his shoulder. \u201cI gotta agree with Bennett on this, Murph. The woman is out of her element, and I\u2019ll eat my fucking keg tap if she\u2019s got any real experience as a Domme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter give us the basics on her,\u201d Sully added.</p><p>The big man stroked his fingers through his long black beard and looked at each one of them in turn, but spoke to Ben. \u201cI told you. Angel is a friend of Layla\u2019s. She\u2019s here to see if this type of club would be a good fit for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been involved in other clubs like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Layla, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then where does her previous Domme experience come in?\u201d</p><p>Murphy sighed. \u201cI argued with Layla about this, especially after she told me Angel\u2019s only Domme experiences were in a controlled setting where she...ah...paid the dude so she could be in charge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me this woman waltzed into my club, expecting to be given the gold stamp of approval because she paid some dude from a male escort service to let her boss him around for a few hours?\u201d Cody asked tightly.</p><p>Murphy nodded.</p> <p>\u201cSo much for being the master of your house.\u201d Sully snickered.</p><p>\u201cLayla assured me that Angel only wanted the Domme designation as protection; she didn\u2019t intend to use it besides to observe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an even worse reason for bein\u2019 here. She\u2019s a poseur,\u201d Ben said. \u201cShe ain\u2019t gonna get any real idea if she can handle this, even on a casual basis, if she can\u2019t be honest with herself about what she is.\u201d For Christsake, she\u2019d worn a freakin\u2019 disguise to the club. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you each a thousand bucks she\u2019s submissive.\u201d</p><p>A bet no one took, because in six years, Ben hadn\u2019t been wrong even one time.</p><p>Cody pointed at Murphy. \u201cYou know we can\u2019t let her in the club if she ain\u2019t gonna play. How the fuck did you ever agree to breaking that rule?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say Layla has a helluva distraction technique and she asked at a...ah, a pivotal moment.\u201d</p><p>Sully and Cody shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cHow many nights is she here?\u201d Ben asked Murphy.</p><p>\u201cTwo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be enough. Get Layla to introduce me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you inform my little slave that pushing me to admit her friend to the club as an experienced Domme has earned her a hefty consequence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I have to tell her?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Murphy motioned Layla over. \u201cBecause she\u2019ll sass me. But she never gets away with mouthy behavior around you, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>Layla sidled up to the bar. \u201cA Bombay Sapphire and tonic and a cherry Coke.\u201d Her eyes widened when she saw Ben adjusting a white bracelet on his wrist. \u201cBennett? You\u2019re changing your status?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly temporarily so I can fix your mistake.\u201d He invaded her space and spoke softly. \u201cYou are in big trouble, Layla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know why.\u201d He watched her gaze skate briefly to Angel\u2019s table.</p><p>She dropped her gaze to her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will convince Angel to play with me.\u201d Ben fought a grin when he heard Layla mutter, \u201cShit. She is so fucked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot as fucked as you are, my pretty,\u201d Murphy warned her. \u201cYou will do whatever Bennett demands to ensure your inexperienced friend doesn\u2019t wind up in a situation we cannot control.\u201d</p><p>She muttered, \u201cI should\u2019ve just given her a damn black bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Murphy snapped.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy will decide your punishment for your coercion in getting your friend admitted to this private club under false pretenses,\u201d Ben told her.</p><p>Layla shot Murphy a contrite look and he snorted. \u201cPuppy dog eyes ain\u2019t gonna get you out of the doghouse, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got planned for our wannabe Domme?\u201d Cody asked Ben.</p><p>\u201cCharm, tempt, seduce\u2014convince her to let me be her submissive tonight.\u201d He lifted a brow at Layla to get her butt moving.</p><p>\u201cPutting your plan into play now, Sir.\u201d She grabbed the drinks and flounced off.</p><p>\u201cI better go help Trace and Riley set up for tonight,\u201d Sully said, stepping away from the bar.</p><p>\u201cMake sure room four is saved for me,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Sully disappeared through the side door.</p><p>Cody laughed. \u201cYou sneaky son of a bitch. You\u2019ve picked a no-view room. Don\u2019t want any of your fan club chicklets to see the almighty Bennett at a woman\u2019s feet?\u201d</p><p>Ben offered another cocky grin. \u201cMake no mistake. She might think she\u2019s giving the orders, but I guarantee I\u2019ll be the one in charge.\u201d</p><p>The first thing Ainsley noticed as Layla sashayed back was her strained expression. \u201cIs everything all right? Looked a little tense up at the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Layla sank onto the barstool. \u201cSee the buff guy with the dark blond hair?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Cody. The bar owner. He asked about you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze above her drink. \u201cHe did? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not exactly inconspicuous in that wig. And you\u2019re wearing a gold bracelet. So he asked me if you were a lesbian.\u201d</p><p>She choked on her gin. \u201cWhy would he think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHistorically in this club, gold bracelets are worn by men, because ninety-nine point nine percent of the submissives are female. Cody wondered if you were here to perform a public scene with another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and the other guys\u2014Doms\u2014wanted to know if you had a specific time in mind for that performance so they could watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I\u2019m not... I...can\u2019t... I don\u2019t like...\u201d</p><p>Layla leaned closer. \u201cI know that. So in trying to save your ass from, oh, having a woman willing to go down on you in public in front of a couple dozen horny guys, I told them you were choosy. So choosy in fact, that you might not find a man you want to play with at all tonight.\u201d</p><p>She noticed Layla no longer wore that smug expression for pulling one over on them. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey reminded me of the club rule: if you pay, you play\u2014regardless if you\u2019re a member or a guest. No exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you gave me this gold bracelet so I\u2019d be top of the food chain, so I wouldn\u2019t have to play.\u201d</p><p>Layla bit her lip. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to fake it, A, because the consequences of me lying to Murphy and trying to slide you under their noses as a real Domme?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cNot only will Murphy be mad at me for weeks, it could jeopardize his job. If they think I, a lowly sub, can manipulate him into letting anyone into the club, then they won\u2019t trust his judgment. In the bar, or with club business, or with club members.\u201d Her eyes shimmered with tears. \u201cSo you see the position I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Guilt sideswiped her. She\u2019d never intended to put Layla at risk. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll do it. If you tell me what to do. What are my options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance you\u2019ll pick up a female sub just out of curiosity?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley shook her head. Not something on her sexual wish list.</p><p>Layla glanced around. \u201cMore members will show up, but if you insist on a man, you\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t use that phrase in this context, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one guy I know who...um...isn\u2019t a submissive but...um...a switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning he likes men and women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett?\u201d Layla snorted. \u201cGod no. He worships women with a single-minded intensity that\u2019s slightly scary. He\u2019s highly sought after here. And he\u2019s very, very picky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why is he a switch?\u201d Since Layla took such a long time to answer, Ainsley suspected her friend\u2019s response would be a total lie.</p><p>\u201cSometimes he just wants pain.\u201d Layla rattled the ice in her glass distractedly before meeting Ainsley\u2019s gaze. \u201cAn experienced Dom is the safest way to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Not the answer she\u2019d expected. She scanned the guys lounging at the bar. Which one was Bennett? Her gaze passed over the buff blond owner, lingered on the tall, dark and handsome guy in the business suit. Probably not him. The enormous man with the buzz cut was either military or law enforcement, so scratch him too. Ditto for the dark-haired, sinful-looking cowboy with the strip now stare and the hard-set mouth. The stocky guy who looked away when their eyes accidentally met?</p><p>Bingo. Had to be him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta get my collar on. Do you want me to introduce you to Bennett now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes to freshen up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsych yourself up?\u201d Layla inserted.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember two things. Be confident, not bitchy. Use that eye contact thing we talked about. And have fun! You\u2019re living every sub\u2019s dream, A, getting to dominate Bennett. Embrace it.\u201d She slid off the barstool and scampered to Murphy\u2019s side.</p><p>Ainsley couldn\u2019t look away when Murphy hooked the thin leather collar around Layla\u2019s neck. Layla kept her eyes lowered, her head bowed.</p><p>A sharp sense of distaste arose. How could Layla, a confident, opinionated, educated woman, allow herself to be treated in such a subservient manner?</p><p>Ainsley wouldn\u2019t have seen it if she\u2019d slunk away in disgust. How lovingly Murphy\u2019s big hands cradled Layla\u2019s face. His insistent kiss. In that moment, when Murphy whispered in Layla\u2019s ear and brought forth Layla\u2019s beaming smile, Ainsley felt...jealous at their obvious connection.</p><p>Then she felt ridiculous and marched to the bathroom.</p><p>After pacing for five of the ten minutes, freshening her make-up for a couple more, Ainsley stilled. Breathed. Adjusted her scratchy wig. She looked outlandish, but that was the point. No one would ever believe uptight Ainsley Hamilton had the balls to wear this flashy garb.</p><p>She raised her chin a notch and practiced a cool-eyed stare. Time to earn a ball-buster reputation.</p><p>Revved up and ready, she exited the bathroom\u2014just as Layla led Mr. Brooding Hot Cowboy to their table.</p><p>Her stomach cartwheeled.</p><p>When he aimed his deeply dimpled smile at her, she stumbled in her three-inch heels, straight into his strong arms.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there. You all right?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley glared at the floor as if it were responsible for her misstep. Then she looked up into the bluest eyes this side of heaven.</p><p>Holy Mother of God. He was striking. She could not wait to tell this man exactly what to do to her. Her gaze slid to his lips. She had an idea or fifty on how he could use his too-pretty mouth.</p><p>Layla interrupted Ainsley\u2019s contemplation of his oral skills. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to make your own introductions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hoisted herself onto the barstool and thrust out her hand. \u201cAn\u2014Angel.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired devil clasped her fingers, lowered his head and kissed her knuckles. \u201cA pleasure, Angel. I\u2019m Bennett. Would you care for another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>He looked back at her.</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>\u201cBefore we get down to business, can I just say that you have the prettiest skin?\u201d He wasn\u2019t content with that verbal caress. He dragged a rough-edged fingertip from the inside of her wrist beneath the bracelet to the bend in her elbow and back down.</p><p>Goose bumps danced up that limb, fanning out across her shoulder. Bennett scored points for his seductive touch but lost them when she noticed his smirk.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s set the parameters for tonight\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a negotiation?\u201d</p><p>His teasing eyes turned shrewd. \u201cTalkin\u2019 about expectations is a club rule, in every club I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d His gaze lingered on her gold bracelet. \u201cHaven\u2019t you found that to be true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know to discuss the play rules.\u201d The lie warmed her cheeks.</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change.</p><p>He kept watching her. \u201cStop staring at me,\u201d she said crossly.</p><p>He lowered his eyes with a murmured, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>When another bout of silence stretched, she knew if she didn\u2019t get a handle on this situation now, she never would. \u201cCan I ask you something, Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the dual role of submissive and dominant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor variety, I suppose. How about you? Why the dominant role?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a power thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like his half-cocky hmm. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I find it odd you\u2019re a Domme.\u201d Bennett raised those compelling blue eyes to hers. The heat and intensity packed a punch so potent she nearly toppled off the barstool.</p><p>Way out of your element, Ainsley.</p><p>\u201cSee, the true power in a dominant and submissive relationship lies with the submissive. Because the sub cedes all control, it\u2019s up to the Dom to make sure all the sub\u2019s needs are being met. To give the sub what she\u2014or he\u2014wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Bennett let his gaze slowly slide down to her cleavage, then back up to her mouth. \u201cI want to please you.\u201d</p><p>Had any man ever said that to her?</p><p>\u201cIn that I\u2019ll gain my own pleasure. But since you brought up my dual sides, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not a switch very often. In fact, I\u2019m the lone switch here right now. So if you want to play tonight, I\u2019m your only choice.\u201d</p><p>And what a fine, fine choice. She tempered her eagerness with an offhand, \u201cI suppose that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. But there is a catch. You\u2019re planning to be here two nights so I\u2019ll make you a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d God was she ever listening. His deep, rich voice was as mesmerizing as his deep, rich eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf I agree to let you be my dominant tonight, then I want you to agree to be my submissive tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Oh hell no, automatically popped into her brain.</p><p>Stop lying to yourself. Isn\u2019t this what you were secretly hoping for? To find a man who could see beyond your fa\u00e7ade?</p><p>Here was her chance to experience both sides. To see if one really fit her better than the other\u2014or not at all. One weekend out of her life. What would it matter? They\u2019d probably never see each other again anyway. \u201cI accept your terms.\u201d</p><p>Bennett brought her hand to his mouth and kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cThank you. Let\u2019s get hard limits out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley had no idea what that meant. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other guys in the play. No kissing guys, no blowjobs from guys and definitely no sex with guys. Not that you\u2019d probably get any offers of men in this club wantin\u2019 to do me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>He scratched his jaw. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be crazy about you donning a strap-on and shoving it up my ass.\u201d</p><p>Geez. That possibility hadn\u2019t crossed her mind. At all. She tossed off a breezy, \u201cI\u2019ll take that into consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Bennett appeared to be waiting for her to lead the conversation. \u201cLayla mentioned you\u2019re a switch because occasionally you want pain. And I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not comfortable with that.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow winged up. \u201cEver? That seems unusual for a Domme.\u201d</p><p>Rookie mistake. \u201cNot ever, but definitely not on the first play date. So if you\u2019re looking for someone to take a cane to your butt...I\u2019m not your dominant tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about usin\u2019 restraints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you like, Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I prefer to be the one doin\u2019 the tyin\u2019 up.\u201d</p><p>Now there was an idea. Tying him to the bed and utilizing his very fine body as her personal sexual playground. \u201cSo using restraints is a hard limit with you?\u201d</p><p>Bennett gave her a considering look. \u201cNo, I guess not. With the exception of you tyin\u2019 my junk up in knots. I ain\u2019t down with that at all.\u201d</p><p>She permitted a sly smile. \u201cGood to know. Any other hard limits?\u201d She mentally scrambled to remember specific scenes in the BDSM books she\u2019d read. \u201cHot wax?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNipple clamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my fave, but not a hell no.\u201d</p><p>Think. What else? \u201cAnal beads?\u201d</p><p>Wariness entered his eyes. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce, feathers, a blindfold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce? Yes. Feathers? Yes. Blindfold?\u201d Bennett\u2019s molten eyes drank in every nuance of her face. \u201cNo. I\u2019d rather not wear a blindfold because I wanna watch you dominate me. Bein\u2019 at the mercy of a beautiful woman is a total fuckin\u2019 turn on.\u201d</p><p>Her belly gave a little flip.</p><p>\u201cNow lemme ask you something, Angel. How would you like me to address you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do your subs address you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett. Or Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Master?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cNo. Only two Masters at the club. And I don\u2019t reckon I\u2019d like bein\u2019 called that. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can call me Angel or...\u201d Mistress sounded as pretentious as Master so she said, \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am. That\u2019ll work fine.\u201d</p><p>Needing a break from the sexual tension arcing between them, she turned her attention to the crowded room.</p><p>She\u2019d expected the club would be comprised of young, thin, beautiful people. But the members were an eclectic mix. Although it appeared none of them had dressed incognito as she had.</p><p>A striking redhead flirted with the suit-and-tie-wearing guy up at the bar. Murphy and Layla filled drink orders side by side. The owner worked the door and Ainsley knew he was aware of every single thing that went on inside this room. And wow. Some interesting scenarios were developing.</p><p>Action behind a privacy screen, which didn\u2019t provide much privacy at all, snagged her attention. The low glow of the lights provided a silhouette of a couple in the throes of a passionate tryst. The woman\u2019s head was thrown back and she slowly moved up and down. Arching as the man buried his face in her chest. Their faces blurred together as they kissed. When she tore her gaze away, she realized Bennett had been studying her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that. You ridin\u2019 me slow. Or fast. I bet this angelic face of yours looks beautiful by candlelight.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley held his gaze. \u201cAre you always like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth.\u201d</p><p>His finger followed the curve of her jaw. \u201cMake no mistake, I\u2019m a very rough man. And if I had to venture a guess, I\u2019d say you\u2019d prefer to see that side of me.\u201d He briefly pressed his finger across her protesting lips. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cHow about if we head to the back rooms?\u201d Bennett suggested.</p><p>None of the sexual tension between them had eased in the last fifteen minutes as they\u2019d watched several scenes and negotiations taking place. She stood, butterflies flapping in her belly.</p><p>He invaded her space until they were nose-to-nose, belly-to-belly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley exhaled slowly, trying not to get sucked into the depths of his blue eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with the club layout so you\u2019ll have to lead the way. Will that be a problem?\u201d</p><p>The slow, sexy unfurling of his smile was a sight to behold. \u201cTakin\u2019 the lead has never been a problem for me.\u201d He clasped her hand in his and maneuvered through the throng of people.</p><p>She attempted a sort of clinical detachment as she watched the couples engaged in various stages of foreplay. Dancing, kissing passionately, groping, hello\u2014one woman was on her knees, hands secured behind her back while her partner twisted his hands in her hair and slid his cock in and out of her mouth. Pausing to trace the outline of her lips with the tip, then gliding back in. He varied the pace, which caused the woman to groan in disappointment when he only teased her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna stay and watch this one?\u201d Bennett murmured in her ear.</p><p>Yes please. \u201cAh. No. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you stopped.\u201d</p><p>The warmth of his chest heated her spine from the top of her butt to her shoulders and she wanted to rest her body against his fully.</p><p>Do it. He\u2019s yours to command for the night, isn\u2019t he?</p><p>The millisecond she eased back, Bennett\u2019s hands circled her hips, bringing their bodies closer. \u201cI like the feel of you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>No one seemed to care they were watching this guy\u2019s blowjob. In fact, two other couples joined. One man played with his woman\u2019s breasts, murmuring in her ear while she writhed against his groin. The other woman fell to her knees, ripping open her partner\u2019s jeans and greedily stuffing his dick in her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ainsley turned her head slightly, drawing in the clean scent of Bennett\u2019s skin. \u201cWant to takes bets on who finishes first?\u201d</p><p>His low chuckle vibrated down her neck.</p><p>The first guy rammed his cock fully into his woman\u2019s mouth. His eyes locked to hers as he rasped, \u201cBaby, I love how you do this to me every time.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Ainsley could admit that was pretty hot. And maybe watching it got her a little hot.</p><p>Bennett gently tugged her away from the scene. \u201cThere\u2019s more to see. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow big is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot very, compared to other clubs. There are two public rooms, not counting the main bar and lounge area, and nine private rooms. At other clubs, where the members are heavily into all the trappings of the lifestyle, the wait for a public room is long. Here, the private rooms always fill up first.\u201d</p><p>She had a million questions she couldn\u2019t ask because Bennett assumed she\u2019d been in places like this before.</p><p>The hallway divided. He waited for her to choose a direction.</p><p>Don\u2019t be a mouse. Be a...cougar.</p><p>Ainsley boldly looked at his crotch then back up at his face. \u201cSo, Bennett. Did you dress left or right tonight?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes heated. \u201cLeft. Or maybe it was right. Wanna double-check?\u201d</p><p>She managed a laugh. \u201cMaybe later. For now, I\u2019ll go with your first answer.\u201d She started down the hallway, but stopped at the first open room.</p><p>The redhead from the bar was naked except for four inch silver stilettos. Draped over a padded bench, ropes secured her arms, her ass was sticking up in the air, and her legs were split wide enough that Ainsley could see the woman\u2019s vulva. From back here. In living color.</p><p>She ducked out of sight.</p><p>Bennett stepped in front of her, blocking her retreat. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt. It looked ah...private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. This is a public scene. And it just started, so we\u2019re in luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t deny us this experience, Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he going to do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpank her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she wants it.\u201d</p><p>Her belly fluttered. She took a step closer to the scene and Bennett was right on her heels.</p><p>The man wielding the paddle was the business-suit-wearing guy she\u2019d seen at the bar. He\u2019d ditched the suit jacket and the tie. He\u2019d left the top two buttons of his white dress shirt undone and rolled up the sleeves, revealing muscled, tanned forearms. His left hand smoothed over the woman\u2019s curves, from her shoulders to her butt and he spoke to her in a low tone. Ainsley couldn\u2019t discern specific words but the cadence was obviously meant to soothe the bound woman.</p><p>So the crack of the paddle on the redhead\u2019s flesh startled her. It startled the redhead too, if her full body twitch and sharp cry were any indication. Before she could catch her breath, two more blows rained down on each cheek.</p><p>The woman jerked against the restraints. The harder she fought, the harder he spanked her. She begged him to stop. He didn\u2019t even pause.</p><p>Bennett must\u2019ve sensed her question. \u201cAn overseer makes the rounds every ten minutes to check that things don\u2019t get out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks like she\u2019s in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. But that\u2019s what she wants.\u201d His lips brushed the top of her ear. \u201cWould you like that? Your beautiful ass bared for everyone to admire? Letting me run my hands all over it before I spank it? And running my mouth all over it to feel the heat on my face after I spank it good and hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Good Lord, she couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><p>\u201cLook at her face. See how it\u2019s changed? She\u2019s trusting her partner to take her to that point where her body craves the connection of his hand on her ass. Where she only feels the warmth, the pleasure, and the care he\u2019s showing her, trusting he\u2019ll give her the release he built for her.\u201d</p><p>With the way Bennett offered a sensual step by step, Ainsley mentally traded places with the woman restrained to the bench. Her ass glowed bright red. Her head spun as Bennett kissed her crazily, one hand fisted in her hair, the fingers of his other hand thrusting in and out of her hot, wet sex. Her shuddering, shaking orgasm reverberated in Bennett\u2019s hungry mouth.</p><p>She groaned softly, intending to turn away, but her face met Bennett\u2019s warm neck. She shifted her legs together as she tried to dodge him, but he wasn\u2019t having any of it. He flattened his palm on her lower abdomen, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cAre your panties wet?\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhat would you do if I slipped my hands under your robe to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please. Not here.\u201d</p><p>He half-growled, \u201cI\u2019m allowing it only because you\u2019re in charge tonight.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she felt right now was in charge.</p><p>\u201cBut if I was wearin\u2019 that gold bracelet? I wouldn\u2019t give you a choice.\u201d</p><p>Her whole body trembled. And he knew it.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see what else will get you whipped into a frenzy.\u201d Bennett kept his hand in the small of her back as they moved down the hallway.</p><p>The next room was completely open. It contained a throne-like looking chair, except it had shackles on the armrests and the legs. Alongside that chair was a leather footstool and another spanking bench. Restraints hung down. Hooks and pulley systems were embedded in the ceiling. Chains and ropes were attached to the hooks and pulleys.</p><p>A naked, blindfolded woman was bound by a set of chains, her arms stretched above her head, a bar kept her legs spread apart. Two men stood in front of her, sucking on her nipples. Each man had a hand between her legs, one in front, one in back. Needy, desperate sounds came from her mouth through the gag.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the more extreme things you\u2019ll see. For that woman, the more men involved in the scene, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-more than two men?\u201d Ainsley stuttered.</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ve seen her take six men at one time.\u201d His lips skimmed the underside of her jaw, sending tingles down the left side of her body. \u201cWanna know how that works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSuch a bad liar. You\u2019re tryin\u2019 to figure out where six cocks are gonna go, so let me set the scene. She\u2019d have one in her pussy, one in her ass, one in her mouth. Another would be fucking her tits. The last two? One in each hand.\u201d</p><p>Talk about multitasking.</p><p>\u201cAnd she really gets off on the guys comin\u2019 all over her. On her face, her tits, her ass.\u201d</p><p>Again, she was speechless.</p><p>\u201cNot your thing?\u201d Bennett asked softly.</p><p>\u201cBeing coated in come? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about multiple partners? Does the thought of two men touching you, fucking you, bending you to their will send a shiver of want down your spine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m more of a one-on-one type, I think.\u201d</p><p>He placed another soft kiss on the inside of her neck. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d</p><p>With Bennett touching her and kissing her, Ainsley realized she didn\u2019t want to watch what other couples were doing; she wanted to experience it for herself.</p><p>\u201cFind a room. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Bennett tugged her down the hallway and pushed her into a room. He slammed the door and pressed her against it.</p><p>She expected he\u2019d kiss her with unrestrained passion. Tear off her clothes and take her hard and fast against the door.</p><p>But Bennett stepped back and waited.</p><p>For what? A written invitation?</p><p>Right, she was in charge of this scenario. Forced out of lust-filled possibilities, she locked her gaze to his.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want me to do, Angel.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cMake me come. Fast. Use your fingers or your mouth or even a vibrator. I don\u2019t care but do it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the robe.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers fumbled with the knot at her waist. Then Bennett was there, taking over, murmuring, \u201cYou really need this, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The robe slithered down her back. \u201cOn second thought, forget the vibrator. I have a whole collection of them at home.\u201d</p><p>When he tried to kiss her, she turned away so his mouth connected with her cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo time for kisses, huh?\u201d His big hands cupped her breasts, then he jerked the peignoir aside and pulled her bra cup down. A rumbling noise reverberated against her breast when he bent and sucked her nipple into his hot mouth.</p><p>Ainsley kept her hands by her sides, lost in the silken pull of his mouth and the hot lashes of his tongue. She shifted impatiently, her damp thighs rubbing together, trying to create enough friction to set her off. But it wasn\u2019t working. She released a frustrated wail.</p><p>Then Bennett\u2019s mouth was on her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t make me guess, dammit. You\u2019re in charge. Tell me what you want me to do to you.\u201d</p><p>She blindly reached for his hand and shoved it between her legs. \u201cTouch me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He tugged aside her g-string and plunged a finger into her pussy. Then another. Thrusting in and out, a pleased rumble vibrated in her ear when he realized how wet she was. She pushed her pelvis toward him, wanting more.</p><p>Bennett trailed sucking kisses down the side of her neck.</p><p>Any attention to her neck made her thrash wildly. She used her shoulder to force his mouth away from her skin.</p><p>\u201cHold still,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Touch my clit. I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>Muttering another curse, Bennett slid his fingers free and rubbed the wet digits on her clit. He eased back and suckled her left nipple so hard she felt the bite of his teeth.</p><p>That set her off. \u201cYes. Yes!\u201d Her clit throbbed beneath his stroking fingers, sending tremors throughout her body. When her head fell back, Bennett zeroed in on her neck and sucked.</p><p>Her whole body vibrated as if she\u2019d swallowed a live current.</p><p>He kept sucking and petting her until her knees gave out. \u201cWhoa there, Angel.\u201d He pressed his lower body against the door, keeping hers upright. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he tried to rest his forehead on her shoulder, she twisted free. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>Trying to regain her mental balance, she sidestepped him and took in the private room.</p><p>The bland space didn\u2019t look like it belonged in a sex club. Well, besides the gigantic bed. And the swing-like contraption in the corner. And the shackles hanging from the ceiling. Maybe her initial impression had been too hasty.</p><p>Air blew down from the vents reminding her of her skimpy attire. Why hadn\u2019t Bennett enclosed her in his arms?</p><p>Because you didn\u2019t ask him to. Or tell him to. You\u2019re in charge, remember? He follows your lead.</p><p>Which begged the question, what now? Now that she\u2019d so easily, so quickly, so wantonly fallen apart in his arms? Begging him to touch her clit, for crying out loud.</p><p>A true Domme wouldn\u2019t react with embarrassment. A real Domme would probably...reward him for bringing her to orgasm.</p><p>Visualizing herself as that ball-busting woman allowed her to face him with a sultry smile. Her appreciative gaze rolled over his body. \u201cThank you, Bennett. I guess I needed that more than even I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what my other pleasure would be? Seeing you completely naked. Strip.\u201d</p><p>The muscle in his jaw flexed and he made no move to obey.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just... No problem at all.\u201d His leather vest came off first. Followed by his western shirt. He grumbled something as he toed off his boots, but she was too busy gawking at his near nakedness to pay much heed.</p><p>Heaven help her, the man had one of those chests. Broad, muscular, masculine perfection with just the right amount of chest hair. Ainsley\u2019s eyes followed that trail of dark hair down his torso to the top of his jeans. She watched as he unhooked his belt. Watched as he popped the button loose. Watched as he slid the zipper down. Held her breath as those Wranglers fell to the carpet. Holy mother of all saints the man had the largest dick she\u2019d ever seen outside of porn. She finally chanced a look at his face.</p><p>Bennett managed a tight-lipped smile. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of half-scared by it, if you wanna know the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten many complaints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine you have.\u201d She sauntered forward. Her eyes snared his. Then her fist closed around his girth and she squeezed.</p><p>He hissed.</p><p>Ainsley stroked the hard, heated flesh. \u201cTell me what you like.\u201d He sucked in another sharp breath when her thumb swept beneath the cockhead.</p><p>\u201cI like that. But...\u201d</p><p>Her hand didn\u2019t stop moving, her eyes never wavered when she asked, \u201cBut what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2019d rather fuck you. I\u2019d rather watch you get off again.\u201d</p><p>Something about his response seemed rehearsed. Something about the too-bright look in his eyes told her that he wasn\u2019t used to being manhandled. Which made sense, if his reason to switch to submissive was to feel pain. His submissive role tonight wouldn\u2019t be the same as other times.</p><p>She rolled to the tips of her boots and pressed her lips to his. \u201cAs delighted as I am by your selfless sentiment, Bennett, it\u2019s not your decision, is it?\u201d</p><p>A tiny flare of anger replaced the pleasure in his eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d Ainsley angled her head to feel his downy chest hair brush her cheek. She nuzzled his pectoral, breathing in his warm, earthy scent. He groaned when her questing mouth found his nipple. She licked the disk, dampening the hair around the hidden tip, using her teeth to tease the tiny nub as she increased the stroking motion of her hand.</p><p>\u201cGod. Dammit.\u201d</p><p>She upped the tempo, switching to shorter, harder strokes.</p><p>\u201cAh fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop swearing at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry it just feels so... Shit, it feels so fuckin\u2019 good.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his chest. \u201cTell me how close you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbarrassingly close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you embarrassed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my stamina is usually... Christ, do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Her middle finger slipped between his damp balls on the down-stroke. \u201cOr this?\u201d Her thumb traced the wet edge of his cockhead above the sweet spot on the upstroke.</p><p>\u201cBoth. God! Dammit.\u201d</p><p>She sucked hard on his nipple as she jacked him. \u201cTell me what you want, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Faster. Yes. Just...like that.\u201d He humped her hand and swore a blue streak as he came in hot, short bursts.</p><p>Ainsley watched his cock as he erupted, feeling a heady sense of triumph. Triumph and power. And heat. Getting him off had turned her on again.</p><p>Then Bennett\u2019s hand curled around her jaw, forcing her head back. His eyes were still pleasure-clouded when he murmured, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She playfully squeezed his softening cock one more time just to see that warning look flicker in his eyes. \u201cStay put. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>After washing her hands, she wet a washcloth with warm water, intending to clean him up. But she handed it to him instead. It seemed too intimate, touching him in the aftermath.</p><p>But she did watch. She\u2019d never known seeing a man handle himself could be so sexy.</p><p>He tossed the rag aside. \u201cDid it turn you on, getting me off?\u201d</p><p>Was it that obvious?</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of you. Let me get you off again. This time with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her pussy throbbed a happy yes. It\u2019d been a long time since she\u2019d seen any tongue action. A really long time. But she also knew Mr. Charming and Persuasive Bennett would push for more if she gave in without restrictions. \u201cYou are such a silver-tongued devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes? You want me to prove how well this devil can use his tongue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a yes...just as soon as you put your clothes back on.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him short. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d His mouth remained pursed, intending to argue.</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was totally loving this power thing.</p><p>She sat in the armchair, watching him get dressed. Such a pity to cover up that magnificent body.</p><p>His smooth movements belied the annoyance in his eyes. His boots barely made a sound as he crossed the room. Her heart thumped when he dropped to his knees.</p><p>They stared at one another for a very long minute.</p><p>\u201cTake off your panties.\u201d</p><p>In one fast, and hopefully sexy move, Ainsley whisked off the g-string.</p><p>Then Bennett circled his fingers around her ankles just above her shoes. His hands glided up her shins, over her knees and up the inside of her thighs. He tapped the outside of her hips. \u201cScoot down so I can reach all of you.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when she panicked, the reality of her wet sex up close and personal in Bennett\u2019s face, as well as her fat white thighs, rounded belly and big butt. Shoot. Maybe she should insist he shut the lights off.</p><p>\u201cYou want a play-by-play?\u201d</p><p>Bennett\u2019s voice startled her. \u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to talk about how badly I want to bury my face in your pussy? Of how perfect and sweet it tastes? How fuckin\u2019 hot it is that you\u2019re so wet?\u201d</p><p>Instead of purring, Oh yeah, you can keep up that sweet dirty talk all night, she let her confusion show. \u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a guess, because you haven\u2019t given me any instructions about what you do want.\u201d</p><p>Another rookie mistake. She gave him a haughty, \u201cWhat I want is to come. Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>He made a primitive noise and lowered his head to kiss the rise of her pubic bone. The cheeky man looked up at her when his tongue danced across her clit.</p><p>At the second swipe of his clever tongue she abandoned the idea she had any control in this situation at all.</p><p>He slid his tongue down the seam of her sex. Circling the opening and plunging inside. Licking. Sucking. A wiggling maneuver that made her gasp.</p><p>Her body twitched against the barrage of sensations. His rough-tipped fingers spreading her open. His short hair teasing the swell of her belly. His wickedly wonderful tongue was a constant reminder of how much she loved oral sex.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d ever experienced oral sex like this.</p><p>The man teased and tormented. He built her to the detonation point, and backed down, just because he could.</p><p>And then he sent her soaring.</p><p>Her clit pulsed against his sucking mouth. She let her head fall back and shamelessly reveled in every glorious throb. Once the storm inside her calmed, she tried to scoot back up to conceal her lower half, but Bennett wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t close yourself off from me. Every part of you deserves to be worshipped.\u201d He kissed her knees. \u201cI want to worship your body with mine tonight. All night.\u201d</p><p>That comment sounded far too practiced. She placed her hands on his face to stop his marauding mouth. \u201cHold on there, slick. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s in the cards.\u201d</p><p>Bennett truly appeared confused. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m in charge, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t look the teeniest bit repentant.</p><p>Ainsley stood and discreetly put on her g-string. \u201cWhile I\u2019m considering our options, I could use a stiff drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head back to the main room so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>She trembled when his warm, insistent lips followed the slope of her shoulder as he helped her put on her robe.</p><p>His huskily whispered, \u201cI like the way you tremble in my arms,\u201d only caused her to tremble harder.</p><p>They\u2019d exited the room and reached the end of the hallway, when the owner shouted, \u201cBennett! There\u2019s a malfunction with the pulley system in room nine. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Bennett sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you as soon as I\u2019m done, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ainsley strolled into the crowded main room, feeling out of place. Her little bit of confidence evaporated. Too many people surrounded her. Too much had happened in such a short amount of time. She needed to clear her head and she couldn\u2019t do it here.</p><p>Without saying goodbye to anyone, she slipped into the night.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Ben couldn\u2019t believe Angel had snuck out of the club last night.</p><p>Yes, you can. And you don\u2019t expect to see her tonight either.</p><p>That would suck.</p><p>After he didn\u2019t find her cooling her heels in the bar area, he scoured the entire club for her. Layla had sworn she hadn\u2019t seen Angel leave. When he pressed for more information, Murphy stepped in, reminding him of the club rules. He\u2019d managed not to snap, fuck the club rules, which would\u2019ve gotten him thrown out on his ass and banned for the weekend.</p><p>He\u2019d nursed a beer, watching dispassionately as two of his sometime playmates ended up with Trace and Riley. Then he\u2019d headed to Cody\u2019s place and crashed.</p><p>Ben figured it made him a fool, waving off a constant stream of subs tonight, as he waited for Angel to show up. The woman flat out fascinated him. Her boldness in lying about her Domme designation. Her wide-eyed reaction to the scenes she\u2019d witnessed. Followed by her moments of true Domme-like behavior. The way she jacked him off and made him clean himself up. Her insistence he put his clothes back on when he so obviously wanted to fuck her.</p><p>But what really tripped him over the edge for her? Her genuine surprise at her body\u2019s response to him. Allowing her to believe she\u2019d been in control last night told him exactly what he\u2019d suspected: she was submissive to the core.</p><p>She\u2019d be a challenge. Ben couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d been challenged by a woman, inside or outside the club. His last three regular playmates hadn\u2019t posed any challenge.</p><p>Zoe had been a trial.</p><p>Ali had been too eager to please, a lifestyle sub in training.</p><p>Lorena had needed submission as therapy; they\u2019d mostly talked.</p><p>He considered his one-nighters a fun way to pass the evening. A little bondage, a little practice with his toys, a chance to hone his skills with a whip, flogger, cane and crop.</p><p>Talk about clinical. And cynical. Now he remembered why he\u2019d stayed away from the Rawhide in the last month. He needed to shake off his attitude. But if Angel didn\u2019t show up tonight, he wouldn\u2019t stick around.</p><p>Ben looked around the room at the tables of couples, some already in play roles, some still negotiating. Sully, sans his usual lawyerly suit, was propped against the wall in overseer mode. Neither Cody nor Trace was around. Gil was behind the bar.</p><p>His gaze scanned the crowd. He froze when he spotted Angel, watching him from a corner table. How long had she been there?</p><p>She studied him for several long minutes. Then she stood, gracefully slipping from her chair. She started across the room. Stopped halfway. The distance between them seemed to increase with his every heartbeat.</p><p>It was damn difficult not to swoop her up and carry her off, but he waited for her to come to him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to hide his grin when she threw back her shoulders, lifted her chin and strode forward.</p><p>Good girl. See? That wasn\u2019t so hard.</p> <p>Angel slid into the seat across from his. \u201cHello, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came.\u201d Smooth, McKay.</p><p>\u201cI said I would. I\u2019ve been here awhile. Watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cBesides the dozen women who approached you? I was waiting for one of them to drop down and lick your boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t have mattered if one of them had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not interested in anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>Tension thickened the air.</p><p>How was it possible she was more alluring than he\u2019d remembered? She\u2019d donned the wig again, but her make-up wasn\u2019t as severe. Her facial structure was a study in contrasts, wide angular lines that emphasized her dainty feminine features. Apple cheeks, big hazel eyes framed by long, dark lashes, an upturned nose. She looked soft and angelic, except for her mouth. Goddamn those pillowy lips were made for nights of red-hot sin.</p><p>\u201cYou skipped out last night.\u201d Ben placed his hand over hers to stop her nervous finger tapping. \u201cBut you\u2019re here now and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the foggiest idea what that means.\u201d</p><p>It means you\u2019re mine tonight.</p><p>She squirmed as if he\u2019d said those words aloud.</p><p>He kissed her palm. \u201cIt means you and I are about to swap bracelets.\u201d</p><p>Those bewitching hazel eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so surprised. That\u2019s why you came back, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re curious about how it\u2019ll be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd scared,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. I\u2019m more scared of my reaction to you. You\u2019re just so...different from any man I\u2019ve ever been with. I mean, look at you.\u201d She touched him then, without conscious thought.</p><p>He studied her eyes as the tips of her fingers explored his face. Gently sweeping over his cheekbones. Tracing his jaw from the bottom of his earlobe to the dent in his chin. Innocent caresses that instantly gave him a hard-on.</p><p>\u201cSuch a stern look on such a handsome face,\u201d she murmured as her thumb outlined his lower lip. \u201cI prefer your heart-stopping smiles to your scowls. But I imagine I won\u2019t see many smiles from you tonight, will I?\u201d</p><p>Lightning fast, Ben trapped her face between his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ll see plenty of smiles from me tonight.\u201d He pressed his mouth to hers, letting the kiss linger, but not taking it deeper.</p><p>A delicate shiver rippled through her. When she attempted to retreat, he let her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d He removed the white bracelet and slid it across the table.</p><p>She removed the gold bracelet and exchanged it for the white one.</p><p>\u201cNow. Let\u2019s talk about hard limits,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo other players.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo public scenes between us.\u201d</p><p>That put a kink in his kinky plans. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know you won\u2019t like it until you\u2019ve tried it?\u201d he countered.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s a hard limit. No exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo anal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever experimented with it?\u201d</p><p>Two bright pink spots appeared on her cheekbones. \u201cNo. And I don\u2019t want to start tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What about bondage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because I assume you know what you\u2019re doing with ropes and such?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a few years of practice. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But if something you\u2019re doing makes me uncomfortable...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse your safe word and I\u2019ll stop immediately. But keep in mind it\u2019s not for casual use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe public club safe word is red. You should have a personal one too. So what is yours?\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled. \u201cBroncos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that team.\u201d</p><p>Ben grinned. \u201cGuess you and I won\u2019t be watchin\u2019 football together any time soon, since that\u2019s my favorite team.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t crack a smile. She fidgeted as if debating something.</p><p>\u201cAsk me the question.\u201d</p><p>Her startled eyes zoomed to his. \u201cHow did you know what I was thinking? Oh right. This isn\u2019t your first rodeo, is it, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t meet your expectations?\u201d</p><p>Like that\u2019d ever happen. \u201cMy list of expectations is short. One, complete honesty between us at all times. Two, keep an open mind because I\u2019ll push you more than you\u2019ll expect. Three, you don\u2019t just up and leave when we\u2019re done. We will talk about everything that goes on between us tonight and how you feel about it. Especially important this first time.\u201d He threaded his fingers through hers. \u201cMuch of what happens between a dominant and a submissive is psychological, not just physical. I need to know you ain\u2019t gonna bail on me the second I undo your restraints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run out. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, would you like a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. Bombay Sapphire and tonic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they have waitstaff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Keeps interruptions to a minimum. If members want a drink they can get it themselves.\u201d</p><p>Gil already had a bottle of Ben\u2019s brand of beer out when he approached the bar. \u201cWhat does the lady want?\u201d</p><p>Ben told him and waited, taking a sip from his beer. When Gil returned, Ben asked, \u201cWhat time are Murphy and Layla doin\u2019 their thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny minute now. Same place they always use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Ben wondered if he should tell her about the scene. Could Angel handle seeing her friend publicly whipped and fucked? He took the chair beside her.</p><p>She said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat.\u201d He pointed at her drink. \u201cYou know that stuff looks like watered down glass cleaner, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t taste like it.\u201d She sipped. \u201cIf the honesty thing applies to you, tell me what\u2019s put that wrinkle in your brow?\u201d</p><p>Astute little sub. \u201cMurphy and Layla are doin\u2019 a public scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not normal for them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Some couples give up exhibitionism once they\u2019re in a committed relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are they doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLayla got herself into a bit of trouble last night.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cIs it because of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. Layla never should\u2019ve lied to Murphy to get you into the club. It was her choice, so she has to deal with the consequences. Their scene will be about punishment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She paled. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. So we can stay here until it\u2019s over. Or we can go find a room right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suggesting I hide? Even though it\u2019s partially my fault she\u2019s being subjected to punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Layla isn\u2019t a novice to the lifestyle, Angel. You are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it be bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to you Murphy won\u2019t hurt her beyond what she can handle. But the whole point is to remind her of her submissive, not subversive, role in his life.\u201d</p><p>Determination flitted through her eyes. She drained her drink. \u201cI want to watch.\u201d</p><p>Brave girl. \u201cJust as long as you understand you cannot interfere. Period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ben left his unfinished beer on the table. Clasping her hand, he led her through the crowd, taking a left at the hallway.</p><p>Two dozen people were in front of the medieval room. He nudged her to a space in the middle of the crowd, wrapping his arms around her upper body, unsure if he meant to hold her up or hold her back.</p><p>She gasped softly, seeing Layla in chains, arms above her head, a spreader bar keeping her legs apart. Her naked back faced the audience. Murphy wielded a single tail whip.</p><p>Layla stuttered, \u201cF-fourteen, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Welts decorated Layla\u2019s back. Murphy didn\u2019t move as he cracked the whip again; the tip scored the tender skin on her left side.</p><p>Angel jumped and Ben held tight. \u201cThis part is almost done,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMurphy never does more than twenty strikes.\u201d</p><p>Layla counted, her voice staying strong. But Murphy didn\u2019t look happy when he leveled the final blow. He put the whip aside and stood in front of his submissive, forcing her to meet his gaze as he unhooked the manacles from her wrists. Then he nodded at Sully, who rolled a pommel up front.</p><p>Layla said something to Murphy and he snapped, \u201cThat earned you another ten.\u201d He hoisted her off the floor, placing her torso on the modified pommel horse. Her head and arms dangled on the opposite side, which left her ass sticking up in the air. With her legs spread by the bar, her pussy and her anus were totally exposed to all who watched the scene.</p><p>Murphy restrained Layla\u2019s arms and snagged a paddle off the cart. He grabbed a fistful of her hair, raising her head. \u201cTwenty swats. You will count them down from twenty. And if I\u2019m not convinced you\u2019ve learned your lesson, I will add twenty more from the cane. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>He moved behind her. He swung, the paddle connected with her skin, high on her left butt cheek.</p><p>\u201cTwenty. Thank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The next blow hit in the same place.</p> <p>\u201cNineteen. Thank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>The next blow lower. Each blow precisely placed so every inch of Layla\u2019s ass was cherry red.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t all that was red. Ben murmured, \u201cLook at her pussy. See how wet and swollen it is? These last ten aren\u2019t punishment for her. They\u2019re her reward for takin\u2019 the punishment. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his neck.</p><p>Murphy bellowed, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you, sub. Louder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree. Thank you, S-sir.\u201d</p><p>Layla\u2019s voice had taken on a dreamlike quality. The last two blows landed so close to her cunt she moaned. When Murphy finished, he tenderly smoothed his hands over her abraded ass. But Layla barely stirred. He dropped his pants. When he reached for the strap-on, murmurs rippled through the crowd.</p><p>Murphy squirted lube on his cock and on the phallus centered above his cock and stroked both. He drizzled more lube between her butt cheeks. Using both hands, he aligned the dildo to her asshole and his cock to her cunt and shoved both in deep.</p><p>Layla\u2019s head came up and she wailed.</p><p>\u201cIs he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking her ass and her pussy at the same time.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cOh God,\u201d but she didn\u2019t avert her eyes from watching Murphy master Layla. Murphy slowed his thrusts, sped up and reached around Layla\u2019s thigh to toy with her clit.</p><p>She wailed again. \u201cPlease, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it, Layla. Say it and I\u2019ll let you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I disappointed and embarrassed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to hear. You\u2019ve earned this.\u201d He fucked her harder, moved his hand faster. \u201cCome for me.\u201d</p><p>And Layla did. Her body convulsed. She screamed, but they weren\u2019t screams of pain.</p><p>Murphy kept reaming her until her body went completely slack. He slowed, leaning over her to place a tender kiss on her back. He pulled out and bent down, releasing the spreader bar from between her ankles. After pulling up his pants, he crouched in front of her and cradled her face in his hands. Wiping her tears, murmuring to her, smoothing her tangled hair from her face, kissing her with tenderness and fire. He unhooked her restraints and scooped her into his arms, kissing the top of her head as he carried her into a private room and shut the door.</p><p>Watchers started to scatter.</p><p>His sub had craned her head to look at the closed door, so Ben couldn\u2019t read her eyes.</p><p>When he placed an openmouthed kiss on her shoulder, she tried to get free from him. \u201cHey now. Easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t... I never...God. That was... I have to...\u201d</p><p>Then his sub raced down the hallway like the hounds of hell nipped at her heels.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Ben caught up with her in front of room four. \u201cWhoa. Where you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Not here.\u201d</p><p>He herded her into the room.</p><p>Immediately she retreated to a corner and sent off don\u2019t-touch-me vibes.</p><p>This isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve dealt with a skittish sub.</p><p>\u201cAngel? Are you upset about the scene with Murphy and Layla?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot upset. It horrified me. I can\u2019t believe I stood there and watched him whip her. She tried to explain to me why the hurting stuff was part of their life, and I thought I understood, but obviously I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t remind her everything was consensual. He just watched her pace as her mind raced.</p><p>\u201cBut no one around me was horrified. So when Murphy finished whipping her and switched to the paddle, it didn\u2019t seem as horrible. Mostly because I saw the change in Layla\u2019s body language. And it wasn\u2019t like Murphy noticed it too; it was like Murphy had caused the change in her. And each time that paddle connected, I could almost feel her calmness and bliss floating over me.\u201d</p><p>Sweet sub, you really are starting to get it.</p><p>\u201cBut Murphy didn\u2019t use sex for shock value for the people watching. He used it because Layla needed it. And I\u2019ll admit it was pretty hot watching him, especially with two...\u201d she gestured distractedly, \u201cyou know. I\u2019ve never believed a woman could scream from an orgasm. But it wasn\u2019t like a porn scream, it was a you touched my soul type scream.\u201d</p><p>She stopped by the door with her hands clenched at her sides, her eyes closed. \u201cBut when Murphy knelt in front of her, the gratitude, love and admiration in his eyes for Layla was far from horrifying. It was beautiful. And I never would\u2019ve believed any of this if I hadn\u2019t seen it firsthand. If they hadn\u2019t let me be a part of something so intensely personal for them.\u201d</p><p>Ben had known Angel was smart, but that didn\u2019t guarantee she\u2019d be intuitive. It also didn\u2019t guarantee she truly knew what she wanted. He waited for her to regain her balance. The longer he waited the more he realized her epiphany wasn\u2019t making her happy. In fact, she seemed to have closed herself off from him again.</p><p>He crowded her against the door, relying on the power of his voice, not his body, to keep her in place. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>Her haunted hazel eyes burned with indecision.</p><p>\u201cIs there something else about Murphy and Layla\u2019s scene that\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d Her gaze fell to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s something I realized about myself while watching it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben expected loss of eye contact would encourage her to speak openly, but she remained mute. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was barely a whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t ask me to do what? Fuck you? Whip you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be whipped. Ever.\u201d She gnawed on her lip.</p><p>\u201cStill waitin\u2019 for an answer, Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I can\u2019t ask you to spank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you liked watching that redhead get her ass smacked last night.\u201d That\u2019s when Ben understood. \u201cYou need me to take the choice away completely. Like Murphy did with Layla. You need me to decide when to paddle your ass.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, a bit shyly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like usin\u2019 a spanking as punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not usually much of a rule breaker anyway, so see my dilemma?\u201d She peered up at him. \u201cI\u2019d be worried you\u2019d use more than your hand on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to worry because it\u2019d be my decision.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her mouth into a scowl.</p><p>\u201cAh-ah. None of that.\u201d His lips grazed the plumpness of hers, hovering a breath away, waiting to swoop in and claim the kiss she\u2019d denied him last night.</p><p>This time when she opened her tempting mouth, Ben denied her a kiss. Moving his lips to the tip of her chin and cruising up the left side of her jaw. He nuzzled her ear, licking, blowing, nibbling. The more he nuzzled, the harder she squirmed. Coarse hair brushed his cheek and he itched to remove the wig, so she wasn\u2019t hiding anything from him.</p><p>Her fingers inched up his chest and she clutched his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHands by your sides,\u201d he reminded, nipping her neck.</p><p>She gasped, twisting away from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cStay still.\u201d His tone turned sharp and he forced her hands back down.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a request.\u201d When Ben sank his teeth into the section of skin between her shoulder and throat, her knees buckled and she shoved him away hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth was open in shock when she realized what she\u2019d done. She took a defensive posture, wrapping her hands over herself, attempting to melt into the wall. \u201cSorry. God, I\u2019m sorry, Bennett. I forgot for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time I give you a very clear reminder about who\u2019s in charge.\u201d He uncurled her fingers from her biceps, forcing her hands by her sides. \u201cRepeat after me. Bennett is in charge of me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett is in charge of me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again. Bennett is completely in charge of me tonight.\u201d</p><p>A spark of irritation darkened her eyes but she repeated, \u201cBennett is completely in charge of me tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. But because you inappropriately used your hands, you\u2019ve lost the use of them for as long as I see fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. That\u2019s not fair\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben got right in her face. \u201cKeep it up and I just might rethink my stance on not usin\u2019 spanking as punishment for talkin\u2019 back. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. Then nodded.</p><p>\u201cTurn and face the wall.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate at his command. She didn\u2019t move when he unzipped her corset and tossed it aside. She didn\u2019t protest when he tugged her leather skirt down her legs, leaving her in a tiny peach lace thong and the three-inch black patent leather pumps.</p><p>But she did tremble when he rested his hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking.\u201d He pressed a kiss on the slope of her shoulder. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what happens next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ben slid his hands up the front of her body. Over the soft curve of her belly. Pausing to cup her breasts. Stopping to place his thumb on the erratic pulse pounding in her neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroncos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to use it now?\u201d</p><p>A pause, then, \u201cNo. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Ben twined his fingers with hers and towed her away from the wall. At the end of the bed was a leather foot bench, the perfect height, length and width for what Ben had in mind. He dragged it to the middle of the room.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He opened the top dresser drawer and removed the items he\u2019d need.</p><p>She remained in a prim and proper pose. Her head wasn\u2019t bowed and her eyes seemed mighty interested in what he held in his hands.</p><p>He stepped so close she had to widen her knees to accommodate him, grinning down at her because her mouth was level with his cock. \u201cSo, what do you think I\u2019m gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze traveled up his torso until their eyes met. \u201cI think you\u2019ll unzip your jeans so I can give you a blowjob.\u201d</p> <p>Ben\u2019s smile faded. He crouched until they were eye-to-eye. \u201cLast night, when you were playing at bein\u2019 a Domme, whose pleasure were you more concerned with? Yours? Or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you went wrong, Angel. That\u2019s how I knew you weren\u2019t truly a Domme. Bein\u2019 dominant isn\u2019t about takin\u2019 what you want.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks reddened and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, please.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze winged back to his.</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019 dominant is about figuring out what the submissive needs. It\u2019s about trust. Tonight, as your dominant, you\u2019re trusting me to give you what you need, maybe even when you don\u2019t know what that need is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what I need?\u201d she asked with an edge of surliness.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow? You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019ve been observing you since I first saw you. Before we even talked I watched you. While you were sizing me up, I watched you. And last night when we walked through the club? I studied your reaction to every scene and your response every time I touched you. When I had my hand between your legs getting you off, I watched you. When I had my mouth between your legs, makin\u2019 you come? Well, I really watched you then. So I may not know your favorite kind of ice cream, or the name of the street you grew up on, or your birthday, but I guarantee that I\u2019ve learned things about you that\u2019d surprise...even you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes never left his as she processed his words. He could practically see her backtracking, trying to remember how much of herself she\u2019d given away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an awful Domme, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot awful. Just confused about the difference between power and control. So let me show you.\u201d Ben smooched her mouth. \u201cLay back and let your arms fall to the floor.\u201d</p><p>She straddled the bench and stretched out. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Scoot down so your head is almost hanging off the end. Now move your feet until they\u2019re right beside the bench legs. Yep. Perfect.\u201d Ben dropped the straps on the floor and trailed the ends of the silk scarves up her sumptuous body. Starting at her knees, zigzagging across her exposed flesh, swirling around her nipples, watching the tips constrict. \u201cSuch a gorgeous body. I love seein\u2019 you nekkid. Once I start touching you I won\u2019t wanna stop.\u201d</p><p>The tensed line around her mouth softened.</p><p>Ben lowered to his knees. \u201cRelax your shoulders.\u201d He twined the red scarves from her elbows to her wrists, immobilizing her arms.</p><p>The height of her heeled shoes only allowed him to tie her legs from mid-calf to ankle. He ran his palms up the inside of her thighs. \u201cYour skin looks so pretty wrapped in red silk.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chest when he secured the first strap above her hips. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyin\u2019 you down so you can\u2019t jerk away from me when I touch you.\u201d He secured the next strap above her breasts. \u201cStay still. If you move too much the strap will bite. I don\u2019t want these beautiful breasts bruised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it pinch me more than it is now?\u201d</p><p>He traced the edge of the strap from one armpit to the other. \u201cIf you arch too high. And the only thing allowed to pinch these sweet babies is me.\u201d He tweaked both nipples simultaneously.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cBennett, I don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>He studied her reaction to being bound. Rapid breathing. Slight trembles. But she wasn\u2019t attempting to jerk against any of the restraints. \u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>His index finger trailed from the dip in her chin, down her neck, between her breasts, passing over her belly button, stopping at the swollen folds hiding her clit. \u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll make you lose control?\u201d</p><p>When she turned her head away, Ben gently grabbed her chin, forcing her attention on him. \u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay? I\u2019m scared you\u2019ll make me lose control. You\u2019ve already got me tied up so I can\u2019t move. When you start to touch me I\u2019ll probably beg you to make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, little control freak, there\u2019s no one here but us. There\u2019s nothin\u2019 embarrassing about you begging me. Every time you come by my hand or by my command, it\u2019ll show you how in tune I am with your body.\u201d Ben\u2019s thumb stroked her bottom lip. \u201cThat\u2019s not embarrassing. That\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t...build me to the point I\u2019m begging you and then stop? Just because you can?\u201d</p><p>Was this a brand-new fear? Or had some mean fucker in her past gotten his kicks by denying her an orgasm? \u201cMakin\u2019 you come is a rush for me, so if I deny you that, I\u2019m denying myself. But I ain\u2019t gonna lie. Sometimes delaying that gratification intensifies it. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>They measured each other for another minute.</p><p>\u201cSay your safe word if you wanna stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re done talkin\u2019.\u201d Watching her eyes, he slid his finger down her slit. The wetness he found at her core didn\u2019t surprise him, but she wore that look of embarrassment. He pushed his finger inside her. \u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed of how your body responds to me.\u201d</p><p>Ben slipped another finger inside, using his thumb on her clit. The feminine heat and wetness made him want to sink his cock into her now. But he painted a trail up her body with his wet fingers instead, lapping the sweet stickiness with his tongue. He smeared her juices on her nipples, then sucked it off slowly. One side at a time. While his mouth was busy, so were his hands. A teasing brush of his fingertips across her belly. Caressing the deeply contoured sides of her body from hip to armpit. Skimming the outside of her legs. Grazing the inside of her thighs. But never touching her sex directly.</p><p>Much to her squirming displeasure.</p><p>He focused his attention upward and knew the instant she realized his intention.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax your neck.\u201d He firmed his lips and followed that swan-like curve from the sweet spot behind her ear to the hollow of her throat.</p><p>A full body shiver rolled through her. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really that riled up about me kissing you here?\u201d Ben bestowed a warm, soft kiss to the side of her neck. Then he parted his lips and scraped his teeth across it.</p><p>She bucked up with a sexy whimper.</p><p>Breathing in the scent of her passion-warmed skin, he dragged openmouthed kisses from the sweep of her shoulder, up and down both sides of her neck, back and forth from her jawbone to her clavicle.</p><p>She tried to block him, raising her shoulders and angling her head into his face whenever he got too close. After her cheekbone smacked into his nose, he warned, \u201cHold still, goddammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t. I can\u2019t take any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>Eyes closed, she nodded.</p><p>Liar. \u201cThen say your safe word.\u201d</p><p>A couple of heartbeats passed before she shook her head.</p><p>Which meant her mind protested but her body didn\u2019t. That was his goal for tonight\u2014to get her mind and her body on the same wavelength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben cupped her sex. Wetness coated his fingers. Yeah. Her body wasn\u2019t objecting at all. Keeping his hand covering her pussy, he zeroed in on the hot spot on the left side of her neck.</p><p>She jerked on the restraints, arching and tossing her head, narrowly missing a collision between her sharp chin and his forehead.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>He pressed one hand to the top of her head; his other hand gripped the base of her throat.</p><p>Her eyes were panicked and if she hadn\u2019t been restrained, Ben suspected he\u2019d see skid marks on the carpet from her hasty departure.</p><p>\u201cBreathe. Do you understand I\u2019m not gonna hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Took a second, but she nodded, purposely inhaling slowly and deeply.</p><p>But her neck was so rigid he worried it\u2019d be sore. \u201cRelax. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your hand off my neck, unless you plan to choke me out with auto-erotic-asphyxiation for your next trick.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cTrying to piss me off to see if I\u2019ll give up on you and untie your binds?\u201d</p><p>She seemed surprised he\u2019d picked up on her intentions.</p><p>\u201cTough luck. I have half a mind to just let you squirm and thrash around like a bull in a buckin\u2019 chute. Wouldn\u2019t be long before this wig was laying on the floor. And wouldn\u2019t that be interesting?\u201d</p><p>That definitely got her attention.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so damn squirmy whenever I touch you here?\u201d He stroked the cord straining in her neck.</p><p>Her jaw clenched.</p><p>He brushed his lips over hers. \u201cThis would be a good time to practice that honesty thing, bein\u2019s you ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere unless I let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. My whole neck is super sensitive. One touch on it, one whisper across it and I\u2019m a mass of goose bumps. So when you kiss my neck like you were? I feel like I could come from just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head gets fuzzy. It makes me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLose control. Guess what? That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m tryin\u2019 to do. Because control is mine, not yours.\u201d</p> <p>Ben slid his hand between her legs. Swirling his middle finger in her juices and following the seam of her sex up to her clit. He rubbed the tiny nub until it plumped, her escalating moans urging him on. Then he went in for the kill, suctioning his mouth to her throat as he shoved two fingers into her wet pussy.</p><p>Her body jerked like she\u2019d stepped on a live wire.</p><p>He felt the vibration of her scream beneath his lips and a jolt of male satisfaction hardened his dick. She was so damn responsive. He imagined spending all night teasing her, driving her to the pinnacle and then kicking her over the edge. Some other time, since he was chomping at the bit to fuck her.</p><p>When the tension left her body, he donned a condom. He untied her legs and kneaded her calves. \u201cAny numbness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Releasing the straps, he perched on the edge of the bench. Grasping the backs of her thighs, he pulled her legs straight up and placed her ankles on his shoulders. When he widened his knees, her pussy and her asshole rested against the base of his cock. He twisted his hips, grinding his cock against those hot spots.</p><p>She pressed into him for more friction and her eyes fluttered closed.</p><p>\u201cEyes open,\u201d he said curtly, waiting until she complied. Then he gradually fed his cock into her, until he was buried to his balls.</p><p>\u201cSee how I\u2019ve positioned you? So I can fuck you as deep as possible? So you can\u2019t touch me? So you can\u2019t touch yourself? You are totally at my mercy. Your body, your pleasure all belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>Tight, wet warmth surrounded his shaft. \u201cSqueeze my cock with those cunt muscles as I pull out.\u201d The increased pressure around his dick felt amazing. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>After the third time, her surprised, \u201cYes, more,\u201d as he withdrew made him grab a handful of ass and hike her pelvis higher. No easing in\u2014he bottomed out on the first thrust.</p><p>She arched hard, and turned her head with a drawn out moan.</p><p>\u201cEyes. On. Me.\u201d</p><p>A bit of defiance showed in those hazel depths when she looked at him.</p><p>He answered her unspoken question. \u201cWhy? Because I want you to see who\u2019s fucking you. Who\u2019s making you cry out. I want you to see who\u2019s in charge.\u201d Ben plunged into her again.</p><p>Moisture trickled down his spine. Her chest turned slick with a sheen of sweat. Her breathing became labored. When he kicked up the pace, he wanted to come so bad his balls fucking hurt.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to come, Angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will come. Without me touching your clit. Without kisses or whispers in your ear. Without me suckling your nipples or biting on your neck.\u201d Right after he said that, goose bumps covered her skin. \u201cBut you love the thought of that, don\u2019t you? Me sucking on those hot spots that make you tremble. Make you scream.\u201d</p><p>Ben pulled out halfway to stroke his cockhead against her inner pussy walls. \u201cArch your lower back.\u201d He rocked that G-spot, squeezing his fingers at the root of his shaft into a makeshift cock ring. He felt her body go rigid from neck to chest to belly to legs in anticipation of the orgasm. He rasped out, \u201cBear down.\u201d</p><p>She unraveled. Her muscles spasmed around his cock and a long, low pitched wail distorted the air, competing with his grunting breaths and the hard grinding of his teeth.</p><p>When the last pulse faded, he unleashed his control and fucked her without pause. Each stroke bringing him closer...and closer. He roared when his balls emptied, each pulse better, hotter than the one before. \u201cFuck. Fuck!\u201d He closed his eyes and let go.</p><p>A cramp tightened his palms. The sexual fog lifted from his brain and he opened his eyes. Ben glanced down, seeing he still had a death grip on her butt. He moved his hands to circle her ankles, resting above his shoulders. Keeping his gaze on hers, he kissed the inside of her calf.</p><p>The hazy look of pleasure had softened her face. Although she deserved a break, he couldn\u2019t allow that. He needed to keep her in the post-orgasmic state a little longer.</p><p>Ben carefully set her feet on the floor. He ditched the condom and knelt by the bench. While he untied her arms, he fed her sweet kisses and murmured against her skin, until she released a contented female purr.</p><p>He tilted her head back and peered into her sex-sated eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed, Angel. We\u2019re not done.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Ainsley blinked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed. Now.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so there wasn\u2019t after sex cuddling. But it\u2019d be hard to complain after Bennett had thoroughly rocked her world.</p><p>Three times.</p><p>Talk about a rush, a total mind blower, how completely freeing it was to be tied up. Not to have to worry where to put her hands on his body. Or if she should be touching him more. Or mirroring the way he touched her. Or if she\u2019d lose it when he found her sensitive spots. Which he had. In record time. Oh boy, she couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d come so hard just by him\u2014</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Bennett said sharply. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>His handsome face swam into view. She smiled dreamily. \u201cYou are so good looking. Even when you scowl. I just want to lick you all over.\u201d She touched the deep cleft in his chin and swayed closer to him. \u201cWould you let me lick you here?\u201d</p><p>Strong fingers circled her biceps. He studied her face, a cross between delight and pride dancing in his blue eyes. \u201cChrist. You really are sex drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m sex drunk, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>Bennett bestowed that heart-stopping smile. \u201cOh, I\u2019ll definitely take all the credit,\u201d and gently pushed her onto the bed.</p><p>She flopped back with a sigh, staring at the gossamer fabric rippling on the canopy above her. She felt like that fabric. Light. Floaty. Beautiful. Her skin tingled. Her pussy throbbed. And she absolutely didn\u2019t give a rip she was bare-naked with a man she hardly knew. The hottest man she\u2019d ever been with. With the biggest dick she\u2019d ever encountered. How would she ever get that thing in her mouth?</p><p>His amused face hung above her. \u201cSo that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking about? How you\u2019ll fit my dick in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that out loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. It will fill you up. Guaranteed. It\u2019ll be fun helping you bone up on your deep-throating skills.\u201d He pulled her to a sitting position. \u201cGimme your foot so I can take off these ankle-breaking shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey looked naughty and sexy up by your ears.\u201d</p><p>He just grunted. Then he patted his thighs. \u201cCome here and sit on my lap.\u201d</p><p>She walked on her knees, watching as his eyes ate up her body. When Bennett\u2019s gaze lingered on her belly, she didn\u2019t suck in the pooch, nor did she mention getting back to exercising to tone up her wide hips and flabby thighs. Ainsley just let him look his fill.</p><p>He curled one hand around her jaw, holding her in place as he kissed her. These bone-melting kisses were new. Soft, slow, and thorough. He explored every inch of her mouth with his tongue as he urged her to sit on his thighs. Ainsley didn\u2019t mind the awkward position if he\u2019d just keep his mouth on hers, devastating all her senses with his drugging kisses.</p><p>But Bennett abruptly spun her around, face first on the bed. One of his legs pinned both of hers to the mattress and his hand was in the center of her back, holding her down.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A sharp smack echoed when his hand connected with her butt cheek.</p><p>Ainsley jerked up, her haze of pleasure evaporating. \u201cThat hurts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still. Every time you fight me I will add another one to each side.\u201d</p><p>He smacked the other butt cheek and she automatically reared up. Oh God. It stung. How had she ever thought she\u2019d like this?</p><p>Two more stinging swats on her tender flesh. \u201cI warned you. Tell me you understand the consequences.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cI-I understand,\u201d almost by rote.</p><p>Bennett\u2019s hands made soothing circles on her butt. Then he landed two more blows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears prickled in her eyes. Her entire body vibrated with a mix of fear, anger and humiliation.</p><p>Then his deep, soothing voice drifted to her. \u201cThe first few spanks are hard. You can get through them, Angel. Breathe through them. Loosen up your body. Count them out loud.\u201d</p><p>The whole time he spoke his hands caressed her backside. Then he stopped and smacked her left cheek hard, up by her hip. He bit off, \u201cCount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d Please only let there be one more.</p><p>He mirrored the spank on the opposite cheek.</p><p>\u201cT-two.\u201d</p><p>Her head buzzed. Her butt was on fire. Her face burned like she\u2019d spent the day at the beach. By the time she\u2019d counted twelve smacks on each side, a strange kind of anticipation began to build. She wanted to feel his hard palm connecting with her flesh. Would the next blow be harder? Or softer?</p><p>It will be what he chooses. Enjoy it. Revel in it.</p><p>Bennett murmured, \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what the bite of pain can do for you. Get your mind to shut off from everything but how I can make you feel.\u201d Then he administered the hardest hits yet.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d reached number twenty-two, that restless need for release had her rubbing her thighs together. She wanted to tell Bennett to finger her clit with his free hand.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got time to think about tellin\u2019 me what you need to get off, then I\u2019m not makin\u2019 it clear just who is in charge.\u201d</p><p>Was the man a mind reader?</p><p>Then he smacked the back of the left thigh, up high by her pussy. Oh God. This was torture.</p><p>Delicious torture.</p><p>\u201cCount!\u201d Another round of rapid-fire smacks.</p><p>She\u2019d drifted off into that happy place again and hadn\u2019t kept track. \u201cI...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bennett barked, \u201cDon\u2019t. Move.\u201d His hand left her back and both hands gripped her hips as he hiked her ass in the air. More spanks. Not as hard as on her ass. He stroked his fingers up her slit before he spanked her again.</p><p>Everything stopped. No more spanks. No more barked orders. Ainsley felt Bennett staring at her ass.</p><p>Then he caged her body beneath his and that deep voice rumbled below her ear. \u201cYour pussy is wet. Really wet. Do you know what that means? That means you liked your first spanking. And you took every blow so beautifully. Almost regally.\u201d His warm lips grazed her neck and she shivered. \u201cGoddamn your ass is hot, woman.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cIn many ways. I wish you could see how pretty it looks. How your pink thighs and red ass frame your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Bennett\u2019s words sent a thrill through her.</p><p>\u201cGood behavior is rewarded. Get on your hands and knees on the end of the bed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t meet his gaze; she just did what she was told. In that moment of foggy pleasure, she understood she\u2019d needed freedom from choice. How could that feel so freeing? Why did she have the urge to weep with gratitude that he\u2019d shown her what\u2019d been missing?</p> <p>The bed jiggled. Ainsley chanced a look between her legs when something soft brushed the insides of her thighs. Oh. Wow. His head was right below her...</p><p>Bennett yanked her down until her pussy was right on his mouth. He feasted on her, spreading her open with his thumbs. One minute that wickedly talented tongue was fucking so deep she swore she felt the tip tickling her G-spot. The next minute he suckled her pussy lips, then speared them apart with his tongue. He lapped at her delicately, making greedy masculine sounds, teasing the flesh hiding her clit with firm-lipped bites. And finally, he sent her rocketing into bliss when he sucked directly on her clit.</p><p>The orgasm blew her doors off. Ainsley threw her head back and practically screamed. The strong pulses zipped from her clit to her pussy to her fiery bottom, making everything\u2014her skin, her sex, her butt\u2014throb in sweet, torturous synchronicity.</p><p>She experienced that shivery sensation again. Her head became heavy. Her well-used body whispered for her to lie down. She was vaguely aware of Bennett moving from beneath her.</p><p>Then his fingers were under her chin, lifting her face up. \u201cEyes on me, please.\u201d</p><p>Took her a couple tries to remember how to open her eyes and Bennett laughed softly. She smiled at him. The way he looked at her made her feel like a goddess.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful. Such a blissful look I put on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was...\u201d Beyond words because she couldn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when you said you wanted to lick the cleft in my chin?\u201d Bennett bent so they were nose-to-nose. \u201cDo it now. You came all over my face, so I want you to lick your taste from me.\u201d He tilted his head back, but kept his hungry eyes on hers.</p><p>Her tongue darted out and flicked the sexy cleft. She playfully bit down as she lapped her juices from his chin. Once she finished, she dragged her mouth up to his and outlined his lips from corner to corner. She sucked at his full lower lip and let her teeth scrape the fleshy inside as she slowly released it. \u201cI taste good on you, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes held a dangerous look. \u201cYou\u2019d be a real challenge for me, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I live for a challenge.\u201d He smooched her nose. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley heard him rummaging around behind her. Any desire to sleep had fled. She wanted more time with this man.</p><p>More than just tonight? Would you come back to the club if he asked?</p><p>The bed dipped and the heat of his body called to hers. \u201cThis is cold but it\u2019ll help.\u201d A sticky substance splatted across the top of her butt like icy raindrops. His callused hands spread coolness over her flaming ass, toning down some of the hotness, and she couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><p>\u201cKnow what I normally do, after I\u2019ve reddened a woman\u2019s ass like this?\u201d His finger traced her butt crack. \u201cI fuck it. Hard and fast. While she\u2019s in that hazy place where the line is blurred between pleasure and pain.\u201d He pressed his finger against her anus and she involuntarily clenched. \u201cI\u2019d like to force this tiny hole open to take every inch of my cock. But you have a hard line on no anal, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I guess we\u2019ll just have to do it this way.\u201d Bennett impaled her pussy in one masterful stroke.</p><p>Yes. Yes! She loved it from behind. Something animalistic about that male power driving into her, experiencing sex at its most elemental level.</p><p>And the way Bennett hammered into her defined primitive. His hips slapped her butt, every thrust a reminder of her stinging ass. Every thrust a reminder this time wasn\u2019t about her pleasure. Only about his. He controlled it all. She didn\u2019t have to think, just feel.</p><p>His voice was hoarse. \u201cAlmost there. Jesus, this is so good.\u201d A feral groan sounded and Bennett rode her hard as he came.</p><p>After he pulled out, Ainsley fell face first into the mattress. When Bennett rejoined her on the bed, she made the time out sign above her head.</p><p>Laughing, he stretched alongside her, propped on his elbow, trailing his fingers over her spine. \u201cYou did very well.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d warned her they\u2019d talk when they were done. But really, what was she supposed to say? A play-by-play so soon after the game ended was unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to sit in a cool bath tonight. And probably tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>Bennett\u2019s hands stopped caressing her. \u201cDon\u2019t get snippy. If there\u2019s a problem with what happened, let\u2019s talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, Bennett, I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. That is a problem.\u201d</p><p>Then Ainsley found herself on her back with a grinning Bennett above her. \u201cWhat so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis. I\u2019m not known for bein\u2019 a big talker in my life outside the club.\u201d His lips toyed with hers. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just say this straight out: I want to see you again. I can finagle a guest pass outta Cody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I was a good submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a great submissive. Didn\u2019t give me nearly as much lip as I figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something to be said for an inventive punishment scene,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Ainsley set her hands on his lean cheeks. Her fingers continued a southerly descent, stopping to trace his collarbone. Her palms rested on his pecs and she glanced up to gauge his reaction. \u201cIs this permissible, Sir? Within the realm of your control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ignore that smartass remark this time. But yes, sub, you may continue.\u201d</p><p>She ruffled his chest hair and fingered his nipples until he hissed. \u201cI like your body. Sorta sad I didn\u2019t get to touch it as much as I wanted.\u201d She dragged her knuckles down to his groin. \u201cAnd this appendage is why the term penis envy exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I love flattery, you haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t know what to say when you tell me you want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. Say yes.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019d like to explore this pull between us. I have a feeling it\u2019ll be explosive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d</p><p>Bennett tipped her face up. \u201cAfraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Afraid of myself. Of letting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo?\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cNo. Afraid...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re afraid of, do you?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again next weekend. Maybe we can figure it out together.\u201d He pressed a lingering, gentle kiss on her mouth. \u201cSay yes. Please.\u201d</p><p>She found herself whispering, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He rolled off the bed and dressed quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone. I know you prefer time to think, although if I have my way, you\u2019ll lose the ability to think entirely whenever we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Ben\u2019s hair was still damp from his shower when he heard the first knock on his door. Who was the early bird? The event didn\u2019t start for an hour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keely yelled, \u201cBen? You decent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to help me carry stuff in.\u201d</p> <p>The back end of Keely\u2019s black Escalade was open. She handed him a cardboard box containing two Crock-Pots. \u201cDamn, cuz, this smells good. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulled pork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of it.\u201d</p><p>She slid her rhinestone-encrusted sunglasses on top of her head. \u201cI know how much you guys eat.\u201d</p><p>Ben smiled. \u201cNone of us are gonna complain there\u2019s too much food, Keels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on that because I don\u2019t wanna take this home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack doesn\u2019t eat leftovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack is out of town for the next week,\u201d she said, a pout in her tone.</p><p>Four trips later his kitchen counter was covered with containers of all sizes. Keely bustled about, transferring food from one dish to the next.</p><p>He brought her a Bud Light from the bar and a Moose Drool for himself. \u201cNeed me to do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She took a swig of her beer and hopped up on the counter. \u201cI wanted time to catch up with you.\u201d</p> <p>Catch up. Right. She intended to grill him until her brothers arrived and forced her to stop. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mysterious older brother Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Ben leaned against the opposite counter. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he keeping in contact with you guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s called me and Quinn a couple times. When the PBR was in Arizona he went to see Chase ride. He met Ava too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea when the rest of us get to meet him? It\u2019s bizarre that Aunt Vi had Uncle Charlie\u2019s baby and gave him up for adoption. And then they ended up getting married years later anyway?\u201d She shook her head with disbelief. \u201cI hoped Gavin\u2019s status as an only child in his adoptive family meant he\u2019d be curious about all of us.\u201d</p><p>He tried to find an answer that wouldn\u2019t offend. The McKay family was overwhelmingly large, especially with the influx of babies in the last few years. From the few times Ben had talked to Gavin, the man defined cautious. It made sense he\u2019d test the waters with his newly discovered siblings before he plunged into the gigantic McKay gene pool.</p><p>After Gavin showed up on their parent\u2019s doorstep a few months back, announcing he was their firstborn son, Ben figured Gavin had satisfied his curiosity about his birth parents and that\u2019d be the end of it.</p> <p>So it\u2019d shocked him when Gavin called. They\u2019d been exchanging emails since then. Ben kept it casual, waiting to see if Gavin was only maintaining contact out of some level of guilt. But they had more in common than Ben had initially believed. Gavin liked working with his hands and had experience remodeling the rental properties he owned in Arizona. They were both single, although Gavin had joint custody of his fourteen-year-old daughter. But during their conversations, Gavin never mentioned coming to Wyoming and Ben wasn\u2019t the type to push.</p><p>You had no problem pushing Angel last night.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Ben,\u201d Keely said.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cSorry. He\u2019s asked about our cousins. It\u2019s a lot to absorb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken in the diplomatic tone I expected. Bennett McKay, the peacemaker.\u201d</p><p>He flipped her off.</p><p>Keely grinned. \u201cOn to the next thing I want to harass you about\u2014I mean talk to you about. You know how much I adore the log bed you made us. It\u2019s big enough that I have my own space, in theory anyway\u2014\u201d she snorted, \u201c\u2014if Jack would ever let go of me at night. The damn man is stuck to me like Velcro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not really complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d talked to him about specific modifications to the original bed design. And I\u2019ve gotta say. Very sneaky, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb. You built the bed with hidden hook-and-eye thingies so that depraved man could tie me to the bed any way he wanted.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cAnd again, little cuz, you ain\u2019t really complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I am! Why didn\u2019t you tell me so I could tie him up? I\u2019m your cousin, your family, your flesh and blood. How could you let him have the advantage over me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, the submissive is always the one in control, regardless if she\u2019s bound by rope or by her dominant\u2019s word. Second, those are not special modifications Jack asked me for. But I knew if I added them, he\u2019d put them to good use.\u201d Ben pointed his beer bottle at her. \u201cBecause I suspect there are plenty of times you need to be trussed up to get your butt paddled.\u201d</p><p>Keely wore a calculating expression. \u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><p>Probably pointless to deflect, but Ben tried it anyway. \u201cHey, Jack noticed the hardware before you did, when we assembled the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that. I\u2019m actually good with GQ learning the ropes, so to speak. I\u2019m talking about you. Tossing out that dominant and submissive lingo like a pro.\u201d</p><p>Ben shrugged. \u201cNever devalue opportunities offered by good porn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is a conversation I never wanna have with you, Keely. So drop it.\u201d The way she froze, Ben realized too late he\u2019d used his Dom voice.</p><p>\u201cDoes that tone always get you immediate obedience?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you, apparently,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>Keely laughed. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass what consenting adults do behind the bedroom door, but I\u2019ve gotta ask: is your...proclivity why you go to Gillette?\u201d</p><p>Proclivity. Diplomatic way to put it. He studied her, debating on whether to give her a piece of the truth or to lie. The odd thing was, he trusted Keely. She might be a chatterbox, but he\u2019d never heard a whisper of her being a blabbermouth. \u201cYeah, I suppose it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She seemed to be deep in thought. \u201cI know someone who hung out at the Rawhide Bar. She\u2019d never tell me why the place had such a pull on her. She was awful secretive. Like it was a private club or something.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, Ben kept from choking on his beer. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnaliese.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI know Annaliese.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze sharpened. \u201cHow well?\u201d</p><p>He knew the petite blonde loved to give head after being flogged until she came. \u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Evasion. I\u2019m beginning to understand why your motto is gentlemen don\u2019t kiss and tell. I\u2019m also beginning to understand why you aren\u2019t interested in dating anyone from around here.\u201d Keely cocked her head. \u201cAlthough Jessie told me you went out with her coworker Simone a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out with her once. Why? She badmouthing me or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You knew within a single date she wasn\u2019t your type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimone was...\u201d Too abrasive. He preferred his women docile. Like Annaliese. Like Angel last night.</p><p>\u201cSimone was...what?\u201d Keely prompted.</p><p>\u201cSuffering from baby fever. She\u2019s lookin\u2019 for a man to be her husband only so she can get knocked up and experience the joys of motherhood. That sets off my warning bells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A woman who wants to settle down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A woman who\u2019s only interested in getting pregnant. I doubt she\u2019d be focused on me or the marriage, since she\u2019s already fixated on babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you expect your woman to devote all her energy to you? Make you the center of her existence?\u201d Keely demanded.</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cBut I watched my sister-in-law Libby\u2019s single-minded focus on having a baby nearly destroy her marriage to Quinn. I hated watching my brother suffer. I hated seeing everything they loved about each other become unimportant. They were lucky and fixed their problems, but that\u2019s a rarity because the divorce rate is so damn high. So I ain\u2019t gonna sign on for something for the rest of my life knowing ahead of time it ain\u2019t what I want.\u201d</p><p>She started to retort when two raps preceded Quinn walking in. He cast a glance at the dogs snoring in front of the woodstove. \u201cDid you drug my usual welcoming committee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They spent the weekend in the barn, pacing, missing their cushy life inside the house, snoozing by the fire. You want a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Quinn placed a tinfoil-covered plate on the counter. \u201cLibby made brownies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. Yum.\u201d Keely moved dishes around to make space.</p><p>Ben slipped behind the bar and popped the top on a bottle of Coors Light, nudging it toward his brother. \u201cBefore we get overrun with family, what\u2019s up with Dad? I called him on the way home today and he said he couldn\u2019t talk. He was figuring something out.\u201d Ben winced. \u201cChrist. Please tell me that ain\u2019t married man code for him and Mom havin\u2019 sex?\u201d</p><p>Quinn laughed. \u201cNope. He was lookin\u2019 at airline schedules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? They goin\u2019 to see Chase and Ava in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Gavin invited them to Phoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s...good. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>His cousins streamed in. Kane and Kade. Cord and Colby. Colt and Cam. Brandt, Tell and Dalton. They all gave Keely a rash of shit before bellying up to the bar. He handed Colt a Coke. Then he set out the beer and popped the tops.</p><p>\u201cMan, how do you remember everyone\u2019s favorite beer?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>\u201cMust be the time he\u2019s spending in the bar in Gillette,\u201d Cord said. \u201cDo you have an owner\u2019s stake in it?\u201d</p><p>I wish. \u201cNope. Cody and Trace own it. I help out when I can, but I mostly just hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why you don\u2019t hang out in the bars around here,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cBecause the bars around here suck, dumbass.\u201d Tell took a drink of his Coors.</p><p>\u201cMaybe sometime me\u2019n Tell will head that way since you like the place so much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton had been saying that for a while, so Ben shrugged it off. \u201cYou should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ll bet it ain\u2019t your buddies that\u2019re holding your interest. Got a woman stashed there?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Kade, standing next to Colby, and blatantly changed the subject. \u201cRielle mentioned seeing Skylar last week. She said Sky had been sick. Is that why you weren\u2019t around?\u201d</p> <p>Kade nodded. \u201cSome flu thing. I\u2019m just damn glad the girls and I didn\u2019t get it.\u201d He knocked on the wooden bar top.</p><p>\u201cYou sure the sickness wasn\u2019t from Sky being pregnant?\u201d Cam said slyly.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, lawman. Some of us know when to say when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some of us not so much,\u201d Colby muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo way. Channing is pregnant again?\u201d Kane asked.</p> <p>\u201cGod no.\u201d Colby also knocked on wood.</p><p>\u201cLibby ain\u2019t pregnant either,\u201d Quinn offered.</p><p>\u201cDitto for Indy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdd AJ to the not list,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>\u201cDid this conversation have a point?\u201d Tell demanded. \u201cOr all you gonna whip out baby pics next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, cause you don\u2019t have a picture of your nephew Landon in yours,\u201d Keely inserted.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re just tryin\u2019 to figure out who\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Kane said. \u201cCause at least one woman in this family is always knocked up.\u201d</p><p>All eyes zoomed to Brandt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Jessie\u2019s not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed. Then all everyone turned and looked at Keely.</p><p>She bristled. \u201cWhat did I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just wondering...\u201d Colt drawled.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bun in the oven?\u201d Cord finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a whole package of them right here.\u201d Keely whipped a roll at Cord\u2019s head. \u201cJerk.\u201d Then she pegged Colt with one. \u201cAsshole. You telling me I look fat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPut away the dinner rolls, Nolan Ryan. We ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 you look fat. We\u2019re just tryin\u2019 to figure out who Ma is knitting the new baby blanket for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. Jesus. Jack and I have only been married a year. And after I saw AJ in labor with Beau?\u201d She shuddered. \u201cMaybe never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d</p><p>Keely threw another roll at Cord. \u201cNot that bad? Didn\u2019t AJ threaten to cut off your big swinging dick filled with demon seed if she ever saw it again?\u201d</p><p>Cord smirked. \u201cShe didn\u2019t mean it, trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss and make up with your big swinging dick, did she?\u201d Colt said with a snicker.</p><p>More laughter broke out.</p><p>\u201cHow did we get on this subject anyway? I was hoping there\u2019d be no baby talk for a change,\u201d Dalton complained.</p><p>\u201cWe got on the subject because my brother was avoiding your question about the women keeping his interest in Gillette,\u201d Quinn said.</p><p>Ben scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he only wants us to think that. Maybe he really has his eye on a woman closer to home,\u201d Keely tossed out.</p><p>Thanks a fuckload, Keely.</p><p>Quinn\u2019s beer bottle stopped halfway to his mouth. \u201cAh hell. I should\u2019ve seen that one comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Ben said. \u201cShould\u2019ve seen what one comin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what, who. You know, your hot, sexy, single neighbor, Rielle Wetzler?\u201d Keely added, \u201cHow\u2019s she doin\u2019 with that bed and breakfast? I don\u2019t ever hear anything about it, which can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>Dalton stood. \u201cCount me out of the conversation when it comes to the Wetzler girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd count me out of the conversation where you guys are tryin\u2019 to marry off the last of us single McKays,\u201d Tell said. \u201cWe like livin\u2019 the carefree bachelor life.\u201d</p><p>Ben noticed his married cousins exchanging smug looks after he, Dalton and Tell high-fived.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 goin\u2019 on between me and Rielle. We\u2019re friends. I\u2019ve built some furniture for her. Done some repairs at the B&amp;B. She keeps an eye on my dogs when I\u2019m gone. Just normal neighborly stuff. Plus, she\u2019s at least ten years older than me.\u201d</p><p>Cord grinned. \u201cAge ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a number. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she does all that stuff because she wants to be more than just friends. You should ask her out,\u201d Cam suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou might even get to put one of the beds you made her to good use,\u201d Quinn teased.</p><p>\u201cVery fucking funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. Someone\u2019s sensitive.\u201d</p><p>Male laughter erupted.</p><p>He snapped, \u201cWe watchin\u2019 bull riding or didja bring nail polish so we could give each other manicures while we gossip?\u201d</p><p>Keely rang a cowbell in the kitchen. \u201cCome and get it!\u201d</p><p>While plates were being filled, Ben shooed his dogs outside and turned on VERSUS. Once everyone was settled, Ben brought another round of beer before he fixed a plate for himself. He looked around, glad his cousins had put their differences aside and not only worked together, but could hang out together occasionally. They were all too hotheaded and stubborn for their working relationship to always be sunshine and roses, but at least that relationship wasn\u2019t combative day in and day out.</p><p>A collective groan rippled through the room when a bull stomped the crap out of a rider\u2019s leg.</p><p>Low stakes betting didn\u2019t last more than ten riders because Tell won all rounds. Being a PRCA rough stock judge was an advantage.</p><p>Buck-offs were more common than an eight-second ride so the speculation was high that Chase had a shot at the championship round, since his first score put him in the top twelve.</p><p>After Keely ended her cell phone call, she squeezed between Cam and Colt on the couch. \u201cCarter and Jack say hey to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t go an entire afternoon without checking in with your lord and master?\u201d Cord asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to check in, jerkface. Jack called me because he misses me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he was drunk,\u201d Cam said.</p><p>Keely elbowed him in the gut.</p><p>\u201cBrandt, have you checked in with Jessie yet? It\u2019s been at least an hour since you\u2019ve talked to her.\u201d Dalton added kissing noises and Tell muttered about being pussy-whipped. Brandt cuffed them both in the back of the head.</p><p>All in all, just a normal McKay gathering.</p><p>Chase\u2019s match-up was announced. He\u2019d drawn Red Bull Rebel. Chase was on the bull by the time the camera panned to him, helmet on, testing his wrap. Another shift of his hips and he nodded to the gatekeeper.</p><p>Red Bull Rebel went nearly vertical right out of the chute. Ben mumbled, \u201cCome on, bro. You got this. Stay on him.\u201d Chase had total control during the spin. Ben didn\u2019t look away from the screen until Chase hit the eight-second mark and the cheering started behind him.</p><p>High-fives were exchanged all around the room. Ben grabbed the remote and rewound so they could watch it again. Immediately after the score of eighty-eight was announced, the camera panned to Ava, Chase\u2019s wife, in the audience.</p><p>\u201cChase has really turned his ridin\u2019 around,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>Ben muttered, \u201cHe needed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone more determined when we worked them bulls last summer. One day, Chase climbed on twenty-five bulls.\u201d Colby shook his head. \u201cCrazy damn kid. Me\u2019n Cash kept waitin\u2019 for him to say enough but he never did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ben?\u201d Kane said. \u201cMe\u2019n Kade are goin\u2019 antelope huntin\u2019 next weekend. Do you still want the hides if we bag a couple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Any deer skin you don\u2019t want either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 with them?\u201d Colt asked.</p><p>\u201cTanning them and adding pieces to furniture. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll work, so I need extra skins to experiment on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass the word along. I know Trev and Ed got permits to hunt damn near everything.\u201d</p><p>After Chase placed seventh, the party broke up.</p><p>Ben was too restless to sit inside, so he headed out to his workshop. But his thoughts kept drifting to Angel. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t talk herself out of returning to the Rawhide.</p><p>It\u2019d been a common occurrence, in Ben\u2019s experience, that once a woman was out of the club atmosphere, she\u2019d get to thinking about how she\u2019d willingly given herself over to a dominant partner. She\u2019d become mortified by her behavior. In the moment, it\u2019d been a heady experience. In the outside world, it seemed...wrong. Dirty. Out of character. A violation of her feminist sensibilities.</p><p>Not that Ben disagreed some dominant/submissive relationships were borderline degrading. It bothered him that some women\u2019s foray into the scene only showed the worst side. Not the best side, like Layla and Murphy, who\u2019d been together for years. Their devotion to each other\u2019s needs was undeniable. Ben wasn\u2019t looking for a lifestyle sub, but a woman who understood this wasn\u2019t a phase with him. He was a dominant to the core and always would be. He couldn\u2019t be with a woman who wouldn\u2019t accept that side of him\u2014no matter where they met.</p><p>Planing boards for mission-style nightstands took his mind off constant speculation about the odds of Angel showing up.</p><p>He suspected it\u2019d be a long week.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Oh my aching ass.</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s butt still stung on Monday morning. Bad. She\u2019d immersed herself in a cool bath as soon as she\u2019d returned to the hotel after her sexcapades at the Rawhide Club with Bennett. Every time she felt that burning twinge, it reminded her of him. Of how he\u2019d known the pain would morph into something else entirely for her.</p><p>And that knowledge had shaken her very foundation.</p><p>She prided herself on being a logical woman. But what she\u2019d experienced with Bennett defied logic. A smart, independent, capable female ceding all control, in essence saying, here\u2019s my body, do to it what you please, don\u2019t let me think, just make me come.</p><p>Did that make her a mindless slave to pleasures of the flesh? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. Ainsley knew it wasn\u2019t that cut and dried. Logically she understood the difference between giving control and having a man take control away. What amazed her was that she hadn\u2019t felt powerless at any point. All she\u2019d felt was relief.</p><p>Which gave credence to Bennett\u2019s claim: the submissive had all the power in the situation. The dominant was restricted only to the amount of power the submissive relinquished. But that didn\u2019t answer the question of why she\u2019d trusted Bennett so easily? So quickly? Which led to the next question weighing on her mind: would there be a next time?</p><p>She had until Friday to decide. And heaven knew she\u2019d dissect this scenario and potential outcomes a hundred times before then. The image that kept popping up when the doubts plagued her was Bennett\u2019s face and the intense way he studied her. He wanted to know her, inside and out. Her every gesture, her every laugh, her every facial twitch and her every word were memorized and filed away for his future use.</p> <p>And if she was totally honest with herself, she was less spooked by that than she was immensely flattered.</p><p>Tapping on her car window startled her. She glanced at the intruder, slicked up, anal-retentive, nosy Turton Ingvold, the man she\u2019d secretly dubbed the turd. Because boy howdy, did the name fit him. Brown hair, brown eyes, and a total brown-noser\u2014to everyone except her. Turton treated her with an air of derision. He\u2019d expected to land the bank president position after the man who\u2019d initially been tapped for the job last spring had been abruptly reassigned. But she\u2019d been offered the plum job for this new branch office, making Turton her second-in-command.</p><p>She managed to smile at him after she exited her car. \u201cMorning, Turton.\u201d</p><p>He walked beside her\u2014right beside her\u2014up the sidewalk. \u201cI trust you\u2019ll handle the situation with Rita this week?\u201d</p><p>No hello, no good morning, no surprise. Half the time she wondered how Turton had reached management level because he had zero social skills and practically no tact. \u201cYes. I believe she works tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019d hate to think you were showing favoritism and we\u2019d have disgruntled employees\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019d handle it, so can we please drop it?\u201d She felt him breathing down her neck as they walked single file into the bank lobby and it creeped her out.</p><p>She stopped for a minute and took stock of the space. The lobby paid tribute to Wyoming\u2019s western heritage. Stacked slabs of native stone, exposed wooden beams, rusty barbed wire used throughout in unique ways. Even the chairs were covered in cowhide. The corporation had invested in local artists for the rest of the d\u00e9cor, large bronzes, painted scenes with cowboys and Indians, as well as a large mural depicting the spectacular and desolate landscape in the Sundance area. The brand new building had only been open for business two weeks and Ainsley already thought of the place as hers.</p><p>Evidently Turton had been trying to engage her in conversation, or treating her to a thinly veiled comment about her incompetence, and when she hadn\u2019t responded, he\u2019d stormed off to his office.</p><p>She ditched her coat and briefcase in her office before heading to the employee break room for a cup of coffee. Leslie, the lone loan officer, sat at the break table, dunking a teabag in hot water while she flipped through the newspaper. She glanced up and smiled. \u201cHow was your weekend?\u201d</p><p>Enlightening. \u201cToo short. How about yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetween the kids\u2019 activities and the laundry I was happy to come to work this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jenny, the receptionist, sitting next to Leslie, said, \u201cMy car wouldn\u2019t start and my dad couldn\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong with it, so I spent the entire weekend carless, at home watching TV instead of barhopping with my friends.\u201d She sent Leslie a sly look. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get my car fixed, I might have to come to you for a loan for a new car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to make an appointment for next week, because I\u2019m full up this week,\u201d Leslie said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always good news to hear first thing on Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do this weekend, Miss Hamilton?\u201d Jenny asked, giving Ainsley\u2019s suit a thorough inspection.</p><p>Miss Hamilton. Like she was an old spinster. The twenty-something woman was a tad mean-spirited, but efficient, so usually Ainsley let her barbs slide. Not today. She poked Jenny back. \u201cOh, I went to a club.\u201d</p><p>Jenny furrowed her brow. \u201cLike a supper club or a knitting club or something?\u201d</p><p>The little snot. \u201cNo, to a night club.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know it. It\u2019s out of town. I had a great time but it was exhausting. I discovered muscles I hadn\u2019t used in years.\u201d She smiled and sailed from the room.</p><p>Her taunt literally came back to bite her in the ass when her butt met the leather seat of her office chair.</p><p>Ben ditched his gloves and dug his cell phone from his front pocket after it rang for the third time. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re home. I need a huge favor.\u201d</p><p>He set aside his ax. \u201cSure, Rielle. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car has a flat tire. When I went to change it I discovered the spare is flat too. I have a meeting at the new bank in fifteen minutes. Is there any way you can pick me up and take me to town?\u201d</p><p>Ben dusted off his Wranglers, scraped the muck from his boots and grabbed his keys from the workbench. \u201cHopping in my truck now.\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s place was up the road three miles. The top half of her one hundred and forty-six acres bordered Casper McKay\u2019s land and Ben\u2019s portion of the McKay Ranch. According to family gossip, thirty years ago both Charlie and Casper had wanted that section. They\u2019d fought over it to the point the original owner had sold the parcel to the Wetzlers, a family from California.</p><p>Ben never put much faith in local speculation that the Wetzler\u2019s were dope-selling hippies, but they were an odd bunch. Their housing setup had a commune-like vibe\u2014from the individual cabins spread out from the new main structure, to the acres of gardens, the chicken coops, the animal pens, the dairy cows, the bee hives and the fruit trees.</p><p>No one knew how many people had squatted on the land with the Wetzlers\u2019 blessing. But in the two years since the deaths of her parents, Rielle Wetzler had built the Sage Creek Bed and Breakfast to supplement her income from her organic farm. Even with all the improvements, there was still much to be done. And those improvements didn\u2019t come cheap.</p><p>Rielle stopped pacing on the porch and bounded down the steps when he pulled up.</p><p>The willowy blonde strode toward his truck with an air of gracefulness. Although Ben knew how strong and capable Rielle was, her waif-like appearance didn\u2019t appeal to him. Despite his family\u2019s teasing, she never hinted about them becoming romantically involved\u2014a first in Ben\u2019s life when it came to dealing with a single woman. So their friendship meant a lot to him.</p><p>She gathered her long, tie-dyed skirt and slammed the door. \u201cYou are a lifesaver, Ben McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to help.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak until they were zipping along the blacktop toward town. \u201cSo why you goin\u2019 to the bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s new. They won\u2019t know my family history and wonder if I\u2019m asking for a loan for new grow lights to increase my secret crop of marijuana.\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously. I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll loan me money to pay off some debts. Like what I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you not to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do worry.\u201d She smoothed her palm from the top of her scalp down to the ends, trying to tame her baby-fine hair. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be. Them bankers usually have their minds made up before you even walk in the door. Bunch of controlling bastards. Least, that\u2019s been my experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought all the McKays had more money than they knew what to do with and didn\u2019t owe anyone anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the McKays. Especially not those of us who\u2019ve built houses or businesses or bought land. I\u2019ve got monthly payments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think my chances are of getting the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost bankers are real tight-asses in this economy. They\u2019ll take into account that you own the land. But they\u2019ll also take into account if your proposed improvements will actually increase the property value.\u201d</p><p>Rielle sighed. \u201cToo bad the barter system doesn\u2019t still work with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019. Speaking of...thanks for checking in on the dogs this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo biggie. I had nothing else going on. Rory was supposed to be home this weekend but she had to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s her first semester of graduate school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. She\u2019s still bartending at Happy John\u2019s three nights a week since her graduate assistant grant only covers classes. I wish I could help her out more.\u201d</p><p>Ben shot Rielle a sideways look. \u201cIs that part of why you\u2019re applying for a loan? To give Rory money for school? Because, Ree, I gotta tell ya, your stubborn daughter ain\u2019t gonna be happy about that at all.\u201d</p><p>Rielle smiled. \u201cLike mother, like daughter, huh? Too damn independent for our own good. Don\u2019t worry, and don\u2019t tattle on me. The loan is strictly for the Sage Creek.\u201d</p><p>The remaining ride to town was quiet. The new National West Bank was an eye-catching structure comprised of blocks of native sandstone, glass and steel. The wooden beams on the outside added an Old West touch, as did the metal trim that would weather and rust in the harsh Wyoming elements. It was a nice addition to the town, even when he questioned whether the citizens of Sundance could support a second bank.</p><p>Rielle checked her make-up in the passenger mirror and slicked on a coat of Chapstick. Fussed with her hair. Mumbled to herself and pushed up the sun visor with a decisive snap. \u201cOkay.\u201d She curled her fingers around the door handle. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look ready. Knock \u2019em dead, tiger.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAren\u2019t you coming in with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken a good look at me? The last thing you need is them seeing me tracking mud and shit across their brand new carpet. I\u2019ll stay in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Ben sank into his leather seat and pulled his hat down over his eyes, wishing he could take a catnap. He\u2019d had a restless night, thinking about Angel. Wondering if he\u2019d recognize her without that funky-ass wig. Wondering how her real hair would feel wrapped in his fists as he fucked her mouth. His flashbacks made the crotch in his jeans uncomfortably tight, forcing him to redirect his thoughts.</p> <p>He studied the building\u2019s clean lines. He\u2019d built his log house himself and appreciated how form and function affected design, yet retained an artistic feel. As he thought about art, he remembered his cousin Carter had been commissioned for a large sculpture for this bank. Ben always loved seeing what works his crazy-talented cousin created. He was already here. He might as well sneak in and have a quick look-see.</p><p>The inside of the bank was as impressive as the outside. The place was busy and no one took notice of him as he stopped in front of the massive sculpture, prominently displayed beneath a circular skylight. A rusty chain enclosed the art\u2014a horse head carved from wood, surrounded by twisted sections of metal of varying heights, sizes and finishes that gave the impression the horse was running through tall, native grasses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s magnificent, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He recognized that sultry voice immediately. Ben spun around so fast he made himself dizzy and couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. \u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw nearly hit the floor. \u201cBennett? You... What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Before he could answer, a hearty hand landed on his shoulder. \u201cBen! I haven\u2019t seen you in a coon\u2019s age.\u201d</p><p>Dazed, he glanced at Bill, his insurance agent, who\u2019d inserted himself between him and Angel.</p><p>Bill said, \u201cWhat brings the elusive Ben McKay to town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChecking out Carter\u2019s latest piece of art.\u201d Now go the fuck away.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not shopping for a new bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ben kept his focus on the woman he hadn\u2019t been able to get out of his head.</p> <p>Bill kept yapping. \u201cI reckon Steve Talbot would take issue with that, since the McKays have always banked with Settler\u2019s First. Although this bank president is much prettier than Steve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re president of this bank?\u201d Ben said with total shock.</p><p>Her eyes turned frosty.</p><p>\u201cLook, Bill, how\u2019s about you don\u2019t mention to Steve you saw me in here and I won\u2019t mention to him I saw you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal. See ya around, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Ben moved close enough Angel had to look up at him. \u201cWe need to talk, Madame President.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna make a scene, but I will.\u201d</p> <p>The pink on her cheeks deepened.</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze wandered over her tousled golden-brown hair, streaked with amber, that fell past her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t ever wear that ugly-ass wig again. Jesus, woman, I like the look of you. So real. So pretty and soft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what? Pay you a compliment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come into my place of business and act like you control me here.\u201d</p><p>Stung, he bit off, \u201cThen I would appreciate ten minutes of your time in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re gonna turn away business? Because I want to open an account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Bonnie can help you with that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I want you to help me. Only you. So we doin\u2019 this or what?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes still held a warning. \u201cFive minutes.\u201d</p><p>As they headed toward her office, a voice called out, \u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>He faced a miserable-looking Rielle. \u201cYou done already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d He extracted his keys from his pocket and handed them over. \u201cYou can wait in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s gaze moved between them. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Inside a glass-fronted office, she skirted the desk, offering a curt, \u201cShut the door and have a seat,\u201d and slid into an oversized chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think you were a gentleman, saving the chair for your wife or girlfriend, if I didn\u2019t just see you order her to sit alone in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Any veneer of calmness fled. Ben cut across the room and placed his hands on her desk, looming over her. \u201cFirst off, I wouldn\u2019t have been in the Rawhide Club screwing around with other women if I was married or seeing someone.\u201d Breathe, man. His gaze dropped to the nameplate. Whoa. Her name wasn\u2019t Angel? \u201cMaybe I oughta be questioning you and your motives, since you, oh, lied about your damn name and wore that ridiculous wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven my occupation, I\u2019m sure you understand why I disguised myself. Plus, I had no idea what to expect from an establishment like the Rawhide Club since it was my first foray into such a place. Better to be safe than sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I guess I can buy that.\u201d</p><p>She fiddled with a pen. \u201cCan you please sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I makin\u2019 you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already established last weekend that you make me very nervous, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Ben,\u201d he corrected, perching on the edge of the floral-covered wingback chair. \u201cI only use Bennett at the club. Or my mom uses my full name when she\u2019s pissed off at me about something. Which you can imagine is all the damn time.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley smiled.</p><p>\u201cI like it so much better when you\u2019re smiling at me, angel. The name fits you, although that\u2019s not your name.\u201d His gaze tracked over the engraved nameplate. \u201cSo, Ainsley Hamilton, you\u2019re a bank president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would appear. You surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I knew you were sharp, and I figured you had a job where you were used to bein\u2019 in charge. You haven\u2019t been in Sundance long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived in this area my whole life. People talk when a hot single lady moves into town. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t been in town in recent weeks... Shame on me for not introducing myself earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re part of the infamous McKay family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfamous is an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from what I\u2019ve heard. Anyway, I haven\u2019t been out and about Sundance. There\u2019s a lot to micromanage when opening a new branch. I spent the first weekend unpacking and last weekend\u2014\u201d Her blush seemed to annoy her. She squared her shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t need to give you a play-by-play of last weekend\u2019s events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you surely don\u2019t, because I\u2019ve been reliving them in my head every damn hour for the last day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Were you gonna show up Friday night? Or stand me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t decided. It was all so...surreal.\u201d She rolled the pen between her palms. \u201cBut having you here in my office is surreal too.\u201d</p><p>But damn fortunate in his opinion. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny something clicked between us last weekend. How about if we talk about it tonight over dinner?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a questioning stare. \u201cDinner? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout adding more fuel to the infamous McKay fire, we\u2019d better stick to my place, because wherever we go in Sundance or Moorcroft, chances are high we\u2019ll run into one of my family members. I\u2019m not sure the new businesswoman in town wants to be associated with a McKay.\u201d When more suspicion flared in her hazel eyes, he realized he\u2019d have to take extra care with her, given how they\u2019d met. \u201cNo one knows about my life at the Rawhide Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make sure. I promise. It\u2019s only between us.\u201d He leaned closer. \u201cHave dinner with me tonight, Ainsley. It\u2019ll just be us talkin\u2019. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that tying me up and spanking sex stuff?\u201d</p><p>Was there disappointment in that snappy answer? \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d Ben tried hard to reconcile this polished, professional woman with the submissive he\u2019d had beneath his hands only two days ago.</p><p>\u201cYou can cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bachelor. Be pretty sad commentary on my life if I didn\u2019t know my way around a kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley smiled again. \u201cGive me your address and I\u2019ll be there after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fourteen point eight miles south on Bridger Gap Road. Turn left at the cattle guard. It\u2019s a log house. Can\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>Three knocks and Ainsley said, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>A tall brunette sashayed into the office. \u201cPublic relations from the main Denver branch called. I told them you\u2019d call them back as soon as you finished with your client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jenny.\u201d</p><p>Ben bit back a groan. The brunette was none other than Jenny Timsdale. Town beauty queen, hardcore partier and the last-call bar hookup for his cousin Tell. Or his cousin Dalton. Or both, to hear Dalton brag.</p><p>She feigned surprise at seeing him. \u201cBen McKay. Where have you been hiding yourself? I haven\u2019t seen you at the Golden Boot, Ziggy\u2019s or the Twin Pines in forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin Tell hasn\u2019t been too busy to come out and whoop it up with me once in a while.\u201d</p><p>He muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley said, \u201cJenny, is there anything else you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be so kind as to ask Bonnie to start the new account process? Mr. McKay will be right there, as he\u2019s decided to open an account with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Jenny flitted out.</p><p>Ben couldn\u2019t help but grin. Ainsley was no pushover. But she\u2019d soon learn he wasn\u2019t either.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the hard sell, Miz Hamilton. I look forward to you meeting my needs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour banking needs,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>His week was looking up.</p> <p>About fifteen minutes after Bennett\u2014Ben\u2014moseyed out of the building after opening a new checking account, Ainsley called Jenny back into her office.</p><p>\u201cYou buzzed me?\u201d she inquired with fake sweetness.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you have that number for the PR department? There are four different extensions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem. Be right back.\u201d Jenny\u2019s small, perfectly pear-shaped ass didn\u2019t bounce in the skintight pink leopard print skirt.</p><p>Ainsley sighed and swore she\u2019d eat like a bird tonight.</p> <p>Jenny handed over a slip of paper. \u201cHere you go. I hope I didn\u2019t interrupt anything between you and Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we were just finishing up. But as long as you asked, what can you tell me about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides he\u2019s as hot as fire? Mama, those blue eyes of his just like...look right into you, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d been on the receiving end of those soul-pondering looks.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pretty quiet compared to the rest of his family. But like the rest of them, he\u2019s involved in the McKay ranching operation. He\u2019s not much into the bar scene around here. He probably gets sick of women hanging all over him, but he\u2019s too polite and gentlemanly to say anything, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>No, that didn\u2019t ring true. Ainsley clearly remembered Bennett telling her exactly what he wanted her to do.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really date, definitely not like his cousins do. Because of that, some nasty people around here whisper he\u2019s gay, but I don\u2019t believe that for a second.\u201d</p><p>That man was far, far from gay.</p><p>Evidently Jenny realized that Ainsley hadn\u2019t responded to anything she\u2019d said. Her baby blues widened. \u201cYou aren\u2019t involved with him or something? Because aren\u2019t you, like, a lot older than him?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley let the snarky comment slide. \u201cWe were just talking about his cousin\u2019s art. He had a couple of general questions about the bank and I convinced him to open an account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a big deal if you could get all the McKays to switch their banking business here. I\u2019ll bet you can be very persuasive.\u201d</p><p>Not nearly as persuasive as Bennett could be</p><p>And that scared the bejeezus out of her.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p> <p>Ben\u2019s charming, rustic house looked nothing like Ainsley had pictured a big, bad Dom\u2019s swinging bachelor pad.</p><p>Cradling the bottle of wine, she tiptoed up the flagstone walkway, cursing her high heels, wishing she\u2019d changed clothes after work.</p><p>Soon as she neared the door, she heard barking. Snarling barks. And thumps. Like the dogs were throwing themselves at the door to get to her.</p><p>Ben\u2019s voice boomed. \u201cDammit, shut up. What the hell is wrong with you guys?\u201d</p><p>The dogs whimpered.</p><p>\u201cHang on a sec while I put the dogs out back.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted the shoulder strap on her purse, watching through the screen door as Ben dragged the dogs by their collars.</p><p>He trotted back, swinging the door inward. \u201cSorry about that. Don\u2019t know what got into them. They\u2019re usually so friendly they slobber all over ya.\u201d</p><p>She handed him the wine. \u201cThey probably smelled my cats.\u201d And my fear.</p><p>\u201cCan I take your coat?\u201d He set the wine bottle on a beautifully crafted side table.</p><p>Ainsley stopped on the edge of the foyer. \u201cAh. Sure.\u201d She passed him her trench. He hung it on a coat tree crafted out of some kind of animal horns.</p><p>She swiped her palms on her skirt, wishing she had pockets. Wishing she hadn\u2019t come.</p><p>Why was this so awkward?</p><p>You\u2019ve had kinky sex with this man. Dinner should be a breeze.</p><p>Then Ben was curling his hand over her jaw, gazing into her eyes. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here. I\u2019m so...nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Maybe this will help.\u201d Ben kissed her. Sweetly at first. Softly nibbling her lips while his thumb stroked her jawline. He patiently coaxed her to kiss him back. Once she opened her mouth wider, he dove right in, blowing all her circuits with a kiss packed with desire, laced with passion. Her head went muzzy and she wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>After an eternity of those soul-feeding kisses, he tilted her head back to string hot kisses from her chin to her neck.</p><p>Chills danced down her arms and neck and she sighed.</p><p>Ben chuckled, smooching her mouth one last time before resting his forehead to hers. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else can I do to put you more at ease?\u201d</p><p>His concern touched her. \u201cI\u2019d love to kick off my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free. How about a drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Ainsley followed him to a built-in bar. \u201cWow. This is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Bombay Sapphire and tonic, right?\u201d</p><p>Of course he remembered her drink of choice. \u201cNo, actually, I\u2019ll take a soda. Whatever you\u2019ve got is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComin\u2019 right up.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley checked out the rest of Ben\u2019s house. Definitely masculine with the animal trophy heads lining the wall and the large room focused on the huge TV, pool table and other man toys. Her gaze wandered to the open kitchen outfitted with stainless steel appliances, mahogany cabinetry, a big picture window overlooking an incredible view of the rolling plains. An eat-in countertop separated the kitchen and conversation area, comprised of two leather recliners facing a wood stove with an antique trestle table centered between the chairs. Maple-colored wood flooring stretched from the front door, through the kitchen, living room and bar. The TV/game room had brown and gold-flecked Berber carpet that continued down the hallway. A hallway that likely led to Ben\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Did Ben have hooks and restraining devices in his bedroom? Or did he only indulge in that at the Rawhide Club?</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a beautiful home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook me six years to get it done. Definitely a learning experience as far as adding to my carpentry know-how, but it ended up being exactly what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. \u201cYou built this place? By yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the plumbing and electrical and a few odds and ends. It\u2019s a kit house. Kinda like Lincoln logs for grownups. I bought three kits and turned them into one house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes it even more impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, angel, you\u2019re gonna make me blush.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley was pleased that he\u2019d reworked her fake club name into a term of endearment. She watched as he poured himself a Coke. \u201cJust because I\u2019m not drinking doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t.\u201d Way to tell him what to do. \u201cNot that you can\u2019t decide yourself whether or not you want an alcoholic drink.\u201d Stop babbling. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her forearm. \u201cYou\u2019re probably starved. How about if we eat?\u201d</p><p>She looked up right into those stunning blue eyes. She swallowed a girlie sigh. He really was delightful to look at. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>He instructed her to sit at the counter as he set everything up. \u201cIt\u2019s nothin\u2019 fancy. Just chicken and potato casserole. A side salad if you want it.\u201d</p><p>After they\u2019d taken a couple of bites, Ben spoke. \u201cGiven the way we met, seems strange to swap life stories, but I reckon we oughta get the basics out of the way. So go ahead. Ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>That was a loaded question. \u201cYou\u2019re part of the McKay family ranching dynasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDynasty.\u201d Ben snorted. \u201cI\u2019m just a simple rancher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your main job is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCattle. Feeding them, breeding them, moving them, selling them. I work with my older brother Quinn on our section of the ranch. But we all help each other out if need be. Certain times of the year are busier than others. It ain\u2019t a nine to five job, like bankers\u2019 hours.\u201d</p><p>She bristled until she realized he was teasing. \u201cFunny, cattleman. Have you ever been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He shot her a sideways glance. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was married for almost five years. Been divorced almost two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to bust up your marriage?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s forthright manner was refreshing. \u201cThe things that made us compatible in the beginning of our relationship started to wear on me. My ex was set in his ways and didn\u2019t understand why I wanted things between us to change. Luckily, I got out of the marriage before I became bitter, but I didn\u2019t get out unscathed.\u201d</p><p>His gaze hooked hers. \u201cTo be blunt, you wanted to experiment, sexually, and he wasn\u2019t on board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was appalled. At one point he told me I needed counseling to deal with my unhealthy attitude about sex and my desire for deviant behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a fuckin\u2019 idiot. I don\u2019t need to tell you that you\u2019re better off without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that he wasn\u2019t a sexual man. For a few years I thought I was asexual, just like him, but I realized I wasn\u2019t. The fear that I\u2019d find myself sixty years old and regret choosing a man with a pension plan instead of finding real passion gave me the courage to end the marriage.\u201d She pushed her food around on her plate. \u201cHis last shot at me? I was a sex addict, control freak, ball-buster. Which led me to believe I was a Domme. So now I don\u2019t know what the hell I am.\u201d</p><p>Then Ben\u2019s hands were on her face. \u201cWhat you are is a beautiful, sexy woman. Smart enough to get out of a situation that didn\u2019t fit you. The real you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his. \u201cYou really believe I\u2019m submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not control you want, Ainsley. It\u2019s freedom from control. Freedom not to have to micromanage every aspect of your life. Freedom to trust that your sexual well-being will be tended to by a man you trust. Freedom to feel instead of think.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are the man who can get me to do that?\u201d</p><p>Ben leveled that panty-dampening smile at her. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d His hands fell from her face. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this conversation after we eat.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the meal was quiet, except for the dogs barking. After he cleared the plates, he led her to the oversized corduroy couches. Ben plopped down beside her, and picked up her hand. \u201cTell me about your job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s guaranteed to put you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI switched banking corporations during our separation since my ex and I had worked for the same company. Basically I started over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you go around opening new banks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This was sort of a fluke. I turned around a branch office in Denver. When this job unexpectedly opened up, they offered it to me. I\u2019m probably in over my head. And since this is a small bank in a small community, they expect me to have a community presence.\u201d</p> <p>He groaned. \u201cA man could go broke supporting all the community causes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo words a banker doesn\u2019t like to hear together: go broke.\u201d</p><p>Ben turned his head, brushing his lips in front of her ear. \u201cDoes the stern bank president ever wear her hair up?\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was an abrupt subject change. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you jerk away if I put my mouth on that sexy sweep of skin between your hairline and your shoulder?\u201d Ben blew a stream of air across her ear. \u201cWould I have to pull your hair to take what I wanted?\u201d</p><p>More shivers spread across her body. \u201cI thought you said we\u2019d just talk tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why does this feel like a seduction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I am trying to get you to feel instead of think.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley fought the urge to push him away as his mouth wandered over her skin. She\u2019d never let a man know her weak spots, let alone hone in on them.</p><p>\u201cI sense the fight in you, angel. Let. It. Go.\u201d</p><p>Hot kisses seared her neck and she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cDrop your head back on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s voice had become Bennett\u2019s. Demanding in that deceptively soft way that only increased its power.</p> <p>She inhaled a deep breath and...obeyed.</p><p>Bennett nestled his mouth into the curve of her neck. Kissing her with tiny pecks. Flicking his tongue over the pulsing vein. Whipping her into such a frenzy that she didn\u2019t notice his fingers inching up her thigh until his fingertips breached midpoint beneath her skirt.</p><p>When she tensed, he warned, \u201cDon\u2019t. Spread your legs.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she complied, Bennett stroked her slit, while his mouth kept up the relentless assault on her neck.</p><p>Ainsley shifted her hips, wanting more contact.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he warned sharply, nipping her skin in admonishment.</p><p>Hard to be still when her whole body vibrated. When she already dangled so close to the edge. Which was ridiculous because he\u2019d been touching her for like two minutes, tops. Over her panties.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing became choppier yet when Bennett\u2019s free hand cupped her breast. The sensations of his mouth and finger stroking her, almost in tandem, were too good, too much, too intense, too intimate. She needed to wiggle free and find her wits.</p><p>\u201cBe. Still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m too\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bennett sucked on that magic spot the same time he pinched her nipple hard. His thumb pressed against her clit and she detonated. Every pulse point in her body throbbed in time to the blood pulsing in her clit.</p><p>Ainsley lost herself then. Her mind became blessedly blank. When she raised her head, he withdrew his hand from under her skirt. He straightened her bra and blouse.</p><p>\u201cYou respond so well to me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re definitely a master at what you do.\u201d</p><p>A harsh look darkened Bennett\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t have a playbook. I\u2019m not thinking, if I stroke her pussy fourteen more times she\u2019ll cream on my hand.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley knew he\u2019d intentionally used crude language to drive home his point. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not what I meant. I meant you should have that designated Master title because...well, you are a master at this stuff. It\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p><p>When she looked at him, Bennett was gone. Seemed strange to think of him as two separate personalities, but he really did have a switch that turned Ben, the easygoing rancher, into Bennett, the intense Dom.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna lie. I want more of that with you. I\u2019ve been kicking this idea around all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you as my submissive.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t joking. She narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll never be a lifestyle submissive like Layla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019d never demand that of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you demand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime alone with you. Conditioning you to learn to let go. Showing you how satisfying it is to entrust me to give you what you need. Proving this is what you\u2019ve always wanted and who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know enough about this lifestyle to commit to anything long-term, Ben.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a considering look. \u201cHow about if you commit to it\u2014to me\u2014for one month?\u201d</p><p>That was a workable timeframe.</p><p>\u201cA month of you turning all control and decisions over to me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate spiked. \u201cI need to clarify that you mean all control and decisions...aside from my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intent of controlling your career, Ainsley. That\u2019s yours. Everything else would be mine. If you agree to this, we\u2019ll skip the club scene for the month. Especially since I know you\u2019ve no interest in adding exhibitionism or other players into the mix. No need to drive to Gillette when we both live in the same town, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d Ainsley twisted her fingers together. \u201cCan you give me a for instance on your \u2018all control and decisions\u2019 comment?\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cI set all the parameters when we\u2019re alone together. I\u2019m not looking to turn you into a slave to perform household chores, if that\u2019s what\u2019s put the wrinkle in your brow. I\u2019m only interested in your submissiveness on a sexual level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019d get no say in anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexually? No. If you can\u2019t agree to that, well, there\u2019s nothin\u2019 else to discuss. Because that\u2019s the basis of a Dom/sub agreement.\u201d</p><p>No surprise he\u2019d taken a firm stance. But was he offering her what she needed? Or taking what he wanted?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to make a decision on the spot tonight. I\u2019ll give you a day to think it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day is all?\u201d</p><p>Ben smirked. \u201cI can see if you agree to this you\u2019re gonna try and argue with me. And the key word in that sentence is try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that big, bad wolf bit very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of practice, but I guarantee I ain\u2019t all bark and no bite. I\u2019m lots of bite.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if it was too late for a drink.</p><p>He held out his hands to help her up from the couch. \u201cI know you\u2019ve had a long day and I figure you\u2019ll replay this discussion in that pretty head of yours long after you leave here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sending me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d He pushed her hair back from her face. Then the ragged pad of his thumb traced her bottom lip. \u201cI like seeing your mouth swollen from mine.\u201d</p><p>Talk about a punch of lust. At that moment Ainsley wanted to drag him to the floor and ride him until she was sweaty, sore and gasping for air.</p><p>Ben growled, \u201cGoddamn I love that fuck me now look in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you aren\u2019t going to act on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You need to make the decision about what\u2019ll happen between us, from your head, not your cunt. Because if I take you to my bed, I know which answer will win.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019d say you were overly confident, but I know you\u2019ve got the juice to back up that claim.\u201d</p><p>He held her arm to steady her as she slipped her heels on. He helped her put her coat on. He gave her a chaste kiss on the cheek after he walked her out to her car.</p><p>Ainsley buckled her seatbelt. When she turned, Ben was peering in her window. She rolled it down. \u201cDid you change your mind about trying to sway my decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I just wanted to say I had a great time with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear from you tomorrow? Either way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive safe, angel.\u201d He tapped the side of the car twice and stepped away.</p><p>On the way home she considered all that\u2019d been said. A couple of phrases kept tripping her up.</p><p>I\u2019m not a master. I\u2019m just a simple rancher.</p><p>Right. Bennett McKay was the most complex man she\u2019d ever met.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>What were the odds the first time Ben had lunch in town in months, he\u2019d run into Ainsley?</p><p>Pretty high, given a town the size of Sundance.</p><p>Since she was having lunch with the mayor, he didn\u2019t approach her. He took the first empty booth in Dewey\u2019s Delish Dish and positioned himself to observe her. She laughed more than he\u2019d expected. Whatever she\u2019d said cracked the mayor up several times.</p><p>He tore his gaze from her as Dalton and Tell slid into the opposite bench seat. \u201cIf it ain\u2019t Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. Didja order for us? We\u2019re starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve since you guys are always dragging ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot our fault this time,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cBrandt showed up late this mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d Tell inserted. \u201cIt puts us behind every damn day. Them two are gonna have to do something different than splitting their time between Jessie\u2019s place and Brandt\u2019s place. Every time they stay at Jessie\u2019s, he\u2019s late.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d bet Jessie is late the mornings she\u2019s gotta drive from Brandt\u2019s to her job at Sky Blue.\u201d Ben slid his menu to the edge of the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup on them getting one place together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney, probably. And Dad hasn\u2019t exactly been helpful.\u201d</p><p>Like that was news. His uncle was an asshole most days. \u201cWhat\u2019s Uncle Casper been doin\u2019 in his retirement? My Dad never says much about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe drinks until he passes out. We stop by to check on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make sure he ain\u2019t dead,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>The muscle in Tell\u2019s jaw flexed. \u201cMom would have a conniption fit if she saw the state of the house. It\u2019s nasty. Dad\u2019s been livin\u2019 like a drunken hermit since their divorce was finalized.\u201d</p><p>Dalton scowled. \u201cEven after all the shit Dad did to Jessie over the years, she still tried to help him. Cleaned the place top to bottom. Washed his clothes. Cooked for him. He\u2019s such an ungrateful bastard that Brandt won\u2019t let Jess go over there anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad you can\u2019t just move your dad\u2019s stuff to Brandt\u2019s trailer and then he and Jessie could have the house. It\u2019s at least fifteen minutes closer to her job.\u201d</p> <p>Tell and Dalton exchanged a pained look. \u201cWe think that\u2019s what they\u2019re waitin\u2019 for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting for Uncle Casper to die?\u201d Ben said sharply.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s killin\u2019 himself, Ben. He won\u2019t listen to any of us. Believe it or not, Mom had some influence over him, but that\u2019s gone. They haven\u2019t spoken since the day she left. There ain\u2019t a lot we can do.\u201d</p><p>Ben hated the huge rift his uncle had caused in the family, but it seemed wrong to write him off and let him drink himself to death.</p><p>A highly rude waitress took their order and as soon as she stomped away, Tell set his forehead on the table. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to her, bro?\u201d</p> <p>Tell raised his head. \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t date women from around here. She\u2019ll probably spit in my damn food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cHer name tag said Tara if you don\u2019t remember,\u201d Dalton offered.</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Dalton. It ain\u2019t like you don\u2019t have sex amnesia every so often.\u201d</p><p>Ben lifted a brow at Tell. \u201cSex amnesia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know. Where you have sex with a woman, good sex, memorable sex, but then you can\u2019t seem to recall her name.\u201d</p><p>His cousins stared at him when he didn\u2019t immediately respond. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, gentleman Ben. You remember the name of every woman you\u2019ve banged?\u201d</p> <p>They had him there. \u201cNot the ones from way back. But the ones from last month? Hell yeah.\u201d His gaze momentarily strayed to the back of Ainsley\u2019s head.</p><p>Tell gloated. \u201cSee, Dalton, I told you he wasn\u2019t a fuckin\u2019 monk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that don\u2019t mean he\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 man-whore like you are,\u201d Dalton shot back.</p><p>\u201cBoys. Play nice. So what\u2019s so all-fired important you asked me to come to town?\u201d He frowned. \u201cSince it was your idea, I ain\u2019t buying your lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheapskate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about Uncle Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe heard you took Rielle to the bank yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so?\u201d Then he remembered the conversation on Sunday about Rielle. \u201cChrist. I\u2019m not interested in her, okay? I was just bein\u2019 neighborly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t care about that,\u201d Tell said. \u201cWe wanna know why she was at the new bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does anyone go to the bank? She needs a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet they didn\u2019t give it to her, did they?\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say and I didn\u2019t ask. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve heard she\u2019s seriously financially fucked.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze turned sharp. \u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cEvidently she put up her land as collateral when she borrowed the money to build that bed and breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon to borrow against equity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe borrowed the maximum amount of the equity and hasn\u2019t made a single payment on it for over a year.\u201d</p><p>That shocked him. \u201cAre you fucking serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The bank has given her a lot of leeway, but unless she pays at least six months of the amount she\u2019s in arrears, in the next forty-five days, Settler\u2019s First will start foreclosure proceedings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Ben wasn\u2019t surprised Rielle hadn\u2019t shared that information; the Wetzlers always had a serious distrust about \u201cthe man\u201d and the McKay family. Plus, Rielle already felt guilty about not paying him for his handyman help. Or the new beds he\u2019d handcrafted. \u201cHer money troubles ain\u2019t common knowledge?\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find this out?\u201d</p><p>An unspoken communication passed between them. Then Dalton said, \u201cRory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory just told you this?\u201d</p><p>Dalton pushed his hat up an inch. \u201cRory didn\u2019t just blurt it out. I went to Laramie last weekend to hang out with my buddies and I saw Rory in the bar. She\u2019d just finished her shift and was takin\u2019 advantage of the employee discount by doin\u2019 a shit ton of shots. Some assholes were bothering her so I kept \u2019em away.\u201d He sighed. \u201cRory don\u2019t drink, so the booze hit her like a cattle truck. Then she started cryin\u2019 about how her mama used every penny they had to put her through college. And she\u2019d wanted to get a job after she graduated, but Rielle told her it was more important she finish grad school since it was basically free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Rory knew what the fuck she was even sayin\u2019. I couldn\u2019t leave her there, so her boss told me where Rory lived. I took her home.\u201d He scowled. \u201cShe tossed her cookies in my truck and on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like when you used to baby-sit her, huh?\u201d Tell teased.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell. I never babysat her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. You ran nekkid through the woods with her playing Tarzan and Jane. Or Adam and Eve. Or...doctor.\u201d</p><p>Dalton ignored him. \u201cSo when Rory called me the next day to apologize for barfing on me, I didn\u2019t mention she\u2019d been a freakin\u2019 blabbermouth. And if she did remember, I doubt she\u2019s gonna confess to Rielle that she told their financial sob story to a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I appreciate you tellin\u2019 me this, I gotta ask...why?\u201d</p><p>Tell leaned forward. \u201cThe way we see it, Rielle would probably rather sell the land, or part of it, than lose it entirely when it gets foreclosed on. So we\u2019re thinkin\u2019 we should approach her with a business proposition. We\u2019ll make the cash payments to catch her up on the bank loan to stave off the foreclosure\u2014if she\u2019ll divide up the back half of her land and sell it to us. That way it\u2019d be McKay land, from your place to ours, as it should\u2019ve been before my dad fucked it up all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>Ben gave them credit for quick thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted that creek front section. But they\u2019ve always refused to sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt don\u2019t look like Rielle\u2019s got an option now. The sale of that acreage will give her enough money to keep her bed and breakfast open if she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else have you talked to about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cNot even Brandt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause as much as we appreciate that Brandt\u2019s a hard worker, he\u2019s a damn do-gooder. He\u2019ll see even talkin\u2019 to Rielle as takin\u2019 advantage of her. We don\u2019t see it that way. We figured you wouldn\u2019t either. So, we\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t mention this to Quinn.\u201d</p><p>It clicked. \u201cQuinn would feel the same as Brandt.\u201d</p><p>Tell nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re practical, Ben. And to some extent, unsentimental, like us. It\u2019s just business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood business,\u201d Dalton inserted. \u201cIt has to be just the three of us, if we can swing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want Uncle Carson or Uncle Cal to get wind of this either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd buy it right out from under us? Fuck no. But it ain\u2019t like the purchase wouldn\u2019t benefit the entire McKay ranching operation. It\u2019d just give both our families a little more land, a little more pull, and maybe a little more respect. I mean, yeah, they\u2019re treating us better than they ever have, askin\u2019 for our input, increasing our shares, but sometimes we still feel like the poor relatives.\u201d</p><p>Again, Ben couldn\u2019t argue with their logic. \u201cDo you guys have the capital?\u201d Not wanting to admit he fell into the poor relative category, he added sharply, \u201cBecause I sure as hell ain\u2019t funding the whole thing.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure he could fund even a portion of it. He\u2019d have to hope like hell some of his furniture payments came through.</p><p>A fierce look entered Dalton\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean that to be insulting, cuz. Yeah, me\u2019n Tell are the youngest, but that don\u2019t make us the dumbest. We put up the lion\u2019s share of the down payment for that section we bought, more than Brandt. Dad don\u2019t even know that.\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cImpressive. You saved all that?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged another look. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you boys been up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Tell offered a shit-eating grin. \u201cWe\u2019ve become damn good poker players. We hit Deadwood for weekend tournaments. Blackhawk, Colorado, has decent-sized pots once a month. We made a shit ton of money playin\u2019 online before most them sites closed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in Vegas with you last December for the NFR?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rocked it at the poker tables. Played a little blackjack. I ended up fifteen grand ahead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seemed he wasn\u2019t the only one with a secret life. \u201cDoes Brandt know about any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He thinks we\u2019re man-whores, hittin\u2019 strip clubs all over hell when we\u2019re really playing poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the weekends I\u2019m working as a rodeo judge,\u201d Tell clarified. \u201cSo you see why we don\u2019t want him to know about this. Alls we want is a bigger piece of the pie and not to have to borrow money from one of the uncles to make improvements on our land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad didn\u2019t have a problem with that, but the rest of us did,\u201d Dalton said sourly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I would\u2019ve had a problem with that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t just show up on Rielle\u2019s doorstep and ask if what Rory said was true. It\u2019d be easier if someone Rielle knows and trusts, someone she owes neighborly favors to, would get the real scoop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? I\u2019m supposed to pop over and say, \u2018Hey, Ree, thanks for watching my dogs and for the zucchini bread and by the way, how much are you behind on your bank payments?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hoped you\u2019d use your no bullshit reputation to get the facts, and not act the part of an ass-kissing suck-up like the rest of our relatives.\u201d</p><p>Ben scrubbed his hand over his jaw. This had caught him off guard. \u201cLook. I appreciate your trust in me. I ain\u2019t gonna say nothin\u2019 to nobody, but I need time to chew it over. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But don\u2019t forget the ticking clock.\u201d</p><p>Tara delivered the food. She dropped Tell\u2019s hot beef sandwich almost from eye level. The cheeky bastard just grinned at her and said, \u201cThanks, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Conversation ceased as they ate.</p><p>Ben made a point not to stare at Ainsley, because his cousins would notice his distraction.</p><p>Then again, Tell and Dalton shoveled food like they\u2019d never seen it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to sit around and bullshit when there\u2019s work to finish.\u201d Dalton dropped a twenty on the table. \u201cLet us know if you find anything out.\u201d</p><p>As his cousins exited the restaurant, Ainsley and the mayor headed toward him. Ainsley kept her expression blank.</p><p>The mayor, Mark Gilbert, was effusive. \u201cBen McKay! I haven\u2019t seen you in town for a while. Did we tick you off or something?\u201d He thrust out his hand.</p><p>Ben shook it. \u201cNo, sir, Mr. Mayor. Just keeping myself busy on the ranch. Snuck into town to have lunch with my cousins.\u201d</p><p>Mark leaned in. \u201cWhat\u2019s with this Mr. Mayor bullshit? We\u2019ve known each other since elementary school.\u201d</p><p>Ben held Ainsley\u2019s gaze. \u201cJust wanted to show you the proper respect when you\u2019re havin\u2019 lunch with the president of Sundance\u2019s newest bank.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOf course you\u2019ve already met the lovely and capable Miz Hamilton. The McKays have a knack for knowing when a beautiful new woman arrives in town and mercilessly working her with those cowboy charms.\u201d</p><p>Slathering on the flattery for Ainsley while taking a small shot at him? Mayor Mark didn\u2019t miss a trick.</p> <p>Ben offered Ainsley his hand. \u201cGood to see you again, Miz Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAinsley and I were just discussing ideas for the next community event. We\u2019re hoping to have something big to welcome National West Bank to our community. You have any thoughts?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear your input. I\u2019ve heard your family is a big part of this community and has been for over one hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the risk of bein\u2019 accused of nepotism, I\u2019d suggest a community celebration to honor my brother Chase\u2019s accomplishments this past year. He might not be headed to the PBR World Finals, but he\u2019s done an outstanding job starting his own advocacy group for mandatory safety helmets in bull riding. The mayor knows any time Chase comes back to town there\u2019s always people interested in hearing him talk. Now that he\u2019s gone and married himself a genuine movie star?\u201d Ben grinned. \u201cThis community event could have worldwide attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an excellent suggestion, Ben.\u201d Mark said. \u201cWould Chase be interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ask him. If he is you\u2019ll have to get in touch with his PR people to finalize the details. I only see one problem with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKays have always been customers at Settler\u2019s First Bank. I reckon they won\u2019t take too kindly to a celebration for Chase McKay bein\u2019 sponsored by a competing bank.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Ainsley looked impressed...and a little peeved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we could work something out.\u201d Mark glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve got a meeting. Could I drop you off at the bank, Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll walk back. I\u2019d like to talk a little more in depth with Mr. McKay about his ideas.\u201d She winked at Mark. \u201cMaybe try to sweet talk him into hearing my National West Bank pitch about all the services we offer our new customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea. Enjoy.\u201d He hustled out the door.</p><p>Ben gestured to the booth. \u201cCould I interest you in a slice of pie or a cup of coffee while I hear how well you can service me?\u201d</p><p>Her stern look vanished into a reluctant smile. \u201cMy God. You are unbelievable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to tell you.\u201d</p><p>After receiving their coffee, Ben had his first doubt Ainsley would agree to his proposition. She spent a considerable amount of time stirring sweetener into her cup, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced up. \u201cJust trying to grasp how the man who groaned when I talked about community responsibility last night came up with a brilliant idea for my community event that cuts my part out of it entirely.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not worried. I\u2019m sure you and Settler\u2019s First can come to an agreement that benefits both of you equally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill our agreement benefit us both equally?\u201d</p><p>So she didn\u2019t intend to skirt the issue. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk about this now?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley looked around the restaurant, almost comically, before she lowered her voice to a near whisper. \u201cActually, yes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll be able to think clearly when you\u2019re not touching me.\u201d</p><p>Ben smiled unrepentantly. \u201cWords can be just as powerful as a touch.\u201d</p><p>She challenged him with an arch look.</p><p>He also dropped his voice. \u201cDid you imagine yourself havin\u2019 sex with Mayor Mark? I\u2019ll admit I imagined you in bed with him.\u201d</p><p>That threw her off. \u201cWhy on earth would you imagine that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I saw how he looked at you, and, angel, Mark was definitely imagining you in his bed.\u201d</p><p>Her response might\u2019ve been, \u201cOh please,\u201d but she really meant, Go on.</p><p>\u201cThis is how I imagined it. He\u2019d probably undress you slowly. Kiss you, run his hands down your chest. Keep all touches gentle and exploratory. When you give him the signal to move on, maybe by releasing a little moan, that\u2019s when he\u2019ll put his mouth on your skin. Starting with your nipples. He\u2019ll spend way more time licking and sucking on them than even you\u2019d like. He\u2019ll kiss straight down your belly and you\u2019ll feel that tingle of anticipation. Wondering if he\u2019ll put his mouth on your pussy and get you off first. Or if he\u2019ll just tease you. Push you to the edge and then slip on a condom to take you the rest of the way. I\u2019d bet he\u2019s more of a teaser, more an equal opportunity man. If you go down on him, he\u2019ll go down on you.</p><p>\u201cWhen he deems you ready for his cock, he\u2019ll gently ease inside you, looking in your eyes. He\u2019ll keep up a steady pace, asking you the entire time if it\u2019s okay. He\u2019ll try to remember to kiss you as the momentum builds and he fucks you faster. You won\u2019t demand he slow down and see to your needs before his. You decide you\u2019ll let it slide this first time. After he comes, he\u2019ll pant in your ear how good it was. You\u2019ll tell yourself it was okay. Even if you don\u2019t believe it. Even if you have a sense that something was missing.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley stared at him. \u201cAnd there\u2019s something wrong with that scenario?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, goddammit, there is, because that\u2019s not what you want. That\u2019s the type of sexual encounter you\u2019ve had your whole life.\u201d</p><p>Her haughty look vanished.</p><p>\u201cNow imagine having sex with me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s not that civilized with me. Sex with me is raw, dirty and demanding, but you\u2019ll never feel there\u2019s something missing because I will see to your needs above my own. Every. Single. Time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re more of a giver than a taker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I take plenty. But never at your expense.\u201d</p><p>She softly said, \u201cThen my answer is yes. One month.\u201d</p><p>Relief flowed through him.</p><p>Ainsley scooted from the booth and Ben followed her outside. He admired how respectable she looked in a form-fitting gold-colored business suit, and he couldn\u2019t wait to thoroughly muss her up. \u201cBe at my place right after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is strictly clandestine between us?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo public outings in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll spend all of our time together naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bet the bank on that.\u201d Ben tipped his hat and strode away.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Ben hated putting his dogs outside. But if he wanted to use all the rooms in his house with Ainsley, curious sniffing dogs would put a damper on that real fast.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a pacing kind of guy, but he beat a path from his kitchen to the bar, through the game room, to his bedroom and back to the living room. He rarely had a case of nerves, but he definitely was feeling them tonight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Way to act like a confident Dom.</p><p>Finally, Ainsley knocked on the door.</p><p>Gone was the bank executive. She\u2019d dressed in a long-sleeved T-shirt the color of summer grass, jeans and puffy, down-filled vest. She wasn\u2019t carrying an overnight bag.</p> <p>\u201cHey. Come in. Did you eat?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley shook her head. \u201cNervous stomach. I wasn\u2019t sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d make you strip the instant you walked in and we\u2019d go at it in the foyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, yes.\u201d</p><p>Ben took her hands in his. \u201cAinsley. I wanna get to know you. All sides of you. Not just how you respond to me when you\u2019re nekkid and trussed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerformance anxiety.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, naturally. \u201cI doubt you\u2019ve ever suffered from that in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always that first time. Now, I\u2019ve gotta make an embarrassing confession.\u201d Ben hung his head. \u201cI\u2019m addicted to Wheel of Fortune. Most nights I eat supper in front of the TV so I can get my fix.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that changes things between us dramatically. Because I\u2019m more of a Jeopardy fan myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have way more brain power than me, smart girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re just a simple rancher, right?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cYep. So how about if I fix us a bowl of popcorn and you can snicker at me as I try to guess the puzzles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. You need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do you think I\u2019ll burn it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just want to make sure you pour extra butter on mine.\u201d She stood on tiptoe and kissed him. \u201cIf your goal is to keep me off balance, it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>They settled in front of the TV. Ben thought you could learn a lot about a person by how they ate popcorn. The quiet munchers? Reserved in life. Loud crunchers? Enjoyed everything with gusto. Eating a single kernel at a time? Very methodical. Piling on extra butter, extra salt and extra seasoning? A hedonistic bent. So it\u2019d pleased him to watch Ainsley pour butter and sprinkle all sorts of seasonings on her popcorn.</p> <p>She bumped him with her shoulder. \u201cHave you figured out this phrase yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a chicken wing and a prayer.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI hate the pun ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they all puns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Heh. Look. He went bankrupt anyway. That sucks.\u201d</p><p>During the next commercial, he casually asked, \u201cAre we usin\u2019 condoms?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cI guess. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hoped you were on the pill. But no biggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m comfortable having sex without a condom, with a man who frequents a sex club. No offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. I\u2019ll just mention I got a clean bill of health three months ago and I could show you the paperwork. Twice yearly testing is mandatory for club members. I\u2019ve always worn a condom. No exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when you...play like this, outside the club?\u201d</p><p>Ben faced her, but she was busy rooting around in her bowl. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She peeked at him from beneath her lashes.</p><p>\u201cIn the years I\u2019ve belonged to the Rawhide I\u2019ve seen a woman outside the club only a few times. But I\u2019ve never done this\u2014asked a woman to be my submissive for a month outside the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about inside the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been expecting that answer. \u201cDo you have normal relationships? I mean, date normal women who don\u2019t know about you being involved in the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ignore your use of the word normal because of your lack of experience. I used to date. Then my buddy Cody took me to a club in Denver and it changed my life. I no longer felt like a deviant for what I wanted from my partners. I no longer had to pretend my needs were conventional.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley blushed.</p><p>\u201cEvery once in a while I\u2019ll meet a woman outside the club and ask her out. But if I can\u2019t be myself, why waste my time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the longest you\u2019ve dated a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably...a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you insisted on a month with me?\u201d</p><p>Astute woman. It\u2019d just seemed like an arbitrary amount of time. \u201cNo. As a newbie sub, you oughta know in thirty days whether you\u2019re cut out to be submissive, even just behind bedroom doors.\u201d He gave her a buttery, salty, smacking kiss. \u201cQuit distracting me from Vanna, woman.\u201d</p><p>Ben solved the next puzzle. They bantered back and forth. But when the game show ended, he sensed Ainsley\u2019s anxiety. He set aside her empty popcorn bowl. \u201cSit on my lap facing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll make your crotch go numb? I\u2019m not exactly a petite woman, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat myself.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley threw her leg over his and straddled his thighs. \u201cI guess Bennett the beastly Dom is back.\u201d</p><p>He curled his hand around her neck and took her mouth in a heated kiss. No easing into it, just sucking in her surprise like a drug. Holding her in place while he controlled the kiss. Keeping it red-hot until she could scarcely sit still. He backed off the intensity, sliding his mouth to her ear. \u201cGo into my bedroom and get undressed. Then lay facedown on the bed.\u201d</p><p>She immediately tensed up.</p><p>Ben waited for her to ask why, or what he had in mind.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He heard her swallow. \u201cWhich room is your bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room with the four-poster log bed.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her eyes averted, she climbed off him and disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>He flipped through channels for five minutes before he followed her. He paused in the doorway, his eyes drinking her in. Ainsley\u2019s body was an abundance of curves, just exactly the body type he liked best.</p><p>After shucking his jeans and shirt, he grabbed a necktie, a condom and a bottle of lube from his dresser. From beside the bed, he ordered, \u201cSpread your arms out.\u201d Then he straddled her, his knees bracketing her thighs. His cock stirred when his balls brushed the soft curves of her ass. Ben placed a kiss on the back of her head, inhaling the subtle scent of her shampoo. \u201cDo you have any idea how fucking sexy you look?\u201d</p><p>He dug his thumbs into the base of her neck and gradually moved across the tops of her shoulders, using a combination of soft and harder pressure. Letting himself enjoy her supple flesh beneath his hands. Goose bumps rippled across her back every time the rougher skin on his hands glided across her. He kneaded her biceps and triceps. He nestled a kiss in the bend of each elbow before massaging her forearms and hands. When he reversed course and dragged his palms over her arms, Ainsley didn\u2019t utter a peep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet,\u201d he remarked as his thumbs followed the line of her spine.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was allowed to speak.\u201d</p><p>Ben stilled. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause those are the Dom\u2019s rules in books I\u2019ve read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat books?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones that deal with...BDSM.\u201d</p><p>To some extent, he hated the way the term BDSM was thrown around as much as he disliked the casual use of the word Master.</p><p>\u201cHave you read any of those books?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFiction? Or nonfiction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonfiction. When we first went to the Denver club. One of the owners saw that we were clueless bastards and took pity on us. He gave us a stack of material to read so we knew the differences between what we wanted as dominants and what was expected in certain Dom/sub relationships. And I\u2019ll admit, even from the start, I\u2019ve been on the side of the fence where dominance is used as a sexual tool to heighten sexual experiences. I\u2019m not into debasing a sub by using a cage or a pallet to sleep on or a shock collar. Or extreme pain games. Never been tempted by bloodsport or knife play or piss play or even breath play. If I knew subs who were into that stuff, I\u2019d avoid them. But I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s practically nonexistent at the Rawhide anyway.\u201d He rubbed a spot at the base of her neck. \u201cSo the subs don\u2019t speak because they\u2019re gagged or something in these books?\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo. A sub isn\u2019t supposed to speak unless asked a direct question by her dominant. And in scenes, the sub isn\u2019t supposed to cry out in pain or in pleasure unless the Dom permits her to.\u201d</p><p>Ben tamped down his temper. \u201cHave I ever said you can\u2019t talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I\u2019ll ever forbid you from speakin\u2019 your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might take issue if you argue with me about something I tell you to do, but I don\u2019t expect monk-like silence from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a scene,\u201d he said testily.</p><p>She lifted up and looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Christ. I\u2019m giving you a massage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I giving you a massage? Because I wanted to put my hands all over you. And you acted nervous. I thought it\u2019d calm you down.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley continued to stare at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou confuse me, Bennett. This confuses me. The variances in the different types of Dom/sub relationships...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there are no rules for us besides the ones I set\u2014with your input. I suspect this will be a learn as we go thing for both of us.\u201d He lightly slapped her ass. \u201cFace back on the mattress, so I can finish.\u201d</p><p>From that point on, Ainsley was vocal.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me more about these BDSM books you read. What things you read in them that turned you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more interested in what I didn\u2019t like than what I did?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty confident I can figure out what you like.\u201d He pressed his thumbs onto a knot beside her right shoulder blade.</p><p>\u201cOh. I like that. You hit it. Right. On. The. Money.\u201d Another sexy moan of delight. \u201cYou have magic hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me one sex fantasy that ain\u2019t in a book.\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>He stopped the massage. \u201cTell me or no more magic fingers.\u201d</p><p>She groaned and said, \u201cFine, I have a stranger fantasy. It\u2019s dark. I wake up and notice him in the shadows. I\u2019m freaked out and then he starts saying all these sexy things. How he\u2019s whacked off imagining how it\u2019d be to touch me. How he knows what I sound like when I climax because he\u2019s watched me touching myself. He does all sorts of sexy, naughty things to me and then he just leaves and I never knew who he was.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed her temple \u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate for you to think I\u2019m the boring banker type with no imagination.\u201d</p> <p>His chuckle vibrated against her neck. \u201cThe last damn thing you are is boring. So tell me more about these books. Specifically what you don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the master and slave mentality of the BDSM relationships. Where the subs are always expected to kneel at the Dom\u2019s feet. Or when they have to keep their heads lowered and eyes averted, not only for their Dom but also for all other Doms, in a club situation. I don\u2019t like how the subs are supposed to walk three steps behind their Doms. I really didn\u2019t like the leash and collar thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you disappointed that you didn\u2019t see any of that goin\u2019 on in the Rawhide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty long list of dislikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just getting started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley jerked up. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve told you my fantasy and dislikes, will you use them against me?\u201d</p><p>Ben pushed her back down. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m a little tired of you jumping to the worst conclusion when it comes to me and who I am as your dominant. I get that you wanna know ahead of time everything I have planned for you, Ainsley, but guess what? It ain\u2019t happening.\u201d He grabbed the tie and said, \u201cArms behind your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d As soon as her arms were in place, he tied her wrists together. He spread her legs and slicked up his fingers with the lube. \u201cAngle your hips so I can reach your pussy.\u201d</p><p>She had to push up on her knees, and she didn\u2019t look comfortable, but she didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Ben\u2019s fingers traced her slit. \u201cA massage makes you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you give me one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA total suck-up answer.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley moaned when he slipped a finger inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to concentrate on my voice and listen to what I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels so good. What if I can\u2019t concentrate?\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t stop stroking her wet folds as he spoke. \u201cThen you\u2019ll learn the difference between punishment and discipline pretty damn quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this punishment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He swept his thumb over her clit. \u201cThis is discipline.\u201d He brushed his lips below her earlobe. \u201cDon\u2019t come. No matter what I do, you don\u2019t get to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not up for discussion. You will not come. Not now, not at your house. Your orgasms belong to me. They\u2019re my responsibility. You don\u2019t control them anymore. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Ben pushed two fingers inside her and stroked her G-spot, while gently strumming her clit. \u201cSay yes, Bennett, I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Bennett, I understand.\u201d</p><p>He teased, tortured and tormented her. Taking her to the edge several times, seeing if she\u2019d disobey and throw herself over. He skimmed her jawline with light kisses. \u201cHow close are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. God.\u201d</p><p>Ben flipped her onto her back and started kissing down the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Please.\u201d Ainsley twisted her head away.</p><p>Which caused Ben to grab her hair and pull slightly. \u201cStay. Still.\u201d</p><p>She whimpered softly.</p><p>\u201cI adore your body, angel.\u201d Ben kissed the hollow of her throat. The tops of her breasts. \u201cI intend to play with it, however I want, for as long as I want. Testing your limits and mine.\u201d He kept finger fucking her, studying her reactions, from the anxious expression on her face, to the hard tips of her nipples, to the flexing of her toes and the clenching of her jaw. When he heard that swift intake of breath, he removed his hand from between her thighs.</p><p>Her entire body drooped against the mattress, but she wasn\u2019t relaxed.</p><p>\u201cYou did good.\u201d Ben turned her on her side so they faced each other. She sighed as he continued to intersperse tender kisses with languorous caresses. \u201cYou ready to talk?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley slowly opened her eyes. \u201cTalk? Aren\u2019t we going to...\u201d Her gaze dropped to his crotch and the outline of his fully erect dick.</p><p>\u201cFuck? Make love? Have wild sex? Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me your hard limit. One thing that\u2019s an absolute no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You won\u2019t know if other things on your very long dislike list would actually be a like unless you try it. Fair warning: I\u2019ve only got a month with you, so I wanna give you a taste of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything but your one thing. So what\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cYou using one of those scary bullwhip or snake whips on me is an absolute no.\u201d</p><p>Damn. No single tail. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just accept that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because you only get one. Everything else is a possibility.\u201d Ben smooched the frown between her eyebrows. \u201cTell me something you\u2019ve never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d He traced her cheekbone with his knuckles. \u201cBig secret, little annoyance. Give me a piece of yourself you\u2019ve never shared with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She focused on his chest and those tiny furrowed lines appeared on her forehead. \u201cI had lasik surgery on both my eyes four years ago. People knew about it because I\u2019d been wearing glasses for twenty-two years, but I never told anyone why I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought losing the glasses would make me more attractive to my husband. Obviously it didn\u2019t work. He just bitched about the price of the surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you happy with your decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I felt younger, freer. I liked the change.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed the corners of her eyes. \u201cYou should. I\u2019m guessing it was the first of many changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. It is. Same question back at you, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Not Bennett. Interesting. He didn\u2019t answer, just kept touching her how he pleased.</p><p>\u201cYou constantly harp about honesty. You expect mine but don\u2019t offer yours? That\u2019s crap. Sir.\u201d</p><p>He held back a Dom-like retort. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me something you\u2019ve never told anyone.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Ben knew he\u2019d have to up the stakes. Ainsley had given him what he\u2019d asked for, but her answer wasn\u2019t anything really personal. Or if that was her idea of exposing an unseen part of herself, he\u2019d need to convince her to mine deeper. She was still far too guarded with him, and he needed to break that first barrier. Show his vulnerability on a level that made him slightly uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI ran away from home when I was eight. I remember feeling ignored, invisible, that no one would care if I just left. I had these visions of my mom and dad frantically searching for me. They were screaming my name, regretting their treatment of me, while my brothers cried. So I took off early one mornin\u2019, making sure I didn\u2019t go to any of my favorite spots. I waited for them to come find me. But no one ever did. I spent the night by myself. Alone. Every fear realized. Around dawn, a solid day after I\u2019d left, I snuck into my bed. Nothing had changed for them, but it seemed everything had changed for me. I\u2019ve always felt that day cemented my place in the family. The middle child but in last place.\u201d</p><p>A beat passed and warm lips connected with his. Ainsley kissed him with the perfect mix of fire and sweetness. When she angled her head to take the kiss deeper, Ben realized her cheeks were wet.</p><p>His brain did a victory dance. Although he never wanted any woman to see him as the forgotten boy in Dom\u2019s clothes, he was humbled and touched by her honest tears. And he knew the next time he asked her to share something emotionally personal, she\u2019d be less hesitant. \u201cLet\u2019s get you untied,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Ben checked her circulation, falling back into Dom mode. He remained stretched out on the bed as she put her clothes back on, not caring if his staring made her uncomfortable. She\u2019d said as much. His response? \u201cTough.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d kept her flustered, rebuilding that passion between them as he herded her back to the living room. Kissing her. Biting on her neck. Stroking her nipples through her clothing. Then he helped her on with her coat. \u201cRemember. You don\u2019t get to come. And if you do get yourself off? I\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are a bad liar. Don\u2019t push me on this, Ainsley.\u201d He bestowed one last, hot kiss. \u201cSee you tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Since Ben intended to keep her off balance, Ainsley decided she\u2019d do the same to him. Accepting her submissive side didn\u2019t mean she had to be malleable or predictable. She could be a temptress. She could feed the soul of the dominant man. And she could damn well cook him dinner too. They both had to eat.</p><p>She arrived at his house, bearing a Crock-Pot filled with a pork roast and potatoes. His rowdy dogs nearly jostled it out of her hands as she waited for him to answer her knock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh my Lord. She watched Ben approach through the glass-paned front door, wearing a towel and a scowl. A tiny shiver worked free. She never wanted that displeased look aimed at her. Luckily his glower was focused on his unruly dogs.</p><p>Maybe he wouldn\u2019t notice the drool dripping from her chin at seeing him nearly nude.</p><p>When he opened the door a crack, the dogs clambered to get inside. He snapped, \u201cSit.\u201d The dogs sat. \u201cStay.\u201d They whimpered. And stayed. Wagged their tails to get their master\u2019s attention. He opened the door for Ainsley. Once she was inside, he said, \u201cTake off,\u201d to the dogs and they slunk away. He finally looked at her, then at the Crock-Pot she held. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDinner. You made me dinner the other night, I\u2019m returning the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmells good. You can plug it in by the coffeepot.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley felt his eyes on her as she fussed with the temperature and the lid. When she turned around, Bennett wore the Dom face.</p><p>\u201cSupper will keep for a while?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here?\u201d</p><p>That one brow lifted as if to say, You challenging me, sub? and she stripped without another word.</p><p>He directed her through his bedroom to his bathroom. The rectangular shower had a clear glass door. The back walls and floor were comprised of dark gray tiles. Half a dozen nozzles were placed at different intervals on the side wall, and an enormous showerhead was centered in the middle of the ceiling. In the back corner was a built-in seat and another smaller handheld showerhead on the opposite wall. She\u2019d take a gorgeous space like this over a sunken tub any day.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just in time to help me get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley had a moment of panic. She wasn\u2019t one of those women who looked sleek and sexy under the spray of water. Her hair frizzed the instant a drop of humidity touched it. Plus, she wasn\u2019t wearing waterproof mascara. So she\u2019d resemble a fat, fuzzed-out rat with raccoon eyes. Yeah. There was an image to turn him on.</p> <p>Bennett motioned her inside the enclosure and settled her against the far wall. The tile chilled her back. He turned on the water and stood beneath the spray, facing her. \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>Like she could take her eyes off his beautiful form. Long and lean, ripped arms, narrow torso, strong legs\u2014his every muscle looked carved from granite. He wet a washcloth and soaped up, filling the humid space with a piney scent. Briskly rubbing the sudsy cloth over his arms, his neck and shoulders. Across his pecs and abdomen to his crotch. Over his fully erect cock. Between his legs, down to his ankles, feet and toes. He tossed the cloth aside and squirted shampoo into his palm. Closing his eyes, he scrubbed his head, turning away to rinse.</p><p>The rear view was as impressive as his front. Powerful shoulders and back. Firm buttocks so perfectly round and hard her teeth ached to take a bite.</p><p>He shut the water off, but steam still hissed from a pipe low to the floor, keeping the space warm. Bennett said, \u201cFace the wall.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d moved in behind her. His mouth latched onto her nape. \u201cDid you touch yourself last night after you left here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you touch yourself this mornin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how did you feel today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchy. Edgy. Needy.\u201d</p><p>His hot breath burned her ear. \u201cThat\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to feel. Last night was about putting you at ease. Tonight is about you proving to me that you\u2019re ready for this.\u201d</p><p>She squared her shoulders. \u201cI am ready.\u201d</p><p>Sweet, lazy kisses morphed into tiny nips on the fleshy slope of her shoulder. She shivered. Bit her lip against a moan.</p><p>He zigzagged his tongue along her spine to the tops of her buttocks and placed a sucking kiss in the middle of each cheek. \u201cGet on your knees.\u201d</p><p>Again she felt that flip in her belly. That spike of heat in her pulse. That deep throb in her sex. As she got into position, Bennett perched on the edge of the bench seat, his feet planted wide on the tile floor.</p><p>She dropped to her knees, allowing her hands to rest on her lap.</p><p>\u201cAngel, you are a quick study.\u201d</p><p>His compliment stirred an odd sense of pride inside her.</p><p>\u201cTouch your nipples.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley pressed her palms over her breasts. Squeezing the fleshy globes, she began to rub the centers of her palms over her nipples in small circles.</p><p>Her gaze flew to his when two strong hands enclosed her wrists, stopping the motion.</p><p>Bennett brought her right palm to his mouth and thoroughly bathed it with his tongue. Then her left palm. Then he placed them back on her nipples.</p><p>The wetness from his mouth coupled with the heat in his eyes tightened the tips further. She rubbed faster. Need radiated from her breasts down her belly to gather between her thighs. She was hyperaware of the incremental changes in her own body as she became aroused. She hadn\u2019t taken the time to absorb those changes in the past. She\u2019d been was too busy racing toward the orgasm finish line.</p><p>\u201cPinch them,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>It was almost a relief to add more pressure.</p><p>\u201cHarder. I wanna hear you gasp like that again. You can take a little more pain.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley half-expected he\u2019d reach out and show her what he wanted, but he didn\u2019t. He expected her to follow his directions. Using just the tips of her thumbs and forefingers, she pulled her nipples and squeezed. A hot line of pain made her gasp.</p><p>A brawny hand cupped the back of her neck, bringing her head forward. She opened her eyes as the head of Bennett\u2019s cock touched her mouth.</p><p>He painted her lips with the wet tip. \u201cRelax your jaw. See how deep you can take me on the first try.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her to open her mouth fully; he just pushed past her lips.</p><p>She sucked when the thick cockhead rested on her tongue, wanting that first wholly male taste of him. She sucked again, harder, attempting to pull more of his shaft into her mouth, letting her tongue explore the sensitive underside.</p><p>Bennett\u2019s hand curled around her jaw. \u201cAs much as I love those fuckin\u2019 sexy little moans you\u2019re making, you don\u2019t get to direct this.\u201d</p><p>Chastised, she peered up at him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn I like the defiant look you\u2019re wearing right now. Like you expect me not to have enough willpower to stop you.\u201d He shoved his cock further into her mouth, kicking in her gag reflex. \u201cWrong. I have more control than you know.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes watered as she fought the urge to dislodge the hardness filling her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBreathe.\u201d His thumb stroked her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna take some practice for you to take me all the way.\u201d His blue eyes glittered with lust. \u201cI\u2019m a patient man, but I can\u2019t wait to have your breath on my belly as my cock is buried so deep in your throat I can feel your heartbeat.\u201d</p><p>That dirty play-by-play absolutely drenched her. Ainsley so wanted to squeeze her legs together to spread that hot slickness between her thighs. Physical proof she was really here and this wasn\u2019t just another fantasy.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she broke a rule; she just stretched the boundary a bit when she curled her hands around his knees and let her palms slide up his muscular legs until they reached his hips.</p><p>Bennett softly snarled at her. \u201cJust for that, you don\u2019t get to use your hands on my cock. Only this wicked mouth.\u201d He pulled out and stroked back in, each time coming closer to the back of her throat.</p><p>She closed her eyes, wanting so much to make this good for him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swallow until I tell you to,\u201d he warned. \u201cI wanna see liquid running outta your mouth, making your neck wet.\u201d</p><p>Every time she settled into the rhythm, Bennett mixed it up. Thrusting faster if he was going slow. Slowing down if he\u2019d been using short, quick jabs. Proving to her that he had all the control.</p><p>She loved every second of it. His hand gripping the back of her neck. The hardness of his cock on her tongue, hitting the roof of her mouth, rubbing the inside of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cPlay with my balls,\u201d he rasped, \u201cbut only my balls.\u201d</p><p>The globes were already drawn up when her fingers brushed the seam between them. She rolled the balls on her palm. Her middle finger slid back to tickle his perineum with every upstroke of her mouth.</p><p>His thrusts all became short and fast.</p><p>Ainsley heard that swift intake of breath. The head rested on her tongue. His guttural, \u201cSuck hard now,\u201d was her only warning before hot ejaculate spurted in her mouth. \u201cSwallow. All of it.\u201d</p><p>She hollowed her cheeks and sucked, moving her tongue back and forth beneath the sweet spot as she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cSo. Fucking. Good. Christ.\u201d</p><p>There was an endorsement of her oral skills. But she didn\u2019t let up even to allow a small, cocky smile.</p><p>He slowly pulled out, using the hand holding the back of her neck to tip her head back.</p><p>Ainsley licked her smooth lips and met his gaze. Sated, yes. But something else lingered there. Something primal.</p><p>Bennett trailed his finger from the tip of her chin, down through the wetness coating her throat. \u201cBeautiful. Look at you. So fucking beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She blushed. No man ever said anything like that to her. Even while part of her did the cha-cha that she\u2019d pleased him, she wondered if his compliments were simply because she\u2019d just blown him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat skeptical look. You frowned at me.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She did have a crap poker face. \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. But I know what\u2019ll fix that. Stand.\u201d</p><p>Her knees were wobbly. Bennett held onto her hips and nestled his face into her cleavage. Then he kissed the upper and lower swells of both her breasts before sucking on her nipples. Sucking with lazy intent. Showing her that the sucking was all about his enjoyment of her body, not hers. Which made his attentions that much more enjoyable.</p><p>He tipped his head back and looked at her when she sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick this up later. Meantime, feel free to use my robe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get dressed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up and you\u2019ll be eatin\u2019 supper nekkid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour robe will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and tossed her a towel. \u201cThought you might say that.\u201d</p><p>After supper they watched the DVR\u2019d episode of Wheel of Fortune and snuggled up on the couch.</p><p>Ben liked having Ainsley close. Their legs side by side on the ottoman. Her head resting on his shoulder. Her hand on his chest. His fingers trailing up and down her arm. Touching her without restriction as a Dom was one thing. But touching her like this? Almost absentmindedly just because he could? That gave him a sense of satisfaction on a different level.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t talk much about ranching.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much to say. I get up, I do it, I come home, go to bed and repeat the next day. Pretty much the same day in, day out. Except for when we\u2019re calving or haying.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley drew circles on his pec. \u201cDo you get bored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to get bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me one thing you did today that was out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>He smiled because she\u2019d tried to wrest control. Instead of waiting for him to question her about something personal, like he had last night, she\u2019d tried to get the jump on him by keeping her question innocuous. \u201cI got an awesome blowjob in the shower.\u201d</p><p>She poked his sternum. \u201cBesides that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had a beautiful lady bring me supper.\u201d</p><p>Three more pokes. \u201cCome on. Tell me something.\u201d</p><p>Ben tried to remember what the hell he had done today. \u201cHow about while I\u2019m thinking on that you tell me something out of the ordinary you did today.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then she sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo banking is as boring as ranching?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cAt least it was today. Tomorrow I\u2019m hoping for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bank heist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite your tongue, Ben McKay.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cWell, tomorrow afternoon I\u2019ll be doin\u2019 something out of the ordinary. I\u2019m taking my folks to the Rapid City airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhoenix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn vacation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf sorts. They\u2019re mostly goin\u2019 to see my brother Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley tilted her head to look at him. \u201cI remember you talking about your older brother, Quinn, and your younger brother Chase, but not about Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Gavin is...let\u2019s just say Gavin recently came into our family.\u201d Ben laid out the situation. \u201cLong story short, we\u2019re still tryin\u2019 to figure it out. On the spur of the moment Gavin invited Mom and Dad to Arizona. So I won\u2019t be around tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Did it make him a bastard for being happy to hear disappointment in her voice? \u201cWhich is why you\u2019re spending the weekend here starting Friday night.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cI am? I don\u2019t remember agreeing to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that wasn\u2019t a request.\u201d Well, it was, but he didn\u2019t want to risk she\u2019d say no.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Should I bring anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour collection of vibrators.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks pinked. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me at the club, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not something I usually share.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed her nose. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing a lot, though, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of us more than others,\u201d she snipped.</p><p>That stopped him. \u201cYou think I\u2019m holding back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re holding back, cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout how you became Master Bennett.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMaster. I hate that fuckin\u2019 term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her smirk faded beneath his scrutiny. \u201cYou\u2019ve grilled me about why I believed I was a Domme. You\u2019re determined to prove I\u2019m submissive, but you\u2019ve never explained how you became interested in this lifestyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d buy the explanation of pure dumb luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d</p><p>He settled back in the cushions. Had he ever explained this to anyone? \u201cAbout eight years ago, me, Cody, Trace and Trent were drinking at the Rawhide Bar after closing time. Bullshitting about jobs and women. Complaining about not getting laid enough. Them guys were coming up with sure-fire strategies to get laid and what kind of women they were goin\u2019 after. When the conversation rolled to me and what I wanted from a woman, I told \u2019em I wanted a woman who\u2019d give me total sexual control, without question or hesitation.\u201d</p><p>Ben still remembered that panicked feeling after confessing the truth to his closest friends. His worry something was wrong with him, even when he\u2019d been too chicken to act on the erotic and exotic images constantly playing out in his head. Was he a deviant? A psychopath? A sociopath? Would it be enough if he fulfilled his binding, spanking and fucking fantasy, where his partner screamed and creamed from sexual pleasure? Or would he move on to a violent and twisted scenario? Because from what he could tell, his ideas were very twisted. Nice men didn\u2019t fantasize about hitting women with whips and canes. Nice men didn\u2019t fantasize about tying women up. Nice men didn\u2019t fantasize about doing all of that to women while fucking them like an animal.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cSorry. Just thinkin\u2019. Come to find out Cody, Trace, Trent and me were all on the same wavelength. We found a couple of clubs in Denver that catered to what we wanted. Bein\u2019 in those places lifted a huge burden off me. I wasn\u2019t a total freak. Or a bad man. There was a name for what I liked. For what I was. And a place where I could go to explore all aspects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLabels are important to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been labeled\u2014Charlie McKay\u2019s middle boy, the one between Quinn and Chase. But I didn\u2019t think, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll join a kinky sex club to set myself apart\u2019. As relieved as I was to find out who I was, I didn\u2019t want anyone in my family to know what I was up to. I still don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo began the secret life of Bennett McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long way to drive, but we did it regularly for a couple years. Then Cody and Trace kicked around the idea of starting a similar, private club in Gillette. After they remodeled the old brothel space, we brought Murphy up from Denver to run it. We\u2019d met Sully in Denver and found out he lived in Gillette. He brought in Riley. Riley brought in Gil. Gil brought in Bryce. All guys who either had Dom experience or were willing to learn. The ten of us set up the club rules, Murphy screened prospective club members, we opened the doors six years ago. Membership stays steady. But it\u2019s never been about makin\u2019 money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you financially invested in the club?\u201d Ainsley asked.</p><p>\u201cTypical banker question.\u201d Too bad he hadn\u2019t invested in it. That might solve some of his current financial issues. But Ben would come across as a fucking pussy if he admitted an emotional investment to the place had always been more important. That for him, it\u2019d never been solely about the kinky sex, but him finding acceptance in himself.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t an answer,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Once again she\u2019d tried to commandeer the conversation, which had forced his thoughts to money and how he\u2019d come up with his portion to buy Rielle\u2019s place, rather than the fact he had a naked sub sitting right next to him. \u201cBecause we\u2019re done talking.\u201d He allowed his gaze to linger on the curve of her breast peeking out by the lapel. \u201cDitch the robe.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley stood in front of him naked, awaiting instruction.</p><p>\u201cFace the TV.\u201d He unearthed the fur lined handcuffs from beneath the couch cushion. As soon as she assumed the position, he cuffed her.</p><p>Ben struggled to shimmy his sweatpants off over his erection. Once he had his clothes off, he rolled on a condom. He said, \u201cTurn around,\u201d and crooked his finger at her.</p><p>He braced her shoulders as she straddled his lap. He buried his face in her neck, searching for the honey-almond scent that drove him wild.</p><p>She shivered but didn\u2019t try and squirm away.</p><p>Ah. Progress.</p><p>Using just his fingertips, he traced the line of her stubborn jaw. Caressed the corded muscles in her neck. Traced the angle of her clavicle to the edge of her shoulder. Every glorious indentation and plane. Then he followed the plump curves of her breasts past those pretty pink nipples. He curled his hands over her ribcage and stroked his thumbs over the soft, feminine swell of her belly and across that sensitive skin between her hipbones. Sometimes he murmured verbal worship of these amazingly unique female parts as his fingers explored, but tonight he wanted to concentrate on every hitch in her breathing. Every reaction to his touch.</p><p>He already caught the scent of her arousal and his dick stood at attention, ready to satisfy the call of her body.</p><p>Ben ran his fingers through her hair while he kissed her. Unhurriedly. She matched him kiss for kiss. Never veering from his lead. Giving all of herself over to him.</p><p>In that moment she was wholly his. What a fucking rush.</p><p>He\u2019d intended to drag this out. Teasing those hot spots on her neck with his mouth until she begged to come and then getting her off with his hand. But now? He just wanted to fuck her.</p><p>He released her hair and aligned his cock to the source of that fragrant wet heat. Still feeding her deep soul kisses, he put one hand on her ass and urged her to lower her pelvis to his.</p><p>Then he was sliding up into that sublimely tight, hot pussy.</p><p>Ainsley briefly broke her mouth free from his to gasp softly.</p><p>Ben pumped his hips up to meet her downward thrusts. Each deep stroke drove his need higher. His need to hear her cry out. His need to see the pleasure on her face he\u2019d denied her yesterday. He latched onto the handcuffs, angling her body back. Then he slipped his free hand between her thighs.</p><p>Her eyes opened and she groaned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Using the wetness from her body, he rubbed his thumb over her clit.</p><p>She began bumping her pelvis against his hand, trying to get more friction. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Immediately her body stilled. Then she surrendered.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d After teasing her, reminding her who was in charge of her orgasms, Ben quickened the motion of his thumb, increased the pressure on that plumped bit of flesh and watched as Ainsley came unhinged.</p><p>She was a goddess, swamped with pleasure, her head thrown back, her silky hair swaying, her kiss-swollen lips parted as she cried out, the pulse throbbing in her neck in tandem with the pulse throbbing beneath his stroking thumb.</p><p>He drew out the climax, and only when she was spent did he drive himself over the edge. Yanking on the cuffs chain, bowing her body backward so he could see his cock pumping in and out of her. His fingers dug into her thigh when his balls lifted.</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s pussy squeezed his cock as seed shot out of his shaft.</p> <p>Ben\u2019s eyes rolled back in his head. He blanked out as her sex milked him of any thought processes. Zoned out, done in, checked out.</p><p>Sweet nuzzling on the side of his face roused him. \u201cBennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the cuffs.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed his favorite spot on her throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd thank you for easing me into this Dom/sub thing.\u201d</p> <p>Ben looked at her. \u201cA forced blowjob and me handcuffing you during sex is...easing you into it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, your aggressive side really does it for me. Like when you tied me to the bench at the club. But I like this closeness too. It almost felt...like it was more than sex.\u201d</p><p>Instead of admitting, for me too, he said gruffly, \u201cBend your knees.\u201d He helped her stand, removed the cuffs and checked the circulation in her arms before hitting the john to ditch the condom. When he returned to the kitchen, Ainsley was dressed.</p><p>\u201cLeaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get my beauty sleep. Don\u2019t you know bankers\u2019 hours are brutal?\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cHave a safe trip to Rapid City tomorrow and I\u2019ll see you Friday after work.\u201d</p><p>Ben walked her out to her car, ignoring her protests that she wasn\u2019t afraid of the dark.</p> <p>As he watched her drive away he knew he\u2019d have to push her next time. Break down some of those barriers. Even when he understood it\u2019d cause some of his walls to crumble a little too.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>The doorbell rang and Ainsley set the bottle of Pinot Grigio alongside the two wineglasses on the kitchen counter.</p><p>As soon as she answered the door, Layla squeezed Ainsley in a big hug. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to have you living so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit your phone call this morning surprised me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I invited myself over? We don\u2019t live that far apart anymore, so there\u2019s no excuse for us not to hang out. Besides, we would\u2019ve thought nothing of driving an hour across Denver to have dinner together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Come in.\u201d</p><p>The cats observed from the end of the hallway as Layla kicked off her Ugg boots and draped her parka and scarf over the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cCute kitties,\u201d Layla cooed, crouching down to hold out her hand. \u201cWhat are their names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWally is the tabby. I found him last spring huddled by a cart return at Wal-Mart. Poor thing was just a baby. And Charo, the calico, was my animal shelter rescue the week before. Some sicko kid scorched her tail and cut off one side of her whiskers. But look at that cute face. I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharo. As in she\u2019s been...charred? A, you have a bizarre sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley poured the wine, handing Layla a glass. \u201cI apologize for the boxes all over the living room. I haven\u2019t completely unpacked.\u201d</p><p>Layla tucked herself into the corner of the loveseat. She ran her hand over the peacock blue cushion. \u201cThis is a stunning sofa. So bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swore I\u2019d never have a neutral room again. Nothing boring. Or safe.\u201d Ainsley\u2019s gaze moved over the spring green chairs opposite the vividly patterned blue and green couch that complemented both the chairs and loveseat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re stepping outside that neat little box you\u2019ve lived in for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter late than never.\u201d She let the wine rest on her tongue. \u201cSo Murphy didn\u2019t need you in the bar tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThursdays are quiet. People are gearing up for the weekend. I probably would\u2019ve sat at home anyway, and Murph agreed I needed to come here to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s face warmed, recalling the last time she\u2019d seen Layla at the club. Was she here to explain that scene? \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what my reaction would be to watching you and Murphy. It wasn\u2019t what I expected. Can we just leave it at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Layla\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh. The public scene last weekend?\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not an exhibitionist, which is why Murphy almost always chooses that punishment when I\u2019ve stepped over the line. I\u2019m here to talk to you about something else. Someone else actually. Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me say I knew Bennett was a rancher. I had no idea where. As a sub, I don\u2019t ask questions that will get me in trouble. Murphy and I were talking about you, specifically the changes in your life, including moving from Denver to Sundance. He got really quiet. Which freaked me out. Then he told me Bennett lives in Sundance.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley swirled the wine in her glass before she looked up. \u201cI know. We\u2019ve already run into each other.\u201d</p><p>Layla gasped. \u201cYou did? Did he recognize you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away.\u201d She groaned. \u201cOf course it happened at the bank. He requested my presence at his place that night so we could talk. And...\u201d Why was she feeling shy, telling Layla this?</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked for a month of me being his submissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you said yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you assume that?\u201d Ainsley said a little sharper than she intended.</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Layla held up her hand. \u201cNot trying to piss you off, A. I suspected you\u2019d be a good fit for Bennett in the club. Especially since you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re interested in participating in this lifestyle beyond a short-term sampling. And Bennett...well, he only does short-term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett likes variety. He\u2019s got excellent instincts with whips, floggers, riding crops and canes, knowing how far he can push the submissive\u2019s pain threshold. Seems he\u2019s always being asked to show his expertise on another member\u2019s partner. When he gets her to that headspace, he returns her to her partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Ben doesn\u2019t have sex with every woman he demonstrates on?\u201d</p><p>Layla shook her head. \u201cHardly any, actually. He\u2019s very mindful of boundaries, yet there\u2019s never any doubt who\u2019s in charge during the scene. There\u2019s something about his quiet intensity that draws subs like bees to flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it could be the size of his...ah...stinger that attracts them,\u201d Ainsley said.</p><p>\u201cOh man.\u201d Layla giggled. \u201cAin\u2019t that the truth. Murph once gave me twenty lashes because he caught me licking my lips during one of Bennett\u2019s public scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ben\u2019s got a smoking hot body besides his impressive stinger.\u201d</p><p>Layla squinted at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you calling him Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s in Dom mode he\u2019s Bennett. When we\u2019re hanging out, he\u2019s Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much time have you spent with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last three nights. We\u2019ve come to terms on the specifics of his one-month proposal. Since we live in the same town, he suggested we skip the club for the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right with that? You trust him? Because some subs only want to play where there\u2019s supervision in case the Dom goes too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust Bennett. Even when the idea of surrendering that much control to him scares the bejeezus out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearning to integrate your submissive side will be hard for you, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should alter your personality, in or out of the bedroom, just to please him.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley frowned. \u201cExplain that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoms expect a certain amount of disobedience from subs, especially new subs just learning their parameters. You are a strong woman with strong opinions. If you never act out, either accidentally or on purpose, how will you know the difference between punishment and discipline?\u201d</p><p>She vaguely remembered Ben mentioning that, but she hadn\u2019t asked specifics. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d</p><p>Layla nodded. \u201cMurphy forcing me to do a public scene was punishment for the way I humiliated him. Discipline was the caning I received in private the next three days to reinforce his dominance and as a warning not to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to be defiant to see how Bennett reacts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot always. But accepting everything Bennett says or does...where is the learning curve? What are the limits? For both of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs happy as I am that you\u2019re getting a taste of the lifestyle, even behind bedroom doors, I want to caution you about a couple of things.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley expected Layla to alert her to the physical pain from spankings. Or reiterating practicing safe sex, or suggesting Ainsley call her if something happened that made her uncomfortable. She hadn\u2019t expected her friend to warn her off Ben completely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall for him, A. Not as Bennett, not as Ben. Keep the relationship focused on you embracing your submissive nature with an experienced Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t look to get involved long-term with the first Dom you meet anyway. Don\u2019t expect promises of forever or fidelity, especially not from Bennett. Don\u2019t agree to play every night. And for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t spend the night with him because that\u2019s a gateway drug for subs. As soon as you\u2019re able to function following his aftercare, leave. Or make him leave.\u201d Layla\u2019s gaze turned shrewd. \u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBen\u2019s already asked me to spend the night with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see that not yet answer in your eyes, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>She fidgeted. \u201cBut he can just command me to stay over anyway, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically? Yes. Especially if you\u2019ve agreed to give up your weekends to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to. Next time you\u2019re together before the clothes fly off and the restraints come out.\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley rolled her eyes. \u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about you, knowing he\u2019s in the area. You\u2019re trying to prove you can handle the bank president\u2019s job. You\u2019re new in town and it\u2019d be easy to spend all your free time with Bennett. I don\u2019t want you to get too attached to him, because it won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><p>As much as Ainsley wanted to protest, she\u2019d be wise to listen to Layla since she\u2019d known Bennett for years. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Layla sagged against the loveseat. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the advice. I never would\u2019ve mustered the guts to do this if not for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve reconnected, A.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Ainsley stood. \u201cLet\u2019s eat. Then you can give me hints on how to keep my Dom on his toes while keeping my butt from getting paddled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even pretend you don\u2019t want that man spanking your ass at every opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m blindfolding you tonight.\u201d</p><p>That was an abrupt subject change. \u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to start the weekend,\u201d Ainsley said dryly. She\u2019d weighed Layla\u2019s advice and ignored it simply because she\u2019d wanted to spend the whole weekend with him. In his house. In his bed. Under his control.</p><p>Bennett traced the line of her jaw and stared into her eyes. When he studied her so intently, as he touched her with such familiarity, she felt more naked than when she was actually naked. Stripping her defenses was more intimate than stripping her clothes.</p><p>\u201cWill I need to bind your hands so you don\u2019t tear the blindfold off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Ainsley\u2019s heart pounded. How could he make her so skittish with just words? \u201cSo you\u2019re going to blindfold me, tie me up and then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave you in the barn while I come back inside and watch The Speed Channel.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you\u2019re afraid of? I\u2019ll take away your choices and leave you powerless and at my whim? Then I\u2019ll somehow abuse you, or your trust, which will allow you to get upset and leave, which also lets you regain control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett,\u201d he corrected with an edge. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t know...the truth is I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll un-confuse you. Because you\u2019re not supposed to be thinking, are you?\u201d His smile, usually so sexy and sure, took on a decidedly wolf-like gleam. \u201cGet undressed and bend over the arm of the couch.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley bit back her question. But the uneasiness wouldn\u2019t go away. Just focus on each step. She removed every stitch of clothing. She stretched across the couch arm. She tried to concentrate on how the soft cushion molded against her hips and belly. How the fabric abraded her nipples.</p><p>Bennett crouched beside her. \u201cDo you know the difference between discipline and punishment?\u201d</p><p>Yes. But she had the urge to stall. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscipline is what a Dom uses to remind the sub who\u2019s in charge. Punishment is to correct offensive sub behavior.\u201d He plucked her bra from the floor and quickly bound her arms with it.</p><p>Neat trick. Okay, scary trick.</p><p>When he rolled up her blouse, she understood he intended to use her clothing to truss her up. That made this lesson more personal somehow. He covered her eyes and tied a knot at the base of her neck. Everything turned dark and her anxiety increased exponentially. Why was she naked, bent over, blindfolded and about to let this man do whatever he wanted to her?</p><p>Retreat! Retreat now. It\u2019s not too late.</p><p>\u201cIgnore that voice,\u201d Bennett whispered in her ear. \u201cThe voice of doubt, the voice of reason that demands you assert yourself has no place here. The only voice you should be listening to is mine.\u201d</p><p>The deep cadence held a compelling, but rough edge. But when she let go of her fear and trusted him, when she pleased him, those harsh tones mellowed into warmth. Ainsley tried to shut off everything but the reality of him: his voice, his touch, his scent, his presence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d A single fingertip traversed her spine. \u201cDon\u2019t think. Feel. Anticipate.\u201d</p><p>Sensual touches zigzagged from her shoulders to the top of her butt in a constant stream of motion. Then the sensation changed into a sharp bite of pain in a dozen separate spots on her body.</p><p>She pushed up from the couch, only to have Bennett pushing her down.</p><p>\u201cLet. Go.\u201d</p><p>She did and it was a glorious place to be, completely under his care and control.</p><p>Caresses slithered over her back, sending goose bumps blooming outward, increasing her awareness of new erogenous zones. As soon as she became used to the tickling touch of a dozen different points of contact, they morphed into pinpricks of fire that seared her skin.</p><p>The teasing stroke followed by several stinging snaps went on for several rounds. The hard/soft combination awakened her nerve endings, sending her to the place where pleasure bled into pain and became one. She existed in the moment, in his attention.</p><p>That\u2019s when Bennett stopped. Curling his hands over her shoulders, he pulled her upright and unbound her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful in obedience, angel.\u201d</p><p>He tantalized her with erotic kisses that increased the dizzying, floating sensation. She was vaguely aware of moving. Of his callused hands gripping her hips as he guided her backward.</p><p>\u201cUp on the bed. Hands on the headboard.\u201d</p><p>Despite the commanding tone, he helped her into the position. He made her wait, but he hadn\u2019t left the room. She heard him pacing behind her.</p><p>The bed dipped and his warm, hard body pressed against hers. A hand slipped over the curve of her belly, breaching the curls covering her mound. Two fingers followed the seam of her sex and plunged inside her wet pussy.</p><p>God that felt good.</p><p>His pleasure rumbled in her ear. \u201cFlogging turns you on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWiden your stance.\u201d</p><p>While Ainsley slid her knees out, he thrust his fingers in a few more times before he moved. The bed jostled. Soft hair brushed the inside of her thighs.</p><p>\u201cLean forward.\u201d</p><p>Oh wow. It was like she was sitting on his face.</p><p>His tongue snaked from the top of her slit to her bottom. A very long, very thorough lick.</p><p>Her whole body trembled.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you taste good.\u201d He yanked her down and went to town. Suckling her pussy lips, then flicking them with his tongue. Mapping every fold with every part of his mouth. Lapping at the cream pouring from her sex.</p><p>A whimper escaped when his teeth scraped her clit.</p><p>Bennett stilled. \u201cDid that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. It just caught me by surprise.\u201d</p><p>He pressed several soft kisses over the hood of her clit.</p><p>Those glimpses of his care, of how attuned he was to her every response amazed her. His work-honed hands clutched the globes of her ass as he ate at her sex. She was so lost in the intimate attentions of his hungry mouth that she jumped at the first brush of his thumb across her anus.</p><p>Which caused him to smack her ass and growl a warning.</p><p>That smack made her wetter yet.</p><p>Bennett began to plunge his thumb in and out of her pussy as he fastened his mouth to her clit.</p><p>Ainsley knew she wouldn\u2019t last long with such intense focus. All pulse points in her body were already buzzing as Bennett pushed her closer to the edge of detonation. He didn\u2019t retreat when she began to grind into his face, desperate for that rush of release.</p><p>Right as the climax hit, he slipped his thumb in her ass. Her clit pulsed against his sucking lips. Her pussy and anal muscles contracted in opposition to the throbbing in her sex, making the orgasm seem endless.</p><p>As soon as the last pulse faded, Bennett scooted backward. \u201cStay just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think, let alone move.\u201d</p><p>A couple of seconds later he removed the blindfold as he kissed her nape. A slick digit swept over her asshole. \u201cDon\u2019t clench.\u201d</p><p>A light pressure gave way to a gentle swirling motion that encompassed all those unexplored nerve endings. A constant stroking of the outer ring of muscle and a little inside. The more he stroked, the more those nerve endings came alive. She found herself wanting that invasion. Unconsciously she pressed down, trying to force contact.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cWho\u2019s in charge, Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax and I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>She expelled a steady breath. As soon as she followed his directive, he slipped something in her ass. A thick something. But it didn\u2019t fill her bowels completely. Not a dildo. Probably not even a finger.</p><p>Demand to know what he shoved up your butt.</p><p>No. Be compliant.</p><p>Bennett chuckled. \u201cYou are bein\u2019 a model sub. Avoiding punishment by doin\u2019 what you\u2019re told without arguing or without questioning me.\u201d He slapped her ass. \u201cLet\u2019s see how long you can keep it up.\u201d</p><p>The swat didn\u2019t hurt; it merely caught her off guard because it jiggled the thing in her butt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing the butt plug until I take it out.\u201d He trailed his finger down her spine, between her butt cheeks, over her tailbone to jostle the object. \u201cWhatcha think about that, sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to think.\u201d She tacked on, \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cGood answer. Come on. Let\u2019s shoot a game of pool.\u201d</p><p>Pool? With her bending over the table and that...thing poking out of her behind? No way. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That penetrating blue gaze sharpened. \u201cYou might learn more about the difference between discipline and punishment tonight after all.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley plastered on a smile. \u201cWould you like me to chalk your stick?\u201d</p><p>The crotch of Ben\u2019s jeans was strangling his cock.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t expected to get so turned on by Ainsley\u2019s competitive streak. Her cocky attitude.</p><p>He suspected she\u2019d downplayed her pool abilities when she\u2019d challenged him to the best two games out of three. But as soon as she started shooting, he realized the woman was a novice. He\u2019d hustled enough games in his youth to be considered a pool shark. He\u2019d easily won the first game without taxing himself.</p><p>His amusement morphed into lust during the second game. Watching her naked body contorting to try a shot. So he\u2019d been biding his time. Keeping the Dom hovering in the background, pacing like a caged tiger for the opportunity to pounce.</p><p>And there it was.</p><p>Ainsley scratched on the eight ball. Which didn\u2019t faze her in the least. She beamed at him. \u201cDid you catch that awesome shot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. But, angel, you still lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. I got the black ball in.\u201d</p><p>Jagged spikes of lightning flashed outside the windows. Thunder boomed. The wind whistled through the house with enough force to shake the rafters. Hard drops of rain pelted the skylights above the pool table.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the cue ball can\u2019t follow the eight ball in. It means you scratched. Which means I win.\u201d</p><p>An ominous crack of thunder echoed.</p><p>Her eyes widened. Her delicate fingers tightened around the pool cue. \u201cWe still have one game left.\u201d</p> <p>Ben shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve won two. The third game is pointless.\u201d He let his predatory gaze roam up her body. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a much better use for the pool table.\u201d</p><p>The lights flickered.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d He stalked her until her butt met the edge of the pool table, ignoring the elements battling outside his house, focusing instead on the elements raging inside him. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d He plucked the cue from her hand and returned it to the cue rack. Then he grabbed a flat sheet from the guest bedroom, a couple of condoms and a bottle of lube.</p><p>In the few minutes he\u2019d been gone, a mutinous look had settled on Ainsley\u2019s face. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the sheet for?\u201d</p><p>He tossed it to her. \u201cSo your knees don\u2019t get skinned up from the felt covering the pool table. Spread it out.\u201d He grabbed a cylinder-shaped pillow and said, \u201cCrawl up and lay on your back.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when everything went completely dark.</p> <p>\u201cBennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. The power just went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave me here to go and check on it, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Power outages happen all the time.\u201d He ditched his clothes, put on a condom and dropped the lube in the closest corner pocket. \u201cYou wanna tell me why you have such a fear that I\u2019ll tie you up and leave you alone?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was so soft he strained to hear her. \u201cHe did it once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean. My ex. I was shocked when he told me he wanted to try some...stuff I\u2019d suggested. He had me strip and then he tied my wrists together around the banister with some kind of electrical cord.\u201d</p><p>Ben fought his surge of fury and calmly asked, \u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left me tied there. For hours. In full view of anyone who walked up to the front door. It was his way of trying to cure me. To show me what I\u2019d wanted him to do with me was sick and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long after that did you leave him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kicked him out the next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d It was one of the hardest things Ben had done, ignoring the anger raging through him to concentrate on being what Ainsley needed now. Comfort her, but not coddle her. Return her focus to them. To this moment. To who they were to each other. Proving he\u2019d never ever be that kind of man and she could trust him without hesitation.</p><p>Ainsley twitched when he hopped up on the table and crawled over her body on all fours. Strobe-like effects flashed throughout the room, distorting the shadows, which increased her look of fright. Needing to soothe her, Ben\u2019s lips captured hers as a shard of lightning and thunder boomed above them.</p><p>She jerked so hard their teeth knocked together.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Ben reclaimed her mouth in a passionate kiss, a duel of tongues, the constant glide of wet lips as they kept changing the angle of the kiss. Taking it deeper. Making it hotter. Kissing her for a good long time until she squirmed beneath him.</p><p>\u201cThe storm sets me on edge too.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s something raw about that power. Something that makes me wild.\u201d Ben nipped her neck. \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wildness? Yes. Your whole body vibrates with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it scare you?\u201d He pulled back to look into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ainsley didn\u2019t bother to hide her lust. \u201cIt excites me. You excite me.\u201d Her hands moved over his shoulders and she scraped her fingernails down his back to his bare ass. \u201cI know what you want, Bennett. Take it. Take me.\u201d</p><p>Ben rose to his knees, primal need clawing at him. \u201cRoll over and grab onto the edge.\u201d</p><p>As she maneuvered herself into position, he shoved the pillow under her hips and snagged the lube. He scooted back and placed a kiss on each butt cheek. The pounding of his heart rivaled the sound of the driving rain. His hands shook as he removed the butt plug.</p><p>He added more lube to the stretched anal opening and coated his cock. He couldn\u2019t watch the head of his cock breaching that tight pink pucker, but he could feel the mind blowing contraction of the muscle as pushed his shaft in without pause, until he was balls deep in that untried channel.</p><p>She reared up.</p><p>He pushed her flat to the table with his body, curling his hands around hers on the edge of the pool table. \u201cJesus. You\u2019re so fucking tight.\u201d His mouth brushed her ear. \u201cIt\u2019ll get better.\u201d He canted his pelvis, slid out a few inches and then back in.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019ll get better? Have you had a dick in your butt?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Several booms of thunder rattled the windowpanes.</p><p>Ben sank his teeth into the skin at the base of her neck, feeling her tremble beneath him. \u201cAnd what if I said yes? Would you believe I wouldn\u2019t put a sub through something I\u2019m not willing to have done to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say that\u2019s not an answer.\u201d She hissed when he withdrew, resting the cockhead just inside the opening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bein\u2019 kinda mouthy for a woman pinned to a pool table with her Dom\u2019s cock filling her virgin ass.\u201d Ben slammed back in fully.</p><p>Ainsley gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted this. You said take me. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. Take you. My way.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened beneath his as she braced herself.</p><p>Ben started fucking her. Slowly. Steadily. Trying to keep as much of their skin in contact as possible with each stroke. Despite the chill in the room, he was sweating. He whispered, \u201cYou feel so goddamn good.\u201d</p><p>The wind whistled and shrieked. Sheets of rain pelted the windows.</p><p>He withdrew and plunged in deep, aware of Ainsley\u2019s changed breathing pattern. Aware of her conflicting feelings of agony and ecstasy. \u201cYou like this.\u201d</p><p>No response except for a grunt.</p><p>\u201cAdmit this was another of your dirty fantasies. Bein\u2019 made to enjoy havin\u2019 a cock in your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay? Happy now?\u201d She bucked against him, which shoved his cock deeper into her glove-tight channel.</p><p>Ben chuckled. \u201cVery happy, angel.\u201d That\u2019s when he fucked her hard. His hips slamming into her backside. His toes cramped as he used the inside ledge of the pool table to propel himself into her faster until he reached that point of no return.</p><p>He came in a head roaring rush.</p><p>She followed right behind him, her inner muscles clamped down as she humped against the pillow.</p><p>They stayed like that\u2014sweaty, panting, sticky, spent\u2014for quite a while.</p><p>What a great way to start their weekend.</p><p>Late Sunday morning Ben rolled over and grabbed his phone from the nightstand. \u201cHey, Quinn. What\u2019s up?\u201d Ben frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s today? Shit. No. I forgot. Thanks for the reminder. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d He hung up and headed straight for the shower. Then he grabbed his clothes from the closet.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Quinn and Libby I\u2019d watch Adam and Amelia today. Usually my mom volunteers to baby-sit, but she\u2019s outta town.\u201d He buttoned his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone, so make yourself at home. No reason to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to wait here for you all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley threw back the covers and angrily started gathering articles of clothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you pissed off about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She held out her arm. A section of rope still dangled from her wrist. \u201cOh, maybe because we\u2019d barely finished screwing, and you left me half-tied to the damn bed so you could answer your phone!\u201d</p><p>Shit. He tried to catch her gaze but she stomped away. What was she trying to tell him by calling that last heart pounding, body-pumping bout of sex...screwing? It\u2019d been more than that. It\u2019d been freakin\u2019 phenomenal.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you gave me the impression that I was supposed to lie in bed all day and wait for your triumphant return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words.\u201d Ainsley muttered as she yanked on her clothes.</p><p>\u201cSomething you wanna say to me? Instead of throwing me dirty looks and mumbling under your breath?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI realize I\u2019m your sub. But I\u2019m not some object like your saddle. Hanging around ready to be used when you need me, set aside when you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Did Ainsley really just compare herself to his saddle? And what the fuck was up with that \u201cbe used\u201d comment?</p><p>She flounced to the bedroom doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re goin?\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley deigned to give him a mocking look. \u201cI\u2019m going to the fucking opera dressed like this. Where do you think I\u2019m going? I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here since Friday night. I need to check on my cats. Then I have to finish unpacking and wash clothes. All things I\u2019ve neglected, because I have a life besides the one I spend bound for your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>That smartass comment raised his blood pressure. \u201cYou trying to see how much hotter you can make the water you\u2019re already in, sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sir, Bennett, Sir,\u201d she snapped off with military precision and notched her chin higher. \u201cYou told me we wouldn\u2019t spend every waking minute together. We have this weekend. I think I deserve a furlough.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019d been one of the best weekends he could remember, not that he could tell her that with the anger emanating from her like a poisonous cloud. Hey wait. Had she just compared the weekend to a...prison sentence?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a busy week, so I\u2019ll call you. Or maybe you\u2019ll call me when you need to practice your rope-tying skills.\u201d She threw the rope at him and disappeared down the hallway.</p><p>Maybe you\u2019ll call me when you need to practice your rope-tying skills? Oh hell no. That would not fly with him.</p><p>Ben heard the door slam. By the time he made it outside, her car was halfway up the drive.</p><p>Oh, little sub, you\u2019ve just landed yourself in a whole passel of trouble.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>Ainsley spent all day Monday on the phone with Chase McKay\u2019s publicist and going back and forth with Steve Talbot, president of Settler\u2019s First Bank. They\u2019d come to an agreement about co-sponsoring the local event as a platform for Chase to announce his new charity. Steve\u2019s attempts to cut National West out of the event entirely displeased Mayor Mark, who championed the idea of both banks providing a united front to the community.</p><p>So at the end of the day, she felt she\u2019d accomplished something. So much of her duties as bank president were busy work. Seemed she spent her life on the phone.</p><p>Not that she minded. She\u2019d taken the position because the regional manager assured Ainsley that the bulk of her job would be schmoozing locals into switching a portion of their banking business to National West. Ainsley could handle PR; it\u2019s what she did best. She figured the event would show the locals that this bank was interested in investing in the community. In the next month she\u2019d approach individual businesses, touting the benefits of diversifying their banking needs.</p><p>During her divorce, she\u2019d needed a career change. Intrigued by the management end of banking, she\u2019d taken over a small branch office in a low-income suburb of Denver no one else wanted to tackle. Determined to keep the branch from closing, she\u2019d approached every business, big and small, in the three-mile radius, talking up the benefits of banking locally. She used the bank\u2019s allotted community funds to resurrect small community events that were underfunded, but much beloved. She volunteered her time, which had a huge impact on convincing locals of her sincerity. The hard work, the unpaid hours of overtime, had paid off. In that year she\u2019d increased that branch\u2019s business banking operation by twenty-five percent and the personal banking business by thirteen percent. Quite a coup for a woman who\u2019d spent the previous six years as a PR assistant.</p><p>Now here she was in Sundance, basically starting over again. With her PR savvy and Turton as the bean counter, on paper they looked like an unbeatable team to make this branch a rousing success from the get go. But in reality, Turton was bitter Ainsley had been awarded the job. And she still hadn\u2019t figured out the best way to deal with him.</p><p>Jenny knocked on her door. \u201cSorry to interrupt, but there\u2019s an extremely agitated woman pacing in the lobby. Turton tried to help her but she refuses to talk to anyone but the bank president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Ainsley set aside the stack of files, and straightened her short suit jacket as she made her way around the desk.</p><p>But the agitated woman met her at the office door. \u201cAre you the bank president?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m Ainsley Hamilton. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t treat me like an idiot, for starters.\u201d</p><p>Okay. So she was testy. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate the same courtesy, Miss...\u201d</p><p>The petite redhead looked up. Her large eyes were a pale shade of blue that made her pupils stand out. A striking combination, given the woman\u2019s gamine features. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m Joely Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Miss Monroe, let\u2019s talk in my office. Could I get you something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve got vodka?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley muttered, \u201cI wish. We\u2019ve got coffee. Water. Hot tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat.\u201d After they\u2019d both settled, Ainsley said, \u201cIs there a problem with your account?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an account here. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d She jammed a hand through her hair, cut in an asymmetrical style few women could pull off. \u201cMy accounts have always been with Settler\u2019s First. Not by choice, I assure you. But there is no bank in Moorcroft and I didn\u2019t want to drive even farther to Spearfish to do my business banking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour business is in Moorcroft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a medical practice. Small town doctor-type stuff, it\u2019s just me and two nurses. Anyway, we\u2019ve been having problems with our credit card machine. It locks up, and then it won\u2019t generate reports. A big pain in the butt since so much business is done on that machine. Settler\u2019s First installed the machine as part of their full-service banking promise. But any time it goes down, their advice? Unplug it from the wall for a couple minutes and plug it back in. When that doesn\u2019t work, they claim it\u2019s my Internet connection causing the problems, which it\u2019s not. The machine has gone down fifteen times in the last month. And not once has anyone from that bank contacted me to see if the problem is fixed, or if they should show up and troubleshoot the problem if it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m tired of fighting with them. I\u2019m tired of my office manager losing her mind on me because we\u2019ve got thousands of dollars in transit every time the machine goes down. So I\u2019m shopping for a new bank. But before I go to the trouble of changing accounts and telling Steve Talbot where to shove it, I\u2019d like some guarantee that I\u2019ll get decent customer service from this bank.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley smiled. \u201cWe can do much better than decent on the customer service end. We\u2019ve got a Denver-based IT team here on Wednesday. I\u2019ll send them your way and they can check everything in your office, from the phone lines to the Internet service to the credit card machine itself. And if those guys can\u2019t figure out the problem? They\u2019ll find someone who can.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up. \u201cReally? You\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, assuming you open an account with us.\u201d Or multiple accounts.</p><p>\u201cDone. What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual boring bank stuff. You\u2019ll have to fill out reams of paperwork, but it\u2019ll be worth it in the long run, I promise.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Monroe glanced at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost five o\u2019clock. Don\u2019t you banker types lock the doors at five?\u201d She scowled. \u201cI took off early today to address this problem with Settler\u2019s First only to find out their lobby closes at four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy as I am that your unhappiness with them brought you to us, I will point out our goal is to maintain more customer-friendly hours than bankers\u2019 hours. Our lobby is actually open until six during the week and noon on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now that you\u2019ve given me the spiel, lay the paperwork on me and I\u2019ll get it to my office manager first thing in the morning. It\u2019s kosher for her to swing in tomorrow and finalize everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll grab all the paperwork you\u2019ll need.\u201d</p><p>When Ainsley returned to the office, the doctor gave her a curious look. \u201cYou haven\u2019t lived here long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks. I transferred from Denver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see pictures of a husband or kids decorating your walls. You married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorced. No kids.\u201d Sort of a bizarre line of questions. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso divorced. No kids. And let me tell ya, that makes us a rarity in this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had much time to meet many people or soak in the local color.\u201d</p><p>She popped to her feet. \u201cYou have to eat, right? I\u2019ll take you to a local favorite hot spot where we can chow down a juicy hamburger, split a plate of onion rings and sip a martini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA martini? In Sundance?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cLettie at the Golden Boot makes a mean lemon drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in. Let me grab my coat and tell my vice president to close up. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she had plans tonight anyway. Ben acted shocked that she\u2019d gotten a little huffy with him. Probably not smart to compare herself to an old saddle\u2014broken in and ready to be used when he wanted it, out of sight and out of mind when he didn\u2019t.</p><p>There\u2019s gonna be hell to pay for that crack, sub.</p><p>Ainsley whirled around like Bennett had whispered that in her ear. But she only saw Turton giving her the stink eye. She had to find a way to deal with that prickly man, but not tonight.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Ainsley slid into the booth across from her newest customer. Before she sipped the yummy looking martini, she confessed, \u201cI have no idea what to call you. Doc? Doc Monroe? Joely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Joely. As proud as I am of my medical degree and my practice, it\u2019s good to be reminded I\u2019m more than just my occupation.\u201d She raised her glass. \u201cTo faulty credit card machines.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. \u201cThis is the only time I\u2019m drinking to that.\u201d</p><p>Joely was surprisingly easy to talk to. The woman definitely had opinions. They talked about college and places they\u2019d traveled. Even after they\u2019d finished a cholesterol-laden meal and switched to soda, neither was eager to leave. It\u2019d been a while since she\u2019d spent time with another professional woman she didn\u2019t work with. Or who wasn\u2019t in her circle of married friends.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you? About thirty-four?\u201d Joely asked.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost thirty-eight, and thanks for that, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo red-hot love affair you left behind in Colorado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping maybe I\u2019d find one of those here.\u201d Ben\u2019s face swam into her mind\u2019s eye, and she shook her head to erase it.</p><p>Joely stared into her soda as she stirred the ice cubes. \u201cThere are a few single men. If you don\u2019t mind younger guys. Or cowboys. Not a lot of professional types.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fill of those types. The problem I discovered with younger guys? They want marriage and a family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve never had that burning maternal urge.\u201d She looked up, not knowing how Joely would respond to that. Most women didn\u2019t understand. They always claimed she\u2019d change her mind when she met the right guy. But she knew she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d accepted that about herself. Why couldn\u2019t everyone else?</p><p>\u201cI hear you. I\u2019ve lived in this area for twelve years. So if I\u2019d taken up with the first yahoo that asked me, I\u2019d probably have kids by now. Probably be divorced again, and a stranger to those kids since I work all the damn time.\u201d Joely gestured to the empty space between them. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been out on a date in months.\u201d</p><p>Now that Ainsley thought about it, it was pretty bizarre, Joely just asking her out for...holy crap. Had she said date? Was the doc...gay?</p><p>\u201cYou stiffened up, Ainsley, did I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called this a date. It isn\u2019t, right? Because you should know I don\u2019t swing that way.\u201d</p> <p>Amusement danced in her eyes. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a date. Freudian slip, maybe. I\u2019m not a lesbian. If I had to classify my sexuality, I\u2019d say...celibate. And I\u2019m damn tired of it. You know what bites about being the only doctor in a rural area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have to at least pretend to have a moral code. If I worked in a suburban hospital or practice, I could get away with having a different man or two in my bed every week. Heck, I could have that every day. But here? I have to be Dr. Sexless and Upstanding.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard you chiming in about forced celibacy since moving to the sticks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for hook-up sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m really jealous. You\u2019ve only been here a month and you\u2019ve already got a local hook-up whenever you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoely?\u201d</p><p>They both looked at the dark-haired woman at the end of the booth.</p><p>\u201cLibby! What\u2019s up?\u201d Joely said, \u201cAinsley Hamilton, meet my friend, Libby McKay. Ainsley is the president of the new bank.\u201d</p> <p>Of course this woman had to be a McKay. \u201cNice to meet you, Libby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikewise. Are you the one who\u2019s responsible for Chase\u2019s event this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure am. We hammered out the final details today with Settler\u2019s First. How are you related to Chase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley went very still. That meant this woman was Ben\u2019s sister-in-law. Why that freaked her out was totally stupid, because chances were very slim Ben was anywhere around.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc, good to see you.\u201d</p><p>Then that deep voice that fueled her fantasies was right behind her.</p><p>\u201cBen. Fancy seeing you here,\u201d Joely said.</p><p>\u201cPoor Ben was roped into bringing me into town. Ginger and I haven\u2019t had a chance to catch up with girl talk forever so we\u2019re meeting when she gets off work.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t miss Joely\u2019s wistful smile that she hadn\u2019t been included in Libby\u2019s girl-talk time.</p><p>\u201cIt was no bother,\u201d Bennett said keeping his eyes on Ainsley. \u201cI had another matter I needed to tend to tonight anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced. She\u2019d probably be tending to her own burning butt cheeks before the night was over, if the hard look in his eye was any indication of his mood.</p><p>And didn\u2019t that just thrill her?</p><p>\u201cBen, do you know Ainsley?\u201d Joely asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ainsley and I have crossed paths a few times,\u201d Bennett drawled.</p><p>\u201cRight, probably about Chase\u2019s event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Chase\u2019s event, Ainsley, I\u2019d like to run a couple of ideas past you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth and brain were frozen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna snag that table in the back,\u201d Libby said. \u201cNice seeing you, Joely. Nice to meet you, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>Bennett said, \u201cEither of you ladies need a drink while I grab a beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m good. Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Damn man, bossing her in public.</p><p>As soon as Bennett left, Joely leaned across the table. \u201cBad poker face. You are totally banging him. The elusive, sexy Ben McKay is your local hook-up, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t deny it. Up top.\u201d Joely held her hand up for a high-five. \u201cKudos to you for getting some of that hot cowboy ass while the getting is good.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley slapped Joely\u2019s hand. \u201cThis is so far under the radar it\u2019s underground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I live my life under the radar.\u201d She slipped out of the booth. \u201cThanks for an entertaining evening. I hope we can do it again soon.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and meant it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your number, you\u2019ve got mine. Let\u2019s set up something fun once the bank business is out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley waited for Ben to return, feeling resentful about his command. In public. Then she thought, screw it, and started to leave.</p><p>But he blocked her in. \u201cI wondered how long you\u2019d sit there before showing your insubordination.\u201d He swigged from his beer. \u201cOr should I say more insubordination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have plans tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Did you call me to double-check?\u201d</p><p>She refused to back down. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware I needed your approval to have a business dinner with a bank client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is true. So your bank business with the doc is done?\u201d</p><p>Say no.</p><p>Bennett leaned close enough to get her attention. \u201cYou really gonna lie to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just finished. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou were serious about discussing Chase\u2019s event?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cKnow why I came to town?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley tapped her finger on the table. \u201cHmm. Does it involve handing me a paddle since I\u2019m up shit creek? Or are you just going to paddle me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting off that easy this time.\u201d He kept that smoldering Dom stare on her. \u201cI\u2019m still ticked off at you for the way you compared yourself to my saddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the stirrup fits...\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cYou tryin\u2019 to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But this is your pissed-off face? Because it looks the same as when you\u2019re happy\u2014or when you\u2019re turned on\u2014to me.\u201d</p><p>Wrong taunt, Ainsley.</p><p>\u201cDo you really feel I use you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sometimes I do.\u201d</p><p>An emotion she\u2019d never seen flitted through those beautiful dark eyes. \u201cGet your stuff and plan on spending the night at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say your safe word. You won\u2019t see me again.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. He stared back. No surprise she dropped their mind-fuck connection first. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say my safe word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better do as you\u2019re told, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley looked up but he was already walking away.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t prepared for this side of Bennett.</p><p>He had no time for pleasantries or conversation when she showed up at his house. He simply asked her to repeat her safe word. Twice.</p><p>When he told her to strip, kneel at his bedroom door and wait for him, she had her first real feeling of trepidation since she\u2019d agreed to be his submissive. Sometime in the last week, she\u2019d even wondered if Bennett was acting. Playing the part of being a dominant man. That when she really got to know him, he\u2019d drop that aggressive role and just be a demanding lover.</p><p>But this man wasn\u2019t acting. This man was pure, full on dominant male about to mete out punishment to his sub. Why was she kneeling, waiting for his return? He knew she hated the subservience aspect of Dom/sub relationships. Another thought made her stomach roil. What would she do if he slipped a collar on her? Bennett had only allowed her one hard line. He\u2019d told her anything else he wanted to do to her was fair game. The idea of being collared like one of his dogs had her head screaming her safe word and urging her to run.</p><p>No. Stay put, stay calm. You can do this. There\u2019s a lesson in here in here for you. Bennett isn\u2019t a cruel Dom, you know that.</p><p>Did she?</p><p>Immediately upon his return to his bedroom, after making her wait for twenty minutes, he\u2019d secured her, naked, and stretched her out, face down, spread-eagle on his mattress. He used a riding crop on her butt, letting it glance across her thighs. Twice he\u2019d stopped to see if she needed to use her safe word. Asking in that firm, gentle voice that somehow offered her reassurance, even as it kept her clinging to the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ainsley shook her head and bore his punishment, wondering why his attention wasn\u2019t having the usual effect of turning her on. Wondering why she felt so disjointed.</p><p>Then Bennett changed the configuration of the ropes and kept her bound in his bed, but added a blindfold for variety.</p><p>When he maneuvered her body how he preferred, she knew he\u2019d fuck her however he preferred. As many times as he preferred.</p><p>The first time he fucked her mouth, angling her head off the bed so she could deep throat him. He came partially in her mouth, partially on her face.</p><p>No soothing touches in the aftermath. Usually he touched or kissed her mouth, murmuring how sexy her lips looked swollen from sucking his cock.</p><p>The second time he fucked her breasts. Pinching her nipples to the surprising edge of pain she craved that usually sent her soaring. But he\u2019d stopped. He squeezed her breasts around his cock and slid his shaft faster and faster until he ejaculated on her chest. But again, no praise from her Dom, no promises that her compliance would be rewarded. It was all about him.</p><p>Ainsley drifted into a place where she almost could see the events happening from outside her body. She felt nothing. No pride, no shame, no excitement, no gratitude. None of the usual submissive high where she knew her acquiescence would please him. Where she knew her total surrender was prized by him and he\u2019d gift her with an explosive orgasm.</p><p>The third time he fucked her pussy, bringing her leg straight up as he drove into her from the side. Keeping her blindfolded and bound. But he had fingered her clit, with almost clinical detachment, and got her off.</p><p>No sweet kisses, or whispered words or loving touching. Just fucking. His way.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d brought her ankles up and attached them to her bound hands. She\u2019d laid face down on the mattress, her body pinned like a butterfly, unable to move at all as he\u2019d lubed her back channel with his fingers and then rammed his cock into her ass without pause.</p><p>This was what she\u2019d feared Bennett would become. Unyielding. Aggressive and unwilling to provide her with any type of comfort or explanation as he took what he wanted. Reinforcing to her what it meant to be submissive. Reminding her who had the power and the control.</p><p>The scenes had happened in such rapid succession, she had no idea how much time had passed when Bennett finally untied her.</p><p>If she\u2019d had the strength in her legs, she might\u2019ve run.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been so confused by Bennett\u2019s sudden change, becoming the caring Dom she recognized, she might\u2019ve shaken off his loving touches. But he\u2019d shown a Dom\u2019s care. Massaging blood back into her limbs. Caressing the spots where the rope had abraded her skin. Running those rough hands over her body, not with punishment, but with reverence.</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s instinct was to give into the sleepiness. She didn\u2019t want to ask him what she\u2019d done to deserve that treatment. He was accustomed to her reluctance to discuss a scene immediately after it ended. But this time she wouldn\u2019t let it slide. She swallowed hard and managed to eke out one word. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifference between what?\u201d</p><p>He bestowed sweet kisses on her lips. \u201cYou accused me of usin\u2019 you. What I did to you tonight? That was usin\u2019 you. Has it ever been like that between us before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it won\u2019t be again.\u201d</p><p>She broke down completely. It was hard to be humbled. But she\u2019d needed it. Needed a reminder of what Bennett really was\u2014a dominant man to the bone. But he wasn\u2019t a taker. He wasn\u2019t a user. She\u2019d signed on for this experience as his submissive. Bennett was who he was. A Dom. A teacher. A taskmaster. This was how he\u2019d be to the next sub in line after their thirty days together ended. She\u2019d never be special to him.</p><p>That made her sob harder.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, angel. Let it out. I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Bennett\u2019s hands were in constant motion over every inch of her bare skin. He nuzzled, touched and murmured to her. Using his entire being to soothe her.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t help. When she began to shake, not even the inferno of his skin against hers warmed her. He practically carried her to the shower. Holding her beneath the blessedly hot water as the jets pummeled her sore muscles and the steam thawed her from the outside in.</p><p>And when the tremors ended, she let the last tears fall, feeling more vulnerable now than any other time with him.</p><p>Run. Get out of here now and don\u2019t look back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she lied in a whisper against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? We can stay in here as long as you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>With those long, muscular arms, he grabbed towels hanging from the racks. He tied one turban-style around her head. Dried her thoroughly with the other, and wrapped a bath sheet around her body. He led her back into the bedroom and wrapped her with his robe before tucking her between the covers.</p><p>Bennett gathered her in his arms and piled another blanket on top of them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still so cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not cold. You\u2019re shaken. And it\u2019s my...\u201d Resting his chin on the top of her head, he said gruffly, \u201cNever mind. It\u2019ll keep. Sleep.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t sleep. When she wiggled out of his arms, he let her. When she crept out of his house a few hours later, he let her do that too.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you so pissy about today?\u201d</p><p>Ben scowled at Quinn. \u201cI\u2019m not pissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you always stomp around and throw shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m in a bad mood. Can we leave it at that and get this damn thing fixed?\u201d</p><p>Quinn sighed. \u201cThis is beyond what either of us can fix.\u201d He kicked the tire. \u201cLet\u2019s load it up and take it to D and F.\u201d</p><p>Ben bit back a snarl. His brother might\u2019ve said that, oh, an hour ago when they first started dicking with the ATV. \u201cI\u2019ll go get the trailer.\u201d But when he got to the backside of the barn, he saw both tires were flat. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d They only had one spare. Which meant they\u2019d have to take both tires off and see if they were salvageable.</p><p>A shadow appeared beside him. \u201cGuess I shoulda checked that before now, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Ben pushed upright. \u201cI\u2019ll get the jack.\u201d</p><p>The tire had settled into the ground on the opposite side, making Ben wonder when was the last time they\u2019d used the trailer.</p><p>Out of the blue, Quinn said, \u201cIs it woman trouble? Because only woman trouble puts a look like that on a man\u2019s face. Trust me, I know.\u201d</p><p>The jack clanked. \u201cWhy you doin\u2019 this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoin\u2019 what? Talkin\u2019 to you? I\u2019m pretty sure you ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 to nobody else about this.\u201d</p><p>Ben grunted.</p><p>\u201cCome on. You don\u2019t gotta give me her name, but this is eatin\u2019 at you, bro.\u201d</p><p>Eating at him was putting it mildly. He\u2019d had a hollow feeling in his gut that felt a lot like shame. \u201cI did something...that didn\u2019t seem wrong at the time, but now I\u2019m feeling guilty about it.\u201d He\u2019d taken the harshest stance imaginable with Ainsley\u2014a new sub\u2014showing her what it really meant to be used. Using sex as punishment.</p><p>You think she might\u2019ve been upset? Since she didn\u2019t want you to touch her and she left in the middle of the fucking night?</p><p>What the fuck had he been thinking?</p><p>Because after seeing Ainsley\u2019s flood of tears before she fled, he had an acute sense of failure. As a man. As a lover. As a Dom. For the first time ever, he\u2019d questioned his actions. His rights as her dominant. Whether he\u2019d tried to break a woman, instead of breaking through a woman\u2019s barriers. Whether he\u2019d been punishing her out of his frustration with her.</p><p>The fact he was so upset he couldn\u2019t think straight, or concentrate, indicated he\u2019d stepped over the line. And it sliced his guts to ribbons that she hadn\u2019t said her safe word.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Quinn. \u201cSorry. Did you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering how long ago this happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems a helluva lot longer than just last night.\u201d</p><p>Quinn crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cIs that why you volunteered to take Libby to town last night? To meet up with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, you don\u2019t give an inch. And people say I\u2019m closemouthed? You\u2019ve got me beat by a country mile. Have you tried talkin\u2019 to her about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do plan to, right?\u201d</p><p>Ben tossed the socket to the ground. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat oughta go over well, if you\u2019re as forthcoming with her as you\u2019ve been with me,\u201d Quinn said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just gonna toss this out there. We guys expect women to carry the emotional load in a relationship. I\u2019ve figured out things go to hell when I\u2019m not doin\u2019 my part to tell Libby how I feel. Then she gets upset and won\u2019t talk to me. It\u2019s a damn vicious cycle and an easy one to get into.\u201d</p><p>Quinn had hit it dead on. Ben had been so adamant about Ainsley opening up, about sharing her feelings, both in and out of bed, that he\u2019d neglected to share his own. He\u2019d kept her at arm\u2019s length emotionally, even while he demanded her absolute physical obedience.</p><p>Not only did that make him a bad Dom; that made him a bad man.</p><p>But he had no idea how to fix it. He sighed. \u201cSo got any advice, Q?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 a sincere apology can\u2019t fix, especially if you just started seein\u2019 her, especially if you offer it up front. Then talk to her, really talk to her.\u201d</p><p>The thought of opening up to her scared the crap out of him. He could handle her rejection of him as a Dom. But what if he let her see Ben and she rejected that part of him? The part he didn\u2019t share with women who shared his bed? The side of himself that wasn\u2019t the confident dominant? The guy who felt like an outsider even in his own family? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlowers would help,\u201d Quinn offered, breaking into his thoughts again.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she worth it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not worth it,\u201d he muttered and changed the subject. \u201cWe\u2019re all set to ship cattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOughta be a good year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a nice change from the last few years.\u201d Ben rummaged through the toolbox. \u201cHave you talked to Mom and Dad since they\u2019ve been in Arizona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly. Sounds like Gavin is gonna show up for Chase\u2019s thing this weekend. Which means he\u2019ll meet the rest of the McKays.\u201d</p><p>Ben grinned. \u201cPoor sucker don\u2019t know what he\u2019s in for, does he?\u201d</p> <p>Quinn grinned right back. \u201cNope. But speaking of McKay family gossip...\u201d</p><p>The threat of gossip always put Ben on edge. He carried the fear he\u2019d be outed as a sexual deviant to one of his many family members by someone from the club with an ax to grind\u2014with him personally, or the McKay family as a whole. Discretion was paramount to the Rawhide\u2019s survival. But nothing was failsafe.</p><p>Then he had another jarring thought. If Dalton knew about Rielle\u2019s financial problems, had someone else in the McKay family also found out? And that reminded him that he still hadn\u2019t talked to her. But with Rielle, timing was everything. If he caught her on a bad day, she\u2019d likely warn him off her porch with a shotgun and not listen to a single word he said. Rielle trusted Ben as much as she trusted anyone, and that wasn\u2019t much. So Dalton and Tell had to trust him to know when the time was right to approach her and he\u2019d tell them that if they nagged him about it. \u201cWhat McKay family gossip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently Mom, Aunt Kimi and Aunt Carolyn went to Casper to visit Aunt Joan last week, and she\u2019s got herself a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do her sons know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. I sure ain\u2019t gonna be the one to tell them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m with ya there.\u201d Ben released the jack and pointed to the tires. \u201cI\u2019ll run these into town. See if they\u2019re salvageable.\u201d</p><p>After the tires were loaded into the back of Ben\u2019s truck, Quinn said, \u201cHope to see you in a better mood tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to be in a better mood tomorrow. Thanks for the advice. If it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m blaming you.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley looked totally stunned to see him on her doorstep. Or was that fear in her eyes?</p><p>He smiled, knowing it looked as strained as it felt. \u201cHey, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>Bennett. Not Ben. Dammit. He didn\u2019t want to be her Dom right now.</p><p>So tell her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ben,\u201d he said softly, his heart pounding with fear she\u2019d say something about not seeing a difference.</p><p>\u201cAnd so it is Ben,\u201d she murmured, studying his face. \u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He offered her the bouquet of flowers before he crossed the threshold. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t have plans. I took a chance you\u2019d be home because I wanted to\u2014\u201dexplain, grovel, apologize profusely, beg you not to walk away from me, \u201c\u2014talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I have plans?\u201d</p><p>Her locks were tamed in a ponytail and she wore sweats, not another of those snappy business suits. \u201cYou look great. But you always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth talker. I\u2019ll get these in water.\u201d Ainsley hightailed it to the kitchen.</p><p>Christ. Was she afraid to be alone with him?</p><p>He followed her. When she turned from the sink and saw him, she jumped back. Not a good sign.</p><p>\u201cWould you like coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take something stronger, if you\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBombay Sapphire or raspberry vodka. Obviously my bar isn\u2019t as well stocked as yours.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a quick smile. \u201cI\u2019ll take a shot of the blue stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really blue, silly man. It\u2019s on the shelf behind you, help yourself. Lowball glasses are up there too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I pour you one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She plopped ice cubes in both glasses and added tonic. \u201cLet\u2019s sit in the living room.\u201d</p><p>Ben chose the loveseat opposite the couch, facing her. He looked around. \u201cThis is a great place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. But I know you\u2019re not here to admire my decorating skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am, since I haven\u2019t bothered to show up here before now.\u201d He let his gaze wander. \u201cThe space suits you. Colorful. Classy. But not so formal. I\u2019m glad to see you don\u2019t mind mussing it up.\u201d An afghan hung off one end of the couch. A half-finished crossword puzzle was on the coffee table. Boxes were stacked between the loveseat and chair.</p><p>\u201cYou do have a way with words.\u201d</p><p>Regrets that you didn\u2019t use your safe word last night?</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He forced himself to meet her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m here to make sure you were all right after last night. You snuck out on me. Again. Just like that first night in the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay. Christ, it\u2019s far from okay. Just hear me out, all right? \u2019Cause I\u2019m not used to...doin\u2019 shit like this.\u201d He exhaled a frustrated burst of air. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t fuck up from time to time, but I\u2019ve never had to approach a sub and apologize for my inappropriate Dom behavior.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat I did was out of line. I won\u2019t make excuses. I won\u2019t be the guy who apologizes, and tries to defend his actions after the apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothin\u2019.\u201d Ben studied his drink. \u201cI was wrong. I made the punishment about what I wanted, instead of makin\u2019 it about what you needed. That goes against everything I am as a Dom and as a man. Jesus. I...\u201d He looked into her eyes and felt his stomach bottom out. \u201cAinsley. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI knew it last night. But I appreciate you coming by and saying it and making sure I was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are we okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean am I willing to continue as we were? With me as your submissive for the next couple weeks?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, fear clawing at his throat that he\u2019d fucked this up.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I want to point out that although it was an extreme punishment scene for us, I could\u2019ve said my safe word at any time. I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted you. I still do. Although I was confused during the scene and upset when it ended, I really understand why you did it.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Ben was off the couch, framing her face in his hands, kissing her with sweetness, passion and gratitude. He murmured, \u201cThank you,\u201d against her mouth. Taking a moment to rest his forehead to hers. Taking a moment to wallow in relief.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for any Dom and sub play tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll put a buffer between last night and tomorrow night.\u201d He traced the pulse pounding in her throat. \u201cBecause Bennett will be back tomorrow night. Guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley stared at him.</p><p>He bristled under her scrutiny. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a role for you, is it? Not a once in a while thing. It\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Bein\u2019 a Dom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You can tone him down. Put him aside for a while. But he\u2019s always there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I thought it would. Because you\u2019re the real deal in this situation. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m...what is the BDSM term? A tourist. I\u2019m gawking around, wide-eyed, wanting to see and experience everything before I go back to where I belong.\u201d</p><p>His hopes plummeted. \u201cIs that really how you see this playing out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have a few more weeks to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He sat beside her and took her hand. \u201cSomething else you said last week has been bugging me. You accused me of holding back with you. And I realized you\u2019re right. I have been.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because this thing with you scares the living hell out of me and I don\u2019t want you to run out when I open up. \u201cProbably because I\u2019ve only been on one date outside the club in the last three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRecently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple months ago. The awkwardness reminded me why I don\u2019t go on dates. She talked the entire time, tellin\u2019 me all sorts of personal stuff, and she got snippy when I didn\u2019t blab my entire past life history. But it\u2019s a habit because I don\u2019t share personal things about myself at the club. I just share my body and my expertise. Crude, but true. So when you started asking me questions about what I like to do outside the club and at the ranch, I automatically dodged the questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel I\u2019m prying into your life beyond the Dom/sub parameters we set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, this situation is unlike any other for me too. I can\u2019t fall into that same pattern with you.\u201d Ben touched her face. \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo really get to know you beyond those Dom/sub parameters. To let you get to know me. To hang out.\u201d He didn\u2019t add like normal people, because what was normal for other people probably wouldn\u2019t ever be enough for them. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful night. Would you take a drive with me?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to respond.</p><p>So he gave her an out. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you say no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go.\u201d Ainsley pecked him on the mouth. \u201cLet me grab a coat.\u201d</p><p>Ben opened the passenger door of his truck and helped her inside. The night air held a cold bite, which meant the end of the Indian summer was near.</p><p>Neither spoke as the pickup rolled away from Sundance. The sky was full-on dark. Hills and valleys that during the day were lined with fall\u2019s glorious gold and red hues were austere shadows at night. The truck\u2019s tires clacked against the road\u2019s grooved surface and they didn\u2019t meet another vehicle for ten minutes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Welcome to Wyoming.</p><p>He turned onto a gravel road. The steep, twisty incline had Ainsley reaching for the strap above the door. \u201cGood idea to hang on. It\u2019ll straighten out here in a minute.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they crested the hill, trees flanked the plateau. A plateau where nothing blocked the magnificent view of Devil\u2019s Tower.</p> <p>She leaned closer to the windshield. \u201cOh wow.\u201d</p><p>Ben cut the engine and the lights. \u201cI brought blankets so we can sit outside.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the tailgate, covering the cold metal with an old sleeping bag. He wrapped a blanket around them, bringing her close to his body. \u201cWarm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stayed snuggled together, soaking in the brilliance of the stars, content with quiet.</p> <p>After a while, she said, \u201cThis is such a gorgeous spot. I didn\u2019t know it was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird when you\u2019re used to living among scenery like this\u2014\u201d he gestured to the sprawling grand vista, \u201c\u2014it becomes easy to take it for granted. So I come here when I need to be humbled.\u201d</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his. \u201cI\u2019m happy you brought me to a place that matters to you. It is beyond amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t think I dragged you out here because I was too cheap to take you someplace else.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley snickered. \u201cBut I need to ask... Did you bring girlfriends here when you were in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s always been my private place. Well, as private as a public place can be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever come to any life-altering decisions while soaking in the scenery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven that my workin\u2019 life had been predetermined by bein\u2019 born into a ranching family, I\u2019ll say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever resentful that path was expected for you? And then Chase got to go off and do his own thing?\u201d</p><p>The depth of the questions surprised him. Like she\u2019d just been waiting for the chance to ask. \u201cThere are days, but I\u2019ll admit those days are rare. I\u2019ll also admit I\u2019d probably feel differently about that life if I hadn\u2019t found my place in the club. Besides I\u2019ve always known my station in life regarding our section of the ranch.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI was under the impression the McKay Ranch was one entity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. But it\u2019s complicated with the additions to the original ranch land. My Uncle Carson and his sons have been buying up land for the last fifteen years. So has my Uncle Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family hasn\u2019t added on?\u201d</p><p>Not yet. \u201cNot much. First there\u2019s gotta be land around us for sale to buy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWorking with the ag industry will be a whole new experience for me. I\u2019ll be taking a course after the first of the year that deals with land lease rights, mineral rights, and how it can affect the added value of the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve owned land lease rights for over a hundred years, in some places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how does it work? Dividing the work and the money when there are so many family members involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe divvy up responsibilities. Technically all the cattle belong to all of us. We divide them up according to land size. Out here it takes about thirty-five acres to sustain one cow. So those in the family who\u2019ve bought more land run more cattle, so they make more money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLand equals money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. As far as the rest? We\u2019ve got common ranch equipment to use. Feed is divided up between us because we work together to get the haying done. We\u2019re all paid out of the expenses account. Gotta watch those pennies bein\u2019s we\u2019re only paid individually once a year after the cattle have gone to market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could handle only getting a check once a year.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it goes. So I\u2019m glad I get some extra cash from my furniture makin\u2019 sideline.\u201d Which reminded him he needed to check on what the holdup was for payment on his last completed furniture order. He\u2019d need that money sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cDoes Chase have any stake in the ranch? Seems like he\u2019s not around to pitch in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe opted out last year and took a cash settlement. I did talk to Chase today. He\u2019s excited about the event Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Lucky for us it fit into his schedule so last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s done with the PBR tour for the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it like? Having your sibling a celebrity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase is Chase. He\u2019s the same way now as he was when he was a kid.\u201d He smiled. \u201cA spoiled brat. But he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d That\u2019s when Ben realized Ainsley was doing it again, directing the conversation. \u201cHere you\u2019re asking all about my family. You must think I\u2019m a total dick because I\u2019ve never asked about yours.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley started to swing her legs on the tailgate. \u201cNot a lot to tell. My parents are missionaries. They\u2019re out of the country for a couple years at a time so I don\u2019t see them much. Everything changed between us after I escaped to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Escaped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent my childhood in third world countries. All I ever wanted was a normal life. Living in the suburbs, going to school with kids my age, hanging out at the mall with friends, having sleepovers talking about boys, clothes and other girls. Even when we were in the States I didn\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad requested assignments in rural areas, so we lived on various Indian reservations. I was the outsider white girl everywhere, even in my own country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d had visions of reinventing myself when I started college, but I played it safe. I didn\u2019t want to become a clich\u00e9d wild child, rebelling against my father being a minister.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s thumb traced circles on her palm. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re goin\u2019 wild now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wild. I\u2019m exploring whether I have a wild side, remember? I\u2019m not sure this Dom/sub thing is more than an experiment. I think I\u2019m too old to be learning new tricks.\u201d</p><p>Had she brought up her doubts because of last night? Or was it a warning that no matter how much he opened up to her, there wasn\u2019t a chance this could last longer than the thirty days? Ben asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeetering on the edge of thirty-eight. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t me sucking up, but I thought you were younger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley groaned. \u201cGreat. Now I am a clich\u00e9. Not a wild child daughter of a preacher man, but a cougar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge don\u2019t matter. I\u2019d still be the boss of you even if we were the same age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember saying that to my older brother. You\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d She shot him a sideways glance. \u201cThat totally takes on a different meaning now.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He seemed to laugh a lot with her.</p><p>The first edge of the moon peeped up over the top of Devil\u2019s Tower. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking. Now I understand the phrase moon glow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait. In another hour you\u2019ll barely see the stars because the sky will be lit up.\u201d</p><p>Once again silence fell between them, allowing Ben to study her covertly. He was captivated by the play of moonbeams highlighting her face. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley looked at him and then away.</p><p>\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just...disconcerting. You\u2019ve given me more compliments in a week than...I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what you were gonna say.\u201d He tugged her closer by the collar on her coat and got right in her face. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Bennett. I wondered if he\u2019d make an appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gets pissy when you rip on yourself. So tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her exhalations puffed against his lips. \u201cYou see me in a different way than I see myself. You can make me feel sexy and pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are sexy and pretty.\u201d He pressed smooches to her lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you give me such awesome compliments? They\u2019re sincere. Not toss off comments because you want to get laid.\u201d She rubbed her mouth over his. \u201cYou know I\u2019m a sure thing. So I appreciate them even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only sure thing about you, angel, is you keep me on my toes. I don\u2019t take for granted that you\u2019re a sure thing because you can stop this at any time. And after last night...I was really afraid you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d Ainsley placed a kiss on his chin. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you that this won\u2019t end, but I want to see it through until the end date we agreed on. Okay?\u201d</p><p>That was more than he\u2019d hoped for, but not nearly enough, and it\u2019d have to do for now. He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Ainsley had expected a decent turnout for the community event National West and Settler\u2019s First had co-sponsored for Chase McKay and his foundation. But she hadn\u2019t expected standing room only. She\u2019d had to restock her bank information brochures and giveaway items within the first fifteen minutes. The fishbowl overflowed into a cardboard box with entries for the five hundred dollar drawing.</p><p>Forty-five minutes remained until the golden boy himself, Chase McKay, made an appearance.</p><p>She\u2019d seen Ben, not that he\u2019d sought her out. He couldn\u2019t\u2014being surrounded by a bevy of beauties limited his movement. Really, it was ridiculous. He was good looking. And he did have that sexy dimpled chin. And those expressive blue eyes. And a great body. And that deep, commanding voice. Those women were enticed by the pretty packaging. But those women didn\u2019t know him, the real him, not like she did.</p><p>Jealous much?</p><p>Truthfully, she hadn\u2019t expected to see him, with his brother being the guest of honor. Several tables had been reserved for the McKay family near the stage. Kids of varying ages, with the same black hair and blue eyes as Ben, pawed through the freebie bin until they all came up with matching whistles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leslie brought her a soda and an oatmeal raisin cookie during a lull. Turton had volunteered to make the presentation, but Ainsley feared his monotone would put the audience to sleep. She wasn\u2019t a nervous speaker. She\u2019d given many presentations in her career, so it bothered her she had the heart pounding, stomach-churning attack of nerves today. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been this jittery.</p><p>Yes, you can. That second night with Bennett in the club. And the first night with Bennett in the club. And every night since.</p><p>Not exactly the best timing for those reminders to pop up.</p> <p>Steve Talbot, the bank president from Settler\u2019s First, wandered over, holding his fishbowl full of entry slips. \u201cShall we get this started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Ainsley grabbed her cardboard box and followed Steve up to the stage.</p><p>\u201cLadies first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou the closer?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve got seniority.\u201d</p> <p>Mayor Gilbert quieted everyone down. \u201cBefore we get to the main event with Chase McKay, we\u2019ll hear from today\u2019s sponsors. Ainsley Hamilton, president of National West Bank, will say a few words about Sundance\u2019s newest bank.\u201d</p><p>Polite clapping.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mayor Gilbert. I\u2019m Ainsley Hamilton, a recent transplant to Wyoming, and I\u2019d like to thank everyone for the excitement and support in welcoming National West Bank and its employees to the Sundance community. We\u2019re honored to sponsor Chase McKay\u2019s appearance and to support his foundation. Since National West Bank is the new kid on the block, we wanted to show our pride in being part of this great community, alongside with Settler\u2019s First, in providing Sundance residents with banking choices. If you\u2019re interested in more information, visit our booth, or better yet, come on in to the bank and see what National West can offer you.\u201d She exhaled, glad she\u2019d kept her speech short and concise. \u201cNow onto the money drawing portion, which I know is why you\u2019re all hanging onto my every word.\u201d That comment brought laughter. \u201cI\u2019ll need a volunteer to pick a name out of the box.\u201d</p><p>Immediately five kids rushed to stage. Four boys and one girl. Tempting to pick the dark-haired girl since she\u2019d elbowed three bigger boys to wind up in front. But Ainsley chose the smallest boy with the biggest hat, who trailed behind the others. She pointed at him. \u201cCome on up here, young cowboy.\u201d</p><p>The kid didn\u2019t go around and take the stairs. He took a running jump and threw himself onto the stage.</p><p>This amused everyone at the tables off to the left.</p> <p>Ainsley bent down. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiles McKay.\u201d The kid practically shouted the last part, which incited more laughter.</p><p>Didn\u2019t it just figure she\u2019d pick a McKay? \u201cSo, Miles, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bull rider like my daddy and like Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always admired a man who knows what he wants and goes after it. Have your dad and Chase given you any advice?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cStay on eight seconds.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>What a charmer. \u201cOkay, Miles, stick your hand in and pick out a winner.\u201d</p> <p>Miles stirred the pieces of paper before he found the one he liked. When he looked up from beneath the brim of his little black hat, with those vivid blue eyes and serious expression, Ainsley immediately thought of another dark-haired, blue-eyed cowboy charmer. She almost said, \u201cThanks, Ben,\u201d but caught herself and said, \u201cThanks, Miles. The winner of the five hundred dollars is...Alison Toomey!\u201d</p><p>After she exited the stage, Steve grabbed the microphone. \u201cThanks to National West Bank and Ainsley Hamilton.\u201d He addressed the people at the front tables. \u201cWatch out for that one, McKay family. Don\u2019t be fooled by her charm, she\u2019s only out for your banking business.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley plastered a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get down to it.\u201d Steve did his spiel.</p><p>When he finished, Mayor Gilbert took over. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring out the man we\u2019re proud to call our own, the man who represents the great state of Wyoming and our western way of life, the man who honors his family and his ranching heritage, the man who is bold enough to take a stand for what he believes in. Ladies and gentleman, please welcome home to Sundance, Chase McKay.\u201d</p><p>Thunderous applause echoed in the room.</p><p>Ainsley watched Chase saunter onto the stage. He was shorter than she\u2019d expected, but more powerfully built than Ben. He had a quick smile and quick wit. His smooth confidence in front of a crowd didn\u2019t come off as rehearsed, but polished, as if a PR department had groomed him. As Chase spoke, she recognized similarities he shared with Ben. Hand gestures. Thoughtful pauses. Not to mention those rugged good looks.</p><p>She was so lost in thought about Ben and his family dynamic that she nearly missed being called to the stage. Leslie pushed her with a, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the sponsors of this event, National West Bank and Settler\u2019s First Bank, are contributing five thousand dollars each to the Chase McKay Foundation.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley and Steve stepped forward with the big, fake checks. Flashing light bulbs nearly blinded her, the applause was deafening. Where had all the camera crews come from?</p><p>Chase seemed genuinely stunned by the donation. When it quieted down, Chase took the microphone and looked at the tables on the left. \u201cAva, darlin\u2019, did you get all that?\u201d</p><p>She said something, which he didn\u2019t hear. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on up here and say hello?\u201d</p><p>More raucous applause.</p><p>A stunning brunette bounded onto the stage and stood beside Chase. She was a good six inches taller in spike heels. Chase swept her into his arms and laid a passionate kiss on her that made the crowd go nuts. He finally set her down, but wouldn\u2019t let go of her hand. \u201cHave y\u2019all met my beautiful wife? Ava Cooper Dumond McKay. Ava is workin\u2019 on two documentaries about bull ridin\u2019, and she\u2019s hopin\u2019 to have at least one of them done next spring. Thank you all for comin\u2019 out this afternoon.\u201d Chase and Ava left the stage and a swarm of photographers followed them.</p><p>The crowd vanished quickly. She, Leslie and Rita tore down the display and loaded it in Rita\u2019s Suburban. She returned inside to double-check she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything. She noticed the poster tacked to the backdrop, but she couldn\u2019t quite reach the pushpin.</p><p>A warm, familiar body moved in behind her and murmured, \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t budge for several seconds. She just closed her eyes and absorbed the feeling of having him so close.</p><p>Then he stepped away.</p><p>She straightened her sweater and skirt before she faced him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did great up there. Everybody was real impressed. But I bet you\u2019re used to doin\u2019 presentation stuff like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done it a time or three hundred.\u201d</p><p>His gaze moved from her gray pumps, up her calves and over the black wool skirt that clung to her thighs and hips, then lingered on her breasts molded by the gray angora sweater. The palpable heat in his blue eyes made her thighs clench. \u201cGoddamn you look good enough to eat.\u201d He grinned. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley grinned back. \u201cThat can be arranged. Do you have plans tonight?\u201d</p><p>Ben shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cAh, my folks are havin\u2019 a family thing at their place since Chase is in town, as well as our brother Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course your family wants to gather and celebrate Chase\u2019s success. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a great time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think dodging screamin\u2019 kids and nosy relatives is fun,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. It\u2019s just all the McKays are comin\u2019, which means all of their kids. God love \u2019em, but I\u2019m ready to schedule a vasectomy after about an hour. And guaranteed this shindig will last much longer than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarge families are almost another culture to people like me, who have one sibling and half a dozen cousins, total.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d wanna come with me?\u201d he blurted.</p><p>That shocked her. \u201cReally? Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d That too-blue gaze pinned her in place. \u201cDo you have plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, but won\u2019t your family think it\u2019s odd that you\u2019re showing up with me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cSteve Talbot will be there. It\u2019s only fair the rep from the other bank gets an invite too.\u201d</p><p>So this wasn\u2019t personal. She wouldn\u2019t be showing up on Ben McKay\u2019s arm as his date. Another shard of disappointment sliced her. \u201cAlthough I appreciate the invite...\u201d She fiddled with the sleeve of her sweater. \u201cI\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze zoomed to his at his command.</p><p>\u201cThat was a lie, okay? I don\u2019t want you to come because your bank contributed to Chase\u2019s fund. I want you to come for me. I mean, I\u2019d like it if you came with me. Not as my girlfriend or anything, because Christ, no one in my family would leave either of us alone, and I wouldn\u2019t put anyone through that.\u201d He offered her a shy smile. \u201cSo would you consider goin\u2019 as my...friend?\u201d</p><p>Why did Ben\u2019s honesty surprise her? Even when it hurt her a little? And was he trying to kill her with that sweet little boy smile?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that. Do I need to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlattery won\u2019t get you anywhere, friend.\u201d A thought occurred to her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t using me to fend off questions from your family about why you\u2019re not in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cBusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kiddin\u2019. Sounds like you\u2019ve had the same \u2018when are you gonna find a nice girl and settle down?\u2019 questions from your family that I\u2019ve had from mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, mine are more along the lines of \u2018don\u2019t let the bitterness from your divorce keep you from finding a good man\u2019 and then my mother asks how many cats I\u2019ve got.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben chuckled. \u201cIf anyone asks, let\u2019s tell them we\u2019re too busy fucking like rabbits to find someone decent to settle down with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear if anything remotely close to that leaves your lips, Bennett McKay, the only thing you\u2019ll be fucking in the very near future is your fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d He smirked. \u201cCome on. You can ride with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if I drove? So if it gets too uncomfortable I can leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I wanna give you a ride? That\u2019ll give me an excuse to leave too.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley convinced him to stop and pick up flowers for his mother, so they were late.</p><p>As he sensed the questioning looks from his family members, Ben realized it\u2019d been fucking idiotic, lying to Ainsley, telling her that he didn\u2019t want to show up at his folk\u2019s place, acting like she was his girlfriend. He wanted to hold her hand and lead her through the maze of relatives, introducing her as his. He wanted to sneak a kiss from her in the food line. He wanted...so much more than she did, apparently, because his question about her going just as his friend had been a test of sorts, but he wasn\u2019t sure which one of them had failed it.</p><p>He watched as she made the rounds with his family, so beautiful and confident and real. For the first time he allowed himself to wonder what would happen when the month was up. Would Ainsley be interested in seeing more of him? And if so, did she want him as Bennett, the man who took great pleasure in awakening her darker sexual needs? Or would she want Ben, the rancher? Maybe she\u2019d want neither and she\u2019d just walk away. That made him want to punch something.</p> <p>Ben stared out the dining room window to the darkness beyond, mentally planning his weekly to-do list instead of obsessively watching Ainsley. A hand clapped him on the back and he stiffened. He hated Steve Talbot\u2019s fake show of camaraderie.</p><p>\u201cBen. Good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalbot. Thanks for comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d Steve tossed a glance over his shoulder. \u201cBut I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m surprised you brought my competitor to a family event.\u201d</p><p>Ben couldn\u2019t very well point out the fact Steve wasn\u2019t family and he was here. \u201cThe community event was Ainsley\u2019s brain child, so she should be here. Besides, Chase wouldn\u2019t have had any local recognition if not for Ainsley\u2019s efforts on behalf of National West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is...determined to fit into the community right away, isn\u2019t she? That might be seen as trying too hard. Being too aggressive. Few folks around here like a pushy woman like that.\u201d</p> <p>His brain urged him not to take the bait, but his mouth had already gulped the hook. \u201cThat\u2019s a damn sight better than not tryin\u2019 at all.\u201d</p><p>Steve\u2019s laugh was forced. \u201cI see the lovely Miss Hamilton has a champion in you, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t find fault with supporting a hard worker\u2014regardless of gender.\u201d A phrase that had never applied to Steve Talbot. With that, Ben walked away.</p><p>Hopefully his prickly behavior with Talbot wouldn\u2019t bite him in the ass if he needed to call on the man for a loan. Made Ben shudder to give that man more power and leverage over him.</p><p>He snagged a soda and found a spot in the dining room where he could keep an eye on Ainsley in case she needed rescuing.</p><p>Right. You just wanna watch her ass wiggle in that sexy tight skirt.</p><p>As soon as Tell and Dalton saw he was alone, they approached him. Tell spoke first. \u201cSo you got any news for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Rielle yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d Dalton demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause she can be prickly as a damn cactus. Any time I\u2019ve seen her, she\u2019s in one of them moods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because everything is closing in on her.\u201d Tell leaned closer. \u201cYou need to get this deal done, Ben. Soon.\u201d</p><p>He was half tempted to tell them to take a shot at talking to her if they thought it was so fucking easy. \u201cI get that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d Dalton\u2019s gaze flicked to the banker. \u201cWhat were you and Talbot talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing important. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just wondering if you were asking him about a loan, to cover, you know, your portion. Because if this is about money, we can front you some cash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about money. Jesus.\u201d His cheeks heated. \u201cI said I\u2019d take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that you do because we don\u2019t wanna lose out on this,\u201d Tell warned.</p><p>Then they took off, leaving Ben to brood.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Chase slumped against the wall next to him. \u201cYou been hidin\u2019 over here the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiding.\u201d Ben snorted. \u201cAs if anyone could hide in here. I\u2019m glad Mom and Dad built that three-season room or we\u2019d only get to invite half the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us would\u2019ve minded that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But Mom\u2019s really happy everyone is at our place for a change. Seems we\u2019ve always had to go to Uncle Carson\u2019s house for get-togethers.\u201d</p><p>Chase sipped his beer. \u201cHow much do you think Mom\u2019s happiness has to do with Gavin showing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome, I reckon. But I also figure that\u2019s the reason the whole fam-damly is here. To get a good look at him. No offense, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too. I still think it\u2019s weird he ain\u2019t stayin\u2019 here. Especially since Mom and Dad stayed at his place in Arizona.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Ava ain\u2019t stayin\u2019 here either,\u201d Ben pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fault me\u2019n the missus for wanting to stay in Kane\u2019s trailer, since it holds special significance for us.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cRight. You and Ava are afraid Mom and Dad will hear you two havin\u2019 loud sex all night long.\u201d</p><p>Chase shot him a sideways glance. \u201cWe are newlyweds. Besides, maybe me\u2019n the missus are afraid we\u2019ll hear the folks havin\u2019 wall-thumping sex all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll have to scrub my brain with scotch to erase that image. And gee, ain\u2019t it cute how you\u2019re always calling Ava the missus now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. We\u2019ll see how you act when you fall in love with the woman of your dreams. You won\u2019t wanna wait to put a ring on her finger and call her yours.\u201d Chase hadn\u2019t let grass grow under his feet where Ava was concerned. As soon as she\u2019d agreed to marry him, he\u2019d whisked her off to Hawaii for a private ceremony on the beach.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever get married.\u201d Ben\u2019s gaze automatically sought out Ainsley. She was talking animatedly with his Uncle Carson and Uncle Cal. And she didn\u2019t miss a beat when Steve Talbot horned in on their conversation. What a rude asshole.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know the new bank prez pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSundance is a small town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s nothin\u2019 goin\u2019 on between you and the banker?\u201d Chase asked.</p><p>Ben curbed his intent to remind Chase that Ainsley had a name beyond the banker. \u201cNothin\u2019 worth mentioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really an answer. You lyin\u2019 to me? Or just lyin\u2019 to yourself?\u201d</p><p>Both. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can talk about, okay? Can we just leave it at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But I\u2019ll remind you of all the times you felt entitled to poke your nose in my love life.\u201d He laughed. \u201cAlthough, to be honest, it only became a love life after I met the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean the missus?\u201d Ben made soft kissing noises.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re an asshole sometimes. And nice try, deflecting my questions. I just wanted to throw out that anytime you wanna talk about this, or anything else...just call me. I owe you, for all the times you pulled my head outta my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Chase. I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t one to brag, but I\u2019ve gotten good at this touchy feely shit since meeting my Ava Rose.\u201d Chase belched. \u201cSpeakin\u2019 of...gotta see what my missus is up to.\u201d</p><p>Ben had a strange pang of jealousy when Chase swept Ava into his arms and plopped her on his lap, kissing her soundly. They were so in love, so attuned to each other\u2014so oblivious to assorted family members shouting at them to get a room.</p><p>He had time to study how his family clustered together. His cousin\u2019s wives, Channing, Macie, AJ, Ginger and India had babies propped on their hips. His mom, Aunt Carolyn and Aunt Kimi were carting around their grandkids. Tell, Dalton, Brandt and Jessie had formed their own group in the living room corner. The rest of his cousins were outside because it was damn hot in here. The horde of kids running in and out every ten seconds hadn\u2019t done much to cool the place off.</p><p>No one bothered him. The groups shifted. He saw his sister-in-law Libby bustling around in the kitchen with Domini and Skylar. No surprise Keely had cornered Gavin, but from the looks of it, Gavin was holding his own.</p><p>He realized while amusing himself with his family\u2019s antics, he\u2019d lost track of Ainsley. He turned and there she was. \u201cHey. I was wondering where you\u2019d gone off to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been behind you the last fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d be easy to get overlooked in this family, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ben let her insightful comment pass. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to share my section of wall if you don\u2019t mind bein\u2019 overlooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She scooted next to him, but not right next to him. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty quiet around your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorta hard to get a word in edgewise, if you hadn\u2019t noticed,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI met Quinn. He\u2019s...reserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly around people he doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know his family? Because he hasn\u2019t said much to them either.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that way with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you two talk at all when you\u2019re working together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. If something needs said. But neither one of us jaws on and on just to fill the silence.\u201d He let his arm dangle by hers. \u201cWhat enlightening things did you learn about other McKays?\u201d</p><p>A panicked look crossed her face. \u201cI\u2019ll never keep the names straight. I asked your cousin...Keely? If they\u2019d developed a smart phone app for the family tree. I was kidding but her husband seemed serious about it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019d buy one. Then I\u2019d have a reference point for each new baby and that baby\u2019s siblings. I think I called Colby\u2019s second boy the wrong name for the better part of a year.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cGod I love to hear you laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAinsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019ve been thinking about the first thing I\u2019m gonna do to you after I peel off that sexy skirt. It makes your ass look amazing, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to his mouth and she licked her lips. \u201cWhat idea is winning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tie right now between smacking your ass until you come, or fucking it until you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that. Here in your mother\u2019s house, with all your relatives within earshot.\u201d</p><p>His smile held no guilt whatsoever. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t hear you sayin\u2019 no.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley cocked her head, acting coy. \u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to decide which option holds more appeal for me, Bennett. Not that you\u2019d give me a say.\u201d</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Ben reached for her hand and squeezed before releasing it. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a say, but there is a condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe leave right fucking now.\u201d</p><p>Her hazel eyes heated to a molten gold. Those ripe lips curled into a smirk. \u201cI am feeling tired, now that you mention it.\u201d</p><p>It took ten minutes to say goodbye, and Ben knew he\u2019d missed people. If it\u2019d been up to him, they would\u2019ve just left, but Ainsley was too polite for that.</p><p>Once they were finally in his truck, he said, \u201cStraight to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car is still at the community center. I need to get it and I\u2019ll follow you out.\u201d</p> <p>He kept hold of her hand, absentmindedly running his thumb over her knuckles. He\u2019d thought the simple touch would soothe him, would lessen his overwhelming need to pull his truck over and fuck her blind. But it only made him more impatient. He shifted in his seat, trying to combat the pressure from his jeans on his already hard cock. Trying to combat the pressure inside himself he didn\u2019t quite understand.</p><p>He\u2019d been with her last night. Pushing her limits. Mixing it up. Not holding back on his Dom side, but keeping their slap and tickle more focused on the tickle side, than the slap. Using the flogger on the front side of her body. Holding her on edge, waiting for the multi-point sting that never connected. She hadn\u2019t acted frustrated, especially not when he\u2019d set the flogger aside and fucked her, face-to-face. Taking his time, building up, pulling back, dragging out the pleasure for an hour before letting them both come. Afterward, Ainsley had been so exhausted, she\u2019d crawled in his bed and had fallen asleep. And like some kind of lovesick sap, he\u2019d crawled in bed beside her and watched her sleep, unable to stop from touching her even when she wasn\u2019t aware he was doing it.</p><p>He had no fucking idea what was wrong with him.</p><p>He parked next to her car, noticing it wasn\u2019t the only one left in the lot. He took her hand and helped her from the cab.</p><p>She surprised him with a kiss. \u201cCan I just say that I really love how you always open my door? And walk me to my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers toyed with the snaps on his shirt. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re antsy. My place is closer than yours. So since I have some say in tonight\u2019s fun and games, can we play there? You could even keep your truck parked here, if you\u2019re worried about someone seeing it parked in my drive.\u201d</p><p>She was worried about his reputation? Right.</p><p>But he was too horny to care.</p><p>\u201cDrive.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Wally and Charo usually greeted her at the door no matter what time she rolled in, complaining loudly, and sniffing her shoes. Not tonight.</p><p>Ainsley flipped on the lamps in the living room. She shut the shades. She fought the need to tidy up\u2014straighten the fleece blanket draped over the couch, gather the newspaper and mug on the coffee table. How could she be so nervous in her own house?</p><p>\u201cAinsley.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, definitely in Dom mode now, nonchalantly leaning against the wall. With that look in his eye. The man knew how to smolder. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>A mere twenty steps across the small space and she stood in front of him. More nervous than before.</p><p>Bennett ran his knuckles down her cheek. Then he cupped her chin and traced the outline of her lips with his thumb. \u201cPut your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t think. He\u2019d tell her exactly what he wanted her to do. And that was exactly what she wanted. After being in charge all day, she\u2019d gladly let Bennett take charge of her.</p><p>His hand fell to his waist and he worked his belt buckle, his midnight-blue eyes remained locked on hers.</p><p>She lowered to the carpet. She unzipped his jeans and yanked the denim until the jeans were around his ankles. He\u2019d gone commando. His cock bounced against his belly.</p><p>He threaded both his hands through her hair and brought her face to his groin. \u201cTake all of me.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she let Bennett guide her where he wanted. The wet tip of his cock brushed her lips. She opened her mouth wider, as the hard flesh slipped over her tongue. When the cockhead bumped into her soft palate, she fought the gag reflex until she took his entire length.</p><p>He held her head in place and said, \u201cSwallow.\u201d</p><p>Her throat muscles constricted around the head and he groaned.</p><p>\u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley exhaled and swallowed twice in rapid succession.</p><p>\u201cChrist that\u2019s good. Enough.\u201d Bennett slowly eased back. \u201cSuck me hard.\u201d</p><p>Her hands clamped onto his butt cheeks to bring his body closer. His balls bumped her chin. Then she started to suck.</p><p>Bennett broke that tight suction each time as he pulled back until the rim of his cock scraped against her teeth. He permitted her to moisten her lips before he slid his shaft in, again lodging his cock in her throat. \u201cAh, fuck. I could watch you all night. You\u2019re hot as fire on your knees with my dick filling your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. Not feeling passive, but powerful.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty.\u201d His fingers lovingly mapped every plane and angle of her face. \u201cSo obedient. Make me come, angel.\u201d He kept his hands on her cheeks as he pumped in and out of her mouth with short, fast jabs.</p><p>Ainsley worked the tip, flicking her tongue beneath the head as she sucked in opposition to his thrusts.</p><p>His hands tightened, his breath quickened and he made a guttural sound as he came in hot spurts.</p><p>A haze of satisfaction coursed through her as she swallowed. She kept tonguing and sucking until he squeezed her jaw, forcing her to release him.</p><p>Bennett slumped against the wall with a heavy sigh.</p><p>She remained on her knees, running her fingertips up his naked flanks as she nuzzled his belly. Enjoying touching him.</p><p>\u201cAinsley,\u201d he said in that sex-roughened voice. He wrapped his hands around her biceps and brought her to her feet. His gaze was firmly fixed on her mouth. \u201cI love seein\u2019 your lips lookin\u2019 so shiny and full after you blow me. It\u2019s goddamn sexy.\u201d He leaned forward and brushed his mouth over hers. Twice. Then he murmured, \u201cGet your vibrator.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated long enough that he quirked the one eyebrow that said, Why you still here questioning me? and she hustled to her bedroom nightstand.</p><p>Since Bennett hadn\u2019t specified which vibrator, she chose the most basic silver bullet model. She returned to the living room to find he\u2019d rearranged the furniture, placing a straight-backed kitchen chair across from one of the green parson\u2019s chairs. He\u2019d yanked up his jeans and kicked off his boots. His posture as he rested his backside into her couch might\u2019ve been standoffish\u2014arms folded over his chest\u2014but the heat in his eyes nearly set her clothes on fire.</p><p>\u201cUnderwear off. Pantyhose off.\u201d He grinned ferally. \u201cBut go ahead and put them high heels back on.\u201d</p><p>After she strapped on the heels, he held his hand out for the vibrator and pointed to the kitchen chair.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about since I saw you up on that stage, looking so damn professional in that sexy-assed skirt?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHow much I wanna see your hand up that skirt getting yourself off.\u201d He studied her. \u201cHave you ever done that? Been so horny that you had to take care of yourself in your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t done it. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Bennett parked himself on the parson\u2019s chair less than five feet from where she sat. \u201cThink about it. You\u2019re dressed so prim and proper, but your thoughts are so naughty. You\u2019re so desperate to come you\u2019ve locked your office door. No one can see you. No one knows what you\u2019re doin\u2019. Show me what you\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse skyrocketed. Bennett liked to play games. Her hands trembled as she inched her fingers down the silky fabric covering her legs. When she reached the hem, she tugged the skirt upward, not in a strip tease but trying to keep her thunder thighs from joggling. Once the material circled her hips, she glanced over at Bennett.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself.\u201d</p><p>She palmed her mound, separating her pussy lips with her middle finger. She swirled the tip around the opening, slid it back up and performed the same swirling motion around her clit. Then side to side. Following the slit back down, she pushed her finger inside her pussy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid it make you hot when my cock was in your mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yourself. Use two fingers.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley spread her knees wider and pressed both fingers deep. She moved them in and out, trying not to be embarrassed by the wet sucking noises her body made. She ground her clit into the hard flesh at the base of her thumb.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby, come on. Take it. I can tell you\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>She arched back, removing her hand so her middle finger could flick her clit. So close. So close... Right...there. She gasped, enjoying that sweet, sweet throb of orgasm. In that moment her thoughts were purely selfish. She didn\u2019t think of Bennett at all.</p><p>As the last pulse faded, warm lips landed on hers. Impatient fingers fumbled with the buttons on her sweater. She wanted to sink into the kiss, but Bennett murmured, \u201cOff. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley stood and draped the sweater over the back of the chair. She unbuttoned her skirt and it slithered down her legs to the floor. Bennett\u2019s hands were on the bottom of her lace shell. He pulled it over her head, tossing it aside and attacked the hooks on her bra. Then she was stark naked except for her shoes. And Bennett\u2019s hungry eyes ate up every inch.</p><p>He led her to the bathroom and flipped on all the lights. \u201cUp on your knees. On the counter. Facing the mirror.\u201d</p><p>She actually blurted, \u201cBut why?\u201d before the two hard smacks stung her backside.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Not only did her face heat, but her whole body burned as she scrambled onto the low countertop. She did not want to see all her body flaws in what felt like stadium lighting. Her head fell forward of its own accord and her hair obscured her face.</p><p>Bennett grabbed a handful of hair and jerked her back up. \u201cLook at yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a request.\u201d She watched his big hands in the mirror. His roughness to her softness. Those hard-skinned hands roved over her body. Holding her breasts, teasing her nipples, following the wide shape of her hips to her thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, angel. So bold, yet so compliant. There isn\u2019t anything sexier to me. No question you\u2019re all woman. And how lucky that you\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>A different type of heat, a melting sensation, filled her chest. Bennett knew her so well. Knew when her confidence needed bolstering. Knew when to force her to stop thinking and just feel. Just obey.</p><p>He put her vibrator in her hand. \u201cGet yourself off with this. See how beautiful you are when you let go.\u201d</p><p>One good thing about this scene\u2014the vibrator would get her off quickly. Ainsley braced her left palm against the wall and turned the silver bullet on high.</p><p>As she placed the vibrator tip above her clit, Bennett\u2019s hands cupped her breasts. His fingers toyed with her nipples. Then his mouth connected with the curve of her waist.</p><p>Oh. That felt fantastic. The string of openmouthed kisses down to her lower back. The sharp bite of his teeth and the sweet, soothing kisses he pressed over the skin he\u2019d nipped.</p><p>When goose bumps danced across her body, he chuckled and tweaked her nipples hard.</p><p>She gasped. Then she realized she was supposed to be using the vibrator and set it directly on her clit.</p> <p>\u201cHuh-uh. Not yet. Fuck yourself with it. I wanna see it disappearing into that tight pussy.\u201d</p><p>She rested the length against her slit before she inserted the buzzing object, allowing her head to fall back as she lost herself in pleasure.</p><p>A hard whack on her ass returned her focus to the mirror.</p><p>He bestowed such delicious agony on her back with that wicked mouth of his. She watched in the mirror as she shoved the vibrator into her hole, realizing what a turn on it was to see her swollen, glistening sex swallowing it.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, angel. Show me again.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the bullet out and held the tip directly on her clit. The sights, sounds and vibrations were overwhelming. She moaned when the blood-plumped tissues pulsed and moaned louder when Bennett pinched her nipples.</p><p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>And she did. She didn\u2019t hate the reflection of herself; she reveled in it. She was unapologetically wanton, a sensual woman riding the wave of ecstasy brought about by her lover\u2019s command.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, beautiful. See yourself as I see you.\u201d</p><p>Those sweet words had more impact than back-to-back orgasms.</p><p>Bennett kissed a path up her left side, pausing to nuzzle the bottom of her breast. \u201cGive me the vibrator.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley held out it. Keeping their gazes locked in the mirror, he sucked the bullet into his mouth. Then he licked it clean with long strokes of his tongue, making happy growls before releasing it.</p><p>Okay. That was hot. Talk about stirring her juices again.</p><p>Bennett helped her down from the counter, making sure she was steady on her high-heeled shoes before letting go of her. He whipped off his shirt. Shucked his jeans. Rolled on a condom.</p><p>His eyes were wild with lust. All that masculine impatience was for her. She raised her chin and smirked.</p><p>\u201cOoh. Girl is getting cocky. I\u2019d take that as a personal challenge if my cock wasn\u2019t about to burst. Bend over. Hands on the floor. Spread your legs wide.\u201d</p><p>That commanding Dom voice did it for her in a bad way. Once again her blood raced fast. As soon as her fingertips touched the cold tile, Bennett was behind her, canting her hips to his liking. His fingers pulled her pussy open and he plunged his cock inside to the root.</p><p>Her wet sex closed around his shaft in an intimate kiss.</p><p>He rammed into her, his pelvis pistoning faster with each deep stroke. Taking her how he wanted. Full throttle. No holding back, just hard, quick fucking that left her breathless in its ferocity.</p><p>He went beyond coherent speech. Grunts, groans and ragged breathing were his communication. And Ainsley understood him perfectly.</p><p>His pace slowed and his fingertips dug for purchase on her ass cheeks. She felt his cock lengthen, felt the violent pulsation against her channel. He came in a drawn-out, full-body shudder that she felt down to the tips of her toes.</p><p>Bennett drooped over her, his hand braced against the bathroom door. \u201cGoddamn, woman,\u201d he rasped in her ear. \u201cYou...I...\u201d He laughed. \u201cHell, I can\u2019t think straight. Hang on.\u201d He pushed up and withdrew. He curled his fingers over her shoulders and slowly brought her upright. \u201cStay there.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw him ditch the condom. Then he spun her around and kissed her. Not gently. Not playfully. His kisses were ravenous.</p><p>He opened the door without missing a beat. He herded her backward into her bedroom and didn\u2019t break the seal of their mouths until the backs of her calves hit the mattress. Then he gently sat her down and dropped to his knees. \u201cNow I know why these are called fuck-me shoes. When I saw them today all I could think about was fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I see that they were worth the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d He unhooked the buckle and slipped off the right shoe, taking a moment to massage her arch. Then he did the same with the left shoe.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back the moan of delight when he massaged her left foot. She flopped back on her puffy quilt with a sigh. \u201cA great event, two orgasms, fab sex and a foot massage? I could die happy right now.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and kissed her cheek, settling next to her, letting his calves dangle off the bed beside hers.</p><p>In that moment she knew Ben was back. She reached for his hand. \u201cAre you staying with me tonight? Or do you need to get back to your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I wouldn\u2019t mind getting under the covers, though.\u201d</p><p>After they slipped between the sheets, Ben ended up spooned behind her, tucking her against his body, almost completely immobilizing her.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me to your folks\u2019 party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You deserved to be there. You fit right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is odd, given I\u2019m never around my family, and rarely around so many kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKays were out in full force today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were...scarce.\u201d</p><p>His rough-tipped fingers trailed up and down her arm. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it goes. I\u2019m considered one of the quiet ones, a man of few words, and usually none of importance, so no one pays much attention to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that gives you the opportunity to pay attention to them.\u201d She paused. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so in tune with...people? Because you\u2019ve spent a lifetime observing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. And without goin\u2019 all psychobabble, I\u2019ve been the middle boy. Even now that Gavin is around I\u2019m still in the middle. Quinn...well, Dad thinks the sun rises and sets with Quinn. And Chase is the superstar golden child. Kinda hard to stand out. So I\u2019ve always figured it\u2019s better to blend.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley tried to roll over to look into his eyes, but he held her in place. \u201cBlend? Hate to break it to you, but you don\u2019t blend. You are...\u201d Maybe he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her insight so she held back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForceful. You\u2019re easily the most forceful man in the room. In any room. Whether at the club or amidst your relatives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We kept our distance today. But I knew where you were at all times. Your body was the moon, I was the tide and you had a pull on me. Which I had to resist, you jerk.\u201d She lightly elbowed him in the gut.</p><p>Ben chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI will say you were sporting a pretty serious back off aura today. I didn\u2019t see many of your relatives approach you besides Chase. And the two younger guys, but they didn\u2019t stick around long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be Tell and Dalton. There\u2019s a family dynamic that\u2019d take me the rest of the damn night and part of tomorrow to explain.\u201d He traced the backs of her knuckles. \u201cI guess I wasn\u2019t aware I had that vibe today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it\u2019s just today and not every day.\u201d She fell silent again.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you do that, angel. \u2019Cause I know them wheels are churning. Tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just wondered how much of that standoffishness happened after you accepted your dominant nature. Like if you let the people closest to you see that part of you, you were afraid they wouldn\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p><p>He muttered, \u201cThey won\u2019t accept it.\u201d He stroked her skin. \u201cYou came up with all of these observations just today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a pretty good judge of people, Ben. My ex-husband notwithstanding. I worried about that same kind of stuff with him. He didn\u2019t accept that sexual part of me. And I never asked him to do half the things to me that you\u2019ve done to me. So I understand your need to keep that part of your life secret. Dean...actually threatened to tell our friends, my boss, our coworkers, and our parents about my kinky sex requests. For months, every time I saw our coworkers snickering, I worried he\u2019d over-shared at the water cooler.\u201d</p> <p>Ben rolled and brought her on top of him, clamping one hand on her ass to keep her from squirming away. The other hand held her jaw. \u201cOne\u2014I don\u2019t do things to you, I do things for you. Big difference. Two\u2014I\u2019m proud of you for realizing his hang-ups are not yours and for takin\u2019 a chance to live the life you want. Three\u2014if I ever meet that self-serving motherfucker, I will beat his ass bloody. There\u2019s no bigger sin than breaking a confidence. He was your husband for Christsake. He was supposed to be a safe haven for you, not lead the charge in ridiculing you.\u201d</p><p>This man, who\u2019d known her three weeks, had a better grasp on her, on who she was at the most basic level, and yet embraced her complexities and understood her insecurities, better than any man ever had. No one in her past\u2014man or woman\u2014had ever stood up for her like Ben. No one had ever built her up by knocking down the walls she\u2019d been hiding behind. That knowledge both buoyed her and brought despair, because this thing between her and Ben had an end date.</p><p>Didn\u2019t it?</p><p>She closed her eyes, feeling those stupid, unwelcome tears trying to break free. She jerked from his hold. And he let her go.</p><p>But Ben didn\u2019t release her. He merely returned her to her previous position and held her while she composed herself. He let the brush of his hands on her skin soothe her in ways words couldn\u2019t. Sometimes being a man a few words had its benefits.</p> <p>She whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed her temple. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while.\u201d</p> <p>She punched her pillow. \u201cI know we haven\u2019t spent the night together much, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d He bumped his pelvis into her backside. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m likin\u2019 this a whole bunch.\u201d</p><p>How could she tell him sharing the same bed seemed more intimate than sex? Sleeping she felt even more vulnerable. Had Layla been right? Being in his bed surrounded by his warm body was a gateway drug to wanting more? More of what she couldn\u2019t have?</p><p>\u201cAinsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I started to doze off.\u201d She kissed his biceps.</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cAnd just so you know, you\u2019re welcome in my bed any night. I\u2019ll even kick the dogs out for you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWell, I doubt my cats will be so accommodating.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p> <p>Before he got busy filling his day cutting logs and boards for a furniture order, Ben loaded up his dogs and headed to Rielle\u2019s.</p><p>Unlike Chase, he didn\u2019t consider it strange Gavin had chosen to stay at Rielle\u2019s bed and breakfast. It was neutral territory and he wasn\u2019t beholden to anyone\u2019s schedule. He hadn\u2019t talked to Gavin much yesterday, and he realized he\u2019d never had a one-on-one, face-to-face conversation alone with his oldest brother and it was past time.</p><p>Plus, he had to approach Rielle about her financial situation, as Tell and Dalton had reminded him last night, regardless of what kind of mood she was in, regardless if he was uncertain about where his portion would come from.</p><p>The dogs jumped out of the truck bed and raced off into the trees with Rielle\u2019s three mutts.</p><p>Rielle met him at the front door and held open the screen. \u201cHey, stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, Rielle. Something smells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s fresh coffee and warm muffins inside.\u201d</p><p>She was in a good mood, which boded well for him. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop over here expecting to be fed, but I ain\u2019t gonna say no now that you offered.\u201d He followed her into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine you stopped over to talk to me anyway.\u201d She pointed to the mugs. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Gavin up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hopped into the shower as you pulled in.\u201d</p><p>Ben sat at the counter, poured himself a cup of coffee and set two blueberry muffins on a plate. \u201cI did want to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I wanted to bring it up in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re really scaring me.\u201d</p><p>Ben looked Rielle in the eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t beat around the bush. How much financial trouble are you in?\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s cheeks turned bright red and her hands squeezed her coffee mug. \u201cI told you I\u2019d pay you for the furniture. Are you here to repossess it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. That\u2019s pretty inconsequential, considering everything else you owe on, doncha think?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Ree, how bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The bitter taste in his mouth wasn\u2019t from too strong coffee.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask how you found out?\u201d Rielle asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides that I took you to the bank and know they turned you down for a loan?\u201d</p><p>Her lips formed a sneer. \u201cSo is everyone in town aware of my financial predicament? Is everyone whispering that the hippie chick doesn\u2019t have a clue how to manage money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And if I ever heard anyone say shit like that about you, I\u2019d bust them in the mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you would. You\u2019re a good friend, Ben. One of the few friends I have in this town, despite the fact I\u2019ve lived here my whole life.\u201d Rielle knocked back her coffee like it was whiskey. \u201cSo how did you find out?\u201d</p><p>No reason to sugarcoat it. \u201cRory.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned to chips of ice and she slammed her cup down. \u201cMy daughter called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Evidently she talked to Dalton when he was in Laramie, and Dalton came to me. He\u2019s worried about her.\u201d</p><p>Stunned silence.</p><p>Rielle made a wounded sound. \u201cShe can\u2019t... It\u2019s why I...\u201d She covered her mouth and tears pooled in her hard eyes.</p><p>Christ. He hadn\u2019t meant to make her cry. Ben went to her and pulled her into his arms. \u201cHey. Rory is a terrific kid, Ree. You\u2019ve done a great job raising her into a thoughtful, responsible adult. This fucked up situation hurts both of you, but we\u2019ll get something figured out, okay?\u201d</p><p>It took a minute or so, but Rielle said, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause I\u2019m too fuckin\u2019 old to have new neighbors move in here.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. And sobbed. And hugged him tighter. \u201cThanks.\u201d She stepped back and wiped her cheeks. \u201cI assume you wouldn\u2019t have brought this up if you didn\u2019t have a plan?\u201d</p><p>He peeled the wrapper off the bottom of his muffin. \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan. But I\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna like it much. You\u2019re in arrears to the bank...eleven months on your loan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen,\u201d she corrected. \u201cI\u2019ve got about thirty days left before I default.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you have to pay to get caught up in the next thirty days to keep them from foreclosing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to pay the first six months and all the penalties. Then I have sixty days to pay the remainder to bring the account current.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much we talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Rielle closed her eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cOne hundred and twelve thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That was way more than he\u2019d anticipated. He didn\u2019t have that kind of money. Could Dalton and Tell come up with that much cash? Plus more to put a down payment on the land once they\u2019d kept her foreclosure at bay?</p><p>\u201cSo please tell me more about this plan of yours, because right now, I\u2019d sign a deal with the devil rather than lose everything.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cThe McKays have been called agents of Satan and devil\u2019s spawn before, by your own father, if I remember right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like him, since he constantly referred to me as the Whore of Babylon.\u201d</p><p>It really surprised Ben that Rielle\u2019s father and Casper hadn\u2019t gotten along better, they were both cut from the same mean cloth. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. Me, Dalton and Tell would give you the funds to catch up to make the back payment. That\u2019ll give you a little time to decide if you want to sell us the whole parcel of land, or just part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the creek front section, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019d be great grazing land and it\u2019s the section that\u2019s closest to the rest of our land. Look, if you wanted to subdivide it, we\u2019d be open to that, because we don\u2019t wanna chase you off. But we also figured you\u2019d rather sell the land to us and end up with money in the bank, rather than the bank owning all of it and you ending up with nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the money right now?\u201d she asked skeptically.</p><p>He tried to gauge the best response to her mood. If he told her getting that much cash wasn\u2019t an issue, would she be resentful? Probably. He told a half-truth. \u201cNot all of it, but I know where I can get it.\u201d Jesus. He hoped he could figure out some financial wheeling and dealing \u2014and soon.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. It sounds like a great solution, but I need some time to wrap my head around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take too long.\u201d Isn\u2019t that what Tell and Dalton had warned too? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd promise me you won\u2019t do anything until you\u2019ve talked to me first.\u201d</p><p>Rielle nodded.</p> <p>The swinging door from the back set of stairs swung open. \u201cI should\u2019ve eaten before I showered because the\u2014\u201d Gavin stopped and looked from Ben to Rielle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Am I interrupting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I actually came by to talk to you since we didn\u2019t get a chance yesterday. Rielle insisted I eat while I waited, and well, I\u2019ll never say no to good cookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoken like a bachelor.\u201d Gavin helped himself to a cup of coffee. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t explain why it appears Rielle\u2019s has been crying.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a tad too cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s from chopping onions for the quiche we\u2019re having for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked like didn\u2019t believe her, but he smiled at her anyway. \u201cGood to know. I\u2019d hate to have to pound on Ben if he somehow maligned your muffins.\u201d</p> <p>Rielle rolled her eyes. \u201cBen would never do that. He\u2019s a good guy, honest as the day is long.\u201d</p><p>Ben made a gagging noise.</p><p>\u201cPlus, he knows what side his muffin is buttered on.\u201d She winked. \u201cIf you need anything else, holler. I\u2019ll be in my office.\u201d</p><p>Gavin refilled his coffee and loaded his plate with a muffin and a banana.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to get along with Rielle,\u201d Ben remarked.</p><p>\u201cThis is the third time I\u2019ve stayed with her.\u201d</p> <p>Like that explained it. \u201cSo how long you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI leave at six tonight on the direct flight out of Rapid City to Phoenix.\u201d He cut the banana into precise quarters. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay longer, but my ex-wife can\u2019t handle our daughter for more than a weekend so I have to be back to take Sierra to school tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have a friendly relationship with your ex?\u201d</p><p>Gavin separated his muffin into four equal sections. \u201cIf friendly fire counts, then, yes, it\u2019s friendly.\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed. \u201cSorry, you probably didn\u2019t mean that to be funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo little is amusing about the situation that I\u2019ll take laughter when I can get it.\u201d He chewed and swallowed a piece of muffin, followed by a piece of banana.</p><p>\u201cTell me about\u2014\u201d my niece, \u201c\u2014your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra is a typical teenage girl. Lots of drama and angst in her daily life. Her mother just adds to it by refusing to be Sierra\u2019s parent\u2014she prefers to be Sierra\u2019s shopping buddy and confidante. So when Sierra comes to my house after a weekend with my ex, she argues incessantly, breaks the rules and drives me so fucking crazy I want to send her to boarding school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo offense, but I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Therein lies the rub. After a couple days, Sierra is back to being my sweet, funny, wonderful, only slightly annoying, typical daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she isn\u2019t bratty all the time.\u201d</p><p>Gavin ate a third bite of the muffin and banana combination. \u201cThat\u2019s what Rielle tells me to focus on. Since she survived her daughter\u2019s teen years, I\u2019m hoping to survive it too.\u201d</p><p>Ben couldn\u2019t help but stare at Gavin as he shoved his hand through his short hair. That was the most obvious difference between him and his brothers\u2014they all had the almost black hair color from the McKay side. But Gavin\u2019s hair was brown and slightly curly, like their mother\u2019s. And it was sort of freaky, to realize he had facial characteristics of Quinn, Chase and their father, almost in a perfect blend, so he didn\u2019t look exactly like any of them, but like all of them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to such scrutiny after last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. How was your portion of the dog and pony show anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase was the Thoroughbred and I was the mutt they dragged home that everyone expected to do awesome tricks. I was most likely a severe disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. That was a harsh assessment.</p><p>Gavin sighed and looked at Ben. \u201cThat was uncalled for. It\u2019s just... Can I be blunt? I don\u2019t know what the fuck I\u2019m doing here. It\u2019s all still pretty surreal, this, hey, you\u2019ve got a whole \u2019nother family. Especially last night. I felt like I was standing in front of one of those small clown cars, and more and more people kept pouring out, and I\u2019m somehow related to all of them.\u201d</p><p>The McKay family overwhelmed Ben sometimes and he\u2019d grown up around them. He couldn\u2019t imagine how Gavin felt. \u201cDid anyone give you a hard time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Keely was the most obviously curious. But she disappeared fast when Jack and I started talking business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeely might come on strong, but she\u2019s fiercely loyal to all her McKay cousins. Just because you don\u2019t have the same last name, you have the same blood, so she considers you hers too now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. She isn\u2019t by chance the mother of the ringleader of the McKay kid posse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re probably talkin\u2019 about Kyler. Keely is his aunt. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kid cornered me and asked if I was rich.\u201d</p><p>Good thing Cord hadn\u2019t heard that or he would\u2019ve kicked his son\u2019s butt. \u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him no and asked if I could borrow five bucks.\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed. Gavin had a better sense of humor than he\u2019d given him credit for. But he could just tell by looking at him that the man was stressed out. \u201cWhat else is goin\u2019 on, on the family freak-out front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed spending time with Charlie and Vi. Here and when they came to Arizona. It was great going to the PBR and watching Chase ride and meeting Ava. I spent yesterday morning over at Quinn\u2019s and he gave me a tour of the ranch. Libby\u2019s definitely got her hands full with those two kids. But as far as the rest? Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I get what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re tryin\u2019 to figure out where you fit in just our lives, and then you get thrown a hundred other puzzles pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I sound like a whiner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you sound like a man who ain\u2019t about to get railroaded into doin\u2019 something you\u2019re not ready for.\u201d</p><p>Gavin leveled a serious look at him. \u201cI hope your family appreciates your insight, Ben. I know I do. I\u2019d intended to swing by your place this morning to catch up, but you beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>That mollified Ben some, although he was aware of being the last on the list since he was the least interesting of his brothers.</p><p>A muffled ringing sound became louder as Gavin pulled a cell from his front pocket. He said, \u201cGive me a second.\u201d Then, \u201cHey, sweetheart. Why are you up so early on a Sunday? Uh-huh. No. I didn\u2019t know. Sounds like you had a good time. What\u2019re you doing today?\u201d He was silent for a minute and his face turned red. \u201cNo. Absolutely not. Stop. Right now. Don\u2019t threaten or bribe or try to sweet talk me because it won\u2019t work. My answer is no. I don\u2019t give a sh\u2014damn what your mother thinks. Because you are fourteen years old! Put her on the phone. Now.\u201d</p><p>Ben wondered if he should leave the room.</p><p>A pause. \u201cYou listen to me, Ellen. If you sign the consent form, I\u2019ll be at my attorney\u2019s office first thing tomorrow morning, filing for sole custody of Sierra, without visitation rights. Because she doesn\u2019t need to get her goddamn eyebrow pierced! Or her nose or her lip or her belly button. Don\u2019t try that bullshit argument with me. End of discussion. And I\u2019d better not see one fucking piercing on her body anywhere when I pick her up tonight, we clear? Put her back on.\u201d Gavin paced. \u201cHey. No, honey, slow down. Sierra-bear, you know how she gets. It\u2019s all right. I\u2019m glad you called me. Of course. I miss you too. See you tonight.\u201d He calmly shut the phone and braced his hands against the counter, letting his head hang down.</p><p>\u201cMother-fucking-sonofabitch-goddamn-it-all-to-hell-I\u2019m-going-to-fucking-kill-her-with-my-bare-hands.\u201d</p><p>That was unexpected from Mr. Calm and Refined.</p><p>Gavin took several deep breaths, before he glanced up at Ben. \u201cSorry. Sometimes my ex\u2019s sheer stupidity still astounds me. I try and get my frustration out of my system before I\u2019m around Sierra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that wasn\u2019t...directed at Sierra?\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked appalled. \u201cGod no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Ben had no idea what to say.</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cGreat impression. Not only have I showcased my whining and sarcastic side, I\u2019ve proven I have a quick fuse, a bad temper, a love of curse words and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Ben prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019d like to see how you act when you\u2019re shitfaced. I bet that\u2019s when you really let fly.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI could use a shot of tequila right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in luck. It just so happens I have a great selection of tequila at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all about the house you built. Charlie is really proud of you.\u201d</p><p>His dad had been bragging on him? That was weird. But cool. \u201cWe could head over there now if you\u2019ve got time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Gavin picked up his dishes and rinsed them in the sink.</p><p>That surprised Ben too. He assumed a rich guy like Gavin was used to having maids around and people picking up after him all the time.</p><p>And what would Gavin assume about you?</p><p>He was hoping the time for assumptions was a thing of the past.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>After his monumentally shitty day, Ben didn\u2019t bother going inside his house. He headed straight to his woodshop, needing to connect with a part of his life that gave him joy. An activity that was solely his, a talent that owed nothing to the ranch, or to his family or even the club.</p><p>He tried not to think about Rielle\u2019s evasion when he\u2019d asked her where she was in the decision process. He shoved aside his worry he\u2019d somehow fuck up this land deal and his cousins\u2014no, his whole family\u2014would blame him. He tamped down his resentment that Dalton and Tell didn\u2019t balk at all when he\u2019d shared the amount of cash they\u2019d need to get Rielle\u2019s loan current. When had he become the poor relation? And why the hell did that bother him so much? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Don\u2019t think about it.</p><p>The smell of wood soothed him. Whether it was pine burning in the woodstove, or the scent of freshly cut lumber, or the aroma of cedar curls beneath his feet. The best way to combat his bad mood was to carve. He chose a small piece of walnut and turned it over in his hands, studying the swirls and whorls in the wood grain.</p><p>Some carvers could look at a chunk of wood and see the form inside. Ben\u2019s brain didn\u2019t function that way. He just started chipping away, keeping the possibilities endless.</p> <p>He secured the wood in a block vise and lined up his chisels. By the time he finished setting up, he\u2019d noticed the coloration of the wood was similar to that of a barn owl.</p><p>Maybe it was the mark of a simple man that all his tension from the day simply vanished when he began carving. He didn\u2019t listen to music. His thoughts were focused on the next mark in the wood and what removing it would reveal about the piece. In that concentration he found his own peace.</p><p>A loud voice said, \u201cKnock knock.\u201d</p><p>Ripped out of his creative space, Ben spun on his chair and faced Ainsley. \u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d came out sounding more accusatory than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>She sauntered forward. \u201cLong enough to admire your deep level of concentration and your skill with a chisel. Long enough to become jealous of that piece of wood because of how you\u2019ve got your hands all over it.\u201d</p> <p>Ben was uncomfortable that she\u2019d barged into his private space. Over the years he\u2019d grown more protective of his \u201clittle carving hobby\u201d because no one knew how much expressing his creative side meant to him, especially since his cousin Carter was the artist in the family. He had no concept of time in here, which was intentional. No criticism besides his own, which was intentional too. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I interrupting?\u201d</p><p>A polite lie sprang to his lips but he couldn\u2019t give voice to it.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve called first, but I was feeling restless, so I drove out.\u201d</p><p>He repeatedly scraped along a deep line. \u201cI reckon it might be a wasted trip for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a real sociable mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad day?\u201d</p><p>He grunted noncommittally.</p><p>Ainsley stood right next to him. \u201cIs this what you do to unwind?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze met hers since her body was blocking his light. \u201cThis is one of the things I do to unwind.\u201d He let his eyes slowly travel over her body. \u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the other.\u201d</p><p>Those warm hazel eyes chilled. \u201cI didn\u2019t come out here to ask you to tie me up and fuck me, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop the surly, \u201cSo why did you come out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly? I missed your dogs. The whole snarling, slobbering, jumping on me with muddy paws thing really makes my day.\u201d</p> <p>His lips twitched. \u201cSo you must\u2019ve been disappointed when they were locked in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. It was a total wasted effort to line my pockets with raw meat to win them over.\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed. Damn woman. Trying to cajole him out of a bad mood.</p><p>She wandered around the room, not touching anything. \u201cSo even your dogs are banished from your sacred space?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t blame you. Between us? I\u2019ve found Deuce to be hypercritical about any type of art. And Ace? Well, Ace just goes along with whatever criticism Deuce barks about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are hilarious.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley moved close enough to brush woodchips from his shirt. \u201cI am sorry I assumed it was okay to barge in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAinsley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish. The last thing I intended was to add more stress to your day.\u201d Her fingertips whisked away more shavings. \u201cHere\u2019s the truth, Ben. I missed you. Not Bennett. Not who you are as a Dom, but you.\u201d She nuzzled the side of his face. \u201cThank you for stopping by last night. It was totally unexpected. Completely amazing. And exactly what I...needed. I never understood how much I need to access that submissive part of myself until you showed me how good it could be.\u201d</p><p>The red splotches on her cheeks indicated how hard that\u2019d been for her to admit. It touched him. And flustered him because she was beginning to mean a whole lot more to him than he\u2019d ever imagined. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay, I\u2019m happy to see you too, angel.\u201d</p><p>Ben tugged her between his knees and reached up to frame her face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you too, angel.\u201d This woman constantly surprised him. This woman seemed to get him. All sides of him. And that was almost too much to hope for.</p><p>She broke the kiss. \u201cMmm. I needed that too. Tell you what. Why don\u2019t we switch roles tonight? I\u2019ll wrassle the dogs and then whip up something for dinner. You can come inside when you\u2019re done out here. So, if you play your cards right and are suitably submissive to me, I\u2019ll wrassle you and whip you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you be doin\u2019 while you\u2019re waiting on me to hit a creative rut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought my e-reader to keep me occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them naughty books?\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>Damn. That was sexy as all get out, imagining her getting all wet and squirmy. \u201cDon\u2019t be touching yourself if you get to a hot part, understand?\u201d he half-growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd there he is,\u201d she murmured, \u201cthe beastly Dom.\u201d</p><p>Ben clamped his hands on her ass and jerked her forward. \u201cThe beastly Dom never left, angel. I just tone him down when I\u2019m carving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can be a controlling dick.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAs I well know.\u201d</p><p>He smacked her ass.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, though, when you\u2019re ready, I\u2019d love to hear more about Ben McKay, master wood carver. I\u2019d love to see the beautiful things these wonderful hands create.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a bullshit, throw-away comment. Her genuine interest in yet another side of him was strangely humbling. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? Because I haven\u2019t cooked dinner yet and it might be inedible.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI doubt that. Thank you for\u2014\u201d being exactly what I needed tonight, \u201c\u2014barging in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always pushing my boundaries, it\u2019s only fair I push yours right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true. But as far as us switching roles tonight?\u201d He grinned. \u201cNo chance.\u201d</p><p>Christ. He\u2019d made her cry. All he\u2019d done was give her a piece he\u2019d carved last year. A weirdly shaped cat straight out of a Dr. Seuss book that\u2019d been in his scrap pile because he hadn\u2019t figured anyone would want it.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>His cat-loving sub had gotten all choked up and thrown herself into his arms, peppering his face with smooches, muttering about his sweetness and talent to such an extent that Ben had to kiss her just to shut her up.</p><p>The kisses caught fire. Wasn\u2019t long before they were rolling around on the floor laughing, Ainsley unsuccessfully jockeying for a dominant position.</p><p>Clothes flew and they went at it right on the floor in front of the wood burning stove. He pinned her arms above her head and wrapped her legs around his waist and he drove into her. Looking at her face as the pleasure crashed over her. Burying his face in her neck as pleasure consumed him. Being roused from that happy place by her hands stroking his hair and his back. Damn that felt nice. He oughta leave her hands free more often.</p><p>\u201cYou know how I never want to talk afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? No. I\u2019d never noticed that.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley drummed her heels into his butt. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason why I don\u2019t want to talk is because I don\u2019t want to dissect whatever barrier of mine you\u2019ve breached. I just want to bask in the way you make me feel. Because no matter how we get to that point, with cuffs or ropes or just by your command, it\u2019s always exactly what I need. I don\u2019t know how you know that much about me, Ben, in the short amount of time we\u2019ve been together. I\u2019m just really glad you do.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t expecting that. She\u2019d surprised him for the fifth time in so many hours. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And I don\u2019t push you to talk to be a pain, I do it so I know for sure I haven\u2019t caused you pain. You\u2019re new to this and I can be rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d tell you if you were being too rough. But I\u2019m a lot sturdier than you give me credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget to say it, thanks for comin\u2019 over and dragging my broody ass out of the woodshed.\u201d He pecked her on the lips. \u201cThanks for makin\u2019 that taco thing for supper.\u201d He gave her another peck. \u201cThanks for letting me win at Wheel of Fortune again.\u201d And another soft smooch. \u201cThanks for the boost to my ego for loving that ugly-ass cat I carved.\u201d He dove in for an openmouthed kiss that ramped his need back up and made her squirm beneath him. \u201cAnd thanks for the spectacular blowjob.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley eased back and frowned. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t give you a blowjob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t...yet.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Ben was financially fucked.</p><p>His big payment for the last furniture order hadn\u2019t come through. But it wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway. After he did a quick calculation, figuring out how much money he\u2019d need to buy Rielle out, not just pay down her debt, he realized he needed a shit ton more cash.</p><p>He refused to admit to Tell and Dalton he didn\u2019t have enough to fund his third. He couldn\u2019t go to Quinn for the money, because Quinn and Libby weren\u2019t living high on the hog and Quinn wouldn\u2019t approve of their method of trying to secure the land anyway. He could ask Chase for a loan because Chase had plenty of extra cash, but that crossed a line and quite frankly, made Ben feel like a loser, a broke bum needing a handout from his younger brother. Asking for an advance on his wages from the McKay Ranch fund from their accountant before the cattle went to market would alert his family, which he, Dalton and Tell were trying to avoid. Getting a loan from Settler\u2019s First would pose the same problem. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So he chewed on it for a day and came up with a solution. Not ideal, but workable. Okay, it sucked ass, and it crossed another line, but he had no choice.</p><p>Late Tuesday morning Ben ironed his plain white shirt, slipped on a bolo tie embellished with the McKay brand and donned his tan suit coat. He added a western belt, centering it between his jean-clad hips. He settled the black Stetson on his head, grabbed his duster and headed to town.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t set up an appointment with Ainsley at the bank, too many snoopy people would report back to his that family Ben McKay had applied for a loan. So he was planning to take her to lunch and spring his loan request over a good steak.</p> <p>Ben strode into National West Bank. He tipped his hat to the teller and made tracks straight for Ainsley\u2019s office\u2014only to get intercepted by Jenny.</p><p>\u201cBen McKay. Fancy seeing you here again. Is there something I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need to speak with Miz Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>Jenny sauntered to her desk and tapped her fingers on a large day planner. \u201cShe\u2019s a busy woman. She\u2019s on a conference call right now. She\u2019s scheduled a meeting after lunch, followed by a staff meeting, so if you could come back tomorrow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ll wait until she\u2019s off the phone since we\u2019re having lunch today.\u201d</p> <p>Jenny squinted at him skeptically. \u201cIt\u2019s not on her calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I swore we set the lunch date when she was at my brother Chase\u2019s event. Guess I\u2019ll hang out until her call is done to make sure we didn\u2019t get our wires crossed.\u201d He leaned against pillar so he could watch Ainsley in action. Something about seeing that smart, sexy woman in her element got his juices going.</p><p>\u201cWe have a sitting area\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Jenny harrumphed at his dismissal.</p><p>He waited for that moment when Ainsley realized he was there.</p> <p>Bingo. There it was. Her spine straightened and she swiveled in his direction. Their eyes met though the glass and Ben felt that hard punch of lust. Which increased tenfold when she offered him a sexy smirk and ended her phone call.</p><p>The woman had a pull on him like he\u2019d never experienced. He was just as fascinated with who she was out of the sub role, as he was when she trusted him with full control.</p><p>Ben about choked on his tongue when Ainsley sashayed out of her office, wearing a form-fitting black pinstriped skirt and a matching suit jacket that skimmed her hips. The lacy red camisole peeking above the jacket\u2019s lapels kept the outfit from looking too mannish\u2014as if that were possible with her abundance of curves. When he noticed the red stilettos, his mind zipped to the fantasy of the sharp points of those heels digging into his ass as he fucked her on her desk. Or holding onto them as he fucked her over the desk.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow as if reading his wicked thoughts. \u201cBen McKay. What brings you to town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe claims you have a lunch date,\u201d Jenny inserted with a sneer.</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t miss a beat. She snapped her fingers. \u201cThat\u2019s right. We were going to discuss some things that came up after Chase\u2019s event. I believe you mentioned taking me to Fields.\u201d</p><p>Sneaky woman picked the newest, most expensive restaurant in town. Ben looked at Jenny and smiled. \u201cTold ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just grab my coat,\u201d Ainsley said and ducked back into her office.</p> <p>\u201cI still find it odd the woman who obsessively writes everything down forgot this date. Makes one wonder why she\u2019s hiding that you two are...friends.\u201d</p><p>Ben wouldn\u2019t let this smarmy little bitch take shots at her boss when Ainsley was out of earshot. He leaned closer to Jenny. \u201cOr maybe Miz Hamilton and I are discussing personal bank business and she didn\u2019t want it broadcast. I understand your job is to ensure her schedule runs smoothly, just as I\u2019m sure she can count on you to maintain the discretion that comes along with your position.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley sailed out of her office, saying, \u201cJenny, would you make sure all the paperwork in my outbox is filed?\u201d</p><p>Jenny flashed her teeth. \u201cI\u2019m on it. But remember Turton becomes my lord and master after one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops. I meant to say taskmaster.\u201d Jenny flitted off.</p><p>Ben helped Ainsley with her coat. He opened doors but didn\u2019t reach for her in any way that might be deemed intimate. It about killed him too. She\u2019d worn her hair up and he wanted so badly to press his lips to her bared nape. To taste that fragrant section of skin and watch her body tremble.</p><p>Fields was a new restaurant that utilized locally grown food. The owners only served organic beef, chicken, pork and game. Everything was homemade from ingredients found within sixty miles of Sundance, so the menu selection was limited. This place wouldn\u2019t have been his first choice, but he admitted liking the privacy of the high-backed wooden booths and the fact there were hardly any customers to interrupt them.</p><p>Ainsley set aside her menu. \u201cSo, Ben, why did you really show up at my office today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you worried I\u2019d drag you back to your place for a naughty nooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried? No. Disappointed? Yes.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed a primitive growl. \u201cYou get off taunting me in public, doncha, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll make you pay for that later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it on.\u201d</p><p>The waitress wandered over to take their order. And as usual, Ben knew the woman. He hadn\u2019t dated her, but it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on her part. He kept up a light banter but he was relieved when she disappeared into the back.</p><p>\u201cDoes every woman in town have a thing for you?\u201d</p><p>Might make him a dick, but he was happy to see a spark of jealousy, even when it was unwarranted; he only had eyes for her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by it too. Used to be the single ladies only talked to me in hopes I\u2019d introduce them to Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Which is another reason I\u2019ve stayed away from dating those types of women. I was never sure if they were interested in me for me. I\u2019m just a plain, boring rancher. I don\u2019t have interest in bein\u2019 anything else.\u201d</p><p>Something like sympathy spread across her face.</p><p>\u201cBesides. Aggressive women like that don\u2019t take direction well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re all about that.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ben. What\u2019s up? Why the surprise lunch date?\u201d</p><p>Ease into it? Or just say it. \u201cI need a loan.\u201d</p><p>Any warmth in her eyes evaporated.</p><p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s a...delicate situation so let me explain before your eyes slice me to ribbons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>Rather than admitting the truth\u2014he had his eye on a piece of land about to be repossessed\u2014Ben did something he rarely did: he flat-out lied. Not only had he promised Rielle discretion, he\u2019d promised his cousins that same discretion. Ainsley wouldn\u2019t question this reason for needing the money since it was personal. Given all he\u2019d told her about McKay ranching practices, she\u2019d know something was off that he wasn\u2019t including his entire family on the possible land deal. \u201cYou know I dabble in carpentry. I\u2019ve built custom furniture for different places. Some previous customers have contacted me, wanting other pieces. Seems I have a chance to expand and get the challenge of creating something new. To do that I\u2019ll need more equipment and keep a wider variety of building materials on hand. And that is expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you decide this? Because didn\u2019t you just tell me you\u2019re happy being a simple rancher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. But my woodworking hobby has become something more. It\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes softened, no doubt thinking of the carved cat he\u2019d given her, so he laid it on thick. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to go to Settler\u2019s First. Because I know Slim Jim Beal, who handles the loans, will tell Steve Talbot, who will contact my uncles or my cousins and give them a head\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s against the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s how it works here. Sucks, but it\u2019s true. I can just imagine my cousins confronting me, worried I won\u2019t be pullin\u2019 my weight on the ranch because I\u2019m too busy building furniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see where that might bring up questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuestions I\u2019m not ready to answer. But I don\u2019t want to lose out on a good opportunity. I\u2019ve got equity in my house. A steady income. Ties to the area. I\u2019d be a good bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. And you came to me because...\u201d</p><p>Her hard expression said, Because you expect as your sub I\u2019ll automatically say yes. \u201cChrist, no. Don\u2019t look at me like that. I came to you because I trust you\u2019ll be discreet. I\u2019m not askin\u2019 for any special favors beyond discretion in the loan application process.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley had on her shrewd bank president face. \u201cSay I agree to help you. Would there be a chance I\u2019d get any of the other McKay banking business?\u201d</p><p>That question brought him up short. Was what Steve Talbot said true? She had her eye on his family\u2019s coffers? \u201cYou\u2019d have some of mine. Isn\u2019t that a start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose, but I am first, and foremost, a businesswoman so I\u2019d really like the chance to pitch National West\u2019s financial benefits to your entire family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Startled at the interruption, he glanced up and bit back a groan. He hadn\u2019t seen Michelle Littlefield, a woman he\u2019d dated right out of high school, for several years. This was one of his least favorite things about living in Sundance\u2014he always ran into someone he knew. \u201cMichelle. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. When Gloria came back into the kitchen to tell me you were in the dining room, I had to come out and say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout eight years since I left to attend cooking school. I just recently returned to Sundance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then it clicked. Littlefield. \u201cFields is your restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew a smart guy lurked beneath that handsome face of yours,\u201d she teased.</p><p>Ben felt his cheeks warm beneath Michelle\u2019s admiring gaze and Ainsley\u2019s curious one. \u201cAh, Michelle, this is Ainsley Hamilton. She\u2019s the bank president at National West. Ainsley, Michelle Littlefield.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPleasure to meet you, Michelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here. Sorry if I interrupted a business lunch. I wanted to say hello and mention I\u2019d love to catch up with you sometime, Ben.\u201d</p><p>Luckily Michelle left before Ben had to formulate another lie about how much he\u2019d enjoy that.</p><p>Ainsley raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot your fault. But I\u2019m beginning to understand why you prefer spending your free time at the club in Gillette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can whip the women who annoy you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cBack to the loan issues. I\u2019m not trying to discourage you. But you need to be aware loans are very hard to come by in this economy. Even for people like you, who I\u2019m assuming has established good credit. Taking on additional financial burden without a guarantee you\u2019ll have increased income? I want you to consider very carefully about applying at your regular bank first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. And I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She studied him. \u201cI\u2019d have to delve into your financials, Ben, and I don\u2019t know how comfortable I am with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothin\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t tell you if you just asked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that open about your finances with everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we\u2019re more than just casual acquaintances, Ainsley, way more.\u201d</p><p>She turned her gaze away from his.</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>That command grabbed her attention but she glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo beastly Dom on me.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands in surrender. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t say, sorry, habit.\u201d</p><p>Ben smiled. \u201cSo touchin\u2019 you right now is out, too? Because I missed it last night.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley stared at him, her eyes conflicted, but also resolute. \u201cTouching me at any time is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do understand this\u2014\u201d she gestured to the empty space between them, \u201c\u2014ends if I take your loan application.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t compromise my position at the bank. Any hint of professional impropriety will have long-term repercussions on my career. So while I\u2019m willing to help you secure a loan, once the paperwork is underway, we will only have a business relationship. Period.\u201d</p><p>Christ. He hadn\u2019t considered it\u2019d come down to that. He hadn\u2019t considered how much her casual dismissal of him would sting. \u201cIt has to be that black and white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The firm set to her jaw meant this was nonnegotiable. \u201cEven if we were in a normal dating situation, I\u2019d end it the instant business entered the equation. You have the choice to keep our original agreement intact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy askin\u2019 Settler\u2019s First to lend me the money.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He stretched across the table, and reached for her hand, hoping charm would have some effect on her. \u201cI need the loan. I want you. I want you like fuckin\u2019 crazy. I can\u2019t have it both ways. For a man used to havin\u2019 his way in all things? This absolutely sucks balls. Why can\u2019t we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneak around more than we already are?\u201d she supplied coolly. \u201cWe both knew this would end. You\u2019re just choosing to end it sooner.\u201d</p><p>And with that comment, she\u2019d put the ball squarely in his court. Ainsley could chalk up their time together as an experiment. She wouldn\u2019t have to consider going into a long term Dom/sub relationship with him. Goddammit, this wasn\u2019t fair. The first time he\u2019d found a woman who could\u2014</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Not again. He looked up and casually eased back, hiding his annoyance at how quickly Ainsley jerked her hand away from his. \u201cRielle. What are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDropping off the last of my okra and spaghetti squash in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle, have you met Ainsley Hamilton? We were just wrapping up a few things from Chase\u2019s event.\u201d Why did he have to qualify that?</p><p>\u201cRielle Wetzler. Ben\u2019s neighbor. A pleasure to meet you. We did briefly cross paths at the new bank a couple weeks back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I remember. Nice to meet you too. So do you run a farmer\u2019s market?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small one. This time of year I\u2019m about tapped out. I\u2019m down to root vegetables, apples and some herbs.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to make some fall soups and the A&amp;P doesn\u2019t have a huge selection of vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurnips. Parsnips. Leeks. Do you have beets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do. Three different varieties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, please sell me some. I\u2019m desperate to make a batch of borscht.\u201d</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll sell you anything you want. Come by anytime. I run the Sage Creek Bed and Breakfast out on Bridger Gap Road. I\u2019m usually there or in the gardens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better swing by tonight after work, Ainsley. In case there\u2019s a run on beets tomorrow,\u201d Ben suggested dryly.</p><p>Rielle whapped his arm. \u201cSuch a smart aleck. I\u2019ll leave you to enjoy your lunch. Nice to meet you, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Rielle.\u201d</p><p>The waitress dropped off the food and several minutes passed before either spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou are coming to my place tonight after you stop at Rielle\u2019s.\u201d Not a question.</p><p>Ainsley pointed at him with her fork. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a short attention span, cowboy. No slap and tickle between us any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said this would end after I\u2019ve filled out the loan paperwork and you\u2019ve submitted it. Even if I get everything filled out today, the soonest you can get started on it is tomorrow. Which means I\u2019ll expect you at my place tonight as soon as you get off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThis is not up for discussion. The parameters of our agreement change tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir,\u201d she snapped off.</p><p>\u201cThat smartass response just earned you an extra ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn extra ten what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me again and I\u2019ll add ten more.\u201d</p><p>A mulish look flattened her lips.</p><p>After he paid, they walked back to the bank. He intended to come in for the paperwork, but Ainsley tried to hold him off. \u201cIt\u2019d be easier if I bring it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be spending our last time together filling out a loan application,\u201d he half-growled.</p><p>She murmured, \u201cThat thought hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>The main structure of the Sage Creek Bed and Breakfast was crafted of rough-hewn lumber and stone. The steps were constructed from railroad ties, set at jaunty angles and filled with marbled concrete, which led to a large front porch. An eclectic mix of furniture created intimate conversation areas. Pots of flowers abounded\u2014surprising, given the late time of year. The sun\u2019s last golden rays reflected in large windows stretched to the rafters on both the first and second story. The rustic nature brought to mind old hotels from the Wild West days.</p><p>That made Ainsley think of the Rawhide Club, which made her think of Ben. And were her eyes playing tricks on her, or was that Ben\u2019s truck parked in front of the barn? She climbed out of her car, following the sounds of laughter to the back of the building.</p><p>She called out, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Rielle looked up and smiled. \u201cAinsley. I was hoping you\u2019d come by. I dug up a bunch of root vegetables.\u201d Her gloved hands pawed through the wheelbarrow of dirt. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve found beets, turnips, parsnips, a few carrots, late potatoes and some pink Peruvian sweet potatoes that are too big for the chef at Fields to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not expect all this, Rielle, thanks. Will these keep awhile in a dark cabinet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything but the carrots. I also snipped some dill, chervil, chives and the last of the lemon basil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSold. I\u2019ll take all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll just knock the worst of the dirt off and get them bagged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme help ya,\u201d Ben said, digging his hands into the wheelbarrow.</p><p>Ainsley wished she\u2019d changed clothes so she wasn\u2019t standing there useless in her business suit. It seemed strange Ben would be here. \u201cDo you help Rielle with her harvest a lot, Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot usually. I stopped by for something else and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI roped him into helping me. Poor man. Ben is always getting stuck doing things around here. No wonder he doesn\u2019t come around as much as he used to.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley fought the odd spike of jealousy. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have neighbors you can count on. I lived in a condo in Denver for almost five years and I had only a passing acquaintance with anyone in our neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKays and Wetzlers have been tied together for thirty years. We know all of each other\u2019s family secrets.\u201d Rielle winked and went back to digging.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know about Gavin,\u201d Ben pointed out.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I always wondered why your mom went out of her way to check on me when Rory was a baby.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Ben enough he stopped digging. \u201cReally? Vi did that? Without preaching about the high price of sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d Rielle whipped a clump of dirt at him. \u201cVi never was like that toward me. Or Rory. And you don\u2019t give your mom enough credit, Ben. She might\u2019ve made some mistakes in her life, but she\u2019s owned up to them. She\u2019s changed a lot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were so buddy-buddy with my mom.\u201d</p><p>Rielle shrugged. \u201cVi\u2019s a damn sight more interesting than Joan McKay, who was the only other woman close by besides Libby.\u201d</p><p>As Ainsley shifted her stance, feeling woefully out of place, three dogs came bounding out of the treeline. Ace and Deuce made a beeline for her, barking happily, no doubt remembering her last doggie bribe. There went this brand new pair of pantyhose.</p> <p>\u201cAce! Deuce! Sit. Stay,\u201d Ben commanded.</p><p>The dogs obeyed. Heck, she had the urge to obey.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s dog cowered by her feet and stared balefully at the man with the obey now voice.</p><p>Ben smiled at Ainsley. \u201cKept them at bay this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a fan of dogs?\u201d Rielle asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine. I\u2019m just more of a cat person. Cats are more self-sufficient and easier to leave at home alone for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not more forgiving,\u201d Rielle said dryly. \u201cRory had an ornery cat that would shred every roll of toilet paper in the house if she was gone for more than a day. Which is why all our kitties are outside cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRory is your...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaughter. She\u2019s getting her master\u2019s at the UWYO.\u201d</p><p>Rielle did not look old enough to have a daughter that age.</p> <p>Ben tapped the side of the wheelbarrow. \u201cYou got bags for these someplace, Ree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the mudroom. I\u2019ll grab them.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley watched her duck around the corner. Then she focused on Ben. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust seems...coincidental you\u2019re here exactly the same time I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swing by and help Rielle occasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a standing date with her on Tuesdays at five thirty-five?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got something to say, spit it out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you trying to hide something about her? Maybe your feelings? Because you\u2019re awful abrupt whenever she\u2019s around. Always trying to get rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imagining things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the first time we saw each other at the bank? You shooed her away pretty fast. Then at lunch today, you were uncomfortable when she approached us. And now, you\u2019re here, running interference again. Why?\u201d</p><p>He dusted the dirt from his hands as he closed the distance between them. \u201cBecause your bank turned her down for a loan. She\u2019s a little sensitive about it and I thought she might try to corner you when you stopped to get produce. So yeah, I\u2019m running interference. Not for her. For you.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley got in his face. \u201cBack off, Ben. I don\u2019t need you playing mediator. I\u2019m perfectly capable of dealing with customers who\u2019ve been denied financing. And I resent you riding in here to rescue me, acting like I can\u2019t handle myself in a professional capacity. I can handle myself just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019re just snippy because you\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not jealous.\u201d I\u2019m pissed because you said you wouldn\u2019t use me again. So far today you\u2019ve used me to help you get a loan and now you plan on using my body one last time before moving on to the next sub.</p><p>An amused smile quirked his lips. \u201cSure you are.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to slide that smarmy look right off his face, because this was about so much more than her female jealousy and he refused to see it. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself. Don\u2019t you think if Rielle wanted to burn up the sheets with you, she\u2019d been tied to your bed years ago, wearing a custom collar? Since you\u2019ve been such close neighbors and you know each other\u2019s secrets?\u201d</p><p>Silence. \u201cAngel, you are gonna regret that smart comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looming over me like the beastly Dom. We\u2019re not in those roles right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a role for me. And it looks like you need a reminder that I am always the beastly Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to scare me, cowboy?\u201d She purposely taunted him with a label that meant nothing to him. To show him she could turn off her connection to him any time\u2014just like he could.</p><p>He put his mouth next to her ear. \u201cThe name is Bennett, sub, and your night just got a lot more...interesting.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley swallowed hard. The heat of him, the scent of him, the overwhelming power and masculinity made her head spin. Made her want to plaster her body to his and lose herself in him. Beg him to take his loan business elsewhere so they could continue this. Beg him to understand she\u2019d never had\u2014maybe she\u2019d never find\u2014another man who knew what she needed like he did. And that pissed her off. Stupid traitorous body. Stupid sex-addled brain. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, I will, and I did. I want you nekkid and sitting on my bar when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is unfair.\u201d Why was she pushing him? Because he pushed her into a corner first? Or because she wanted their last night together to be memorable?</p><p>\u201cSays you. I think I\u2019m bein\u2019 more than fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Bennett eased back, fire dancing in his eyes. \u201cGonna run rather than face the consequences?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou insulted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I was insulting Rielle.\u201d</p><p>He half-snarled, \u201cThat earned you another ten.\u201d</p><p>She backed up a step. Then another. And he stalked her.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you sneer that you weren\u2019t scared,\u201d he said in that low, dangerous voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Such a liar. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done nothing to warrant punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty until proven innocent in my world. So you\u2019d better have a convincing argument against punishment to present to me when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I bother? You\u2019re going to make it hurt anyway. Hurt worse than it already does.\u201d Stupid move, Ainsley, you aren\u2019t supposed to tell him that. You\u2019re supposed to be the cool-headed professional and the obedient sub who won\u2019t let him see your disappointment on any level.</p><p>Ben gave her a look she\u2019d never seen before. \u201cAinsley. I never meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound them.\u201d Rielle waved a stack of paper bags. \u201cI also grabbed the herbs. They should be refrigerated.\u201d</p><p>Grateful for the interruption, she practically ran to Rielle. \u201cThanks. How much do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty bucks oughta cover it.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley figured that was a low amount after she loaded the four heavy bags into her trunk. She ignored Bennett\u2019s hard, hot stare that seemed to liquefy her bones as she chatted with Rielle.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look his way when she climbed in her car. She hesitated at the end of the driveway.</p><p>A right turn led back into town. A left turn led to Ben\u2019s house.</p><p>She knew his eyes were on her vehicle as she turned left.</p><p>Ainsley wasn\u2019t naked when Ben walked in the door. Something smelled good, and while the thought of a homemade meal awaiting him stirred a weird longing, she hadn\u2019t followed his instructions.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t seem particularly perplexed about that.</p><p>She sliced cubed potatoes and dropped them in a pot of boiling liquid. She tossed in a handful of herbs and nestled the lid over the steam. Then she looked up at him. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve got that started, we can talk about your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you always want to talk about this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d Ben\u2019s gaze swept over her fully clothed body. \u201cStrip. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I could convince\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to strip right here in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can strip over by the bar, which you\u2019re supposed to be on, nekkid, if memory serves. Every time you open that pretty mouth to argue I\u2019m takin\u2019 note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are surely tryin\u2019 my patience today, woman, and that will reflect in your punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Ainsley stomped across the room, throwing clothes over her head like confetti as she peeled them off her body.</p><p>Ben would find it funny if he wasn\u2019t so damn annoyed with her.</p><p>Oh hell, there was a fine sight, her luscious butt shaking as she climbed atop the bar. She faced him, arms crossed, legs crossed, wearing a very cross look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your attitude. And I think maybe I\u2019ve been too lenient on you. Or maybe in the two days we\u2019ve been apart, you\u2019ve forgotten who\u2019s holding the reins.\u201d</p><p>The woman actually rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStretch out on your belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then Bennett was in front of her, his hands curled around her face, pulling her forward until they were nose-to-nose. \u201cDo you want me to get a gag?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen do what I tell you.\u201d</p><p>Her flesh squeaked against the bartop she obeyed so fast.</p><p>\u201cHands clasped above your head.\u201d After she complied, he ran his hand across her body, from her ankle up to her shoulder. \u201cStay put.\u201d</p><p>Ben retreated to his bedroom and set his bag of toys on the bed. He transferred the riding crop, the ping-pong paddle, the medium-sized curved vibrator, the vibrating butt plug, the leg and arm restraints, and the small bottle of lube to a smaller bag. Just for shits and giggles, he grabbed the ball gag and his single tail whip.</p><p>Ainsley wasn\u2019t meekly stretched out on the bar like a good sub, awaiting his return. She was in the kitchen messing with the stove.</p><p>\u201cAre you still defying me?\u201d he roared.</p><p>She yelped, dropping the metal lid. The loud clank after it hit the floor made her jump again. She bent down to retrieve it, then slammed it on the counter. \u201cI can explain. I didn\u2019t want the soup to boil over while you were playing with me so I got up and turned it off.\u201d She aimed her gaze at the floor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot acceptable behavior,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhen I say stay put, I mean stay put. You could\u2019ve asked me to turn off the soup. Instead, you chose to ignore my instructions and did whatever the hell you wanted. Bad choice. Get back on the bar as you were.\u201d</p><p>When Ainsley peeked up at him with those less-than-remorseful eyes, but didn\u2019t move, he pulled out the whip and snapped it in the air. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Another yelp and then she was running across the room, making all of her girly parts jiggle very nicely.</p> <p>Christ, his dick went hard and he hadn\u2019t even touched her yet. He put the whip, the vibrating butt plug, and the ball gag within her view. He stretched her arms above her head and secured her wrists to the brass rail running along the inside and outside of the bartop.</p><p>She didn\u2019t utter a peep when he restrained her legs in the same manner, but her breaths were coming much faster.</p><p>\u201cOh and for the record? This isn\u2019t playtime. You are bein\u2019 punished.\u201d Her body shuddered as his fingertips skimmed the curves of her ass. \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re bein\u2019 punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...initially? No. Now I know my punishment will be because I disobeyed you. God forbid I put safety first by turning off the stove and preventing a fire hazard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still arguing with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to admit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d</p><p>Ainsley sighed. Wearily.</p><p>\u201cYou disrespected me at Rielle\u2019s place. Then you flat-out insulted me. That alone was enough to earn you a few licks. But your absolute disobedience after the fact, in your Dom\u2019s home, has earned hefty consequences, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. And I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>Like hell you\u2019re sorry. \u201cSince we agreed early on spanking wasn\u2019t a punishment, I\u2019m improvising. By my count you earned forty marks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cF-forty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll split them\u2014twenty with the paddle, twenty with the ridin\u2019 crop.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cThank you for not...just thank you.\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t like it that she flinched when he touched her. And why was she shaking so hard? \u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m f-fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use the whip on me. Ever. Please. I-I\u2019d use my safe word before I\u2019d let you.\u201d</p><p>He froze. Hadn\u2019t they discussed her hard limits? Didn\u2019t she know he\u2019d never... Christ. This was fucked up. \u201cAinsley. Look at me, please.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her head, but her hair obscured her face. He gently brushed the silky strands aside. \u201cI\u2019d never use the single tail on you. I know it\u2019s a hard limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is it on the counter?\u201d</p><p>He felt like a total dickhead for using it as a scare tactic. \u201cIt was just in the bag,\u201d he lied.</p><p>She relaxed slightly. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Part of him wanted to call this punishment off. But a stronger part knew Ainsley needed this lesson.</p><p>Why? So the next Dom she hooks up with will reap the benefits?</p><p>The thought of another Dom touching her made him insane.</p><p>Ben did grant a soft kiss on her forehead as he ran his palm up her bound arm. \u201cCount loud enough so I can hear or I won\u2019t count it. And I better hear respect in that tone, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Using the paddle, he smacked her left butt cheek. The thwack bounced off the bar mirror in an erotic echo.</p><p>\u201cOne. Sir.\u201d</p><p>By the time he reached twenty smacks, Ainsley was very squirmy and his cock was painfully hard. What a gorgeous sight, her ass a bright pink border between the white skin of her back and thighs. He traced her butt crack until his fingers connected with her pussy. Her wet pussy. Oh hell yeah. His angel was a sub through and through. She needed this as much as he did.</p><p>Pity she\u2019ll walk away from this lifestyle and from you at the end of the night. You\u2019ll just become a memory of the weeks she dabbled on the wild side.</p><p>Ben had to toss that unsettling thought aside. He turned the vibrator on the lowest speed, rolling it across those flaming butt cheeks. He said, \u201cLift up,\u201d and slid the phallus into her cunt.</p><p>Ainsley gasped and tried to squeeze her legs together.</p><p>He brushed his mouth across the shell of her ear. \u201cHalf done. But if you come before you get the next twenty lashes? I\u2019ll give you ten more with my hand, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. It\u2019s...vibrating right on my G-spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And be warned, I ain\u2019t gonna go fast with these last twenty. I like takin\u2019 my time with the crop.\u201d</p><p>She moaned. And wiggled that pretty pink butt.</p><p>\u201cGet ready to count.\u201d He knew these would sting twice as much because the tissue was already swollen and he braced himself for her reaction.</p><p>She reared up when the blow landed. \u201cOh, you bastard, that hurts!\u201d</p><p>Ben waited for her to realize her error.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Sir. It just...stung. Crap. That was...ah... One. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Ben smoothed his hand over the hot skin, as if deciding where to place the next mark. Her entire body vibrated in anticipation. The next lash hit the crease of her thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh, I...fuck...you...shit... That\u2019s two. Sir.\u201d</p><p>By the thirteenth mark, her body still trembled but she\u2019d fallen into a deeper breathing pattern. Her voice had taken on that dreamy quality as she counted.</p><p>At number seventeen, her hips began to bump up and she tried to grind her crotch into the wood. Ben gathered her hair in his hand and raised her head. Her eyes were glassy with that mix of pleasure and pain. He wanted to fuck her so bad he could practically taste the scream she\u2019d release on his first deep thrust. \u201cDon\u2019t come. You come and I start over, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can take three more, Ainsley. And these three are gonna sting.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, but whispered, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gone into that Dom zone, where their every breath seemed synchronized. Where he felt sweat breaking out on his body in the same places he saw it on hers. Where he felt each blow travel from the crop, up his arm and down to the exact spot on his body where he\u2019d just hit on hers. He swung. Connected with her flesh. She cried out. Not in pain.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Two more.\u201d As much as he wanted to level the blows boom boom, he spaced them out, hyper-aware the anticipation would make the release so much sweeter.</p><p>As soon as she rasped out, \u201cTwenty,\u201d he shucked his jeans and rolled on a condom. His hands shook as he untied her ankles. She moaned, \u201cNo,\u201d when he eased the vibrator out.</p><p>Ben crawled up on the bar and hiked Ainsley\u2019s hips into the air. Keeping hold of her knees, he plunged into that tight, wet heat, and an animalistic snarl burst free.</p><p>Ainsley whimpered. He pumped twice more and slipped his hand around to finger her clit. Jesus. She was so primed. As he rubbed that plumped nub, he stretched over her lush, bound body, hissing as her scorching hot butt pressed into his lower abdomen.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Yes. Oh please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby, take it. You\u2019ve earned it. It\u2019s right there.\u201d He withdrew, slammed home, and pinched her clit at the same time he opened his mouth wide and sucked the sweet spot on the back of her neck.</p><p>Ainsley released a primal scream. Her cunt spasmed so powerfully around his cock he thought the contractions might suck the seed right out of his balls. He held on through the fierce bucking of her body, through her gasping sobs, through the potent aftershocks that were clusters of tiny orgasms.</p><p>When she lowered her face to the bar, trembling and spent, Ben pulled out of her pussy, gritting his teeth as the muscles clamped down, trying to keep his cock inside.</p><p>He ditched the condom and closed his fist around the base of his shaft. His eyes focused on the sexy sight before him. That beautiful red butt in the air, her inner thighs slick with her juices, spread to reveal her swollen sex. His hand pumped harder. Just a couple more. His shaft swelled. His balls tightened. Ben roared as he came, aiming each hot spurt at her ass. He gloried in pure male satisfaction at seeing her so thoroughly, so intimately marked by him. First by his hand and then by his seed.</p><p>He could not tear his eyes away from watching those milky spots turning into wet stripes on her pinked ass.</p><p>But his knee joint cracked loudly, reminding him where he was. Dazed, he patted Ainsley\u2019s thigh and backed off the bar. His legs were awful damn rubbery as he walked to the kitchen. He washed his hands, his face and soaked two hand towels with cool water. When he returned to take care of Ainsley, the thought of this being their last night together tied him up in knots. Tied him up so completely he thought about calling off the loan. He could get the money from Settler\u2019s First.</p><p>You\u2019re gonna gamble this chance to own the land your family has always wanted for a piece of ass? Even a prime piece of ass? Wrong. You can have this scenario every weekend at the club. It\u2019s nothing special. The land is. Get with the program. Stay on track. Stay focused.</p><p>Ben shut out the warring voices in his head and focused on his sub. He wiped her clean with gentle strokes as his free hand caressed her hair. He released her restraints and helped her find her balance as she slid off the bar.</p><p>Ainsley leaned on him as he led her to the couches in front of the TV. He draped her across his lap, nestling her head into a cushion, offering her a bottle of water, which she declined.</p><p>When he placed the cool towel on her abraded skin, she hissed. Then sighed.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can get you?\u201d he asked, drawing random patterns on her back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He brought her down from the orgasmic high with soothing touches and gentle caresses. Eventually he urged her to turn on her side so he could see her face.</p><p>Ainsley looked at him without his asking.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWill you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>Ben leaned over and captured her mouth. He fed her flirty kisses, tickling kisses, kisses laced with passion, kisses tempered with sweetness. When he nibbled on the inside of her lips, she pulled him closer. Threading her fingers through his hair, holding him in place as she took a hungry kiss. All at once she remembered her place and abruptly released him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry. I just needed...you to anchor me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked me for what you needed, instead of making me guess.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it ironic she opened up to him on their last night together? He brushed his hand over her silky hair, from her scalp to where it curled against her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in a few weeks, haven\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Ainsley pressed the side of her face against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll miss this.\u201d</p> <p>It hit him then, the finality. It wasn\u2019t just the Dom/sub relationship he\u2019d miss; he\u2019d miss her. Everything about being with her.</p><p>They stayed wrapped together for so long the room grew cold and Ben knew the fire had dwindled to cinders. He smooched her forehead and slipped away, covering her with a fleece blanket.</p><p>Ben restocked the wood stove. He crouched and warmed his hands, his thoughts racing a million miles an hour. His gaze moved to the loan paperwork waiting on the counter. It wasn\u2019t too late. He could toss the envelope into the fire. They could continue exploring this thing between them.</p><p>Then what happens? You spend time together and you fall for her even more than you already have? You\u2019ve no guarantee she won\u2019t end it anyway, because you know she\u2019s not convinced this is sustainable. She hasn\u2019t acted like she\u2019s bothered you\u2019re ending it, besides the snippy comments she made at Rielle\u2019s. So either way, you\u2019ve still lost her and you\u2019ve also lost the land.</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p> <p>He turned around. \u201cSomeone took a little cat nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She yawned. \u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He seemed to have lost his appetite. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any more. But I\u2019ll leave it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking off?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and wrapped the blanket around her nakedness and headed for her clothes, which he\u2019d picked up and placed on the chair. As she finished dressing, her gaze landed on the envelope on the counter. \u201cDid you finish the paperwork?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be around tomorrow if I have specific questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould be.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her purse and hastily threw on her coat.</p><p>Go to her. Tell her how you feel.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Ben. I\u2019ll let you know when I hear about the loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it. Drive safe.\u201d</p> <p>Then she was gone.</p><p>And for the first time in his life, his dogs didn\u2019t provide the companionship he needed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>She\u2019d probably get cauliflower ear from the hours she spent on the phone. Ainsley rubbed the sore appendage and switched ears. She didn\u2019t get a chance to leave her office until lunch, and when she returned she noticed the blinds in Leslie\u2019s office were closed, which was unusual. She knocked and heard a scratchy, \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Leslie looked awful. Pasty skin, vacant eyes, red nose. She started to say something and ended up having a coughing fit. But she waved aside Ainsley\u2019s concern and croaked, \u201cJust a cold. Nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here today? You should be home in bed.\u201d</p><p>Leslie sneezed. Coughed. Then blew her nose. Twice. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m behind. I can\u2019t afford to miss a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much are you accomplishing today anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not much.\u201d She let her head fall back into the headrest. \u201cI feel like death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve called in sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to, but Jenny transferred me to Turton instead of you. Turton said sick pay didn\u2019t kick in for thirty days. So if I didn\u2019t show up, my check would get docked. You know Roger and I are still trying to get on our feet after both of us being laid off for six months. I need this job. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ve gone to work far sicker than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. You\u2019re going home. And I don\u2019t want to see you back here until you\u2019re really better. I will handle the sick pay issue with human resources, understand?\u201d</p><p>Leslie sneezed and reached for a tissue. \u201cThanks, A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything pressing I need to handle for you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just cancel the loan appointments for this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d pass that job to Jenny. \u201cConsider it done. Are you okay to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s not that far. I might squeeze in a few hours sleep before the kids get home from school.\u201d She handed Ainsley her appointment book. \u201cThe names and numbers are in here.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley passed Turton\u2019s office. His door was shut, as were his shades. She checked the time. He should be back from lunch by now. She wandered to Jenny\u2019s desk. \u201cWhere\u2019s Turton?\u201d</p><p>Jenny stopped flipping through a magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s taking the afternoon off as a personal day. Why?\u201d</p><p>So it was fine for him to screw off? But he expected Leslie to stick around when she was hacking up a lung? \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him since this morning.\u201d She dropped the appointment book on Jenny\u2019s magazine. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to politely cancel Leslie\u2019s appointments for today as soon as possible and tell the clients she\u2019ll call them to reschedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo excuses. And from now on, you will transfer all employee calls dealing with sicknesses and absences to me, not Turton. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her gaze to the planner. For once, Jenny didn\u2019t have a smart remark.</p><p>Ainsley finished verifying Ben\u2019s financials. She should probably wait to send it off to the main office, but since Leslie was already behind, she didn\u2019t want to add to the burden with a straightforward loan request. After she made copies, she stuffed the originals in a next day envelope.</p><p>Sealing that envelope gave her a strange feeling of finality she wasn\u2019t ready for. She\u2019d liked how things were growing and changing between them. Not only when he slipped into Dom mode, but when he was just Ben.</p><p>She\u2019d miss the way he called her angel. The way he\u2019d growl it against her skin. She\u2019d miss the way he pushed her to accept what she was. The way he wouldn\u2019t let her hide from herself or from him. The way he gave her what she\u2019d needed for so long but hadn\u2019t the guts to admit it she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>This was temporary. And he\u2019d rather have the money than you.</p><p>How long had he known he\u2019d needed a loan? And what would he have done if she\u2019d refused to help him? Would it have strained their Dom/sub relationship? Or ended it completely?</p><p>No way to know now, but she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little used and a lot disappointed.</p><p>Through all her questions and doubt about what could\u2019ve been, she still felt his pull. She wondered how long she could stay away from him.</p><p>Not long, as it turned out. But she\u2019d convinced herself it was a matter of necessity, not personal choice.</p><p>She paced, clutching the phone. \u201cBen? Are you really busy right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What do you need?\u201d</p><p>Then she felt ridiculous and almost gave him a breezy, Oh no reason, just calling to see how you are, rather than coming across as incapable.</p><p>\u201cAinsley? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m inept or that I only called because I needed something, although both those statements are true\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath, angel, and tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bathroom sink is leaking and I can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong and I can\u2019t get ahold of the landlord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that. Be there in fifteen.\u201d</p><p>She gathered the wet towels and tossed them in the tub. After piling clean towels on the toilet, she sat on the floor, listening to the drip drip drip of water into the plastic pail beneath the sink.</p><p>When her cats tore down the hallway she knew Ben had arrived, even before he called out, \u201cAinsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d she yelled back. Her heart flipped over when he entered the bathroom. The man looked even sexier carrying a toolbox than he did carrying his toy bag.</p><p>Ben flashed her a brief smile and, \u201cHey,\u201d before crouching down with his toolbox. \u201cWhen did you notice the leak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter work. I was in that cabinet this morning and it wasn\u2019t leaking then.\u201d</p><p>He turned on a flashlight and the beam arced inside the cabinet. He stuck his head under the sink. \u201cLooks like the nut to the cold water valve is loose. Here. Hold this.\u201d He handed her the flashlight and he rummaged in his toolbox. When he found the tool he needed, he scooted under the sink. \u201cCan you point the light where I\u2019ve got the pipe wrench?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d In such tight quarters, she pressed her body to the outside of the cabinet and held the light steady.</p><p>A couple of hard clanks, a loud screech and then water spewed forth.</p><p>Ben jerked back, hit his head under the sink and yelled, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that flashlight steady.\u201d</p><p>Water was still spraying everywhere.</p><p>Another loud clank and the water stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome idiot forgot to turn the water off before he started fucking with the pipe.\u201d He grunted. \u201cThat was fun. Can you hand me a towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d When Ben backed out from beneath the sink, Ainsley gasped because he was soaking wet\u2014hair, face, neck and shirt.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Ainsley ducked into the cabinet and used a bath towel to sop up the mess. \u201cWhat\u2019s the diagnosis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pipe threading is stripped because the calcium deposits are abrasive. You\u2019ll have to use the kitchen sink until your landlord can get this fixed. I don\u2019t have the right plumbing supplies.\u201d</p><p>When she backed out and stood, she noticed Ben had removed his shirt. Look at that. Broad shoulders, pumped-up biceps. Smooth skin. Even as her brain yelled stop, her fingers heard go. She traced the hard ridge of pectoral muscle. \u201cYou never really let me touch you however I wanted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben tipped her chin up and gazed into her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You were always making our...encounters about furthering my education about the Dom/sub relationship.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb over her bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019d let you touch me now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d much rather I commanded you to touch me, wouldn\u2019t you? Should I? Ainsley, put your hands all over me.\u201d</p><p>That deep, Dom voice traveled through her ear and unfurled inside her like liquid heat, like a drug. She had to twist away from him to hide the longing in her eyes. But longing for what? \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your shirt is soaking wet. You might catch cold if you go home with a wet head. The least I can do is wash and dry it for you, while saving you from possibly getting sick.\u201d Did that sound like a flimsy excuse to him?</p> <p>\u201cI never get sick.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cBesides, you think that\u2019s a good idea, given what we were? Just last night?\u201d</p><p>Of course he reminded her of his Dom role at every opportunity. \u201cI believe we can keep our hands to ourselves for an hour or so, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head no and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley laughed and snatched the shirt. She was surprised Ben followed her to the small laundry area.</p><p>\u201cOn the way over here I was kinda hopin\u2019 you\u2019d answer the door in heels and an apron. Then you\u2019d say something like, I need a guy with a big tool to check out my plumbing. And I\u2019d reply, I know how to plunge deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou imagined I\u2019d lured you over here with a fake porn scenario?\u201d It boosted her ego Ben believed she could conjure up such a sexy scene. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you watched porn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll guys watch porn.\u201d He grinned and towel dried his hair. \u201cThem guys that say they don\u2019t are lyin\u2019. We never watched porn together. Pity. There are lots of scenes I would\u2019ve loved to act out with you.\u201d</p><p>She started the washer and her focus caught on his incredible chest again. Right. He needed to cover up. \u201cI\u2019ll find you a shirt.\u201d</p><p>Just to be ornery, she picked her Cat Lover T-shirt.</p><p>Ben caught it one handed and slipped it over his head. \u201cSpeaking of cats...they raced outta the room the instant I stepped foot inside. They hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you smell like dog. Your dogs hate me because I smell like cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. But I like how your pussy smells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett McKay.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHand me the remote. We\u2019ve already missed ten minutes of Wheel.\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley sat next to him, like she always did. Bennett jerked her close to his body like he always did. Only when the show ended did she remember they weren\u2019t supposed to be twined together. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be touching her. She wasn\u2019t supposed to have her head on his shoulder.</p><p>Almost as if he\u2019d read her mind, he murmured, \u201cSorry. Habit.\u201d His fingers trailed across her forearm three more times before he released her.</p><p>She stood and retreated to the kitchen. He followed. Closely. \u201cLook, your shirt still isn\u2019t dry. Why don\u2019t you stay for dinner? It\u2019s nothing fancy. Just a skillet pot pie.\u201d When Ben didn\u2019t respond, she backtracked. \u201cBut don\u2019t feel obligated. I\u2019m sure you have better things to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He growled that Dom-like warning, curling his hand around her jaw, destroying her protests and her mind with a prolonged, soft-lipped kiss packed with sweet heat. His kisses alone could rocket her into that sublime floaty space.</p><p>Her lips tingled when he pulled back. His face was pure Dom. \u201cI want you. Now. Bent over the table with that kitchen towel tyin\u2019 your hands together behind your back.\u201d</p><p>She tumbled backward into the counter. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say no to me, sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sub anymore, remember?\u201d</p><p>Immediately Ben froze. He shoved his hands in his pockets and took two big steps back. \u201cHave I mentioned how much I fucking hate that?\u201d</p><p>Remind him he brought this on himself. Reset the boundaries and make this about business. \u201cI sent your loan paperwork off today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind anything in my financials worth mentioning?\u201d he asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou make a lot more off your furniture sideline than what I\u2019d expected. So that\u2019s on the plus side of getting loan approval, since it\u2019s enough income to make the monthly payments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea on how long it\u2019ll be before you know for sure?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNext week probably.\u201d</p><p>Then he was invading her space again. \u201cAnd then what, Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur official business will be over. Can we pick up where we left off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean us sneaking around? You bossing me around in private?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat ship has sailed for us. Our month would\u2019ve been up next week anyway.\u201d Ainsley realized she\u2019d literally let him back her into a corner. \u201cBack off, Ben, or I will snap you in the crotch with this dishtowel.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands up and looked at the towel twisted in her hands. \u201cFine. Sorry. But we will talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>It was telling how comfortable they\u2019d gotten with each other that no awkwardness lingered even after that exchange. She told him a few funny stores from her vagabond childhood. He told her about being raised with his McKay cousins. It was weirdly like they were on a first date. It was...nice. Normal. Relaxing.</p><p>Ben peered through the clear lid on the skillet. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Two big cans of condensed vegetable beef soup, a cup of cream and plop a can of biscuits on top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d A tickle started in her nose and she reached for a tissue. She sneezed. Loudly. Three times in a row. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll lay off the pepper next time.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cI forgot to ask if you wanted a beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you were a beer drinker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I bought it for you last week, in case you ever dropped over.\u201d</p><p>He offered her a deeply dimpled smile. \u201cI\u2019ll drop over more often.\u201d</p><p>Yes, please. And oddly enough, him cuffing her and ravishing her until she came screaming wasn\u2019t the first scene that popped into her head.</p><p>And what does that say? That you\u2019d be happy to have a dating-type relationship with this man?</p><p>Could they try it? She shot him a look from beneath lowered lashes. He\u2019d said he\u2019d be interested in dropping over for a beer. They\u2019d cooked together. Watched TV together. They\u2019d done...normal stuff. He\u2019d asked where this relationship could go after their official loan business was behind them. He\u2019d even backed off when she\u2019d become more aggressive than usual. Could that be his way of hinting he wanted to try a plain old regular relationship with her but didn\u2019t know how to go about it? Could they start simple? Start over?</p><p>That might work. She\u2019d broach the subject and see how he responded.</p><p>After they\u2019d eaten, she said, \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking that we could be...friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d he repeated like it was some sort of disease.</p><p>\u201cSure. You have friends, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come over here for dinner. I could go over to your place. We could kick back. Shoot some pool.\u201d Crap. She shouldn\u2019t have tossed that last one in. His expression was a heated reminder of how they\u2019d used his pool table the last time.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know what the fuck to say to that.\u201d</p><p>The dryer buzzed.</p><p>Ainsley got his shirt and helped him put it on. She automatically started buttoning him up, like she\u2019d often done. Something about redressing him was almost more intimate than undressing him. She focused on smoothing wrinkles from the cotton as an excuse not to look into his compelling eyes as she touched him. Even when she wasn\u2019t supposed to be touching him.</p><p>Command me to stop, Bennett. It\u2019s always been your job to set the physical parameters between us.</p><p>When she finished buttoning, Ben pressed her hand against his chest. Right beneath his thundering heart. Was this side of him more dangerous than his Dom side? She had experience dealing with brash Bennett. This dateable Ben? Not so much.</p><p>But she wanted to see this side of him too. Maybe he just needed encouragement that she\u2019d accept this side of him.</p><p>Their eyes met. Then their lips. The kiss wasn\u2019t much more than a simple peck.</p><p>\u201cSo, call me tomorrow, friend,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cAinsley, I don\u2019t know if I can be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was not a request.\u201d She kissed him again, then firmly shoved him out the door.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Ben rang Ainsley\u2019s doorbell again. He\u2019d tried calling her cell several times and she hadn\u2019t picked up.</p><p>Maybe it was an excuse, showing up on her doorstep, but something felt...off. Something besides the bogus friendship she was trying to force on him.</p><p>Jesus. He didn\u2019t want to be her fucking friend. In the last two days he\u2019d already seen her pulling away. Not only from him, but from her submissive side. Trying to remake him into the type of guy he wasn\u2019t, denying her nature and attempting to change their relationship into something it never had been and never would be: normal.</p><p>Ben was starting to lose her. That thought had driven him bat-shit crazy all day after she hadn\u2019t returned any of his calls. Hopefully she hadn\u2019t reverted to old habits, like that post-date game mind-fuck where the woman waited a certain amount of time before returning her date from the previous night\u2019s calls, so as to not appear too eager.</p><p>Fuck that. They weren\u2019t goddamn dating. She needed a reminder of what they were together. Of how right it was. And if he had to wait until the loan went through, to prove it to her, so be it. But he wouldn\u2019t lie to her and he wouldn\u2019t allow her to lie to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So yeah, he was going all beastly Dom on her ass.</p><p>Frustrated, he turned the door handle. Locked. But the door snicked open because it hadn\u2019t been fully latched. That wasn\u2019t good. Ainsley was vigilant about locking the door.</p><p>Ben stepped inside.</p> <p>The cats stared at him from the end of the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAinsley?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>He scanned the living room. Her purse was on the chair, along with her coat. Her car keys and cell phone were on the side table.</p><p>He peeked in the kitchen, no sign of her. He headed down the short hallway. When he flipped on the lights in her bedroom, he noticed the sheets were twisted, the quilt thrown back, pillows scattered across the floor.</p> <p>His heart damn near stopped at seeing her curled up on the bathroom floor. \u201cShit.\u201d He crouched beside her body and found her pulse in her neck, thank God. \u201cAinsley?\u201d Ben placed his hand on her forehead. \u201cBaby. You\u2019re burning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, angel. Stay with me. I need to get you to the emergency room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doctors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d She tried to roll away.</p> <p>He held her still and tamped down his fear. \u201cThen what should I do?\u201d</p><p>She mumbled, \u201cCall Joely.\u201d</p><p>Ben grabbed Ainsley\u2019s cell and scrolled until he found Joely\u2019s number. He dropped to his knees beside her on the tile as he hit Send.</p><p>The doc picked up on the second ring. \u201cDoc? It\u2019s Ben McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen. Why are you on Ainsley\u2019s phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped to see her and found her layin\u2019 on the floor in the bathroom. Her skin is on fire. She won\u2019t go to the ER. It\u2019s freaking me out because she was fine yesterday.\u201d His words came out machine-gun fast.</p><p>\u201cCalm down. Can you tell if she\u2019s been throwing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s none on the floor or in her hair or anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you ask her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me on speaker.\u201d</p><p>Ben poked the button and held the phone lower. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAinsley, it\u2019s Joely Monroe. Ben says you\u2019re sick. Have you been vomiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shuddered and Ben\u2019s stomach roiled. He smoothed her damp hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you first start getting sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after I went to work this morning. I couldn\u2019t stay so I came home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me your symptoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot. Cold. Chills. Headache. Body aches. Sore throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sneezed a lot last night,\u201d Ben inserted.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken meds for any of the symptoms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s my on-the-fly diagnosis. She has the flu. Probably the twenty-four-hour variety. Hopefully it already hit its peak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need to take her to the ER?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless she gets markedly worse. Right now, she needs to take two Tylenol and in another hour, two Motrin. That should drop her fever. If she\u2019s awake, make her drink lots of water, but don\u2019t wake her to drink. Put cool cloths on her face. That\u2019ll at least give her the impression of coolness until her fever breaks.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou are able to stay with her tonight, Ben, or is there someone else she can call?\u201d</p><p>He tempered his initial response, No fucking way am I ever leaving her, to a calmer, \u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d He was freaked the fuck out. He\u2019d never taken care of a sick person before in his life. Sick calves? No problem. Sick person? Not ever.</p><p>\u201cThis is a pretty quick bug,\u201d the doc said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll warn you: it\u2019s highly contagious. You should expect to get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never get sick,\u201d he scoffed at the dial tone.</p><p>Ben tried to move her off the bathroom floor. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you into your own bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too hot in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cooler. I promise. Let me help you up.\u201d Ben practically carried Ainsley to her room. \u201cSit on the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always so bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of bein\u2019 a Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not my Dom anymore, so let me lay down.\u201d</p><p>He resisted the urge to snap, The fuck I\u2019m not your Dom. He breathed slowly and deeply, completely out of his element on so many levels. \u201cFirst you need to swallow your meds.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley screwed up her face.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d choked down the pills, she stretched out on the mattress.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes.\u201d He placed a cool washcloth on her forehead.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s nice. You\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I was bossy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are both nice and bossy. I like that about you. Two sides of the same coin.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhich side do you like better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nice side. I think you\u2019re afraid of showing that side of yourself to me, more than you are of showing me the Dom side.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. You\u2019re fighting the truth that you like that bossy side of me better.</p><p>Ben kicked off his boots and stretched out beside her. He wanted to fix her now. Scoop her up, race to the doctor and demand she be healed. He forced himself to calm down and watch her settle into sleep, reaching for her hand just as he began to drift off.</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s restlessness roused him. He glanced at the clock. Only an hour had passed.</p><p>She started to push up.</p><p>\u201cEasy. Anything you need I\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drink.\u201d</p><p>Ben moved to the edge of the bed and held a glass to her lips. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She drank every drop.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He switched out the skin-warmed washcloth for a cool one.</p><p>Ainsley sighed when he placed it over her forehead. \u201cThanks, Ben. You don\u2019t have to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s not like I have any new loan information for you.\u201d</p><p>That sounded a little cross. \u201cThanks for the update.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019d be interested in hanging out with me, especially if we\u2019re not having kinky sex,\u201d she said snarkily.</p><p>Ben\u2019s voice was pure Dom. \u201cThe lack of kinky sex was your choice. And it\u2019s a damn mystery why I\u2019m obsessed with hanging out with a woman like you who\u2019s beautiful, adventurous, smart and sexy as hell.\u201d</p><p>She slid the washcloth down and squinted at him. \u201cYou really see me that way?\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down her arm. \u201cYeah, angel, I do. You know I do. I see you a lot clearer than you see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come over tonight?\u201d</p><p>To remind you that I\u2019m not some pussy lap dog who will be happy with whatever scraps of friendship you toss at me. \u201cBecause I thought you were ditching my calls so I came over to chew your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you probably wanted to spank it too, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen. That\u2019s not...who we have to be.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it is. That\u2019s who we are. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. But she didn\u2019t need to deal with that issue now. \u201cChrist, Ainsley, it scared the crap outta me when I saw you on the bathroom floor.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and blindly patted his arm, soothing him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you checked on me. It\u2019s a very sweet, friend-like thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Sweet and friend-like my ass. Ben nudged the washcloth back into place. \u201cI need to buy you Motrin as per Doc\u2019s orders. Is there anything else you want from the store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry flavored throat lozenges and 7UP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Ben tucked the covers around her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>When he returned, Ainsley had fallen asleep again. He puttered around her kitchen. Putting the flowers he\u2019d bought in a vase. Finding a saucepan to heat up canned chicken soup. He bribed her cats with treats and chuckled when the fur balls became slightly less standoffish.</p><p>He heard the toilet flush and booked it to the bathroom. \u201cAinsley? You okay?\u201d</p><p>The door opened. \u201cI\u2019m tired of being in bed. I think I\u2019ll sit on the couch.\u201d</p><p>She had a pained expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head is pounding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the lights.\u201d Ben flipped on a lamp and sat beside her. \u201cCome here.\u201d He placed a pillow on his lap.</p><p>Ainsley rested the side of her face on the pillow and practically purred when he gently stroked her hair. \u201cGod. I love how you touch me. No matter how you touch me.\u201d</p><p>I know you do. \u201cSo...I made nice with your cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to bribe them, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Shamelessly. With multiple treats.\u201d</p><p>Her low laugh sent her into a coughing fit. She sat up, blew her nose, took another drink of water and popped a lozenge in her mouth. \u201cSorry. I hate being sick. You probably were one of those healthy kids, Mr. I-never-get-sick.\u201d</p><p>He touched her forehead. Her skin was much cooler.</p><p>She snuggled more deeply into him. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d Her breathing changed and he was certain she\u2019d crashed again, when she muttered, \u201cThanks for taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>Ben wrapped a curl around his index finger. \u201cIt\u2019s a first for me. I\u2019m more the \u2018sorry you\u2019re sick, gotta run\u2019 type of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re definitely more the \u2018I\u2019m your boyfriend and I\u2019ll take care of you\u2019 type now.\u201d</p><p>Boyfriend? Was that what he was to her? The role she\u2019d demoted him to?</p><p>Oh hell no. Fuck no. The kid gloves he\u2019d been treating her with the last few days were about to come off. Just as soon as she got over this fever-induced delirium.</p><p>Naturally, Mr.-I-never-get-sick...got sick.</p><p>He swore he was dying. He\u2019d contracted bubonic plague. Malaria. Leprosy. Typhoid. Ben McKay was a horrible patient. But Ainsley stayed with him from the onset of the first sniffles. Fussed over him. Took care of his dogs. And when he reached for her in the middle of the night, she willingly went into his arms and comforted him as he shook from his fever, not from passion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But even in sickness he\u2019d been in total Dom mode. That\u2019s when the reality of this situation with him began to sink in.</p><p>They were at an impasse. Not friends, no longer lovers. They\u2019d be at this turn in the road anyway, even if the loan business wasn\u2019t hanging over them, with the thirty days at an end. So why was she still at a tipping point? Unsure of what she wanted and afraid to tell him?</p><p>No. You\u2019re not afraid of Bennett; you\u2019re afraid he\u2019d see right through you when you lie to him.</p> <p>So an hour later when Ben returned from his trip to town and plopped next to her on his couch after his shower, she had a hard knot in her throat, wondering how she\u2019d keep this discussion matter of fact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sniffling. You feel like you\u2019re getting sick again?\u201d he asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was sniffing because you smell nice.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cI\u2019da showered sooner if you\u2019d told me I was stinky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t. I just like the scent of your soap.\u201d That type of comment is not keeping this neutral, Ainsley.</p> <p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d He grabbed the water bottle from the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cSo your mom stopped by while you were in town.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his mouthful of water. \u201cShe did? Shit. Sorry about that. She probably was a total pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley had wondered how he\u2019d react to Vi\u2019s surprise visit. \u201cNo, she was great. We talked about our backgrounds growing up with a father in service to God.\u201d</p><p>That startled him. \u201cGuess my grandfather was a real bastard. Kinda sucks that I was named after him. Is your dad like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just set in his ways. Your mom is an interesting woman. We have a lot in common. I liked her. She asked me out to lunch.\u201d</p> <p>Ben harrumphed. \u201cShe\u2019s a meddling woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was a lot warmer to me than Rielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Rielle was here too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently she heard you were sick and brought over a basket of muffins to send you on the road to recovery.\u201d An edge of jealousy crept into her tone despite her intent to curb it.</p><p>\u201cHuh. That\u2019s weird.\u201d He pointed to a colorful ball on the chair. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Why did he blatantly change the subject whenever Rielle was mentioned? \u201cMy knitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnitting. You knit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I had to have something productive to do while you were feverish and thrashing around.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWhy? Do you think it\u2019s a lame hobby?\u201d Not the right type of hobby for a sub? Are my hands supposed to busy tending to your needs all the time?</p> <p>Not fair.</p><p>Ben shrugged. \u201cNot lame at all. You\u2019ve never mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t exactly spent our time talking in the last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, angel, I might take that as a complaint. Especially when you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t wanna talk about stuff.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley rested her cheek on the couch cushion. She\u2019d rehearsed this conversation in her head and now was the time to have it for real. \u201cNot a complaint, Ben. Just an observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna like this observation, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cI like how it\u2019s been between us the last couple days, almost more than I did when we were Dom and sub.\u201d</p><p>The wounded look on his face made her feel as if she\u2019d sliced him in two. \u201cYou don\u2019t really mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. But that\u2019s the issue. I don\u2019t know what I mean.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSex with you... God, I never dreamed a physical relationship could be that all-consuming. And it was between us. Every single time. The amount of intensity varied, but it was always there.\u201d She glanced away, unsure how to finish.</p><p>After a minute or so, Ben said, \u201cCan you look at me, please?\u201d</p><p>Not a Dom command. She looked at him. In his eyes she saw fear, honesty, trust and power. She saw everything she needed. She saw everything she shouldn\u2019t want. Everything she was too...scared to reach out and take.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really goin\u2019 on? Did my mother say something to you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>His blue eyes snapped fire. \u201cRielle? Did she open her big mouth? Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ainsley put her fingers over his lips. \u201cNothing like that. They were both just curious about why I was at your house. And I didn\u2019t know what to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what, Ben? We met at a sex club? And we were taking a test drive as Dom and sub couple?\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cI just...can\u2019t do this anymore. We aren\u2019t lovers.\u201d She smiled sadly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be my friend, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That hurt. \u201cSo, it\u2019s all sex or nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ve been following your parameters, Ainsley. But when we\u2019re through with the business aspect of this loan? I want a chance to put things back the way they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Dom, me sub.\u201d</p><p>His hard gaze pinned her in place. \u201cReally? That\u2019s how you saw what we had together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d This was not going as planned. \u201cI thought I wanted to talk to you about this and now I see why I don\u2019t.\u201d She pushed off the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t answer. She just gathered her things and headed for the door.</p><p>Ben hadn\u2019t kissed her at all since that night at her house when she\u2019d suggested friendship. When he helped her put on her coat, she wanted to melt into him. She wished he\u2019d go full Dom on her. Demand she stay.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t say a word. He didn\u2019t even walk her out to her car.</p><p>That\u2019s when she knew it really was over.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>This bullshit situation with Ainsley sucked ass. Stuck in fucking limbo. In purgatory.</p><p>Waiting, waiting, waiting.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen her for two goddamn days. He\u2019d even called her yesterday at the bank to check on the status of his loan, which was a legitimate reason to contact her because it was getting down to the wire and he\u2019d need the money by the end of the week. For some reason him calling to ask about the loan pissed her off. Then his...request to take her to lunch ticked her off too. She\u2019d said no, she\u2019d be in touch, and hung up on him.</p><p>Ben had called her again today. First thing. He\u2019d been nice. Polite. Purposely un-Dom-like. And he\u2019d gotten the same damn response. A polite fucking brush off.</p><p>It\u2019d taken every ounce of strength not to march into her office, throw her over his shoulder and drag her to his place, where he could tie her to the bed, and make her listen to him. Make her understand that he fucking loved her. And this waiting to tell her what she meant to him was killing him.</p><p>His phone rang. He\u2019d barely said hello, when Kane barked, \u201cBen? Hope you ain\u2019t busy, but we\u2019re in need of your peacekeeping abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell and Colt got into it, and now Brandt and Dalton jumped in. I can\u2019t hold \u2019em all back from beatin\u2019 the shit outta Colt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Casper\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Ben hit the brakes and spun a U-turn in the middle of the road. \u201cOn my way.\u201d</p><p>Seven minutes later he reached the turnoff to Casper\u2019s place.</p><p>Tell stood nose to nose with Colt. Brandt and Dalton flanked Tell on either side. Kane had positioned himself to Colt\u2019s right. Their focus shifted when Ben skidded into the driveway. He jumped out of his truck, noticing Colt had seized the opportunity to step back a couple of feet.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your fuckin\u2019 business what\u2019s goin\u2019 on, Ben, so back the fuck off and go home,\u201d Tell snarled.</p><p>That threw him off. Tell was the most even-keeled one in the family. \u201cFine. Me\u2019n Colt and Kane will go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere until he gives us some fuckin\u2019 answers.\u201d</p><p>Tell started to push into Colt\u2019s face again, but Ben stepped between them. \u201cBack off, Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Move outta the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said. Back. Off.\u201d</p><p>That tone caught Tell\u2019s attention. Some of the rage in his eyes momentarily cleared.</p><p>Ben pointed to Colt and Tell. \u201cNow someone start talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Colt, you heard what Ben said. Start talking,\u201d Dalton sneered.</p><p>Colt\u2019s arms were folded across his chest. \u201cThis would be easier for all of us if you\u2019d just move aside and let me get what I came for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is who?\u201d Ben asked with total confusion.</p><p>\u201cOur dad,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cHe\u2019s been gone five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive days? Why\u2019s this the first I\u2019ve heard of it?\u201d He looked at Kane.</p><p>\u201cHey, it was the first I\u2019ve heard of it too. How come no one told us he was gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you give a shit about Casper. None of you even bothered to come by and see him after Mom left,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>Ben disputed that statement. \u201cQuinn came by about six months ago and Casper threatened to shoot him. So I\u2019ll hazard a guess you don\u2019t know everyone that stopped by to check on him.\u201d</p><p>But Brandt, Dalton and Tell were focused on Colt. Fists clenched. Eyes hard.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and take a swing at me,\u201d Colt said. \u201cWon\u2019t change nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody is takin\u2019 a swing at no one,\u201d Kane said. \u201cAnd quit fuckin\u2019 taunting them, Colt. It ain\u2019t helpin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill somebody please tell me what the fuck is goin\u2019 on?\u201d Ben demanded.</p><p>Colt said, \u201cI stopped by to get something Casper asked for. These guys won\u2019t let me in the house to get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he won\u2019t tell us where Dad is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane drawled, \u201cAin\u2019t this fun? Been at this point since I called you.\u201d</p><p>Ben addressed Colt. \u201cSo is Casper staying with you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something would cover it.\u201d</p> <p>He sensed Colt wanted to talk, but their cousins had pushed him in the corner and he wouldn\u2019t be the first to back out. \u201cCome on, Colt, give \u2019em more than that. Obviously they\u2019re worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoulda fooled me,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a smug asshole,\u201d Tell hissed.</p><p>Ben glared at his cousin. \u201cNot helping. And I wouldn\u2019t talk to you either if you said shit like that to me, so shut it, Tell.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything for a solid minute.</p> <p>Colt dropped the defensive posture. \u201cFine. Casper is in alcohol treatment.\u201d</p><p>Stunned silence.</p><p>\u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 serious?\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me.\u201d Colt rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cActually he called Indy because she\u2019s one of the only family members Casper hasn\u2019t crossed. But I ended up answering her phone and talking to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d Tell demanded.</p><p>\u201cA couple weeks ago. He was drunk as hell. I told him no one could help him until he walked away from the booze. I didn\u2019t figure he would. If you knew how many phone calls I\u2019ve gotten, from folks wantin\u2019 my help...\u201d He sighed. \u201cSo to be honest, I didn\u2019t put much store in it. Until he showed up at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Dalton barked.</p><p>\u201cFive days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get dried out.\u201d</p><p>Tell wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Colt remained mute.</p> <p>When it appeared all three of Casper\u2019s sons intended to beat the answers out of Colt, Ben stepped in. \u201cThis macho bullshit posturing is pointless.\u201d He addressed Brandt, Tell and Dalton. \u201cJesus, guys, stop and think. Colt can\u2019t tell you because of AA confidentiality rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout bein\u2019 a dick, if Casper would\u2019ve wanted you guys to know where he was, he would\u2019ve told you,\u201d Kane added.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be the first fuckin\u2019 time Dad\u2019s kept us in the dark,\u201d Dalton retorted.</p><p>\u201cYou just...helped him? No questions asked?\u201d Brandt asked Colt. \u201cAfter all the bad shit he\u2019s done to the family?\u201d</p><p>Colt simply said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t matter where he is, \u2019cause you can bet he won\u2019t make it through treatment. He\u2019ll be back home, same mean SOB as before, same drunken asshole as before,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>Colt shoved Ben aside and pushed Tell with enough force he almost fell on his ass. \u201cThat\u2019s how you react after your father acknowledges he has a problem? By expecting he\u2019ll fail? Fuck you. This is why he didn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014come to his sons. It\u2019s why he came to me, because I travel this path every fuckin\u2019 day. I know exactly where he is, in more ways than one. It\u2019s also why I\u2019m goin\u2019 in the goddammed house, getting his bible and getting the hell outta here. But you can bet your ass I won\u2019t burden him with tales of your overwhelming concern.\u201d Colt shouldered his way through Brandt and Dalton and stormed up the porch.</p><p>Kane followed him.</p><p>Ben really didn\u2019t know what to say. This family shit tore him up. He and his brothers never had the volatile relationship with each other and their father that Uncle Casper had with his boys, and to some extent that Uncle Carson had with his. Because Ben hated conflict and tried to cut through it as quickly as possible, he\u2019d gotten the reputation in the family as the peacemaker. He felt far from that today.</p><p>Colt wasn\u2019t inside long. He bounded down the porch, holding a burgundy book.</p><p>\u201cSo who knows about Dad bein\u2019 in rehab?\u201d Brandt asked Colt.</p><p>\u201cMy dad, Uncle Cal and Uncle Charlie. Casper asked me to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not us,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t like our dads said anything to us either,\u201d Kane pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that I think about it, you sneaky bastards have no right to get up in my face about keeping secrets,\u201d Colt said. \u201cDid you really think we wouldn\u2019t find out that the three of you planned to buy Rielle\u2019s place? Without discussing it with the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>Brandt frowned. \u201cWhat the hell are you babbling about, Colt?\u201d</p><p>It took Colt all of four seconds to see the guilt on Tell and Dalton\u2019s faces. \u201cYou didn\u2019t include Brandt in on this scheme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScheme is a little harsh,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>Colt whirled on him. \u201cWhat about Quinn? Does he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 to know. Just something that Tell, Dalton and I discussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019ve been squawking about wanting an equal say in the operation, this is the type of thing that oughta be discussed by all of us,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>Pissed off, Ben shot back, \u201cLike the acquisition of the Foster place was discussed by all of us? Or how about the acquisition of the Hackerly place? Or the acquisition of the Borden place? Or how about the separate section up north that Kade ran for a year? Were we part of that discussion, or did Carson and Cal decide to do that on their own? Oh, right, they didn\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 ask us.\u201d His gesture included Tell, Dalton, and Brandt. \u201cAny of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the same and you know it, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Alls I know is that it\u2019s perfectly fine for your families to add to your sections whenever the fuck you feel like it and run it as a separate operation. But when we wanna do that? It\u2019s like we\u2019re tryin\u2019 to short shrift the entire ranch.\u201d Ben forced a slow breath, trying to drop his blood pressure from the boiling point.</p><p>Kane said, \u201cI know it probably don\u2019t mean shit, but for the record, Ben, I agree with you. And if you can get the Wetzler place, or part of it, and be fair to Rielle, then do it. Me\u2019n Kade won\u2019t begrudge you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a moot point because Rielle has already sold it,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben, Dalton and Tell said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you hear this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this mornin\u2019 from Cord and Colby. We heard last week from someone at the bank Rielle was behind on payments and about to be foreclosed on. So we stopped by to talk to her. Pissed her off. I\u2019ve never seen Rielle like that. Woman had a damn shotgun pointed at us. Said she was tired of the McKay vultures pickin\u2019 at her bones before she was even dead. So we took that to mean you all knew about her situation, and made an offer, which apparently wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it was!\u201d Dalton protested. \u201cWe were just waitin\u2019 for her to give us the go-ahead.\u201d</p><p>Colt shook his head. \u201cShe said she\u2019d hadn\u2019t seen money, and the time was closing in on her. So she sold it to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Dalton turned his anger on Ben. \u201cWhat the hell did you do? You assured us you had it handled with Rielle.\u201d</p><p>Ben threw up his hands. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you let her know we were serious? Or did you just mention it in passing?\u201d Tell demanded.</p><p>\u201cI told her we\u2019d make the payments to catch her up and then we\u2019d discuss division of property. She said she needed time to think it over. So I gave it to her.\u201d</p><p>Dalton stepped forward and poked Ben in the chest. \u201cIt\u2019s been three goddamn weeks, Ben. This should\u2019ve been wrapped up two weeks ago. What the hell have you been doin\u2019 with your time? Goin\u2019 to that bar in Gillette?\u201d</p><p>He knocked Dalton\u2019s hand away. \u201cBack off. I didn\u2019t have as much cash as I needed so I had to get a loan for my portion and that took time.\u201d Jesus, he hated to admit that.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve been able to get a signature loan. We\u2019ve been dealin\u2019 with Settler\u2019s First for years.\u201d Tell\u2019s eyes turned accusatory. \u201cOr are you in hock for something we don\u2019t know about and they wouldn\u2019t give you the money?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks burned, not from embarrassment, but from pure anger. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to Settler\u2019s First because it\u2019s pretty fuckin\u2019 obvious that our cousins have someone inside the bank feeding them confidential information. And you can be guaran-damn-teed if I\u2019d waltzed in there, asking for a loan for some land that would be comin\u2019 up for sale soon?\u201d He jerked his thumb toward Colt. \u201cThey would\u2019ve known about it and acted on it. So I had to go to the new bank. And like I said, that took time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is the one fuckin\u2019 thing we didn\u2019t have. You should\u2019ve come clean with us about your money issues and we would\u2019ve given Rielle a down payment, or good faith payment, or something! Instead of givin\u2019 her time to think us right outta that chunk of land. Jesus. I don\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d Tell said. \u201cThis is your fault.\u201d</p><p>No one disputed Tell\u2019s statement.</p><p>Colt and Kane wandered to their trucks.</p><p>\u201cSo you really ain\u2019t gonna tell us where he is?\u201d Brandt shouted.</p><p>Colt faced Brandt, Tell and Dalton. \u201cCasper will contact you when he\u2019s ready. Let him be until then.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything until Colt\u2019s pickup was a black speck in the plume of dust.</p><p>\u201cAs fucking awesome as this was, I\u2019m getting the hell outta here,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta call Quinn on your way home and fill him in,\u201d Brandt suggested with a snarl. \u201cI agree with my brothers, Ben. You should\u2019ve handled this better and now we\u2019re all payin\u2019 for it.\u201d</p><p>Rage and regret formed a toxic cocktail and Ben knew if he stayed here another minute, he\u2019d lose his mind. This wasn\u2019t solely his fault. And fuck them all if they expected him to shoulder all the blame.</p><p>But he knew he\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>\u201cThese two are gonna tell me every fuckin\u2019 thing they kept from me while we clean up the shit piles in Dad\u2019s house since he ain\u2019t here for awhile.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Dalton opened his mouth to protest, Brandt sent him a death glare.</p><p>Fun times.</p><p>Ben did call Quinn.

I\u2019ve seen her car at your place several times in the last few weeks. And isn\u2019t it a coincidence the bank she runs wouldn\u2019t lend me the money I needed to keep my land? But I\u2019ll bet she was more than happy to loan money to you so you could buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re what? Punishing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about you, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get you into the financial mess you\u2019re in,\u201d he retorted hotly, \u201cand you don\u2019t honestly believe I had dishonorable intentions when I offered to help bail you out of that situation.\u201d</p><p>Rielle shivered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to believe. That was the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d you sell to?\u201d</p><p>It appeared she wouldn\u2019t answer and then she said, \u201cI sold it to Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s mouth nearly hit the porch slats. \u201cGavin? As in my brother Gavin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. He made me an offer...the same day you did, actually. I told him the same thing I told you. I\u2019d think about it. Your cousins coming by last week made my decision. I called Gavin, we came to a verbal agreement and he paid off my note, that day, in its entirely, in cash. He\u2019s having his real estate lawyer draw up the terms of sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. And you just trust him? You don\u2019t know him, Ree. Not like you know us.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Ben. I\u2019ve hired my own attorney to look over the agreement, and you can bet your ass that lawyer is not Ginger McKay.\u201d Rielle shook her head. \u201cSorry. That was uncalled for. You have no idea how hard this has been on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t hafta be.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes connected with a point over his shoulder. \u201cDid I ever tell you the last thing my daddy said to me? Don\u2019t sell the land to the McKays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I sold it to Gavin. That man is about as far from a McKay as you can get.\u201d</p><p>Stung by her cutting words, he shot back, \u201cSorry we\u2019ve been such horrible neighbors for the last thirty years. Bet you won\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d she implored. \u201cThis is just business.\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Dalton and Tell said the same thing?</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben stared at her suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re not moving out and Gavin is moving in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Gavin agreed to divide the land. The creek front is mine so eventually I\u2019ll be able to build on it. Since he\u2019s not sure of his plans, long-term or short-term, I\u2019ll continue living in the house just like I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nothin\u2019 has changed for you,\u201d he said dully.</p><p>\u201cEverything has changed for me.\u201d</p><p>Ben was at a loss. Feeling betrayed on many levels, by his cousin\u2019s accusations, by his longtime friend, and by his brother. And since he didn\u2019t know what to say, he turned and walked away.</p><p>Rielle\u2019s shouted offer to finally pay him for the beds fell on deaf ears.</p><p>So he\u2019d called his father to share the love. \u201cBen. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy curiosity mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your tone don\u2019t match your words. You sound mad as hell, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He counted to fifty. \u201cI just left Uncle Casper\u2019s house where I had to keep Brandt, Tell and Dalton from beating the tar outta Colt.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t seem particularly surprised about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much surprises me these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure shocked the shit outta us,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cBefore you chew my ass, lemme say Casper\u2019s private business is not mine to share with you or with them.\u201d A pause and Ben heard the squeak of his dad\u2019s office chair. \u201cSo I take it Casper\u2019s boys just found out?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s knuckles turned white on the steering wheel. \u201cYeah. Kane called me to run interference and keep fists from flying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat responsibility always seems to fall to you, don\u2019t it? Bein\u2019 the one to smooth things over and calm them hotheads down.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised his father had noticed.</p><p>\u201cLook, none of us have been on the best terms with Casper, especially in the last year. But he is my brother. You know you\u2019d keep your brother\u2019s secrets too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of my brothers are better at keeping secrets than others, aren\u2019t they,\u201d he snarled. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid, it just pisses me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you calling me, throwing accusations left and right is pissin\u2019 me off? Why don\u2019t you just spit it the hell out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Gavin bought the Wetzler place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Gavin? Wait. Since when has it been for sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d Ben explained what\u2019d gone down. His dad stayed silent for so long Ben wondered if they\u2019d gotten cut off. \u201cYou there?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m just stunned. Gavin hasn\u2019t said a word about it to me or to Vi.\u201d Ben\u2019s relief was short lived, however, when his dad said, \u201cBut I\u2019m takin\u2019 this as a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou consider it a good sign that Gavin would purposely fuck us over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna ignore that smartass remark bein\u2019s you\u2019re not acting at all like yourself. What I meant was I\u2019m takin\u2019 this as a sign that Gavin wants to be closer to us. He\u2019s interested in becoming part of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily doesn\u2019t do shit like this to each other, and if he\u2019s that type of guy, then I sure as fuck don\u2019t want him as part of my family.\u201d</p><p>A deep paternal sigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. Have you talked to Gavin about any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t care if I ever talk to Gavin again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t mean it, because I do. This day has been a clusterfuck of epic proportions and I need a goddamn drink. Later.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>When Ben reached his house, his temper had pegged overload. Needing to blow off steam, he roughhoused with his dogs. He chopped and stacked firewood. After a long, hot shower, he\u2019d calmed down and poured himself a hefty shot of Pendleton whiskey.</p><p>Ace and Deuce dozed by the woodstove. Ben had always kept his shit moods to himself, dealt with them himself. It worked for him.</p><p>But wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have someone to share this with? Someone to listen to you, verbally soothe you and then you could lose yourself in the heat, softness and surrender of her body to yours?</p><p>Just another fucked up situation in his life. Taking out the damn loan in the first place is what had caused him to lose Ainsley. All because he wanted to do something good, something helpful for his family. All his family saw was the loss of the land. There\u2019s no way he could make them understand he\u2019d lost something far more valuable.</p><p>Grabbing the bottle, he flopped in front of the TV and flipped the channel to Wheel of Fortune. But he\u2019d gotten so used to watching the show with Ainsley in the last month, it felt pathetic sitting by himself, guessing the puzzles out loud.</p><p>Halfway through the program his phone buzzed. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, but he answered it anyway. \u201cBen McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen? Gavin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up. Please hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart that fast talking bullshit you do so well, cause you\u2019ve got about thirty seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie called me, mad as hell, and chewed my ass. I assure you I didn\u2019t want any of you to find out this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat way were we supposed to find out? The McKays are a big family in a small community. Word gets around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I overheard your conversation with Rielle the morning after Chase\u2019s event. You made her a fair offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you swooped in and made her a better one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But not for the reason you think. I bought it as an investment.\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed harshly. \u201cSo you\u2019re giving up life as an Arizona real estate tycoon to run a B&amp;B in nowhere Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly. I\u2019m not big on repeating others mistakes. I\u2019ve seen Rielle struggling with the B&amp;B since I first stayed with her. When she asked for advice I gave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig surprise that your advice to her was to sell...to you.\u201d</p><p>Gavin sighed. \u201cI\u2019m in real estate. I make decisions like this all the time. It\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s goddamned personal to me. My family has been tryin\u2019 to buy that for three decades and once again it\u2019s in a stranger\u2019s hands. Now you\u2019re giving my folks the impression that you\u2019re moving to Wyoming, changing your last name to McKay, which we both know ain\u2019t true.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When silence burned his ear, Ben wished he could take the words back.</p><p>\u201cI never meant to give Charlie and Vi false hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.

Mom and Dad will take any kind of hope when it comes to you, and I don\u2019t wanna see them hurt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a bad guy, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d Ben drained his whiskey. \u201cAnd by my clock your thirty seconds are up.\u201d He hung up and poured himself another drink.</p><p>Everything in his life had gone to hell in the last two days and he saw no clear way to fix any of it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Not a good sign when a smug Turton knocked on her office door before quitting time on Tuesday and made himself comfortable. \u201cGlad to see you\u2019ve recovered from your illness.\u201d</p> <p>What the heck? He didn\u2019t give a rip about her health. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, some of us have a stronger constitution than others. I make it a point to take good care of myself so I don\u2019t catch every bug that crawls along.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Turton, you are the picture of health with your bony-assed body and pasty complexion. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m not sure how to approach this. Saturday evening I stopped into the Golden Boot. Our Jenny was there and she and I started talking...\u201d He picked lint off his sport coat before continuing. \u201cThen I ran into Steve Talbot at the diner Sunday morning. We had breakfast together, which included a pretty interesting conversation.\u201d</p><p>She did not like the turd\u2019s need to talk around the subject to build suspense before he got to the point. She really didn\u2019t like that he\u2019d become so friendly with Jenny.</p><p>\u201cInterestingly enough, both Jenny and Steve posed the same question to me. A question about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe? Why on earth would I be a topic of conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I asked myself. I\u2019ve been so busy doing my job here at the bank, that I pay little attention to office gossip, and even less attention to the small town gossip about the citizens of Sundance.\u201d</p><p>Doing my job here at the bank. As if she\u2019d been sitting in the employee break room checking her Facebook page all day rather than working.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll admit to being perplexed that both Jenny and Steve mentioned the same thing. Numerous times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are involved with Ben McKay.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s lungs seized up.</p><p>\u201cWhich wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, since you are both single adults. And if you prefer to sneak around and see him on the sly because he\u2019s got a...questionable reputation with the ladies, that\u2019s your business. So that, in and of itself, didn\u2019t bother me. But when Jenny informed me that Ben McKay had applied for a loan, through you, not through Leslie? And that no one in the office was aware of this loan but you? And you immediately sent the loan application to Denver for approval and priority processing? Well, that did bother me. Quite a bit actually. So much that I spent the entire morning verifying those facts.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Steve suggested that you\u2019ve been intimately involved with Ben McKay to get the McKays\u2019 banking business away from Settler\u2019s First...I really didn\u2019t know how to respond, except to agree with him it\u2019s very unprofessional on your part, but not necessarily unethical. Then Steve said he saw you and Ben together, late at night after Chase McKay\u2019s event, and early the next morning, which by my estimation is about a week prior to Ben applying for a loan. And that also brings up the question if you were involved with Ben McKay before you helped arrange the community event for his brother, and if that involvement swayed your recommendation for the bank to donate five thousand dollars to Chase McKay\u2019s foundation.\u201d</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m shocked, Ainsley. You have a solid reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s where you\u2019ll make this supposed scandal go away and allow me to keep my solid reputation intact if I...what? Quit and recommend you take over as bank president?\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed with pure spite. \u201cI\u2019d never stoop to blackmail. I truly feel this situation needs to be brought to the attention of the management team at the corporate office in Denver.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley was infuriated because everything that\u2019d been done on the up and up would now be brought into question. All her actions would be scrutinized. With the bank\u2019s avoidance of scandal, after the fiasco with a nonprofit group that\u2019d felled the man tapped to take the president\u2019s position, she suspected she\u2019d be fired. With jobs so hard to come by in the financial world, she\u2019d be lucky to find another job anywhere in the banking industry.</p><p>And admitting her sexual relationship with Ben had ended the day he applied for the loan would be a moot point. Another moot point would be defending her decision to process the loan herself because Leslie had left the office that day due to illness. And yet another moot point would be mentioning she\u2019d sent loan paperwork through herself all the time in her previous bank position. It wasn\u2019t like Ben McKay hadn\u2019t met all the criteria required of every other person who applied for a loan.</p><p>All valid points that wouldn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve set up a conference call for Thursday.\u201d</p><p>Turton stood, wearing a look of fake sympathy she wanted to smack right off his face.</p><p>Great plan, Ainsley. Add assault to your charges.</p><p>\u201cAnd not to worry, I will have the utmost discretion with this matter.\u201d But only until it\u2019s resolved and then I\u2019ll gossip with glee, was heavily implied.</p><p>She closed the computer programs. Tidied up the papers on her desk. Made a stack of filing to finish so Turton could easily find the files after she got canned. She was half tempted to track down a box for easy transport of her measly personal belongings, so she wouldn\u2019t have to paw through the damn Dumpster on Thursday afternoon.</p><p>Jenny knocked on the door. \u201cI\u2019m leaving. Do you need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>You know damn well it isn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Ainsley didn\u2019t look up. While she knew this situation wasn\u2019t Jenny\u2019s fault, she\u2019d definitely played a part in bringing it about.</p><p>The door closed quietly.</p><p>Ainsley drove home on autopilot. She slipped on pajamas and snuggled with her cats. But even they tired of her tears after a while. Miserable, her red-rimmed gaze swept over her living room. She still had stuff in boxes. That\u2019d make moving easier.</p><p>Easier. Right. This was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever have to do.</p><p>Ainsley debated on answering the door when Ben knocked. She\u2019d spent the last twenty-four hours in misery, coming to some harsh realizations\u2014about herself, her life and Ben. But she couldn\u2019t postpone the inevitable so she flipped the locks and let him in.</p><p>Ben blew right past her. \u201cI went by the bank today but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Great. Like she needed more fuel added to the fire by Ben casually stopping by. \u201cI took a personal day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Ben yanked off his duster and draped it across the back of the couch.</p><p>Huh? That was it? For a man who claimed to be so in tune with her, why hadn\u2019t he noticed her distraction? Her haggard appearance?</p><p>Then he was right there, peering into her face with raptness that made her feel as transparent as glass. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be about to lose my job.\u201d</p><p>Ben went motionless. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your loan. Turton, the VP, confronted me about it. He got ahold of the paperwork and said it was bogus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that why you didn\u2019t go into work today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he find out? Not that it matters now, but I should\u2019ve told you the real reason I applied for the loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ainsley fought a sense of dread. \u201cWhat real reason? What did you intend to use the money for if not for furniture equipment and supplies?\u201d</p><p>Distractedly, he said, \u201cA down payment on Rielle\u2019s land, actually. She was in a financial bind. Doesn\u2019t hold true now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me? You lied on the loan application?\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you meant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I meant the loan itself was bogus, not the reason for the loan. But my God, this makes it ten times worse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that! Don\u2019t you understand? Turton questioned why I sent your loan paperwork to the head office myself, instead of running it through our loan officer. Like I was trying to hide it because we\u2019ve been sneaking around. Then he brought up Chase\u2019s event. How I pushed for the bank\u2019s sponsorship and donation, and now my motives would be construed as dishonest, given our intimate relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all bullshit, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d she shot back. \u201cWe have been sexually involved on a level that isn\u2019t normal...which makes me even more paranoid because what if people found out what I let you do to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do to you?\u201d he repeated incredulously. \u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cYou know what that means, Bennett.\u201d She paced and the cats scattered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. Dammit. I haven\u2019t been acting responsibly since the second I donned that stupid wig and waltzed into the Rawhide Club pretending to be someone I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sayin\u2019 you\u2019re sorry we met?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t answer that\u2014she couldn\u2019t. \u201cAll Turton\u2019s accusations have a grain of truth that once piled up makes a damn convincing argument about my poor judgment. As bank president, I can\u2019t have poor financial judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Turton guy is just tryin\u2019 to scare you because I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has scared me. He\u2019s already set up a phone conference with the district manager for tomorrow. So it\u2019s not like he\u2019s blackmailing me. He intends to get me fired.\u201d She continued pacing. \u201cI\u2019ll have to move back to Denver. Although I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019ll live or what I\u2019ll do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAinsley.

But she\u2019d known it was coming. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stay if I asked you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStay where? In Sundance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d She froze when he continued staring at her with that Dom look. \u201cI can\u2019t ever...be that.\u201d</p><p>Ben frowned. \u201cBe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lifestyle submissive. Like Layla. With the collar, the full subservience and the discipline whippings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor Christsake!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think I want from you?\u201d</p><p>He never bellowed and Ainsley shrank back.</p><p>\u201cGod, Ainsley, do you really think I\u2019m some kind of controlling monster? That I purposely set out to fuck up your professional life so I could force you into a lifestyle that you\u2019re not suited for, for my own selfish purposes?\u201d</p><p>When he put it like that, she felt petty. Bitchy. Ben knew all her vulnerabilities. And he\u2019d never used them against her. Not once.</p><p>But you\u2019ve used his against him. You\u2019re about to use them now.</p><p>\u201cNo. But this circumstance has driven home the point I didn\u2019t know what I was getting into with this Dom/sub thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know I was na\u00efve. Stupidly hopeful. Nothing but a tourist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Ben demanded.</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t want to give him false hope. Confess what the last few weeks had meant to her. Confess what he meant to her. She had to take a hard stance and make a clean break, no matter if it would break her. \u201cI knew exactly what you were when I met you, Bennett. A Dom. My job crisis changes nothing for you. You\u2019re still a Dom. You still need the club. The friendships you\u2019ve made and acceptance you\u2019ve gotten at the Rawhide are important to you. I\u2019d never ask you to give that up.\u201d</p><p>Realization dawned in his eyes. His jaw went rigid. \u201cBut it\u2019s changed everything for you. You can\u2019t be a part of it. At all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Even if by some miracle this loan fiasco blows over, I can\u2019t be in a relationship, even casually, with a man who frequents a sex club. Banking is a conservative industry and women have an even harder row to hoe than men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excuse? Right. Because no one has ever lost their job due to a sex scandal,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>That shut him down for a minute or so. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d Ainsley briefly squeezed her eyes shut against the tears and the pain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to change you. But you need to understand I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>When she looked into his wounded blue eyes, her heart went into free fall.</p><p>\u201cSo this is it? You\u2019re cutting me loose? Because of what I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this the wrong way, Ben, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop. Please. Stop justifying it. This...fuck...it\u2019s...\u201d His voice caught. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>With an economy of movement, Ben slipped on the black duster. He grabbed his hat off the sofa table.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look broken-hearted when he walked out. He just looked broken.</p><p>Thursday was the longest day in the history of the world.</p><p>She\u2019d put a couple of contingency plans in place on the off chance it\u2019d work in her favor.</p><p>Ten minutes before the phone conference was scheduled to start, she left her office. Turton left his office at the same time. Not a coincidence and she felt manipulated.</p><p>\u201cAinsley? Turton?\u201d</p><p>They turned and looked at Leslie. \u201cI know you\u2019ve got a conference call scheduled with the district manager in a few minutes. And because this call is regarding a loan situation, as the sole loan officer in this branch, I want to lead the call.\u201d</p><p>Turton harrumphed and walked into the conference room.</p><p>Ainsley and Leslie followed.</p><p>\u201cFrankly, Leslie, I\u2019m a little disappointed that you are rushing to Ainsley\u2019s defense. I imagine the district manager won\u2019t see it as a smart judgment call for you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, Turton. I\u2019m not rushing to Ainsley\u2019s defense. I merely want the chance to explain why I didn\u2019t originate these loans. My part\u2014or lack thereof\u2014should be clarified because I need this job.\u201d</p><p>Turton\u2019s beady eyes narrowed behind his glasses. \u201cLoans?\u201d he said sharply. \u201cAs in Ainsley\u2019s tried to circumvent normal channels to slide another loan through?\u201d</p><p>Leslie sat at the head of the table. \u201cNo. To be honest, I would\u2019ve processed Ben McKay\u2019s loan, had he come to me, and it would\u2019ve netted the same result. The loan I\u2019m questioning is the one you originated for Jenny, our bank receptionist, for a new car.\u201d</p><p>His lips flattened.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you didn\u2019t tell me about this loan, Turton? Why you circumvented normal channels to slide it through? Given the fact Jenny is an employee and she has no assets? Plus, a few employees have questioned whether there\u2019s more going on between you and Jenny than just a working relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is outrageous!\u201d</p><p>Even-tempered Leslie vanished. She slapped the file folders on the table. \u201cAny more outrageous than you accusing Ainsley of having more than a working relationship with Ben McKay? I find it outrageous you expect to run Ainsley out on a rail for making one bad judgment call, when you\u2019ve done exactly the same thing. You\u2019re both in the wrong here. Neither of you followed proper procedure.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley stared at Leslie, both impressed and scared by her ability to ferret out information.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to blackmail me?\u201d Turton sneered.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re both going to let me handle the phone call with management. Where I will bring up the general question of loan origination. Who has the authority to do it? Then I\u2019ll point out you both originated loans without going through me. Since we\u2019re a new branch, and this hasn\u2019t come up before, I wanted to be the one to ask for clarification with both the president and the vice president in attendance so there\u2019d be no disputes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d</p><p>Do not lunge across the conference table and wrap your hands around his scrawny throat.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Because if you continue with your accusations about Ainsley\u2019s involvement with Ben McKay prior to the loan, I have documentation of times you were spotted with Jenny Timsdale, outside of banking hours, prior to her loan application too.\u201d</p><p>Turton\u2019s face immediately went bright red. He seemed too angry to speak.</p><p>But Leslie wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cI strongly advise you allow me to handle this phone conference. That way we can all keep our jobs and continue to work together as one big, happy family here at National West Bank.\u201d</p><p>For the first time in two days, Ainsley felt like the world wasn\u2019t crumbling beneath her feet. On a professional level anyway.</p><p>Leslie looked at them each in turn. \u201cSo. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>Turton wouldn\u2019t meet Ainsley\u2019s gaze. \u201cMake the call.\u201d</p><p>The district manager was notoriously cranky. After listening to Leslie\u2019s question, he let fly. Chewing out both Ainsley and Turton for overstepping their bounds and reminding them National West assigned a loan officer at that location for a reason. Then he reminded them of their responsibilities and if they were too busy doing someone else\u2019s job, they were neglecting their own. In a totally surprising move, he insisted Ainsley and Turton attend an interpersonal management skills workshop in Denver. Over the weekend. He commended Leslie for her attention to detail. All in all, the phone call was short and to the point.</p><p>Ainsley sat in stunned silence when the dial tone echoed in the conference room. Turton didn\u2019t say a word. He just left but he\u2019d seemed to have lost some of the cock-of-the-walk attitude.</p><p>Leslie gathered up her papers.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ainsley said. \u201cI expected I\u2019d be packing up my office and turning in my pass key today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I didn\u2019t do this for you, Ainsley. You and Turton were both in the wrong, professionally, and I didn\u2019t want to get caught in the middle. I need this job and I\u2019ve seen it happen before, where the lower level employee gets fired for a mistake the boss made.\u201d</p><p>She knew Leslie had worked for Steve Talbot at Settler\u2019s First for a few years before getting laid off.</p><p>\u201cOn a personal level, I hated Turton\u2019s double standard. He expected you to get fired for a personal relationship crossing the line, when he was doing the same thing.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThe bizarre part of it was Turton wasn\u2019t drawing those parallels.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley knew trying to find common ground with Turton would be nearly impossible now.</p><p>Leslie paused at the door and looked over her shoulder. \u201cJust so you know. Ben McKay came by yesterday to see me and formally dropped his loan request.\u201d</p><p>Her heart jumped into her throat. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The door shut behind her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move for the longest time. Mostly because she wasn\u2019t sure what her next move should be.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>As soon as Ben finished chores on Friday he drove to the Rawhide Club. After Ainsley\u2019s stinging dismissal, he\u2019d needed to be in a place where people looked at him with respect. Where he was liked for being exactly who he was.</p><p>But his haven didn\u2019t offer him the usual validation. And that confused the hell out of him. So he\u2019d found a spot in the back corner and brooded. About Ainsley. About her refusal to listen to reason and his attempt to fix his mistake. For the first time since they\u2019d started a relationship, she\u2019d looked at him with pity. Like he was a freak.</p><p>When Cody straddled the chair around across from him, Ben bit back a leave-me-the-fuck alone snarl. Cody would snap right back, demanding to know why Ben came to the club if he\u2019d wanted solitude. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re doing some deep thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. It\u2019s very taxing on my pea-sized brain.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBullshit. Spill the details, man. Especially since you ain\u2019t been here in a month again. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Cody, I don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see I had reason to be worried about you. Come on, Ben. It\u2019s me. We\u2019ve talked about everything over the years. And I mean everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he said softly. In some ways, Ben was closer to the guys at the Rawhide Club than he was with his brothers.</p><p>\u201cThen talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that friend of Layla\u2019s?\u201d Cody nodded. \u201cWe ran into each other in Sundance after that weekend at the club. She\u2019s just moved there, so we\u2019ve been playin\u2019 at my house, on a trial basis because she\u2019s not convinced she\u2019s cut out for a Dom/sub relationship. It\u2019s ended up complicated. Even more than I\u2019m letting on because I have feelings for her. Like hardcore I-think-I\u2019m-in-fucking-love-with-her feelings.\u201d</p><p>Cody whistled. \u201cDid you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ben knocked back a swallow of beer. \u201cBecause I know she doesn\u2019t feel the same way. I was an experiment. A failed one; she wanted me because I was a Dom, and now she doesn\u2019t want me because I\u2019m a Dom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe came to terms with who we are a long time ago, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had. Now I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Cody clapped him on the back. \u201cI\u2019m gonna give you the same advice you gave me when Kristin gave me back my collar, get over it, get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Ben snorted. \u201cAnd that\u2019s worked for you...how? You\u2019re still fucking in love with Kristin. You\u2019re still waiting for her to walk back through that door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hell will freeze over before that happens, so don\u2019t be a dumb fucker like me. There are plenty of woman who wanna get with Bennett. Line up another sub. That\u2019ll take the sting out of it.\u201d</p><p>But I don\u2019t want another sub. I want Ainsley.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that look. Listen to me. Don\u2019t be a pathetic motherfucker. Move on. Because we both know once a sub\u2019s made her mind up she\u2019s not really a sub, or she\u2019s got an excuse not to be with you as you really are, there\u2019s no going back.\u201d Cody squeezed his shoulder and left him to consider his advice.</p><p>What sucked? Cody was exactly right. Which was why Ben hadn\u2019t wanted to talk to him in the first place.</p><p>Sometime later Mary Jane and Cliff braved the gloomy cloud surrounding Ben and took seats at his table. The couple had been married thirty years and recently committed to a dominant and submissive relationship.</p><p>Mary Jane liked a bite of pain. Cliff, a novice with brute strength, had gotten comfortable with a flogger and a cane, but shied away from the single tail whip. So Ben helped them out, using the whip on Mary Jane while Cliff watched. When Mary Jane reached her happy place, Ben left the scene. No hard-on, no hard feelings.</p><p>\u201cBennett. Haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a few. How are things with you?\u201d He addressed his comments to Cliff, since they followed traditional protocol in the club and Mary Jane kept her eyes averted.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Is everything all right?\u201d Cliff asked.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few things on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything we can help with?\u201d</p><p>Ben looked from Cliff to Mary Jane. Maybe it was fated they ended up at his table tonight, given the last couple days. He knew Mary Jane had a high-powered job as an oil company executive, so maybe she could shed light on what\u2019d happened with Ainsley. \u201cWould you allow me to speak freely to your sub, Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Jane? You have permission to speak to Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sir.\u201d Mary Jane raised her eyes to Ben\u2019s. \u201cWhat may I help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might sound like a strange question, but would your job be affected if anyone you worked with discovered you were a sexual submissive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my job right now? Probably not.\u201d</p><p>See? Ainsley was just making up excuses not to be with you.</p><p>\u201cBut bear in mind I\u2019m five years from retirement. If I was a young woman just starting out? Especially in a male-dominated industry? That would be the kiss of death for my career.\u201d</p><p>Ben froze.</p><p>\u201cAlso remember I\u2019m a sexual submissive to my husband of three decades. I\u2019m not a single woman being passed from Dom to Dom in this sex club. That\u2019s also an entirely different situation.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s hopes that the obstacles he and Ainsley faced would somehow magically work out, given time and distance, began to fade.</p><p>Mary Jane tapped her fingernails on the table. \u201cThe reason Cliff and I insist on almost total privacy here is because of my professional position. I wouldn\u2019t be keen on anyone finding out I liked to be whipped by a stranger. And I\u2019m sure your outside friends don\u2019t know that you get...something from whipping the crap out of women you have no sexual interest in.\u201d</p><p>Ben frowned.</p><p>\u201cNo offense, Bennett, but I don\u2019t want to get to know you. Emotional ties change things. I\u2019m fine with Cliff spanking or flogging me. But there\u2019s something sadistic about telling the man I love to whip me until I almost pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s different when I wield the whip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because when you\u2019re landing strikes on my body I bear them for him. To show him I can take it. I share the joy and pain with Cliff, not with you. To put it in the simplest terms, you\u2019re the bad guy beating me and Cliff is the good guy who will take care of me when it\u2019s all done.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. Was that really how she saw him? As the bad guy?</p><p>\u201cMary Jane. Apologize to Bennett for insulting him,\u201d Cliff demanded.</p><p>He said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Cliff,\u201d even when it wasn\u2019t. Fuck. He felt he\u2019d just been kicked in the teeth and kneed in the nads.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Bennett. Your blows sting like hell. I\u2019ve been tempted to run, especially in the beginning. Me getting whipped does nothing for Cliff, but he understands it does something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you miss it if you didn\u2019t have it?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Would you miss it if you didn\u2019t do it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t missed it in the month he\u2019d been involved with Ainsley.</p><p>Cliff said, \u201cWe hoped to utilize your whip skills tonight. But given what you\u2019re wrestling with, we\u2019d understand if you opt not to.\u201d</p><p>In his frame of mind, he\u2019d take validation where he could get it. \u201cWhich room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven. In about thirty minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Sending out bad vibes kept subs at bay as Ben attempted to get his head in the game. Holding his whip, he bypassed a public scene where the woman getting flogged looked totally bored.</p><p>Ah hell. Was that...Zoe?</p><p>He ducked from view and hustled down the hallway. He peeked in the window to see if they were ready for him and stepped inside.</p><p>Mary Jane was blindfolded, naked and secured facedown to the bed.</p><p>Cliff gave Ben the instructions in low tones. The scene went better for Mary Jane if she didn\u2019t know where the blows would strike or how many.</p><p>Ben walked the perimeter of the bed. That too, heightened her senses. The fall of his boots on the carpet. The jostling of the bed as he bumped into it. And then that first whip crack. Rarely did he land the first blow. He loved the sound it made, the leather whistling through the air before the end connected with solid mass and a sharp crack.</p><p>That\u2019s when he found his headspace. The intense focus needed to keep his aim true and please both Cliff and Mary Jane.</p><p>But what had he gotten from the scene?</p><p>Ben\u2019s shirt was sweat-soaked and he floated on the buzz of adrenaline when Cliff said, \u201cRed. She\u2019s done in, Bennett. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and slipped from the room, the edgy feeling still riding him hard. As he skirted the crowd, he couldn\u2019t believe Zoe\u2019s scene was still playing out. Their eyes met.</p><p>Hers held a look of frustration. She said, \u201cPlease. Bennett. Show him. Help me.\u201d</p><p>The weight of onlookers\u2019 stares didn\u2019t faze him. He crossed his arms over his chest and let the whip dangle. \u201cSay your safe word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just help me.\u201d She didn\u2019t even flinch when her Dom landed two hard swats on the backs of her legs.</p><p>\u201cRules are rules. Say your safe word and I\u2019ll step in.\u201d</p><p>Zoe screamed, \u201cRed! Red! Goddammit!\u201d</p><p>The guy halted mid-swat. The same frustration burned in his eyes as in Zoe\u2019s when Ben stepped from the edge of the crowd. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of this scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Who the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Brian, I hafta ask. Have you played in public with her before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a pain with sex scene or just pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPain with sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have history with Zoe, and I might be able to help you both out. I\u2019ll give her the pain if you\u2019ll handle the sex and aftercare.\u201d</p><p>Brian actually looked relieved. \u201cSounds fair.\u201d</p><p>Ben kept his gaze on Brian\u2019s as he spoke to the sub. \u201cZoe, I\u2019ve already warmed up with the single tail. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Sir. Please, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d he murmured to Brian.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-three,\u201d Brian whispered back. \u201cYou choose the spots. If she stops counting then you stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Ben walked forward and slowly ran the whip handle down Zoe\u2019s spine and the crack of her ass. Her whole body jerked, the chains rattled and she strained to look over her shoulder at him.</p><p>When he moved, her head tried to follow his movement.</p><p>\u201cYou oughten be watchin\u2019 me, Zoe. You oughta be focused on how you\u2019re gonna breathe through the first blow. \u2019Cause I guarantee it\u2019s gonna hurt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The crowd murmured behind them.</p><p>\u201cBlindfold her.\u201d</p><p>Zoe gasped and turned to glare at Ben. \u201cWhat? No, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben grabbed her jaw, tilting her face up. \u201cI most certainly can, because you\u2019re the one trussed up in chains, not me. And if you don\u2019t show me respect, since this is now my scene? When I\u2019ve deemed that you are done with the pain portion? I won\u2019t let Brian touch you. At all. All you\u2019ll feel is pain. Nothin\u2019 else. So choose.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her eyes. \u201cI apologize for my behavior, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Brian tied on the blindfold.</p><p>At the first whip crack, the crowd moved back.</p><p>\u201cBrian. Distract her.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Brian\u2019s lips touched hers, Zoe relaxed. She arched into him, making soft noises as he broke the kiss.</p><p>\u201cCount. Starting from one.\u201d Ben placed the first blow on the fleshy part of Zoe\u2019s right shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOne. Thank you, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Ben kept moving, walking closer, letting Brian offer soothing words and caresses as he marked her skin with random stinging blows. He concentrated the hits on her buttocks and the backs of her thighs, remembering those as her hot spots. But he felt no stirring of arousal. No need to caress her skin or take her to the next level. He felt...tired. Maybe a little used. More than ready to be done with this night.</p><p>At Zoe\u2019s full body slump, he let his whip fall to the side. Brian moved in and gave his sub what she needed.</p><p>The crowd parted for him, but all eyes returned to the action at the front.</p><p>Ben wanted a shot of whiskey and the comfort of his own bed. He cut down the hallway when a hand landed on his shoulder, jerking him to a stop. He whirled around and his cousin Dalton was in his face, wearing a look of disgust.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that I just saw, Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton?\u201d Ben glanced at the crowd to see if a monitor was close by. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dropped your name at the door. They let me in with a guest pass.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d asked for that pass for Ainsley. The fact she\u2019d never use it made him lash out. \u201cGo away. I ain\u2019t in the mood to deal with you right now.\u201d Ben sidestepped him.</p><p>But Dalton anticipated the move. \u201cWhat are you in the mood for? Beating on another helpless woman? With a fucking bullwhip, for Christsake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your goddamn voice down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I will. I want some fuckin\u2019 answers on why you get off whipping women as they cry out for you to stop hitting them! I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I saw you with that older couple. I looked in the window and watched you beat her. And then I saw you immediately jump at the chance to beat another chick. Jesus. What did either of those women do to you?\u201d</p> <p>Dalton was more muscle bound, but Ben had more experience dealing with hotheads, so he grabbed his cousin by his shirt and shoved him into room three.</p><p>Ben would\u2019ve welcomed Dalton taking a swing at him. But Dalton paced. Muttered to himself. Ben had wondered how he\u2019d handle it if this day came. How he\u2019d explain. If he even wanted to try.</p><p>Then Dalton invaded his space. \u201cHow long have you been comin\u2019 to this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI helped start this club six years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how many women have you tortured and raped during that time?\u201d</p><p>Ben shoved Dalton and held the whip handle against his throat. \u201cBack the fuck off, Dalton. You don\u2019t have the first fuckin\u2019 clue what you\u2019re talking about. You\u2019re just flapping your gums, spouting bullshit and proving your ignorance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? If what I was doing was so unwanted or wrong, then why the hell didn\u2019t the woman\u2019s husband stop me? Then why didn\u2019t any one of the fifty other members watching the last scene step in and stop me? Not because they were scared I\u2019d turn the whip on them. They didn\u2019t stop it because they understood what I was doin\u2019. You don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re goddamned right I don\u2019t,\u201d Dalton retorted. \u201cWhat kind of man does this? And do you know the really sick part? You didn\u2019t get off doin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019d understand it more if I would\u2019ve fucked those women afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Maybe. Fuck, I don\u2019t know. This makes no sense to me.\u201d Dalton paced to the back of the room and jammed a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Why?\u201d</p><p>Ben dropped into the chair. \u201cYou think I can explain it enough to satisfy you? I recognize that look in your eyes, Dalton and that is the reason I don\u2019t broadcast this. Here at the club I find women who are looking for the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 to get their asses whaled on?\u201d Dalton sneered.</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me this private club is a real freak parade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is no more a freak parade than the Golden Boot, where you troll for pussy every weekend.\u201d</p><p>Dalton took a belligerent stance, arms crossed over his chest, feet braced wide. \u201cWrong. This ain\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never tied a woman up during sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Sure. Who hasn\u2019t?\u201d Dalton shifted his stance, then his eyes. \u201cSo I oughta be afraid the next step will be shackling a woman in chains and beating on her in front of a room full of strangers?\u201d</p><p>He sank into the closest chair. \u201cThis is pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your family know?\u201d</p><p>Ben shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThey should. Maybe they can get you some help, cuz, \u2019cause this is seriously fucked up.\u201d</p><p>He thought he\u2019d conquered the fear of being outed to his family. But the idea of his brothers and parents staring at him, with Dalton\u2019s same judgmental eyes, made him physically ill. His voice came out a hoarse whisper. \u201cYou gonna take it upon yourself to tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But you can\u2019t deny the reason you haven\u2019t told them is because you know it\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Now he had to worry that Dalton would blab to the entire McKay family.</p><p>\u201cLook at yourself, Ben. Sitting there holding a whip, a whip that you used on not one, but two women tonight. And you\u2019re tellin\u2019 me I\u2019m the one with the problem.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019d be funny if it wasn\u2019t so sad.\u201d Dalton stormed out.</p><p>There was the game-ending blow. It\u2019d been ages since he\u2019d felt such a wash of shame. Since he\u2019d felt like an outcast. And then he topped off those failings with the fear that no decent woman\u2014like Ainsley\u2014would ever love him because of his tendencies. Hidden fears that smacked him in the face today from his cousin\u2019s accusations.</p><p>Ben remained in the room a long time, emotions warring. He fingered the beautifully made whip. Device of torture? Instrument of pleasure? His supposed expertise gnawed at him. He\u2019d honed his skills on cattle. What would his family say if they knew he regularly used it on people? On women? Would they be ashamed? Should he be ashamed?</p><p>So Dalton hadn\u2019t been totally off base.</p><p>Ben felt raw. Used. Confused. Lonely. As much as he\u2019d broadened Ainsley\u2019s horizon, she\u2019d broadened his too. He glanced around the room. He felt nothing. No pride, or excitement or anger. No anticipation for what might be in store for him for future nights with future subs. He just wanted to go home.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Ainsley dreamt of Bennett every night. Images so vivid she couldn\u2019t tell the difference between fantasy and reality until she woke up alone.</p><p>After last night\u2019s dream she\u2019d leapt out of bed and stared out the hotel window across the freeway to the Denver skyline. She\u2019d hoped she wouldn\u2019t dream of him here, as she had the last two nights in her bed in Sundance.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>Which begged the question: were her regrets about her decision haunting her?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t anything she could do about it. She was miserable. Trying to stave off the dreams that left her feeling bereft, she drank four strong gin and tonics at the hotel bar before she stumbled back to her room.</p><p>But not even booze kept him from overtaking her thoughts.</p><p>A rough-skinned hand brushed her forehead and she shot straight up in bed. She couldn\u2019t see anything it was so dark. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>The echo of heavy breathing was the only response.</p><p>She scrambled backward, even when she recognized the warm, earthy scent of her dominant\u2019s aftershave. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>A deep, male chuckle. \u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>That initial spike of fear faded. She shouldn\u2019t be surprised he\u2019d taken it upon himself to make her bedroom stranger sexual fantasy a reality.</p><p>Or was this a dream? It was so vivid, the sound of his feet shuffling on the carpet. The scent of his skin so close she could taste his sweat on her tongue. The way her body was wound tight with anticipation whenever he was near.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 you. I know what you do when you\u2019re alone in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve watched you jerk up your nightgown and reach for your vibrator? You grab a couple of your favorite naughty books. You\u2019ve used them so many times the pages fall open to your favorite scenes. I know which scenes get you hot,\u201d he said, much closer to her than he\u2019d been. \u201cWhich scenes make you turn that vibrator on high. Which scenes made your pussy dripping wet.</p><p>\u201cYou imagine yourself trussed up. Subject to a man\u2019s whim, maybe his to mercy, but always to his pleasure. However he wants to fuck you, in as many positions as his greedy, depraved brain can create, as many times as he can get it up.\u201d His hot breath stuttered across her ear. \u201cBut here\u2019s where your fantasy is mine. Here\u2019s where the dream becomes real. Because this man, this dream lover, wants to prove he can be the man to give you what no man ever has before.\u201d</p><p>She blurted, \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake you scream.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ainsley shrieked when his strong hands gripped her ankles and she was flipped onto her belly. Her arms were jerked together behind her back and cool metal circled her wrists.</p><p>Then his mouth was by her temple. \u201cBe still. Be quiet or I\u2019ll gag you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>Heart racing, she scooted back, focusing on the feel of her cotton sheets against the side of her face as her shoulders were pressed into the mattress. Metal grinding on metal sounded above her head. Then her arms were lifted off the small of her back. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ensure you cooperate. If you fight me I\u2019ll pull this chain and it lifts your arms until I get your attention.\u201d Her Dom\u2019s familiar touch floated down her arms, and his breath drifted across her nape. His callused fingertips traced her knuckles and fingers as he tested the tightness of the cuffs. His touch was efficient, but tender. Insistent, but elusive.</p><p>He was a study in contradiction tonight.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he let her see his face?</p> <p>He stroked and teased. When a thick finger smeared cold lubricant into her asshole, her heartbeat sped up. She sucked in a sharp breath when an anal plug breached the ring of muscle. She involuntarily clenched around it.</p><p>His hands caressed her ass. Then he delivered a hard smack on each cheek, growling, \u201cMine. Every part of you is mine tonight. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fuck any part of this body I want to.\u201d The coarse hair of his calves brushed the inside of hers as he moved in behind her. He draped his warm body across her back, his weight pushing her chest deeper into the mattress. Panic filled her. She was trapped. She thrashed. A simple gentle touch on her neck stopped her frantic movements.</p><p>\u201cStop. Remember you\u2019re safe with me. You\u2019re always safe with me, Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head but she couldn\u2019t see him.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t that what you wanted in your fantasy?</p><p>No. I want to see him. I want to know it\u2019s him.</p><p>Then his big, capable hands squeezed her breasts. His fingers twirled, tugged and tweaked her nipples. Between the squeezing, the pinching and her complete immobilization, her breath was coming in short bursts of air that left her light headed. She started to drift into her floaty headspace.</p><p>His hand floated down her belly and his fingers traced her clit. \u201cI wanna get you off like you do when you\u2019re alone in your bed.\u201d He stroked, working one, then two fingers inside her. Plunging deep, knowing exactly how much pressure to exert to keep her whimpering for more. To make her pussy moisten and swell for him.</p><p>Just as she could almost taste that sweet climax, he withdrew. She groaned, turning her head to wipe the sweat gathered on her brow. To try and see him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The bed wiggled. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d rather get off with a vibrator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hand is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d A loud mechanical buzz sounded next to her ear. \u201cBecause I found this on your nightstand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to use it. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a liar.\u201d He nibbled on the back of her neck, sending a shudder through her. \u201cI think you planned to give yourself a little treat before you fell asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how this works.\u201d He\u2019d lubed up her rabbit vibrator; the cool silicone easily slipped inside her. He turned on all the moving parts at once\u2014a total blitz on her senses. She\u2019d already teetered on that elusive point and this would kick her right over the edge.</p><p>When he started pinching the tender skin on the inside of her thighs, she tried to close her legs against the intense pleasure.</p><p>He hissed, \u201cDon\u2019t deny yourself this. Don\u2019t lie to yourself that you don\u2019t like what I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>Why did that feel so good? Was she a masochist for craving more of that pain?</p><p>Light pinches on her thicker folds of skin gave way to smaller, faster pinches. As she spiraled closer to orgasm a line of liquid heat shot from those pinpoints.</p><p>\u201cOh. Please.\u201d</p><p>He flipped the vibrator on high, holding it in place. The phallus spun inside her, hitting her G-spot every third rotation. The plastic cage around her clit stopped vibrating at random intervals and stayed steady. That tingling, buzzing sensation tormented every nerve ending in her body. Her sex, her nipples, even her skin throbbed. She forgot how to breathe, how to think, she could only focus on that desperate need.</p><p>\u201cLemme hear you come.\u201d One last hard pinch on her inner thigh and Ainsley unraveled. Her pussy muscles clamped down around the vibrator, increasing the intensity of the pressure against her clit. A long wail poured from her mouth.</p><p>She fell flat on the mattress, after he withdrew the vibrator, her body trembling violently. She closed her eyes, vaguely aware of the gentle tugging of the plug from her ass. She wanted to beg him not to leave, but her tongue and lips weren\u2019t responding.</p><p>Chains rattled and she was rolled to her back. She couldn\u2019t make her eyes open. Her arms were useless. A determined pair of hands pushed her thighs apart. Hot kisses seared her belly. A warm mouth followed the edge of her ribcage and outlined the lower swell of her breasts. Soft suckling and delicate licks on her nipples brought about her contented sigh.</p><p>His mouth snared hers in a kiss as he eased his cock inside her, filling her with one smooth stroke. Realizing just how boneless she was, he brought her legs around his waist.</p><p>When his cock nudged her cervix, her lower half bowed off the mattress.</p><p>His lips clung to hers with sweet, sweet kisses. \u201cI need to feel you wrapped around me like this. Let me have you. Let me have you like this forever.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley managed a soft, \u201cYes,\u201d and arched her neck for him in a show of full submission.</p><p>Then his weight disappeared from her body. His scent vanished. She opened her eyes and found herself alone. \u201cBennett? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>His voice came out of nowhere, but it was everywhere. \u201cGone.\u201d A ghostly breeze drifted across her face. \u201cToo late. I\u2019m already gone.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley woke up sobbing, \u201cNo,\u201d over and over with an acute sense of loss.</p><p>She threw back the covers and patted the mattress as if she\u2019d find Ben there.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>And that\u2019s always when she woke up.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Late Sunday afternoon, Ben had just racked up the balls to shoot another game of pool\u2014by himself, how pathetic\u2014when his dogs started barking. By the time he reached the door to check out the ruckus, he was looking through the door into his brother\u2019s faces. Quinn, and Chase, with Gavin behind them. And off to the left, Dalton.</p><p>He had a bad feeling about this. He quieted the dogs. \u201cDid someone die?\u201d</p><p>Quinn shook his head and came inside.</p><p>Ben asked, \u201cDid I forget I was throwing a party?\u201d</p><p>Chase shook his head and came inside.</p><p>\u201cIs this about the sale of the Wetzler place?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Gavin shook his head and came inside.</p><p>But Ben blocked Dalton from coming in. \u201cDid you do this?\u201d</p><p>Dalton gave him a somber look. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else did you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust them.\u201d Dalton shouldered past and Ben let him.</p><p>No words were exchanged as outerwear was discarded. Everyone wandered to the TV area instead of the bar.</p><p>Ben\u2019s heart thundered in his temples. He felt his cheeks burning as he joined them, sitting in the chair furthest away from his family.</p><p>\u201cSo, Dalton, you gonna tell us why we\u2019re here? And why you think Ben needs an intervention?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>Dalton wiped his hands on his jeans. When he realized the action hinted at nerves, he folded his arms across his chest. \u201cBen\u2019s never been one to talk about the women in his life. He\u2019s always says that a gentleman never kisses and tells, which never rang true for me, because all guys brag on the chicks they\u2019re banging. Then I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I saw Ben out at the bar or heard about him on a date with a woman. I thought it was weird he drove to his buddy\u2019s bar in Gillette. That made me wonder if Ben was gay and hidin\u2019 it.</p><p>\u201cThat also made me wonder if the bar in Gillette was a gay hangout, especially since not one person in our family has ever been there. After the bullshit with us not getting the Wetzler place, and the rumors I\u2019d heard from Jenny that Ben was involved with the president of the new bank, well, I suspected if he was gay he\u2019d slept with her just to get a loan.\u201d</p><p>Dalton had a high opinion of him.</p><p>\u201cI call bullshit on that, Dalton,\u201d Chase snapped. \u201cBen ain\u2019t the type of guy to use women and discard them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just shows how much you don\u2019t know about him. See, I went to the Rawhide Bar Friday night. Dropped Ben\u2019s name and I was escorted to a different door. A private club. A sex club. But the thing I saw that knocked me to my knees? My cousin using a whip on not one, but two different women. Women who were tied up so they couldn\u2019t get away. These woman begged him to stop and he didn\u2019t. He just kept hurting them.\u201d</p><p>Ben studied his hands in the silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you guys. Ben\u2019s out of control. He\u2019s got a problem with violence against women. I know a violent streak runs in the McKay family. Brandt struggles with it. Kane and Colt deal with it by beatin\u2019 the shit out of each other. I figured Quinn had it in your family. Makes me sick to think Ben\u2019s had it all this time and we didn\u2019t notice. Add in the kinky sex stuff I saw? And it\u2019s all kinds of wrong. We need to intervene and get him away from that kinda behavior. We need to help him.\u201d Dalton finally looked at Ben pleadingly. \u201cIf my dad, who\u2019s been a binge drinker his whole life, can admit at his age that he\u2019s got a problem, I know we can find a way to help you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d be touched by Dalton\u2019s concern if he wasn\u2019t so fucking mad. If he wasn\u2019t so fucking mortified he\u2019d have to look his brothers in the eye and admit, yes, part of what Dalton said was true.</p><p>Ben expected silence as his brothers tried to process Dalton\u2019 accusations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Quinn started to laugh. His older brother, who defined restrained, laughed so hysterically tears rolled down his face. He laughed so hard he doubled over on the couch. He\u2019d look up at Dalton, then at Ben, and cackle, giggle and wheeze with laughter.</p><p>Not the reaction Ben had predicted.</p><p>Finally, Quinn calmed down. He wiped his eyes. He addressed Dalton, who\u2019d taken a seat during Quinn\u2019s laughing fit. \u201cI understand your concern, okay? I don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve reacted seein\u2019 Ben in that situation. But you\u2019ve taken it totally out of context.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you ever been to a bar or a club in a big city like what you seen in Gillette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t matter. This ain\u2019t about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laying all Ben\u2019s secrets bare. I\u2019m expecting the same thing from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Whatever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lied about how many women you\u2019ve fucked, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dalton squirmed. \u201cHuh-uh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dalton. Admit bein\u2019 a McKay sometimes makes you feel you\u2019ve gotta live up to that man-whore reputation,\u201d Quinn cajoled. \u201cYou ain\u2019t the stud you pretend to be are you?\u201d</p><p>Took a solid minute, but Dalton blushed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful damn na\u00efve,\u201d Chase answered. \u201cI wish you\u2019da told us your suspicions besides the vague Ben needs help and he\u2019s too proud to admit he has a problem line that got us to haul ass to Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ben inserted. \u201cDalton didn\u2019t tell you guys anything?\u201d</p><p>Gavin said, \u201cNo. Just that it was urgent and Ben\u2019s brothers needed to intervene.\u201d</p><p>Ben wasn\u2019t sure which shocked him more; that they\u2019d all come, including Gavin, or that they hadn\u2019t questioned why they should come.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys takin\u2019 this seriously?\u201d Dalton demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s some heavy shit.\u201d</p><p>Quinn lifted a brow at Ben. \u201cI\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve preferred to keep this quiet as you have for years, but given the circumstances, you wanna explain? In plain terms so Mr. Na\u00efve over there gets a decent grasp on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what\u2019s called a sexual dominant. That means in sex play, I\u2019m in charge. But in order to be dominant I need a submissive. A submissive chooses to give herself, her body, her will, to the Dom. A Dom does not take what isn\u2019t offered. There isn\u2019t rape. There isn\u2019t torture. At least not in my scenes. I don\u2019t expect my subs to be lifestyle subs twenty-four/seven. I\u2019m a Dom strictly in sexual situations.\u201d He gave Dalton a pointed look. \u201cWith women.\u201d</p><p>Dalton had the grace to be flustered.</p> <p>\u201cOn the surface, the Dom/sub relationship is about sex. And I ain\u2019t gonna lie, the sex is what drew me to it. It still does. That exchange of power is heady stuff. But when I\u2019m in my dominant role, I\u2019m completely attuned to my sub. To her needs, her fears, her pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been a dominant?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>\u201cOfficially? About eight years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the whippings?\u201d Dalton blurted out. \u201cThat ain\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not for you to judge.\u201d Ben looked at his brothers. \u201cWhat bothered Dalton was I wasn\u2019t sexually involved with those submissives. Because it\u2019s not always about sex. I used the single tail whip on the sub at the request of the sub\u2019s Dom. That Dom decides when I stop.\u201d</p><p>Chase asked, \u201cDo you do that a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhip another Dom\u2019s sub? Only because they know I\u2019m awful damn good with a whip. The new Doms learn from me. Some Doms don\u2019t like usin\u2019 the single tail but their sub really gets off on it. So I fill a need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you like beatin\u2019 on women,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>Snapping at his clueless cousin would serve no purpose. \u201cOnly if they ask me real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t funny.\u201d</p><p>Gavin laughed. \u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m getting quite the education. I\u2019m impressed, Ben. Shocked, but relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I sort of suspected,\u201d Chase said, \u201cwhen I noticed instruments of the trade Ben accidentally left on his bar last summer. And the missus says sometimes when she looks into Ben\u2019s eyes, she has the urge to do whatever he tells her.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cAva said that? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Now I\u2019m wonderin\u2019 if you can teach me that trick.\u201d Chase smiled slyly. \u201cBecause, bro, the \u2018be a man\u2019 advice really worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave you the \u2018be a man\u2019 advice? Hell, when me\u2019n Libby were havin\u2019 problems he told me I needed to romance her. Be a different man than I\u2019d been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cBest thing I ever did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe when I\u2019m not so pissed that I took my marriage vows seriously and my ex-wife did not, and I\u2019m ready to dip a toe into the dating pool, I\u2019ll come to you for advice, Ben.\u201d</p><p>That acceptance, coupled with the fact Gavin had flown up here out of concern, was sort of an olive branch. \u201cSure. Will I be giving the advice over the phone? Or in person over at the B&amp;B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly time will answer that question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d Dalton asked Quinn, Chase and Gavin. \u201cI\u2019m the village idiot because I didn\u2019t know this was...what did you call it? A lifestyle? A real lifestyle out of the movies and shit. You guys are on board with Ben\u2019s whole tie \u2019em up, whip \u2019em and fuck \u2019em attitude toward women?\u201d</p><p>Ben ran his hands through his hair. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Dalton? I don\u2019t talk about this part of my life. I don\u2019t need your acceptance or your approval. I just need your promise this won\u2019t go any farther than you. I don\u2019t want members of the McKay family lookin\u2019 at me like I\u2019m an abuser. Or wondering if the woman I\u2019m with has no self-esteem because she is submissive to me in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I ain\u2019t gonna tell anyone, because Christ, who\u2019d believe me?\u201d Dalton stood, confusion warring on his face, looking like a twelve-year-old boy who\u2019d just watched his first porn flick.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cAre you pissed that I told them?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m more pissed about the shitty things you said to me regarding the land deal. \u201cI\u2019ll get over it. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s...good, I guess. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d Dalton practically ran out.</p><p>Ben sort of felt sorry for him. Sort of.</p><p>Quinn stepped behind the bar. Ben sat on the barstool between Gavin and Chase. Which was strange because Ben usually kept the bar as a buffer between himself and those he served.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s an indication of how you view the world.</p><p>\u201cDrinks all around, boys,\u201d Quinn said lining up four shot glasses and filling them with Scotch. He raised his glass. Paused. \u201cWhat the hell are we drinking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Dalton bein\u2019 a dumbass,\u201d Chase drawled.</p><p>They laughed and clinked their glasses together.</p><p>Gavin motioned for Quinn to set \u2019em up again. \u201cAs much as you won\u2019t apologize for the lifestyle you lead behind closed doors, I won\u2019t apologize for buying Rielle\u2019s place. So if you want to berate me, go ahead. But I don\u2019t want it to be a point of contention between us forever, Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no interest in beatin\u2019 that horse anymore. It\u2019s dead. And buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you all showed up.\u201d Ben looked at Chase and Gavin. \u201cDo Mom and Dad know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. We didn\u2019t wanna worry them. Now that we know you ain\u2019t some psycho killer, we\u2019ll probably just take off without telling them. It\u2019ll stay between us.\u201d</p><p>Ben fiddled with his full shot glass. \u201cAh, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit it\u2019s a slippery concept to grasp, pain as foreplay. But as long as I don\u2019t gotta watch you in action? It ain\u2019t none of my business,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cIn all seriousness. The reason I laughed so fucking hard when Dalton said you were outta control? Because I know you, Ben. I work with you every goddamn day. You have more control, more cool-headedness and more compassion, in any situation, than anyone I know.\u201d</p><p>Ben had no idea what to say to that.</p><p>They bullshitted about nothing. But it didn\u2019t seem forced. Or like they were all trying to avoid the elephant in the room.</p><p>Quinn and Chase took off, cracking jokes about examining Ben\u2019s collection of chains, whips and sex toys. Ben would\u2019ve been worried if they hadn\u2019t given him a rash of shit about being a pervert.</p><p>But Gavin wasn\u2019t in a hurry to leave.</p><p>\u201cSo was Sierra covered in body piercings when you picked her up a few weeks back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Luckily for her mother. She\u2019s a piece of work. It\u2019s no wonder I steer clear of anything resembling a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife has ruined you for all other women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, she\u2019d have a field day thinking she still had that much power over me.\u201d Gavin sighed. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the...hell if I know. Desire? Patience? Time? Balls? My excuses change every week. It isn\u2019t so much Ellen\u2019s fault anymore as it is I find reasons not to meet women, let alone get mixed up with one.\u201d He sipped the Scotch. \u201cWhat about you? Still involved with that new banker?\u201d</p><p>Ben shot him a sideways glance. \u201cBein\u2019 involved with Ainsley wasn\u2019t common knowledge, so where\u2019d you hear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle said her car was here a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you came clean to her about your club life as a dominant?\u201d</p><p>How did he phrase this and keep Ainsley\u2019s experimentation as a sub a secret? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gavin whistled. \u201cShe\u2019s into the life too, isn\u2019t she? I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s your sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was my sub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p> <p>Not nearly long enough. \u201cA month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ended it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if she wouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still be with her. The ironic thing about Dalton seeing me at the club? I hadn\u2019t been there for the month I\u2019d been with Ainsley. As I walked around? I felt nothing. I just fucking missed her. Missed who I was with her.\u201d And it all poured out. \u201cSince the night I met her I felt our relationship would be different. Club subs want good times and the anything-goes sex. Bringing them out of that world and into mine wouldn\u2019t work. But Ainsley...works. She\u2019s smart and sexy. She challenges me. She gets me. She goes from bein\u2019 the bank prez, to hanging out with me, to bein\u2019 my sub, all in one night. Almost seamlessly. She\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what did you do to fuck it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the bank president. No one can know she associates with lowlife sexual degenerates like me who belong to the Rawhide Club,\u201d he said with a slightly bitter edge.</p><p>Gavin shook his head and chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. All \u2018I\u2019m the dominant, I\u2019m in charge\u2019, and yet, here you are, moping around in your house with your dogs. You\u2019re not that guy, Ben. I\u2019m that guy and trust me, it\u2019s beyond fucking pathetic. So I\u2019m going to mimic the \u2018be a man\u2019 advice you gave our brothers. If you want this woman for the long haul, make it happen. Screw the club. You haven\u2019t needed it the last month, you don\u2019t need it now. Play with her here. Or at her place. Set your own rules. Or change the rules.\u201d</p><p>Ben was as flustered by the admonishment as he was by Gavin\u2019s admission of brotherly ties. \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy.\u201d</p> <p>Or was it?</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Ben had come inside from cleaning out the cattle truck when she burst through his front door. The dogs went berserk. Barking and jumping until she threw two rawhide chews out the door and slammed it shut behind them.</p><p>Christ. His mother was mad as a wet hen. She angrily pulled off her purple gloves finger by finger. Only after she\u2019d shed the outer layer did she seem calm enough to speak. \u201cHello, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. It\u2019d be nice if you didn\u2019t banish my dogs from their home every time you come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose mutts belong outside. I\u2019ll take a cup of coffee if it\u2019s fresh.\u201d</p><p>He poured a cup, refilled his mug and faced her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell, Bennett.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee, thanks. What brings you by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis and that.\u201d</p><p>She curled her hands around the coffee mug and wandered to the kitchen window, appearing to gather her thoughts.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>Finally she looked at him. \u201cI heard something a little disturbing today.\u201d</p><p>His gut roiled. Goddamn Dalton. Hadn\u2019t he stressed the importance of keeping his big mouth shut? Was it a coincidence that one day after Dalton\u2019s accusations, Ben\u2019s mother showed up, hot under the collar? How was he supposed to look her in the eye when she questioned him about the rumor? Would she be disappointed? Would she ask where she\u2019d gone wrong raising him?</p><p>Ben managed a nonchalant, \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>She blew across her cup, expecting him to fess up like a ten-year-old boy.</p><p>Not happening.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cTell me about the woman you took out for lunch last week.\u201d</p><p>Why did she give a rip about that?</p><p>\u201cJust answer the damn question, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>He was punchy if he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d uttered that out loud. His thoughts backtracked. Last week? Right. A last minute lunch with his client from Jackson Hole who\u2019d been driving through town to give him an overdue payment. \u201cYou mean Dani? She\u2019s a friend. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d she mimicked. \u201cYou move fast, which I find disturbing.\u201d</p><p>This conversation wasn\u2019t about Dalton\u2019s intervention? His relief was short lived.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between you and Ainsley? Weren\u2019t you two an item just last week? Because I like her.\u201d</p><p>I like her too. A lot. In fact, I fell in love with her.</p><p>\u201cBennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, it\u2019s sort of complicated and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze hooked hers. \u201cMe? Why does the problem have to be from my end?\u201d</p><p>His mother rolled her eyes. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that makes me a defective man or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your tone, Mister,\u201d she warned. \u201cIt\u2019s my job as your mother to find out if you\u2019re being a jackass to the only decent woman to come into your life in years.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cWere you trying to make Ainsley jealous by having lunch with another woman? Right under her nose?\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Was his mother on crack? \u201cI\u2019m tired of everyone in this family poking their nose into my personal business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett Andrew McKay.\u201d Her cup hit the counter and liquid sloshed everywhere. \u201cMy God. Sometimes your pigheadedness is astounding.\u201d</p><p>Thoroughly reprimanded, Ben sponged up the mess with a paper towel and waited for the lecture, because guaranteed she had one prepared.</p><p>\u201cYou brought Ainsley to our attention, by inviting her to a family party. I drive by your house every day. I know she\u2019s been an overnight guest.\u201d She peered at him over the tops of her glasses. \u201cOn many occasions. I\u2019m pretty sure you two weren\u2019t playing Parcheesi.\u201d</p><p>He blushed. Goddammit. He never blushed.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a big enough person to admit my visit the weekend you were sick\u2014and don\u2019t get me started on how I had to find out that my own son was sick from Rielle\u2014was to check this woman out for myself. Because heaven knows you\u2019d never tell me if you were involved with someone. But when I asked her, she insisted there wasn\u2019t anything between you.\u201d</p><p>Why did that sting?</p><p>\u201cOf course I didn\u2019t believe her. So when Carolyn called me today because she saw you cozied up to that ex-stripper last week\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDani is not a stripper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence the term ex-stripper.\u201d She drained her coffee and lifted an eyebrow. \u201cNot going to deny it?\u201d</p><p>Ben counted to fifteen. \u201cMom. What does this have to do with anything? Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo meddle, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Dad get after you for that? I thought you promised to knock that crap off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ah ah. I promised no more meddling in Quinn and Libby\u2019s life. Chase and Ava aren\u2019t around enough for me to meddle. So that leaves you, my dear middle son, as my man in the meddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no bullshit. What happened between you and Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>Defeated, and tired of playing the denial game, he ducked his face from her probing gaze. \u201cWe were involved but she...\u201d Brought everything inside me alive. Created hope in me I hadn\u2019t felt in years. Then she validated my biggest fear: no woman I wanted would ever want me, as I am, long-term.</p><p>\u201cBennett. Look at me please.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d gotten his Dom tendencies from his mother, not his father. He glanced up and she was standing in front of him. \u201cOh, son, come here.\u201d She opened her arms and Ben walked into her embrace without hesitation. He might tower over her now, but her hugs hadn\u2019t changed from when he was a little boy. There was fierceness in her hugs. Protectiveness. Unconditional love. Funny how he\u2019d forgotten that. Ironic how she\u2019d known he\u2019d needed the reminder.</p><p>\u201cYou are a good man. If she can\u2019t see that...\u201d She eased back and fussed with his collar. \u201cThen she\u2019s a blind fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Ben expected her to leave. But she chatted away about Adam and Amelia\u2019s latest antics. His father\u2019s upcoming birthday. Chase and Ava. Quinn and Libby. Gavin and his daughter. The situation with Casper. When she talked about tattoos, Ben tuned her out. He had a shit ton to do and daylight was wasting.</p><p>\u201cAnd so I have to go...but I have a confession to make. There\u2019s another reason I stopped by today.\u201d</p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get upset if I pursue a friendship with Ainsley.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped. \u201cWhat? How can you be buddy-buddy with a woman you just called a blind fool?\u201d With the woman who rejected me?</p><p>\u201cBecause she and I have a lot in common. Besides, I\u2019ve been trying to widen my social circle. Vaudette can be such a self-righteous pain in the patootie.\u201d</p><p>Typical of his mother to carry on three conversations at once and expect him to follow each one. What the devil did her best friend Vaudette Dickens have to do with anything? Wait. Was she trying to tell him something? \u201cWhen did you talk to Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had lunch with her today.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, he just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI got the impression she\u2019s looking for people to connect with outside her job as bank president.\u201d She shrugged on her coat. \u201cSounds like she\u2019s under a lot of stress. She\u2019ll be busy in the next six months trying to bring new business into National West.\u201d</p><p>So Ainsley hadn\u2019t lost her job? A weird, wonderful kind of hope began to overtake his feeling of defeat. If Ainsley was living in Sundance, he had a chance with her. Until he remembered why he didn\u2019t have a chance with her.</p><p>His mother clucked her tongue. \u201cThe poor girl sounded so lonely.\u201d</p><p>That tore at him. \u201cHow the hell can she be lonely?\u201d Ben demanded. \u201cWhen up until last week, she was with me most nights for the past four weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me? Maybe you should trot yourself to town and ask her. Because God knows, I would never hear the end of it if I poked my nose into your personal business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unreal.</p><p>His mother threw a gaudy sequined scarf over her shoulder like a Hollywood diva. She placed her hands on Ben\u2019s cheeks and stood on tiptoe to peck him on the mouth. \u201cI love you. So here\u2019s some advice, and please don\u2019t take this the wrong way. You are a strong, independent man. A good man. A man who deserves happiness. But don\u2019t be a stubborn man. It doesn\u2019t make you weak to want to rely on someone or to want someone in your life who understands you fully. Who accepts you completely. Who gives you something you can\u2019t get from anyone else. Everything in life is about compromise. If it\u2019s worth it, you\u2019ll change to get it. Changing things about your life that don\u2019t fit who you are anymore doesn\u2019t mean you have to change who you are inside.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her with his mouth hanging open.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s scary how well I know you, isn\u2019t it, son? We\u2019re a lot alike.\u201d She laughed. \u201cAnd that absolutely horrifies you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The door slammed behind her and she yelled at his dogs before she sped off.</p><p>Smart woman, his mother. Between her advice, and Gavin\u2019s, he\u2019d finally found the answer he\u2019d been looking for.</p><p>Without changing clothes, without giving himself a chance to change his mind, he jumped in his truck and headed for Gillette.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p> <p>Late Tuesday morning Layla showed up at the bank, practically spitting fire.</p><p>As soon as Ainsley shut her office door, Layla was in her face. \u201cWhat did you do to Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Nothing.\u201d Panic surfaced. \u201cWhy? What happened to him? Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not all right. He resigned from the Rawhide Club.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched. \u201cHe did? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night.\u201d Layla poked her in the chest. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, A, but if you did something to hurt him, I swear I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold up. Why do you assume it was something I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he told me it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit and start from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Layla flopped into the chair. \u201cI just happened to be at the club last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe club was open last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The guys have a meeting every couple months to deal with schedules, new members, any problems. Ben showed up, which he almost never does. But he looked awful. He had bags under his eyes. I think he came in wearing cow-poop-covered clothes. That isn\u2019t the Bennett I know. He gave no input during the meeting. As soon as it ended, he stood and announced he was canceling his membership. He\u2019d appreciated their friendship and support over the years, but sometimes a man had to make a choice and he\u2019d made his.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley couldn\u2019t believe her ears. \u201cWhat did the other guys\u2014his friends\u2014say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could they say? They were stunned. So I followed Bennett out to his truck and asked him why he was leaving the club. He said being with you changed his life.\u201d</p> <p>Anger rose. Bennett could tell Layla that, but not her?</p><p>You have no right to the anger. You gave him no choice but to keep his feelings from you when you told him it was over.</p><p>Layla tapped on the desk to get her attention. \u201cTell me what happened between you two.\u201d</p><p>Despite her distraction, Ainsley gave Layla the rundown. She tried for detachment in the telling, but by the time she finished, the pressure and misery from the past couple of days nearly had her in tears.</p><p>\u201cSo everything with him was all just an experiment to you and you can just walk away like nothing happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She jabbed her finger at Layla. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said I should give the club a try. I did. You\u2019re the one who said I should embrace my sexuality. I did. It was supposed to be one weekend out of my life and nothing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t enough, was it?\u201d Layla said softly. \u201cI had nothing to do with you agreeing to be Bennett\u2019s sub, outside the club for a month. So don\u2019t pretend you were coerced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Layla. I\u2019m not denying it. I\u2019ve learned...I\u2019ve accepted that I prefer to be submissive when it comes to sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut after seeing how I jeopardized my job with one misstep, regarding Ben, I knew it had to end. All of it.\u201d Even when I didn\u2019t want it to.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What you do in a private club isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business but yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. What would happen if my coworkers or bosses found out I\u2019m a sexual submissive? That I do whatever Bennett demands of me, without question? That I\u2019m involved with a man who\u2019s a sexual dominant at a sex club? And please don\u2019t tell me it doesn\u2019t matter because it does. Maybe not in all lines of work, but definitely in this one and definitely in this part of the country. And Bennett keeps the Dom side of himself hidden from his family and friends too, so it\u2019s not just me who knows the risks of our preferences becoming common knowledge.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley sank back in her chair.</p><p>\u201cI get that, A, but don\u2019t you see how much Bennett cares about you? He\u2019s removing the big obstacle that prevents you two from being together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that burden from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad, you\u2019ve got it,\u201d Layla snapped, \u201cand now you have to deal with it. So tell me how you plan to?\u201d</p><p>Stung, she retorted, \u201cHow long do you think before Bennett gets bored with me and misses the sexual variety that defined his time as a Dom at the Rawhide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett has always been very committed to the club. Making it a place where everyone who\u2019s a member is comfortable because he struggled for years with accepting who he was as a Dom. So for him to walk away for good? I know he\u2019s even more committed to making this work with you.\u201d</p><p>That brought tears to her eyes again. \u201cDamn him. I didn\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want what?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t want to fall for him.</p><p>\u201cAinsley, do you love him?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cWhat if my feelings are from the sex that rocks my world? What if I\u2019ve latched onto the convenience of being with Ben because he lives here? What if I\u2019ve confused submission with love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it is love and you\u2019re making all these lame excuses because you don\u2019t believe you can fall in love in a month?\u201d Layla countered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen are you worried Bennett will expect you to become a lifestyle sub like me if you\u2019re outside the club?\u201d</p><p>She remembered exchanging harsh words about that very thing the last night they\u2019d seen each other. \u201cNo. I know that\u2019s not what he wants. But hearing that he\u2019s leaving the club\u2014\u201dmakes me hopeful that maybe we have a chance, \u201c\u2014makes me wonder if he feels pressured to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett is a force all his own. He doesn\u2019t do a damn thing he doesn\u2019t want to. He is willingly walking away from the club because he wants you, A, for the long haul. He found something more meaningful than he was getting with random hookups at the club. He found it with you.\u201d She shook her finger at Ainsley. \u201cBut don\u2019t for a second think he\u2019ll become some pussified girly man because he\u2019s no longer wielding a whip at the Rawhide. Bennett is a Dom through and through. That part of him won\u2019t change. Ever. He\u2019ll still want a sexual Dom/sub relationship with you, and not temporarily this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that part of him to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d A long sigh echoed. \u201cI know you, Ainsley. Don\u2019t talk yourself out of what could be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you because you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am scared. Aren\u2019t you the one who warned me not to fall for Bennett because he wasn\u2019t a long-term guy? You told me I\u2019d be an idiot for taking up with the first Dom I met.\u201d</p><p>Layla leveled her with an uncompromising stare. \u201cI was wrong. I can admit it. Can you?\u201d She stood. \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot. Accept him as he is. Accept yourself for what you are to him. Accept what you two can have together.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley watched Layla flounce out of her office. Her friend\u2019s words swirling around in her head.</p><p>Accept him as he is.</p><p>Accept yourself for what you are to him.</p><p>Bennett made no apologies about who he was. He\u2019d given her all of himself while helping her get in tune with a side of herself she hadn\u2019t acknowledged. He\u2019d respected her boundaries, even while pushing them at every opportunity.</p><p>And now she wanted to bring those boundaries back in because she was scared? She wanted to use what he was\u2014unapologetically sexually dominant\u2014against him because she was freaked out about what she\u2019d discovered about herself?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she just accept that she admired the sexual woman she\u2019d become because of Bennett? She liked that he challenged her. She liked handing control to him, knowing he\u2019d never abuse it. She liked how he looked at her, not only the admiring gazes he gave her body, but when he locked his eyes to hers and seemed to see into her soul. He saw the real her. He acknowledged the woman she was\u2014in and out of the bedroom\u2014not just as who she was as his submissive.</p><p>Ainsley let her head fall back and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>So what to do now?</p><p>Call Ben and share the news she hadn\u2019t gotten canned?</p><p>Confess she\u2019d fallen in love with him? Not only as Bennett the Dom, but as Ben the man? That she wanted them both?</p><p>Or would he believe her confession was only a knee-jerk reaction to her relief at not losing her job?</p><p>Or would he think she\u2019d only come to him because he\u2019d quit the Rawhide Club?</p><p>Don\u2019t think about it now. Get back to work.</p><p>But the rest of the afternoon was a total wash.</p><p>So many thoughts bounced in her brain, she pled a headache to her staff and shut off the lights in her office. Her mind kept drifting to sex, specifically the night she\u2019d shown up at Ben\u2019s house to seduce him with plain old vanilla sex. Intending to prove they didn\u2019t need foreplay in the form of ropes, cuffs, vibrators or restraints. They could get naked, roll around between the sheets, until hungry kisses and fevered touches weren\u2019t enough. Then Ben could pin her body beneath his and gaze into her eyes as he slowly slipped inside her. Loving her as fiercely and hotly as he always did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It could\u2019ve happened that way.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten off. She\u2019d gotten off. It wasn\u2019t bad sex; it just wasn\u2019t great sex.</p> <p>Afterward, she laid beside him, feeling like she used to before, during, and after sex\u2014awkward. Anxious. Self-conscious.</p><p>Then his hot body had spooned behind hers, because he\u2019d sensed her retreat and he hadn\u2019t allowed it. \u201cSo while that was fun, what the hell has gotten into you, Ainsley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came here to prove I can seduce you. We can have sex anytime we want without all the kinky accoutrements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I realized I couldn\u2019t have seduced you if you hadn\u2019t let me.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d laughed. \u201cYou accept that I\u2019m a Dom, but you\u2019re still fighting the idea you\u2019re submissive.\u201d</p><p>A statement. \u201cMaybe. When I\u2019m with you, when we\u2019re in the moment, I don\u2019t think about anything but how you make me feel or how much my surrender pleases you. But when I\u2019m by myself, or at work, those feelings of...wrongness pop up. Like there\u2019s something wrong with me for loving when you dominate me. There\u2019s something wrong with me for liking that you use cuffs, ropes and handcuffs on me. There\u2019s something wrong with me for wanting to get my butt paddled or to feel the flogger on my skin or the riding crop connecting with my flesh. I wonder why I can\u2019t be satisfied with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVanilla sex?\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cYes. Then when we have vanilla sex...it\u2019s not as satisfying and I wonder why I want to give up fantastic sex because what we do behind closed bedroom doors isn\u2019t the norm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious circle, angel.\u201d</p><p>Then he\u2019d just held her. Stroked her. Let her wrestle with her thoughts, until she\u2019d asked, \u201cDoes the level of kink increase the longer a Dom/sub are together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d He\u2019d placed a soft kiss behind her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the first woman who\u2019s tempted me to find out.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when she\u2019d squirmed away and reminded him she\u2019d only signed on for a month.</p><p>That\u2019s when he\u2019d grabbed her, pinned her, tied her up and fucked her twice, reminding her that the month wasn\u2019t up yet.</p><p>It hit her then. Ben had been telling her before the loan fiasco, before her disastrous plan to force him into just accepting her friendship, before walking away from the club...that he\u2019d wanted more with her.</p><p>And she wanted more with him. She wanted it all.</p><p>After all he\u2019d shown her, after all he\u2019d been to her, and now proving\u2014in his typical Dom way\u2014what he wanted to be to her, did she really think she could let him go?</p><p>No.</p><p>Hell no.</p> <p>She gathered her things and left the bank early.</p><p>Ben\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t in his driveway.</p><p>And where were his pesky dogs?</p><p>Maybe his truck was in the shop and he\u2019d let the dogs in his haven since it was so cold outside. She shivered as snowflakes whirled around her head and she sought shelter in his woodshop.</p><p>Although he\u2019d gotten pissy the one time she\u2019d violated his woodworking sanctuary, she hoped he\u2019d forgive her today.</p><p>But what if her making the first move wasn\u2019t enough?</p><p>Shoving aside her doubts, Ainsley marched through the door. \u201cBen? Are you in here? We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>She flipped on the lights. No sign of him. She knew he hadn\u2019t been in recently because the woodstove was cold. So Ainsley snooped. Animal skins of different colors and textures hung on the wall. Three barrels filled with a smelly solution lined the back wall and she vaguely remembered him talking about the process of tanning hides.</p><p>In the main room, various pieces of finished furniture were lined up, ready for assembly. She ran her hands into the grooves his hands had created. The man was amazingly talented. No wonder she\u2019d believed his loan request; he could easily turn his hobby into a fulltime business, despite his claims of just being a simple rancher.</p><p>Several hand-carved pieces were spread on the long workbench that looked like toppers for bedposts and chairs. A few wooden sculptures were in different phases of completion. She recognized a small bird, a thick stem of a flower. Another funky cat. She let her fingers trace the jagged edges, not bothering to hold back her tears when she saw three shelves full of finished pieces. All these beautiful works of art were just lying around, gathering dust, not out in view where they could be admired. Cherished. He\u2019d hidden this part of himself from his family too. Was there anyone who knew all sides of Bennett McKay?</p><p>You do.</p><p>That\u2019s when every doubt vanished. When Ainsley understood she\u2019d do whatever it took to have Ben in her life. To make him understand that she appreciated and celebrated everything about him. Everything he was.</p><p>When she exited the building she noticed another car had parked in the drive. Pulling her coat more securely against the Wyoming wind, she hustled toward the house. She looked up when the front door slammed.</p><p>Rielle stared back at her. \u201cAinsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d She glanced at the keys dangling from Rielle\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBein\u2019 neighborly.\u201d Rielle smirked. \u201cOh, it gets your panties in a twist that I have a key to his house and you don\u2019t, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley bit back a retort.</p><p>\u201cI see the venom in your eyes. So why don\u2019t you ask me if there\u2019s anything going on between me and Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. What the hell is going on between you and Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d Rielle paused. \u201cBecause the man is in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re surprised to hear that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both idiots,\u201d Rielle muttered. \u201cThat makes me marginally less pissed off at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you be pissed off at me? Because you\u2019ve had your eye on him?\u201d</p><p>Rielle rolled her eyes. \u201cAre you kidding me? Ben is a great guy but I\u2019ve never had any interest in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not understanding why you would be mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I knew you two were sneaking around. I recognized something was going on between you two the first day at the bank. I watched you two having lunch at Fields. Ben couldn\u2019t take his eyes off you. When he held your hand? And you shook him off when I approached? I figured you didn\u2019t want the Sundance townsfolk to know the new bank president was getting down and dirty with a local rancher. So yeah, I blamed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur reasons for keeping our relationship quiet are private. And since you don\u2019t know me, maybe I understand why you\u2019d jump to the worst conclusion first. But you are wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen is a very private guy. He rarely has female overnight guests. So the fact you were here all the damn time?\u201d Rielle shook her head, sending her baby-fine blonde hair flying against the bitterly cold wind. \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t casual. And I like Ben. He\u2019s a good guy. I don\u2019t want to see him get hurt. He deserves a woman who isn\u2019t embarrassed to be seen with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I am that woman.\u201d Ainsley didn\u2019t need to prove it to Rielle; she needed to prove it to Ben.</p><p>They measured one another.</p><p>\u201cSo where is he?\u201d</p><p>Rielle\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you know where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Ben and I had a...fight and I haven\u2019t talked to him since last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to kiss and make up?\u201d</p><p>Snoopy thing, aren\u2019t you Mrs. Kravitz?</p><p>Rielle laughed. \u201cMrs. Kravitz? Did you really just compare me to the nosy, annoying neighbor from Bewitched?\u201d</p><p>Ainsley notched her chin higher, because she hadn\u2019t meant to say that out loud. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing how protective you are of Ben might make me change my mind about you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, goodie. That\u2019s what she needed. Rielle\u2019s approval.</p><p>\u201cThe McKays are taking cattle to market. He\u2019s supposed to be home Friday night.\u201d</p><p>So much for getting this all straightened out today.</p><p>\u201cDid your fight with Ben have anything to do with the land issues coming to a head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLand issues?\u201d Ainsley repeated.</p><p>\u201cHim and his cousins made a fair play for my land by offering to catch up my payments at Settler\u2019s First. I appreciated Ben\u2019s offer. But Gavin\u2019s was better.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley squinted at her. \u201cWait a second. I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>Rielle explained and Ainsley felt guiltier and guiltier. Ben been dealing with such a shit storm in his life the last night they\u2019d seen each other and she hadn\u2019t noticed. She\u2019d just added to it.</p><p>\u201cBut it was the best way for me to save face, keep out of bankruptcy and not be beholden to a McKay.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze snapped up. Had she said that to Ben? Impugned his family name? \u201cYou are talking about Ben\u2019s brother Gavin, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But he isn\u2019t anything like the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t your decision cause problems between you and Ben?\u201d</p><p>She tossed her head. \u201cYes, Ben is pissy with me. Which is why I came over and checked on his place. It\u2019s a neighborly thing. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley wasn\u2019t about to back down. \u201cI understand perfectly. You\u2019re expecting the betrayal of your friendship with him will just go away if you show up with a pan of homemade muffins? Wrong.\u201d She held her hand out. \u201cGive me the damn key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d Surprisingly, Rielle slapped it in her hand. Then Ainsley got in her face. \u201cGo home. Your relationship with Ben will never be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of you? Now that you\u2019re in the picture you\u2019re warning me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you that I know Ben on a level you never will. You were his friend. And now you\u2019re just another person in a long line of people who have used and hurt him. Well, guess what, Rielle? I\u2019ll never be that person. Ever. And yes, I plan on being in the picture for a long, damn time. So get used to it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rielle didn\u2019t utter a word. She drove off.</p><p>Ainsley would make it right with Ben, no matter what she had to do.</p><p>She called Layla on her way home. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about what you said today. Yes. I agree.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWell, funny you should ask...I need a huge favor.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Dead tired after four days of loading cattle, taking them to market, and making the drive back, all Ben wanted was a shot of whiskey, a hot shower and a solid night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>And his soft Ainsley curled beside him.</p><p>Might as well wish for a million bucks.</p><p>Ben trudged to his front door and shoved his key in the lock. Ace and Deuce saw something by the barn and raced off. After being cooped up in the truck for the past few days, the dogs needed to lose their rowdiness before the impending blizzard restricted their antics indoors.</p> <p>He knew he\u2019d loaded enough wood in the outside stack by the backdoor to last through the storm. Absentmindedly he shucked his outerwear and piled it by the chair. He\u2019d expected the house to be cold, so the fire burning in the woodstove shocked him. As did the stack of split logs filling the woodbin. He noticed a flash of red out of the corner of his eye and whipped his head toward the kitchen.</p><p>Ben had never understood the phrase gob smacked until he saw Ainsley perched on his kitchen counter. In the same clothes she\u2019d worn at the club the first night he\u2019d met her.</p><p>Then he had the overwhelming fear this was a fantasy playing out in his mind as he snoozed in the truck.</p><p>His breath stalled. His heart raced, every beat a two-part recitation of her name. Nothing existed in that blur of space known as the universe except for her.</p><p>A primal voice inside his head roared mine.</p><p>Ben erased the distance separating them. He didn\u2019t say a word. He didn\u2019t take the kiss he craved. He simply grabbed her by the hips and threw her over his shoulder.</p> <p>She shrieked, \u201cOh my God, Bennett, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He swatted her ass as he marched to his bedroom. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have this out right now. But since you showed up on my turf, my rules apply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour rules always apply, no matter where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d He tossed her on the bed. Before she could scramble away, he pounced on her, pinning her flat to the mattress. Her arms above her head, his knees by her hips to keep her from bucking.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you just dumped me on the bed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can.\u201d He inhaled a deep breath, bringing her scent inside him, allowing it to calm him. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Brilliant observation. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRielle gave up her key. For good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley tried to act put out, but she couldn\u2019t quite pull it off. \u201cI came to grovel, but I figured the beastly Dom would take it the wrong way if he came home and found me naked on my knees.\u201d</p><p>Ben smiled. \u201cYou know me so well.\u201d He watched as her eyes turned somber. \u201cI know you too, angel. Talk to me. Start from that night when everything went to hell between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was damn near hysterical at the thought of losing my job when you came to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blamed me.\u201d Not a question.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMade it worse when you admitted you lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby. I\u2019m sorry too. I never should\u2019ve applied for the loan through National West. It all turned to shit anyway, but I regret putting you through that. Regret putting us both through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to hurt you back. So I stupidly made a couple of horrible accusations, and I am so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d felt like he\u2019d been gut shot that night. Knowing he loved her and he\u2019d probably lost her for opening up to her. For hoping she\u2019d accept him, everything about him and having her reject him.</p><p>\u201cYet, you tried to make it right. You tried to tell me you attempted to fix it by withdrawing the loan request. But I was too incensed.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cToo...hurt and too busy lashing out at you to listen to what you were saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do seem to pay better attention when you\u2019re tied up,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s full lips curved slightly. \u201cYou like that far too much, Bennett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lie.\u201d He grinned without shame.</p><p>\u201cI missed that smile of yours. I missed you in the last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss Ben? Or Bennett?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve figured out they\u2019re one in the same. I can\u2019t have one without the other. I don\u2019t want one without the other.\u201d</p><p>Hope nearly blindsided him and he fought to retain control. Ben released her arms so he could touch her. \u201cI gathered from my mom that you didn\u2019t get fired.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley blinked at him. \u201cVi? How would she know about my job at the bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have lunch with her on Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was in Denver Friday night through Monday. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t swing by this weekend and talk about what\u2019d happened. The district manager got pissy after the phone call and forced me and Turton to attend a weekend seminar in Denver about interpersonal team management.\u201d</p><p>Ben tugged Ainsley upright and took her mouth in a savage kiss. He owned each breath, each exhalation, each tongue tangling thrust. And when he thought his head might explode, he broke his lips free from hers. \u201cThat little taste isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, woman, I\u2019m dyin\u2019 for you, but not until we talk this through. All of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and that blasted talking.\u201d She nuzzled his cheek. \u201cOkay. But let\u2019s talk fast. Rielle told me what happened. You should know...I had words with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords that made it plain I wouldn\u2019t stand for her hurting you.\u201d Ainsley\u2019s fingers were gently scraping against three days worth of beard growth on his face. \u201cI know you, Ben. Her betrayal of your friendship hurt worse than Gavin buying the land.\u201d</p><p>This woman saw so much, she knew him so much better than he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>\u201cBeen a rough week for you. I cut you loose. You were let down by your brother and your friend.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd you resigned from the Rawhide Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNews travels fast. Layla must\u2019ve told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me? No. She confronted me, accused me, and threatened me...so it\u2019d be redundant if I asked why you quit. But I want to know if you\u2019re sure you want to quit?\u201d</p><p>Ben turned his head and kissed her palm. \u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d When she didn\u2019t say anything else, he prompted. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now will you ask me if I\u2019d be here if you hadn\u2019t resigned from the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When you told me that we couldn\u2019t be together because of what I was\u2014it pissed me off. You knew I was a Dom, you knew that I belonged to a club when we met. It chapped my ass you were using that as an excuse to break it off with me\u2014because you were scared of embracing your submissive nature permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile that is partially true\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben stopped her protest with his fingers. \u201cBut once my anger and pride cleared, I understood it wasn\u2019t me bein\u2019 a Dom that was the issue. Or you not accepting being submissive. It was the Rawhide Club itself. You weren\u2019t passing judgment on it or on people who belong to it. Not on me either. And to some extent, not on yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up. \u201cYou do understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook me a couple days, and a bad night at the club, but I finally got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bad night at the club? You went to the club last weekend?\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, angel. I wasn\u2019t there for a hookup. After everything came to a head with us, the Rawhide has always been my go-to place for support, consolation, acceptance, whatever. Long story short, my cousin Dalton showed up and his accusations brought out some questions I\u2019d not dealt with for quite a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy I needed the club. Why I needed certain aspects of it and not others, which really made me think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat accusations did your cousin make? Because you shouldn\u2019t have to explain who you are to anyone.\u201d She snapped, \u201cDid he threaten to tell your family that you\u2019re a Dom? Is that why you resigned from the club?\u201d</p><p>He loved how she jumped to his defense. \u201cHe told my brothers. Which got Chase and Gavin here right away.\u201d Ben still couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d shown up. \u201cWe had a talk about that part of my life and they didn\u2019t pass judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, Ben. I\u2019m really, really glad for you. That\u2019s got to be a huge relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton promised to keep my...proclivities under his hat. But in some ways his questions were good for me. A big reason I kept going to the Rawhide, aside from my friendships with the guys, is I found acceptance. I\u2019d never had that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d His eyes searched hers and his heart rate spiked. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you\u2019re here. What you want from me.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley didn\u2019t hold back. \u201cI want it all. More time with you and me together. With you as my Dom. With every part, each facet, all sides of yourself that you want to share with me.\u201d</p><p>Everything in him that\u2019d been wound tight...loosened. \u201cI hoped you\u2019d want that. \u201c</p><p>\u201cI do. More than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I\u2019d have to choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoose what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChoose between the club and you.\u201d</p><p>She went utterly still.</p><p>\u201cAnd I chose you. I\u2019ve got your acceptance and I don\u2019t need to go anywhere else. I\u2019m not giving anything up by leaving the club, Ainsley, I feel like I\u2019m gaining so much more than I\u2019d ever hoped for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d she whispered, trailing her fingers across the stubble on his jaw.</p><p>Ben\u2019s mouth went dry as the words he\u2019d never said to a woman poured from his mouth, from his heart. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. God. Ben.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel whole with you. Before I kept the two halves of myself separated. But when I\u2019m with you, I\u2019m a whole man. I\u2019m the man I want to be. I\u2019m the man I was meant to be. You are everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in a woman but thought I\u2019d never find. And here you are.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, sniffing against the tears leaking from the corners of her eyes. \u201cI love you. The whole you. The Dom side. The rancher side. The intuitive side. The sweet side. The raunchy side.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed her with a lingering smooch as he tried to slow the thundering of his heart. \u201cI like who I am when I\u2019m with you, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you. All of you. I want to pick you up at the bank, take you out for lunch and let everyone know we\u2019re together. I want to support your community events. I want you to come to my family deals as my woman, not my friend. I want to take you dancing, and horseback riding, and then I want to tie you up, turn your ass pink before I fuck you hard.\u201d He traced her jawline. \u201cI want to be with you every damn day. I want this angelic face to be the first thing I see in the morning and the last thing I see at night. If I had my way, I\u2019d move all your stuff over here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I understand that you probably wanna take it slow. You\u2019re still trying to find your place in a new town. In a new job. In a new type of relationship. I\u2019m just as shocked as you are that so much has happened between us and it\u2019s only been a little over a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems longer, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Ben peered into her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m here whenever you\u2019re ready to take that next step. I\u2019m a patient man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for when you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cWell, there is that.\u201d</p> <p>Ainsley pecked him on the lips. \u201cI want to be with you too, Ben. And I know in my heart we will be together, sooner rather than later. But we have a few serious, major things to discuss before that day comes.\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t like how she\u2019d dropped her gaze. Instead of commanding her to look at him, he tipped her chin up and saw uneasiness swimming in her eyes. \u201cGive me an example of a major thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...you\u2019re a dog person and I\u2019m a cat person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that is a deal breaker. Who ever heard of cats and dogs living together in harmony?\u201d Ben chuckled and smooched her nose. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about ranching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about banking, so that one\u2019s a wash too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo?\u201d she repeated. \u201cI\u2019m the older, clich\u00e9d divorced woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re the same age as my mother, for Christsake. You\u2019ve got five years on me.\u201d His eyes gleamed. \u201cSince I\u2019m a dog person, let\u2019s say that adds seven years on my age, so I\u2019m actually two years older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Totally crazy for everything about you. So no more excuses, angel, give me a valid reason why we have to have this discussion again at a later date.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley blurted, \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want kids. Ever. And it isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll change my mind on. I know your family is big on big families\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. One of the first things you need to know about me when it comes to my family is that while I love them, I\u2019m not them. I don\u2019t follow their lead. I do things my own way. And with the way my cousins are reproducing? There\u2019s no chance the McKay family name will die out.\u201d He twined a section of her hair around his finger, loving the silken texture against his coarser skin. \u201cHere\u2019s something I\u2019ve never told anyone. I don\u2019t want kids either. Never have. Never will. That\u2019s another reason the club worked so well for me. It\u2019s also why I didn\u2019t date much. Most women want a family. I don\u2019t. Wasn\u2019t fair to enter into a relationship that was goin\u2019 nowhere. And like you, it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real? You don\u2019t want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. The only ass I wanna paddle now and in the future is yours.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou are the perfect man for me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>He watched how the curve of her breast begged for the touch of his rough-tipped finger.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, please.\u201d</p><p>Bossy little sub. His eyes hooked hers.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>Ben lifted a brow. \u201cGetting a bit big for your britches. Just because we\u2019re talking don\u2019t mean you\u2019re calling the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBennett,\u201d he corrected. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve decided you have entirely too many clothes on. Strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is gonna be so fun reacquainting your ass with my hand,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cBut there is one other thing I wanted to bring up.\u201d She rolled to her feet and stood by the side of the bed. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not overstepping my bounds, but I\u2019d like... I mean, I asked Layla...\u201d</p><p>Why was Ainsley so nervous? \u201cSpit it out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes roamed his face and she found what she\u2019d been looking for. \u201cI\u2019m not the type of sub to wear a collar. But I want you to know I\u2019m serious about our relationship, knowing my place in your life, and yours in mine. So I thought...\u201d She pulled out two black bracelets from the Rawhide Club. \u201cWhen I wear mine, I\u2019ll know who I am to you. And when you look at yours, you\u2019ll know that I accept everything about you. It\u2019s a small symbol that we belong to each other. Maybe it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>He was totally gonna paddle her ass for making him tear up like a fucking girl.</p><p>\u201cToo corny?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s perfect,\u201d he said. He cleared his throat and slipped the bracelet on her left wrist, letting his finger follow the thin band all the way around. Such a simple thing that meant so much. Then held his arm out so she could do the same. When he was dry-eyed, he looked up at her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, weren\u2019t you supposed to be getting nekkid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna argue with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Looks like the beastly Dom is back.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDarlin\u2019, he never left.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley leaned over and laid a hot, wet, kiss on him. \u201cAnd I hope he never does.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
