That rich, deep sound Delaney Catalano hadn\u2019t heard for two long years sang in the humid May air, making her heart clench. After all the trials and miles\u2014and lately, the bullets\u2014she never believed she\u2019d hear Tyler Murphy\u2019s familiar voice again. Certainly, she\u2019d never imagined hearing it in BFE, Louisiana, as she hid in the shadows of his back patio like some sad stalker. She wasn\u2019t at all surprised that a group of girls had given him a moniker about his sexual prowess. Women had always crawled all over him, and perpetually single Tyler liked it that way.</p><p>Once upon a time, his antics had made her laugh\u2014until Delaney had experienced him for herself. To this day, she remembered exactly how good he\u2019d been. She pushed the thought aside.</p> <p>Peeking around the corner, she saw Tyler\u2019s broad shoulders and upper back encased in a charcoal gray T-shirt. His blond hair had been cut brutally short, exposing the strong column of his sun-kissed neck. He lounged in a chair, his forearms looking bronzed, heavily veined, and vital under the patio lights. Around a table, he was surrounded by a virtual harem: two redheads, a platinum blonde, a Latina brunette, and an auburn-haired model type\u2014each totally gorgeous.</p><p>Some things never change. Not that it should matter to her. He\u2019d been her friend first and foremost. And he\u2019d never been hers to lose.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad nickname why?\u201d Tyler returned to the stunning blonde beside him, lifting his bottle of beer to his mouth and taking a long swallow.</p><p>As the other women laughed, Delaney glanced over her shoulder, hoping like hell that she hadn\u2019t been followed. She breathed a sigh of relief when it appeared that she was alone. How nice would it be if her most pressing problem were others\u2019 opinions? How nice would it be if someone didn\u2019t want her dead?</p><p>\u201cLadies . . .\u201d the blonde\u2019s voice warned. \u201cThis is not funny. Remember the plan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlyssa is right,\u201d said the brunette with sinful curves. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet, Kata, but acting like you care isn\u2019t going to persuade me to watch another crappy Twilight movie with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked it,\u201d Kata accused.</p><p>Tyler snorted. \u201cYou wish.\u201d</p><p>He probably had liked it more than he wanted to admit. Tyler liked high-testosterone thrillers, but he\u2019d admitted under the influence of Se\u00f1or Cuervo that he kinda liked chick flicks, too. Once upon a time, he\u2019d been Delaney\u2019s buddy of choice to curl up on the couch with and rent movies, she remembered with a wistful smile. Then reality crashed back in.</p><p>\u201cFocus.\u201d Alyssa snapped. \u201cThis is an intervention. The girls and I all agree that you need help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon. I\u2019m not a drug addict or an alcoholic. I\u2019m no danger to myself or others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong. You\u2019re dangerous to womankind,\u201d the auburn-haired beauty cut in. \u201cCan you make it a whole day without getting in some stripper\u2019s thong? Our guess is no.\u201d</p><p>Delaney grimaced. Yep, same old Tyler. He\u2019d always liked women easy and flashy. One reason\u2014among many\u2014she\u2019d never taken his flirting seriously. Then again, it wasn\u2019t his flirting that had been her downfall.</p><p>\u201cOuch, Kimber. You wound me.\u201d Tyler slapped a hand dramatically over his chest.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap,\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it a whole day, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I could. But why torture myself? I have to do something to stave off the loneliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any more catfights onstage about who\u2019s getting Cockzilla tonight,\u201d Alyssa chimed in again.</p><p>\u201cNo catfights at a strip club? You\u2019re kidding me? Your patrons loved the action. Better than Jell-O wrestling. Got a rise out of me.\u201d</p> <p>The women in Tyler\u2019s life were staging an intervention, and he wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. Delaney wasn\u2019t really surprised. He would always be Mr. Good-Time. What did surprise her, however, was that none of the women seemed to be fighting over him. Yet, anyway.</p><p>\u201cWait. Are you here to tell me that you\u2019re suddenly available and want me all to yourself?\u201d he challenged the gorgeous blonde. \u201cYou know I\u2019m all over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know.\u201d Another woman scoffed and waved her hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t known you that long, but seriously, a stiff wind could get a rise out of you.\u201d</p><p>The lovely redhead with the sultry brown eyes wore a wedding ring. Then again, bands of gold had never stopped Tyler before. She ought to know.</p><p>\u201cYou noticed, Tara? I\u2019m touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that,\u201d Tara scolded. \u201cAlyssa is being really serious. We all are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It\u2019s not a joke?\u201d With a sigh, Tyler turned back to the blonde. \u201cOkay. What\u2019s up, boss lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have girls fighting and quitting because you\u2019re too busy playing musical beds,\u201d Alyssa said. \u201cSomeone is going to lose every time, and it\u2019s creating a fucking mess that I don\u2019t have time to clean up. I hired Jessi to replace Krystal, who left because she didn\u2019t like being last on your booty-call list. Tyler, Jessi has been with me for three days. Three! I found out this afternoon that you\u2019ve already tapped that, more than once.\u201d</p><p>He fidgeted in his seat. \u201cAfter her first shift, she asked for an escort to her car. The parking lot was dark and empty. I helped her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy nailing her in the backseat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more room in a Civic than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler, I know you like to keep things light, but please be serious for a minute.\u201d Alyssa\u2019s voice rang with frustration. \u201cJessi came crying to me when she found you and Skylar in the dressing room last night after closing. Do I need to enact a strict no-anal-sex policy at the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt Jessi\u2019s feelings. I thought she knew the score. I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m confused about one thing. I\u2019ve bounced there for almost two years. What I do with the girls has never bothered you before. What is this really about?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, and Delaney watched a few of the women lift glasses of wine and sip nervously.</p><p>The other redhead, the one with the baby bump, clutched a water bottle and shifted in the seat. \u201cWe think it\u2019s time you settled down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgan . . .\u201d he warned. \u201cDon\u2019t try spreading your matrimonial joy on me. Just because you\u2019re all blissful with your monogamy doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in any hurry to get there.\u201d</p><p>So the redhead\u2019s baby bump wasn\u2019t his doing? Never mind. It\u2019s irrelevant. Focus.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to grow up,\u201d Morgan pointed out.</p><p>Alyssa wagged a finger in his face. \u201cSkylar just turned twenty-two. You\u2019re, what, a decade older?\u201d</p><p>Actually, Tyler was thirty-four. Delaney remembered his thirtieth birthday party, during happier times, back when she and Eric\u2014</p><p>She shut down that thought and listened to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was that young. Sorry.\u201d Tyler shrugged. \u201cWe weren\u2019t exactly exchanging vital statistics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alyssa jumped in. \u201cJust bodily fluids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I always wear a condom.\u201d</p><p>Tara grimaced as several others groaned. \u201cEww. I don\u2019t want details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying . . . Let\u2019s not get technical,\u201d he defended. \u201cSo I\u2019m older than she is. I\u2019m not the first guy to date a younger woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking in the back of the club isn\u2019t dating.\u201d Kimber sighed.</p><p>\u201cClean up your man-whore act.\u201d Alyssa looked dead serious. \u201cOr in ten years, you\u2019re going to be a walking stereotype, a middle-aged Lothario hitting on young chicks with your snazzy sports car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a sports car, and even if I did, with a name like Cockzilla, everyone would know that I\u2019m not overcompensating for anything I might be lacking.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa smacked her hand on the table. \u201cDamn it, are you listening to us at all?\u201d</p><p>Tyler sighed. \u201cYes. Joking aside, I will curb some of my . . . activity at the club. I appreciate your concern. But seriously, I\u2019m not looking for any kind of happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d Kata cut in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find you one.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cOh, I get it. You have someone in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought it would be nice if you\u2019d talk to my cousin, London,\u201d Alyssa suggested as if walking on eggshells. \u201cShe just moved here. She\u2019s very sweet and could use a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d</p><p>Kata stood, putting her hands on her very curvaceous hips. \u201cAre you refusing because she\u2019s not a size two?\u201d</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing against girls with a little extra cushion. But that one has purity written all over her. No fucking way. Alyssa, you don\u2019t like the way I treat your dancers, but you want to unleash me on your little virgin relative?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if she\u2019s a virgin?\u201d Alyssa argued. \u201cYou have a really kind, loyal side that would be good for her.\u201d</p><p>The gorgeous blonde had gotten that part right. He\u2019d once proven that he\u2019d do anything for a friend.</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Kata agreed. \u201cI might not be here if that weren\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can just keep your pants zipped long enough, she\u2019ll see it. And you\u2019ll get to know her, too, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tyler finished the last of his beer and slammed the bottle on the table. \u201cI\u2019m done here. If you ladies want to stay and finish your wine, you\u2019re more than welcome, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re pairing me up with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Tara, closest to the sliding glass doors, moved her chair to block his path.</p><p>He scooted her out of the way with a nudge of his powerful thigh. \u201cAnywhere else. Bye.\u201d</p><p>When he disappeared inside the house, Delaney panicked. It had taken her forever to track him down. She was at the end of her cash reserves and the end of her rope. Time had run out. No way could she wait until he felt like coming home again to confront him. There was too much at stake.</p><p>Dragging everything she loved and owned behind her, Delaney clung to the shadows, watching for anything suspicious, and ran for his front door.</p><p>THE doorbell rang before Tyler could escape the house. Damn it, if this was another meddling female trying to tell him how to run his life, he was going to shove a bottle of wine in her hands and send her out back with the rest of them. He had better things to do, like slap some sense into his buddies. What the hell had possessed all of them to marry such interfering women?</p><p>Clenching the knob with almost as much gusto as he gnashed his teeth, Tyler yanked the door open with a curse on the tip of his tongue. It died abruptly.</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>He drank in the sight of the familiar, petite brunette. He knew those wary blue eyes, framed by thick, dark lashes, and that sweet oval face. Her stubborn chin. That wide bow of a mouth. His heart pounded. He found himself unable to take a breath. \u201cDelaney?\u201d</p><p>The sight of her hit him like a fucking two-by-four in the solar plexus. Was it even possible that she stood at his door? Or was he hallucinating after two silent years of wondering what the fuck had happened?</p><p>\u201cHi, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>She shifted nervously, looking too damn tired and rumpled. Her dark hair hung in an unraveling braid. She wore no makeup, a faded T-shirt, and had dark circles under her eyes. By her side sat a black duffel bag on wheels. Something else squatted near her, around the corner. He couldn\u2019t see more than a blue, waist-high plastic handle stretching vertically for about two feet.</p><p>What the hell? She refused to have anything to do with him for two years, then came to his door unannounced, bringing everything she owned?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tough man to track down,\u201d she murmured, then glanced over her shoulder at the empty street bathed in twilight. \u201cYour alias threw me.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, he crossed his arms over his chest. Yeah, he should invite her in, but last time he checked, she\u2019d thrown him out of her life.</p><p>Of course, she wouldn\u2019t show up now with luggage unless she was desperate . . .</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression you\u2019d rather I get and stay lost,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>She shook her head, her dark braid swaying in the valley between her soft breasts, the ones with the pretty berry red nipples he\u2019d never forgotten, no matter how many fake tits he\u2019d fondled in the last two years. Tyler ignored the stirring of his cock and swallowed back the memory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the way things ended.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI know this is awkward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs hell. Yeah. Where\u2019s Eric?\u201d He glanced down at her left hand, clutching the rolling duffel bag. Her ring finger was bare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re divorced.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. And there came the two-by-four to his gut again. Tyler didn\u2019t ask why; he knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry as hell, Del.\u201d</p><p>And he was. But there was a selfish side of him having a full-on, get-down party at the news that Del was single again.</p> <p>Self-consciously, she rubbed her thumb under her naked ring finger. \u201cThanks. It was final sixteen months ago. I haven\u2019t seen much of him since.\u201d She pursed her lips together, glanced behind her at the quiet street again. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk a lot.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch, he\u2019d bet the split was ugly. And why did she keep glancing behind her?</p><p>\u201cDelaney . . .\u201d Tyler didn\u2019t know what the hell to say. It wasn\u2019t all his fault. But a good deal of the blame rested on his shoulders. The need to know why she was here now also kept circling his brain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I know you have company and that this is uncomfortable. I know I handled everything between us badly in the past. I\u2019m sorry. I regret it like hell.\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s blue eyes filled up with tears. As she fought them back, Tyler resisted the urge to comfort her as he had when they\u2019d been friends . . . then more.</p> <p>\u201cCan I come in? There\u2019s something we really need to talk about\u2014and we shouldn\u2019t do it on your porch.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside Tyler seized up. The last time they\u2019d talked, she\u2019d asked him to leave, then cut him out of her life. Whatever was on her mind, it would be heavy. She hadn\u2019t come all the way to Lafayette from Los Angeles to shoot the shit.</p><p>Despite everything, how the hell could he say no? He\u2019d ruined her life, and deep down, he\u2019d been pretty damn sure that would be the outcome the second the deed was done. He owed her. Besides, he\u2019d never been in love . . . but he\u2019d come perilously close with Delaney.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He swallowed, grabbed her duffel, and stepped back. \u201cCome in. How did you know I had company?\u201d</p><p>Delaney glanced at the object with the tall plastic handle beside her, the rest hidden by the exterior wall of the porch. She looked distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cI rang the doorbell a bit ago, and no one answered. So I popped around to the side of the house and . . . saw that you weren\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my buddies\u2019 wives.\u201d He\u2019d meant the words as an explanation, a defense. Then he winced. God, Delaney probably already imagined\u2014with good reason\u2014that he was fucking each and every one of them.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business.\u201d She glanced at the hidden object beside her again, then the empty street behind her. \u201cI came because I need your help. Really badly and right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look tired, Del. And too thin. Come in and tell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath, then bent to the hidden item just beside her. A trunk? A dolly? Did she mean to move in?</p><p>A moment later, she straightened up, clutching a child. A little boy. He was deadweight in her arms, half asleep, his face against her shoulder, thick blond hair askew. Tyler\u2019s heart skidded to a stop.</p><p>The kid\u2019s meaty hands and feet peeked out beyond the arms and legs of his Spider-Man pajamas that were just a bit too small. He hooked one arm around Delaney\u2019s neck, then began rubbing an eye with his little fist. Then the kid turned. That little face possessed the Murphy nose. His own green eyes, uncertain and watchful, stared back at him.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s entire body went cold. His jaw dropped as his mind came to a screeching halt. Oh God. Oh fucking God . . .</p><p>\u201cTyler, meet your son, Seth.\u201d</p><p>His son. Tyler had known this kid was his at a glance. A thousand emotions pelted him at once. Shock blazed through his system first. Wonder crashed in next.</p> <p>He had a son. He and Delaney had created life together that beautiful May night when he\u2019d finally stopped seeing her as a friend and had little choice but to touch her as a woman.</p><p>But she\u2019d never bothered to tell him. Had she even tried to find him or just decided that he was irrelevant and had the child on her own?</p><p>Fury swept over him, relentless. One scathing accusation after another perched on the edge of his tongue. Gritting his teeth, he pushed it down for the boy\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cHi, Seth,\u201d he spoke in soft tones, then speared Delaney with a glare that dared her to defy him. \u201cI want to hold him now.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Tyler ached to. This was his son. His . . . with her.</p><p>Regret made Delaney\u2019s mouth tremble as she nodded. She kissed the little boy\u2019s head, then whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, little man.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned and watched him suspiciously, but went into his arms without a fight. Then Tyler was holding his son for the first time, wrapping him as tightly in his arms as he dared.</p><p>He tried to swallow, but his throat felt too tight. His jaw ached. His heart beat fast, like a fucking racehorse at the Kentucky Derby. Something warm flooded his chest. Tyler had never fallen instantly in love with anything or anyone, but Seth seized his heart in a single moment. He kissed the little boy\u2019s forehead, and the feeling swelled tenfold.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I just now finding out about him?\u201d Tyler tried to keep his voice calm and even. But his eyes accused her. What he really wanted to know was how the fuck she could have robbed him of the first fifteen months of his own son\u2019s life.</p><p>She glanced at the street behind her again apprehensively and shimmied out of the porch\u2019s light. \u201cYou have every right to be angry. Things were complicated, and you became impossible to find once you moved out of state. And I know those seem like poor excuses. At the end of the day, I didn\u2019t know what to tell you or if you\u2019d even care. You can take it out of my hide later. I\u2019m sure I deserve it. But right now, I need your help. I need you to protect Seth.\u201d She swallowed, her red-rimmed eyes looking stark and afraid. \u201cSomeone is trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>TYLER\u2019S face changed immediately, closing up, tensing. Cop mode; she recognized it. He might not be an LAPD Vice detective anymore, but some instincts never changed.</p><p>He dragged her into the house, then rolled her duffel and their son\u2019s stroller into the little foyer. Shoulders taut, he slammed the door, then locked it behind him.</p><p>When he turned to her again, his green eyes were laser sharp and focused. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Delaney licked her lips, her legs about to wobble out from under her. She was starving and exhausted. All of her cash had gone toward feeding Seth and buying gas. She hadn\u2019t dared to use her credit cards.</p><p>Her thoughts were racing, and her son stirred restlessly. He\u2019d been cooped up for days. Now that he was awake, he would want to roam around. As a mother who knew the bastard after her didn\u2019t care if Seth was collateral damage, she was terrified to let the little boy out of her sight.</p><p>Sensing her problem, Tyler gently rocked him. \u201cHey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned. Delaney handed the little boy the last of his apple juice from his sippy cup and a few animal crackers in the colorful but dented box.</p><p>Once he settled down, she risked a glance at Tyler. The man was waiting for an explanation\u2014and not patiently. Where to begin?</p><p>\u201cYou remember Martin Carlson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of L.A.\u2019s upcoming assistant district attorneys, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlimy bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one, yes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou know how Eric always teased me about reporting on fluff pieces, like society baby showers and dog shows, when I first started writing for the Times?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I pushed and pushed my editor, Preston, for meatier stories. On New Year\u2019s Eve, he assigned me to cover a party that Martin Carlson and his wife were giving. During the party, I sneaked away to call the babysitter and check on Seth. I overheard Carlson on the phone, talking. He threatened that he\u2019d better see the money show up in his Cayman account or the police would be banging on the door the next day. Then I heard Carlson specifically call Double T by name and tell the guy not to fuck him over or he was going to find his ass in prison and his operation shut down.\u201d</p><p>Thunder rolled across Tyler\u2019s face. \u201cThe gangster Double T of the 18th Street gang?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Delaney said grimly. \u201cEveryone who knows anything about the drug scene near the Pico-Union district knows that he rules his turf with an iron fist. Carlson didn\u2019t see me, thank God. It was a short conversation, two minutes max. But after that, I started digging. I wanted to write a story that would blow Preston away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck. Double T isn\u2019t the person to get all tenacious and crusading about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston said the same thing. He wanted me to call the feds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d And Tyler looked more than pissed about that fact. \u201cSo Double T is trying to kill you because you know some of his crap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s Carlson, actually. I got my hands on a copy of one of the evidence logs down at your old precinct, Rampart. I\u2019m pretty sure it was tampered with. A whole bunch of guns and bags of white powder, supposedly with Double T\u2019s prints, suddenly turned up missing. I took a picture of the original log. Carlson and some beat cop went in the evidence room. But when I looked again, it only listed the beat cop\u2019s name. I hunted that rookie down and found out he\u2019d supposedly died during a drive-by.\u201d</p><p>The frown that crossed Tyler\u2019s face wasn\u2019t comforting. \u201cGangsters don\u2019t usually shoot cops without provocation. It brings too much shit raining down on their head, which is bad for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. No one else died in the incident, either. One shooter, one bullet, which seemed even more fishy. So I kept investigating. I found one of Double T\u2019s lieutenants, Lobato Loco, who wanted to make a power play, so he was willing to talk off the record. He didn\u2019t like his boss giving the ADA a cut of the money and figured that he could eliminate the problem and Double T at once by snitching anonymously to a reporter. He said he\u2019d sign an affidavit to that effect.</p><p>\u201cArmed with information, I went to Carlson\u2019s office and asked him about his dealings with Double T on the record. Of course he denied everything, but after that, shit started happening fast. I went to the police, but none of Eric\u2019s buddies wanted to lift a finger to help the bitch who\u2019d cheated on him, least of all that creep, Becker the Pecker. So I had to fend for myself, especially since I didn\u2019t have any tangible proof of Carlson\u2019s guilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Tyler muttered. \u201cDid you tell Eric this? You might be divorced, but he wouldn\u2019t want you dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left messages. He didn\u2019t call back.\u201d She pressed her lips together, watching as Tyler got angry all over again.</p><p>In some ways, Tyler had always been more protective than Eric. Her ex-husband had always said that she was strong and capable. He\u2019d never seen her as needing a champion. Tyler had his affable moments, but underneath, he was pure caveman. He\u2019d threatened to bust up just about any asshole at Rampart who\u2019d dared to ogle her or acted a bit too friendly.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She pushed a hand against Tyler\u2019s chest when he looked ready to charge forward and find someone to beat the crap out of.</p><p>But her fingers encountered hard muscle, bulges, sinew\u2014all male. Delaney gulped and withdrew her hand from the burning heat of Tyler\u2019s skin. Too often, she\u2019d mentally replayed their night together and remembered the utter masculine perfection of his body. The way his lips had lingered on her neck, his rough fingertips had scraped every inch of her flesh, his sex-roughened growl had talked her through each one of the five orgasms he\u2019d given her in that sublime hour.</p><p>Those thoughts wouldn\u2019t help her now. Lives were on the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck am I supposed to wait for? I\u2019m going to tear Eric a new one. And Carlson was always a fucking prick, more concerned with his own ambition than justice. If he\u2019s threatening you, I\u2019m going to put a stop to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head. His urge to help her was sweet . . . but misguided. \u201cI started this. I have to finish it. Lobato Loco will only talk to me. No one else knows the facts like I do. Or has cultivated the contacts. But I can\u2019t keep Seth in the middle of this danger. After the bomb destroyed my Toyota\u2014I\u2019m so glad I hadn\u2019t strapped Seth in his car seat before I started the car with my key fob\u2014I realized that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prick bombed your car?\u201d Now Tyler sounded beyond furious. He\u2019d gone deadly, with his jaw clenched damn tight. Delaney wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever seen him so enraged. \u201cThey meant to kill both you and our son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe more than Seth. Focus. All the admittedly circumstantial evidence I\u2019d collected against Carlson was in that car, and now it\u2019s gone. He means business. So I need you to protect Seth. It kills me to ask this of you.\u201d She pressed her lips together, her eyes watering as she stroked her son\u2019s arm, then gripped his little hand. \u201cSo please, don\u2019t make this harder. I don\u2019t want to leave him, but I\u2019d rather he be alive with you than dead with me. No one knows you\u2019re his father, and no one will think to look for him here. I have to go back to California and fix this mess. While I do, please keep our son safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>CLENCHING his jaw, Tyler stared at Delaney. Clearly, the woman had lost her mind if she thought for an instant that he was going to stay behind and babysit while she threw herself headlong into danger. The bad shit was his department; she\u2019d never faced it, and he\u2019d be damned if he let her do it alone.</p><p>But he also knew Delaney. If he argued, she\u2019d only dig in her heels. Tyler weighed his words carefully. \u201cI\u2019ll be very glad for any time you give me to get to know Seth.\u201d</p><p>She released the pent-up breath she\u2019d been holding and closed her eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut before I agree to anything, we\u2019re going to do a little bargaining, angel.\u201d</p><p>He intentionally sent her his most dazzling smile, the one that had been melting hearts and panties since he was thirteen.</p><p>Delaney knew him too well. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you want? Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>If anything, his smile widened. \u201cWho says I\u2019m going to ask for much?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cOh my God . . . Do you forget how many times I\u2019ve seen that expression? You\u2019re going to ask for the moon, then act like it\u2019s nothing. Then you\u2019ll ask for the stars, and smooth talk me until I either (a) think it was my idea or (b) thank you for the suggestion\u2014or both. Not this time, buster. I\u2019m not listening. This is one request I know you won\u2019t refuse me. Regardless of what happened between us in the past, I know you don\u2019t want to see your son die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely true. But I\u2019m also not willing to let you walk out the door again without some assurances that, from here on out, I have some parental rights.\u201d Which was true, but not his primary concern at the moment.</p><p>Surprised crossed her face. \u201cYou want visitation?\u201d</p><p>At the very least, but they\u2019d do details later. \u201cSomething like that. But I also want you to think about what you\u2019re doing. What happens to Seth\u2019s emotional stability if his mama leaves him with a stranger, then comes back in a pine box?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll have to figure out how to not die, I guess. I\u2019d walk away from this, if I could. But Carlson is going to come after me no matter what. He\u2019s not going to leave a loose end like me hanging.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take Seth with me. Carlson won\u2019t care if he becomes collateral damage. My baby is too young . . .\u201d She sobbed, sniffed, then tried to find her fortitude to press on. \u201cI\u2019m his mother, and I\u2019m choosing life and safety for him.\u201d</p> <p>Over her own. Damn. Tyler respected the hell out of her for this, but he also wanted to throttle her. He stroked his chin absently, hashing out a plan. It wasn\u2019t perfect and it forced him to prioritize objectives, but he could roll with it. If he achieved his primary goal\u2014keeping Delaney safe and eliminating Carlson\u2014then the rest of his wants might take care of themselves.</p><p>\u201cDel, you need someone to watch your back while you clear up this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need someone to watch Seth\u2019s back more.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, he found it incredibly sexy that Delaney was such a devoted mother. He wasn\u2019t equating her mothering skills with his desire to fuck her . . . Rather, it was seeing her fierce side, her determination, that started his blood pumping south of his belt buckle again.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. We\u2019ll work it out.\u201d He\u2019d have to move carefully or his plan would backfire. \u201cYou look exhausted. Sit down. When did you last eat? Sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not relevant.\u201d Delaney shook her head, sinking into the recliner beside her. \u201cAre you going to help me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there. Before now, how hard did you try to find me?\u201d</p><p>She heaved an exhausted sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play this game, huh? Okay, if you want me to be honest, not very hard.\u201d She pressed the heel of her hand to her forehead. \u201cAs soon as Eric found out I was pregnant, we separated for good. I was dealing with a lot\u2014a new place to live, morning sickness, being served divorce papers . . . you being gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told me to leave.\u201d And goddamn it, if she hadn\u2019t meant that, he was going to string himself up for listening.</p><p>\u201cI did. Eric couldn\u2019t handle what happened between us. I thought giving us all some time and space would help.\u201d</p><p>Her request had damn near destroyed Tyler, but he had lived with it because he\u2019d thought it would help Del and Eric. He\u2019d thought he was giving her what she needed. But clearly not.</p><p>Still, in the long run, Del was better off without her ex-husband.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s breath trembled. \u201cThen Eric told me that you\u2019d moved out of state and left for good.\u201d</p><p>Tyler froze. \u201cDid he lead you to believe that I didn\u2019t want to come back? That I wasn\u2019t dying to call you twenty times a day and find out if you were okay? Because that\u2019s complete bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Those blue eyes of hers turned up to him, wide, teary. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything, and I didn\u2019t know what to think. Your reputation with women . . .\u201d</p><p>The same one Alyssa and the other girls had been nagging him about fifteen minutes ago, before Delaney had knocked his world upside down\u2014for the second time in his life. Ironic that his long string of conquests had come back to haunt him with a vengeance. His own Karma boomeranging him in the ass. And every friend he\u2019d made in Lafayette would know it in the next few minutes.</p><p>\u201cIs that really why you didn\u2019t try harder to reach me? I would have helped. I would have done whatever the hell you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d been best buddies with Eric since shortly after becoming his partner in Vice. But in some ways, he\u2019d been closer to Delaney, connected more with her sense of humor, her intelligence. Something about her . . . He hadn\u2019t really tuned into what that was until he\u2019d been balls deep inside her and falling for her fast. Until it was too late.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI needed a father for Seth, and we both know you\u2019re short on commitment. At first, I was angry that you\u2019d left without another word. I was tired and pissed and hormonal. I told myself it would serve you right to not know about your child.\u201d Tyler opened his mouth to object, and Delaney waved him off. \u201cIt lasted ten minutes. Then I felt . . . abandoned. I figured you\u2019d gone on a case. But then your PI business closed and you didn\u2019t come back. I knew you must be using an assumed name, and it would take me time to find you. Eric certainly wasn\u2019t going to help me.\u201d</p><p>Mentally, Tyler added that to the list of Eric\u2019s infractions and planned to gleefully beat the shit out of him for being a raving douche.</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess . . . there was a part of me that wanted this child to be mine. Everyone else in my life had left me\u2014my parents died, Eric divorced me, you walked away\u2014but this baby . . . I could raise him with love and get back unconditional love in return. I didn\u2019t mean to be selfish. I think\u201d\u2014she blew out a noisy breath\u2014\u201cI was just hurting. I know it was lousy. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, she\u2019d always had a way of diffusing his anger, and today was no different. In her place, he\u2019d have been so angry, he\u2019d have done serious damage.</p><p>She sobbed once, then clapped a hand over her mouth, trying to hold it in. Tyler crouched down next to her, settled a quizzical Seth into her lap, then wrapped his arm around her. She clutched her son, then stiffened, retreating into the back of the chair\u2014away from him. Tyler sighed, all kinds of pissed off at the disappointment gnawing in his gut, then gave Del some space.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat, angel. And rest.\u201d He stared down at his son, now patting his mother\u2019s hand as if he understood that she needed consoling. \u201cHow about you, Seth? Want a peanut butter sandwich?\u201d</p><p>Delaney\u2019s head whipped up. \u201cHe\u2019s allergic to peanut butter. I\u2019ll make a list of his allergies and write out his routine.\u201d</p><p>Great. That would come in handy\u2014for someone else.</p><p>\u201cWhat can he eat?\u201d</p><p>She wiped away her tears impatiently, then sent a wobbly smile to Seth. \u201cWe like eggs, don\u2019t we? We eat lots of eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgg!\u201d Seth gave her a snaggletooth smile.</p><p>Tyler grinned. Well, hot damn. Eggs had always been one of his favorite foods, too.</p><p>\u201cEggs it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d As if she realized that she\u2019d smiled at him, too, Delaney blinked and looked away. \u201cCan I use your bathroom? I need to change Seth.\u201d</p><p>Tyler pointed down the hall, and she grabbed a diaper bag from the stroller. \u201cTake your time. Scrambled with cheese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember how I like eggs?\u201d She bit her lip, as if trying to conceal the fact that it pleased her.</p><p>Fuck that. He was going to find out exactly how she felt. The whole shitty house of cards may have toppled once, but he\u2019d be damned if he wasn\u2019t going to find a way to rebuild it at least enough to be on good terms with his son\u2019s mother.</p><p>But he was beginning to suspect that wouldn\u2019t be enough for him. Despite looking ragged and tired, Delaney was still one of the sexiest women to him. So sharp in some ways, innocent in others. Determined, brave . . . stubborn. Yeah, he was going to have to get past the walls she\u2019d erected if he wanted to play a role in her life beyond Seth\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t like cheese in eggs.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>Ah, and she remembered, too. He shrugged. \u201cI can adjust.\u201d</p><p>After a cock of her head, like she was trying to figure out exactly what he meant, she lifted Seth and carted him down the hall. The second the door shut and locked, Tyler sent out a quick text, then darted toward the patio. All the instigators of his \u201cintervention\u201d still sat there, drinking and clearly trying to decide how best to direct his life. He was about to give them one great big heaping dose of help.</p><p>Sticking his head out the back door, he glanced at the ladies. \u201cCome inside. Have I got a surprise for you . . .\u201d</p><p>DELANEY thanked God for the long countertop in the bathroom and laid Seth out. No doubt, he had to be wet by now.</p><p>\u201cDa da da,\u201d her son babbled.</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019s your daddy. Tyler had seen it immediately. It was obvious and probably better than having to prove Seth\u2019s parentage to him. But it hadn\u2019t escaped Del that Tyler hadn\u2019t yet committed to staying here and protecting Seth. And if she knew that man, he had something up his sleeve. Whatever ran around in Tyler\u2019s half-crazy head, she couldn\u2019t let him derail her. He had all kinds of incentive to keep Seth safe that no one else would. She was sticking to her guns. If she didn\u2019t make it out of this alive . . . at least she knew Seth would be safe. And loved. Tyler, for all his seemingly carefree ways, had tremendous capacity for caring.</p><p>After a quick tug of Seth\u2019s clothes, the wet diaper came off. A fresh one replaced it, then Del righted his shorts. She looked longingly at the shower. How she\u2019d love to bathe with Seth, hold his little body close to her and revel in the skin-to-skin contact. She\u2019d only stopped breast-feeding a few months ago, and she missed having him that close. Showers were like gold to her now.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>Quickly, she set Seth on his feet, used the toilet, then washed her hands. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>In response, Seth blew air out of his lax lips, making noises like a car engine. She smiled softly, sniffing back fresh tears. He was little boy, through and through. She\u2019d miss him desperately while she tried to nail Carlson to a wall and did everything in her power to make it back to her son alive.</p><p>Suddenly, a knock interrupted her thoughts. \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right out, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>Gathering her things and taping up Seth\u2019s wet diaper, she drew in a deep breath and stepped out of the bathroom, down the hall, and into the kitchen\u2014with the five other women from the patio. She stopped short.</p><p>They didn\u2019t make any bones about staring at her with rampant curiosity.</p><p>Then the gorgeous platinum blonde stared at Seth and gasped. \u201cOh my God, Tyler. He looks just like you. Is he . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Mine.\u201d Tyler\u2019s expression was unreadable, but Del sensed a smile somewhere in there. Her mind racing, she tossed away Seth\u2019s diaper. What the hell was this about?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just now telling us about him?\u201d the pregnant redhead challenged.</p><p>The athletic, auburn-haired beauty tapped her foot. \u201cOf course. He gets in the middle of all our shit, but notice that he doesn\u2019t fess up about his own.\u201d</p><p>The curvy Latina frowned. \u201cTrue, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue this time. See how he looks at the boy, with curiosity and wonder. How long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p><p>The women collectively gasped.</p><p>Del held Seth tighter. \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t know exactly how to find Tyler. And . . . what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies, this an old . . . friend, Delaney Catalano. And my son, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. He\u2019s precious,\u201d the other redhead, this one with the dancing dark eyes, said. \u201cTyler made him eggs. Can I feed him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Snapping around, Delaney spied a plate on the counter. Sure enough, steaming eggs and toast sat beside the stove. Seth saw, too\u2014and lunged.</p><p>The platinum knockout caught him before he squirmed headfirst out of Del\u2019s grasp. She scooped him right up against her chest and took him over to the eggs, calling over her shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m Alyssa, Tyler\u2019s boss. I\u2019ve got a little girl just about the same age as your boy. I probably won\u2019t have more children, so I\u2019d love the opportunity to spoil your son. Come on, Tara. Grab a spoon.\u201d She tickled Seth\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Del reached for Seth. \u201cI\u2019ll do that. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Tara chimed back, then giggled. \u201cGosh, Tyler. He looks so much like you. Except I actually like him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Tyler rolled his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve met Alyssa and Tara over there.\u201d He pointed at the two women fussing over Seth\u2014who looked to be eating it up, along with the eggs. \u201cThis is Kata, Kimber, and Morgan.\u201d</p><p>After nodding a greeting, Kata, the Latina brunette, took out her phone and started texting. Kimber, the auburn beauty next to her, got the same idea and whipped out her cell, too.</p><p>\u201cHold up there, girls. C\u2019mon . . . Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>They both looked up with big Cheshire cat grins. Kimber tapped out a few more keys, then hit send. \u201cThat should have Deke here in . . .\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cAbout five minutes. Less, if there\u2019s no traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good. He\u2019ll tell Jack for me.\u201d Morgan, the pregnant redhead, smiled. \u201cI need to recharge my phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Deke will be happy to tell Jack,\u201d Tyler drawled. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>He said it sarcastically but looked relatively pleased. Del didn\u2019t know who Deke or Jack were, but she got the quick idea that, despite his protests, Tyler had orchestrated this scene for some reason.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWho are these men you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my friends, who will hopefully come collect their wives so that we can talk privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband isn\u2019t coming for me until the navy gives him leave again in a few months. I can stay.\u201d Kata grinned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the same boat,\u201d Tara added, nodding.</p> <p>\u201cBut Hunter and Logan did give you a place to stay until they returned home. Do you need help remembering where it is?\u201d</p><p>Though the women looked completely different, they wore identical pouts. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to cause trouble.\u201d Tyler turned to Del. \u201cThey\u2019re married to the Edgington brothers. Navy SEALs . . . who will spank both your asses red when I tell them what pains in my ass you\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m bringing over New Moon and Eclipse,\u201d Kata insisted. \u201cI\u2019m tying you to a chair and forcing you to watch them. Hunter has taught me some interesting knots.\u201d</p><p>What kind of people were they, openly discussing spanking and bondage? She sent Tyler a questioning glance. He just smiled in a way that didn\u2019t give her any comfort.</p><p>A moment later, a booming growl sounded from the front part of the house. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>A big hulk of a blond man bounded into the kitchen, holding a little boy just a bit older than Seth very comfortably in one beefy arm. Lord, at nearly thirty pounds, lugging her baby around took a lot of her strength. Yet this man didn\u2019t seem to require any effort to cradle his son, a veritable mini-me of the man himself.</p><p>\u201cCheck this out, Deke.\u201d Kimber sent a meaningful glance at Seth, still being fed and cooed by Alyssa and Tara.</p> <p>The big, blond man\u2019s gaze followed Kimber\u2019s, then his jaw dropped. \u201cHoly shit! Um . . . shoot.\u201d</p><p>Tyler crossed his arms over his chest, looking more pleased by the second. What was up with that?</p><p>\u201cHe looks just like you, man.\u201d Deke motioned to Seth.</p><p>\u201cThe way our son looks like you?\u201d Kimber rushed over to pick up the boy in Deke\u2019s arms. \u201cHi, Caleb. Miss Mommy? I missed you.\u201d</p><p>The little boy just smiled at the gorgeous woman, then giggled when she lifted his little race-car T-shirt and kissed his belly.</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this an interesting turn of events?\u201d came a voice from the doorway.</p><p>Del whipped around to face another man who\u2019d sauntered into the room and propped himself against the wall. Dark hair, equally dark eyes, a serious sense of leashed power. He wasn\u2019t someone to fuck with. She got that instantly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it, Jack?\u201d Tyler agreed.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait to hear these details.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know who all these nosy strangers in Tyler\u2019s business were, but she didn\u2019t like the feeling that he suddenly had a whole team of people on his side\u2014a virtual family at his back\u2014while she had no one. As usual.</p><p>Since the whole room seemed focused on Jack, as if waiting for a cue, she decided to nip this in the bud now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Delaney Catalano.\u201d She approached Jack with hand outstretched. \u201cThe boy is my son, Seth. It\u2019s great to meet you. I really have to talk to Tyler privately. Not to be rude, but would you mind leaving and taking everyone with you?\u201d</p><p>Jack took her hand and shook it. \u201cNice to meet you, too. Tyler, you good here?\u201d</p><p>Tyler sent her an unreadable gaze. \u201cMaybe you could hang here for just a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sweat.\u201d Jack approached the pregnant redhead, dropped a kiss on her forehead as he stroked her little baby bump. \u201cHow are my two favorite people today?\u201d</p><p>Their mutual love and devotion was so painfully obvious, even ten feet away. Envy lashed through Del, and she looked away. So many times as her body had been expanding and changing during her pregnancy, she\u2019d wished for Tyler\u2019s comfort. Some sense of his approval or caring. Instead, she\u2019d been lugging boxes, wading into depressing divorce decrees . . . It had all turned out for the best, but welcoming a new life into hers should have been a happy time. Without Tyler, it had been bittersweet.</p><p>\u201cIs someone going to tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d Deke demanded. \u201cY\u2019all texted me for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Every eye in the room turned to her. Every face held an expectant expression. Delaney sighed. They weren\u2019t going to leave, and this was some kind of gang-up-on-the-stranger thing. Fine.</p><p>\u201cI have a dirtbag in L.A. trying to kill me. Really, the fewer people who know this the better, but since you\u2019re all standing here, waiting for me to spill my junk, there it is.\u201d</p><p>Jack raised a brow, then glanced at Tyler. \u201cDid you bring us here so she could hire us?\u201d</p><p>Del frowned. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and Deke are in the personal protection business, angel. And they\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, Jack drawled, \u201cYou\u2019re no slouch, either. The job offer is still open.\u201d</p><p>Deke shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s been too busy enjoying the . . . benefits of working for Alyssa too much for that. The scenery at a strip club is way better.\u201d</p><p>Figures. Del shook her head. She already knew Tyler had a long string of strippers on his beck-and-booty-call list. It didn\u2019t bother her, really. Well, not much. Besides, now that she had stretch marks and her clothes often smelled like baby vomit, there was no way she could compete, even if she wanted to.</p><p>Tyler shrugged. \u201cI might finally take you up on that offer, Jack.\u201d</p><p>The entire room froze. Apparently, this was big news. Whatever. She had herself and Seth to think about.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Jack nodded. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow is good.\u201d</p><p>Del approached Jack. \u201cLook, if you\u2019re in the personal protection business and done with your HR functions for the day, I might be interested in hiring you. I can\u2019t get my hands on my money until the guy trying to kill me is behind bars, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Jack\u2019s voice snapped with command. Then, with a deep breath, he eased his shoulders back, expanded his chest. He seemed to grow six inches in two seconds. His demeanor completely changed. Any hint of affable was gone.</p><p>Automatically, Del obeyed, closing her mouth. Then she frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, my love,\u201d Morgan murmured. \u201cUsing that voice on her . . . It\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll stay out of this, or you\u2019ll hear lots of that voice later. If not, as soon as this pregnancy is over, I have a new single tail with your name on it.\u201d</p><p>Morgan shivered and gave him a secretive smile.</p><p>Del didn\u2019t know exactly what a single tail was, but she was getting an idea. And Morgan seemed completely happy. Who the hell were Tyler\u2019s friends these days?</p><p>\u201cLook, Mister . . .\u201d What the hell was his last name?</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d he supplied.</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, I don\u2019t have time to stop. This man almost killed me and my son three days ago. I\u2019m leaving him here with Tyler for safekeeping. I\u2019d prefer to come home to Seth in one piece, and I could use your help doing it.\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced at Deke. They both turned to Tyler, who said nothing, but she sensed lots of silent communication.</p><p>\u201cLook, I get that you\u2019ve got your man code or whatever, but I\u2019d like to be a client. If you can\u2019t take the job, please refer me to someone who can.\u201d She heaved a frustrated sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be bitchy, but it\u2019s been a terrible few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClients by referral only. There\u2019s no one I can credibly recommend to you in Los Angeles. With my wife pregnant, I\u2019m not leaving town. Deke has his hands full with his family and existing caseload. However, our newest associate would be happy to help.\u201d Jack gestured to Tyler.</p><p>Damn it! That was Tyler\u2019s game, setting himself up to be her safety net.</p><p>Del shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s staying here with Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, your son looks like he\u2019s in really good hands.\u201d Jack nodded toward Alyssa and Tara fussing over Seth. Kimber had joined in, while Kata dug through the diaper bag and picked out some of his toys, to his squealing delight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving him with strangers.\u201d Even the thought made Del\u2019s heart stop.</p><p>\u201cNo one will ever suspect that the boy staying with Jack or Deke is Seth,\u201d Tyler pointed out. \u201cMy friends would protect him with their lives, and you know I don\u2019t say that lightly.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t, but that hardly meant that she was leaving her little man with people she\u2019d met ten minutes ago, especially when one was talking openly about whipping his wife. But Tyler could be stubborn as the day was long. The best way to deal with him wasn\u2019t to go through him, but around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>Tyler grabbed her shoulders. \u201cWill you? Really?\u201d</p><p>His touch was a shock. The feel of his fingers wrapped around her arms buzzed across her skin, singed through her body\u2014made her remember that night she needed to forget. She shrugged out of his grip. \u201cI said I would. Leave it.\u201d</p><p>He looked unsettled that she wouldn\u2019t allow his touch. No, pissed off. God, she didn\u2019t have the time or patience for this game that being near him played with her head. That part of her life was done, gone. She had to focus on taking down Carlson and keeping Seth alive. She and Tyler would work out his parental rights afterward.</p><p>\u201cDid someone say there\u2019s a hungry woman here who needs to be fed?\u201d Yet another voice rang out from the direction of the front door. It slammed a moment later.</p><p>Alyssa made a beeline for the arched opening to the kitchen and met a gorgeous man with hair like midnight silk hanging around his shoulders. \u201cHi, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar . . .\u201d He pressed a quick, demanding kiss on her mouth, hugging a beautiful blonde baby girl against his side, her wide blue eyes and curly, pale hair a soft riot framing a pouty little bow of a mouth.</p><p>Holding out her arms to the baby, Alyssa pulled the girl against her chest. \u201cHow\u2019s my little Chloe? You have a good day with Daddy?\u201d</p><p>Then the man raised his face and glanced across the room at her. Oh, wow. Was that really . . . \u201cLuc Traverson?\u201d</p><p>When she choked out the question, everyone laughed.</p><p>He rolled gorgeous dark eyes, then regarded her with a blinding smile. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I got a text that you\u2019re hungry?\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d come over here to cook food? For her? Del turned to Tyler. \u201cHe\u2019s married to your boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-boss, thank you very much,\u201d Jack clarified.</p><p>Tyler nodded. \u201cEx-boss, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who sent him here?\u201d Del asked. Was this real?</p><p>\u201cJack might have mentioned it when he called earlier, since I ignored the text from Tyler.\u201d Luc slung an arm around the svelte, sexy Alyssa.</p><p>\u201cSo you just . . . came over to cook for me?\u201d That astounded Del. A world-class chef with a growing TV and cookbook empire dropping everything to cook for a stranger? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd to see for myself the woman who gave birth to Tyler\u2019s son.\u201d Luc glanced at Seth. \u201cYep, dead ringer. But he\u2019s cuter than you, Tyler. Since you\u2019re not working for Alyssa anymore and clearly have your hands full, does this mean that you\u2019ll finally stop hitting on my wife?\u201d</p><p>Del\u2019s gaze zipped across the room to Alyssa. Instant jealousy bubbled in her gut. She tamped it down. Tyler wasn\u2019t hers, never had been, and this gorgeous blonde was absolutely his type. Tight dress, fuck-me mouth, stunningly gorgeous. Del felt ridiculously inadequate\u2014as if she needed any help in that department. Right now, she felt every minute of the two years since she\u2019d last had sex. Somehow, being mommy had allowed her to push aside that sexual part of herself. At the moment, she felt as sexless as cardboard.</p><p>Alyssa slapped Luc\u2019s arm. \u201cWould you stop causing trouble and cook?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and turned to the refrigerator. \u201cAnything you don\u2019t like, Delaney? That\u2019s your name, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY-yes. You don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019m honored, really. But I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou last ate when?\u201d Tyler cut in right beside her.</p><p>When had he inched that close?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m said I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the question, angel.\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice was soft but firm. She knew when he put his unyielding hat on, and this was one of those times. A meal wasn\u2019t worth an argument, especially when she needed it.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday at lunch. I split a sandwich with Seth.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stared at her like she\u2019d grown two heads. Suddenly, Kata rushed to pull out a chair from the table in the eat-in kitchen. Tyler shoved her into it. Alyssa pressed a water bottle into her hands, along with a hunk of cheese.</p><p>Del stopped arguing and ate it gratefully. If she was going to fight off Carlson, she\u2019d need her strength.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like bell peppers,\u201d she told Luc. \u201cI\u2019m allergic to shellfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also hates mustard and pickles,\u201d Tyler added, staring straight at her. \u201cCoffee with creamer only. Lightly toast everything. She has a real thing for strawberries.\u201d</p><p>His knowledge of her was intimate, and his direct green gaze challenged her to remember exactly how well he knew her. It was just food, but somehow Delaney felt as if he\u2019d opened her up again. She dropped her gaze to the slate tile beneath her feet, feeling her face heat up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the chair to her left scraped against the flooring, and she looked up to find Jack plopping down beside her. \u201cGo with Tyler. We\u2019ll watch Seth. Between Deke, Luc, and I, he\u2019ll be completely safe. We\u2019ll also do whatever investigating we can from here to support you. Tara over there is a whiz of an analyst. Come back to your son in one piece.\u201d</p><p>When Jack said it, the suggestion sounded reasonable . . . right up to the part where she had to leave her little boy with people she didn\u2019t really know. They seemed nice enough\u2014but seemed wasn\u2019t good enough for her. Only Tyler had a really vested interest in Seth\u2019s future and continued well-being.</p><p>Before she could answer, Luc set an omelet in front of her, filled with chunks of ham, spinach, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes. He\u2019d drizzled a light cheese sauce that smelled over-the-top heavenly. A piece of wheat bread, lightly toasted, and a handful of fresh strawberries sat to the side, along with a cup of creamed coffee. She now had a meal made by the Luc Traverson. Surreal . . .</p><p>Del inhaled deeply and almost fainted in bliss as she dug in. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with a kind smile that only made him more gorgeous. Alyssa was one lucky woman. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It would have been better, but . . .\u201d He turned to Tyler. \u201cGo to the grocery store and stock up. You eat like a five-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I had fresh fruits and vegetables. Sorry I don\u2019t keep foie gras and caviar for you, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so no love lost there. Yet . . . when Tyler needed help, Luc had come. They all had. Again, she was amazed by the incredible sense of family he had among all these people. Yes, they\u2019d rushed over to gawk at her and Seth, but they\u2019d stayed to help. God, she wished she had even half the support system he did, and she realized how much she\u2019d closed herself off from everyone after Tyler had gone, after her divorce. Del shook her head as she moaned around another bite. She\u2019d rectify these deficits in her life after this crap with Carlson was over.</p><p>Seth toddled over to her and plopped at her feet with one of his toys. Little Caleb followed, then Chloe wanted down to join in the fun. Del gnawed on her lower lip, then took her last bite of food. Seth missed his preschool, his friends. He was cranky without his routine, his naps, his fun time. Guilt pounded her. For the millionth time, she wished she could make all this go away for him. For them.</p> <p>And none of these thoughts did her a damn bit of good.</p><p>After wiping her mouth with her napkin, she set it down. \u201cI\u2019m stuffed. Thank you, Mr. Traverson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuc,\u201d he corrected. Then the chef looked at his wife. \u201cReady to head home?\u201d</p><p>Alyssa nodded, and within moments, they were gone. Tara and Kata left directly behind them with a friendly wave and air kisses for Seth, followed by Deke and Kimber. Jack and Morgan loitered for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDeke and I will be around later to discuss our plan of action. We\u2019re going to help you. And you need to trust that Tyler is going to do everything to fix your problem. Listen to him; he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>That sounded an awful lot like an order. Given his profession, it wasn\u2019t a stretch to guess that he\u2019d either been military or law enforcement in the past. But she didn\u2019t work for him, and she wasn\u2019t about to just fall in line with his plans. She had the solution worked out in her head\u2014one that didn\u2019t risk both of Seth\u2019s parents and leave him with strangers.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your opinion, but this is my son and my life. I have to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe understand.\u201d Morgan patted Tyler\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a tough cookie there. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>With that, the couple departed, leaving her alone with Tyler, who sent her an unfathomable stare. His cop stare. God, she hated it when she couldn\u2019t read him.</p><p>Seth\u2019s childish noises faded to the background. The air turned thick. Crap, why was her heart beating faster?</p><p>Tyler leaned over her, bracing his hands on the back of her chair and crowding his way into her personal space. His ridged abdomen, apparent through his tight T-shirt, was right in her line of vision. She didn\u2019t dare drop her gaze lower to see if she had any effect on him. She wanted to . . . Instead, she tipped her head back to glare up at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, angel . . . let\u2019s talk about how this is going to go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>DEL swallowed at Tyler\u2019s nearness. God, for years she\u2019d basically crawled on his lap and never thought of him as more than a pal. One night had completely rewired her body and left her painfully attuned to him. Shoving the thought aside, she planted her palms against the corrugated expanse of his stomach and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cNo, here\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go, Tyler. Seth and I are going to take a shower. Then you can read to him, if you like. After that, he and I are going to sleep. If you don\u2019t have a spare bed, I\u2019ll go find a motel and see you tomorrow, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a spare bed. You\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Because it suited Del\u2019s plans, she didn\u2019t argue. \u201cFine. Thank you. As long as you understand . . . you keep your distance, and I\u2019ll keep mine.\u201d</p><p>Tyler clenched his jaw. \u201cDamn it, Del. I didn\u2019t hurt you the night that we . . . made love.\u201d</p><p>Physically, no. It would almost be easier if he had. Instead, he\u2019d given her one amazing climax after another, tripping her over the edge of pleasure in ways she\u2019d never even conceived of. Certainly in ways that Eric had never managed.</p><p>But she wanted to throw his words back in his face and point out that he had other ways to hurt people besides physically. The seeming ease with which he\u2019d left her without a backward glance had been damn painful, especially after she\u2019d realized how badly she needed Tyler. It hurt more now to realize that, since they\u2019d parted, he\u2019d been getting busy with his usual bevy of strippers and easy lays. Not that she was surprised, but . . . had he thought about her at all?</p><p>She shoved the question aside. It wasn\u2019t his fault that she cared about him more, that not having even a small part of his heart crushed her. In truth, when Tyler had left, he\u2019d only done what she\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you now,\u201d he added into the silence.</p><p>Because I won\u2019t let you. \u201cI\u2019ll come find you when Seth is ready for his story.\u201d</p><p>Tyler hesitated, his green eyes probing. For what? A chink in her armor? Any hint that she wanted him? A sign that she hated him? Maybe she was reading too much into it. At the end of the day, she\u2019d been another piece of ass to him\u2014one careless enough to get pregnant. He was more concerned about Seth, as he should be. She needed to forget whatever emotions might have been between them and move on.</p><p>Finally, he nodded. \u201cTowels are under the bathroom sink. Shampoo and soap are in the shower. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>With that, he was gone, grabbing for the phone at his belt before he\u2019d even left the room. Probably going to confer with Jack or Deke again.</p><p>Del sighed. It didn\u2019t matter if he was mad. Seth mattered. No guilt, move on. She\u2019d functioned like that since her divorce\u2014or tried. It was a good motto now, too.</p><p>She picked Seth up. He fussed at being separated from his toys, so she also selected a little plastic football he could play with in the shower, which calmed him down.</p><p>Minutes later, she stood under the hot spray, letting Seth play at her feet while she washed herself and her hair. She\u2019d even found a fresh razor in the top drawer and availed herself of it. After a final rinse, she almost felt human. Then she quickly scrubbed Seth, working around his little football until he was clean.</p><p>As soon as she pulled back the shower curtain and emerged, she noticed that her duffel was missing. The last of her toiletries and clothing. Tyler, that rat, had sneaked in here while she\u2019d bathed and taken her stuff?</p><p>Wrapping a towel around herself and setting Seth on another, she stormed out the door. \u201cTyler, goddamn it!\u201d</p><p>Moments later, she heard the hum of the washing machine, saw him prowling through the bag and setting aside a diaper and pajamas for Seth.</p><p>He spun and eyed her with a stare that heated so quickly, she clutched the towel even tighter to her chest and took a step back.</p><p>Why the hell was he looking at her like that?</p><p>Water dripped from the ends of her hair, over her shoulders, down her arms. The air-conditioning kicked on. Her nipples beaded under the thin towel. And those green eyes of his zeroed in, staring unabashedly.</p><p>Delaney sucked in a breath. A quick glance down proved his erection packed the front of his jeans. She remembered every inch of the reason he\u2019d stretched her almost painfully when he\u2019d entered her and left her deliciously sore the next day.</p><p>\u201cNo. Do not go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d He tried to look innocent.</p><p>Tyler innocent? She stifled a snort. When he\u2019d been four. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cStop with the . . . sexy glances. Why did you take my bag?\u201d</p><p>Tyler suppressed a smile and held out Seth\u2019s things. \u201cJust trying to help. I took the clothes in the baggie that I presumed were dirty and started washing them. You don\u2019t have a gun in your luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to get Seth out of the way before I brought out the firepower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were followed? What if someone had attacked you?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought of it, but still didn\u2019t feel as proficient with a pistol as she\u2019d like, certainly not good enough to carry it around and make it actually threatening. \u201cI rarely got out of the rental car, but I was afraid if I had a gun \u2018handy,\u2019 that it would be too easy for someone to turn it against me. You know that\u2019s what happens statistically.\u201d</p><p>Tyler ambled closer and rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m going to adjust your comfort level with firearms first chance we get, angel. You don\u2019t get to say no.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Del wanted to balk. She didn\u2019t like guns. In that moment, she didn\u2019t like Tyler, either. But he was right. It was for her own good\u2014and Seth\u2019s. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He lifted some of the damp ends of her hair between his fingers and rubbed, his gaze delving deep into her.</p><p>For a second, Del couldn\u2019t breathe, and she fell back in time, Memorial Day weekend two years ago. The hint of summer, the smell of beer, the laughter . . . then the feel of Tyler\u2019s hands peeling off her clothing, his cock burying deep inside her as Eric\u2019s eyes darkened with arousal.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Tyler murmured, his thumb brushing softly across her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came to me. I wish you\u2019d come sooner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her belly knotted, and her breathing turned shallow. Unless she wanted to fall into his arms and repeat her mistake all over again, she needed to pull away.</p><p>She stepped back, forcing nonchalance. \u201cWe\u2019ve both moved on.\u201d</p><p>Anger tightened Tyler\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not letting Seth out of my life again.\u201d</p><p>Her first instinct was to argue. Where the hell had he been for the last two years? But that was unfair; she\u2019d sent him away. And she had to put Seth first. \u201cHe\u2019d benefit from a father figure. We can work together on visitation. I don\u2019t need child support.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler grabbed her arm and dragged her closer. \u201cStubborn woman. Don\u2019t doubt that we\u2019re going to work this out. Every last detail.\u201d</p><p>He meant that, and his adamancy surprised her. \u201cNever took you for the fatherly type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne look at his face changed everything for me, Del.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue that. The entire stretch of her pregnancy, she\u2019d felt disassociated from the fact that a child was growing inside her and focused on how this would further affect her job, her body, her life. The moment she set eyes on Seth\u2019s face, he\u2019d become the most important priority, hands down. As far as she\u2019d been concerned, everything else would work itself out.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen the timing is better, I want to hear about every moment I missed.\u201d</p><p>A part of her tried to hate him for wanting to be so involved, as if he\u2019d implied that she wasn\u2019t a good enough parent all by herself. Another part of her was so damn touched that he cared about their child. She swallowed back tears. It had been a long time since she hadn\u2019t felt alone. Allowing herself to feel at all close to Tyler was dangerous for her on so many levels . . . She stepped back.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Seth, wailing his displeasure, toddled around the corner, dragging his bath towel. Del ran for him, trying to juggle her own towel and get a free hand to pick up her son. Tyler beat her to it, scooping him up against his broad chest and dusting a kiss on his ruddy cheek.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get dressed for bed, Spidey.\u201d</p><p>Seth patted Tyler\u2019s face and smiled.</p> <p>Del couldn\u2019t help it; her heart melted. They looked so very much alike. Seeing the affection beginning to bring them together choked her up. She turned away.</p><p>\u201cWe got this,\u201d Tyler insisted. \u201cGo get yourself ready for bed. And take this with you.\u201d</p><p>Reaching into his back pocket, he withdrew a big gray T-shirt that said LOUISIANA CAJUN COUNTRY, with a cartoon of a bearded man riding an alligator next to a tiny rowboat, holding a shotgun.</p><p>It was one of the ugliest things she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cTo sleep in?</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He slanted her a considering glance. \u201cUnless you still sleep naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sleeping attire is irrelevant. Thank you.\u201d She plucked the shirt from his grasp, then turned away without another word.</p><p>Back in the bathroom, she shut and locked the door, blinking furiously and trying to bring her breathing back under control. But Tyler\u2019s scent, all woodsy and male with something so vital, lingered on the shirt. He was like smelling pure testosterone. And she had no choice but to wear the damn thing. With her bag elsewhere, it was this or the towel.</p><p>With a dusting of hand lotion and finger combing her hair, she whipped the shirt over her head\u2014and went weak-kneed. God, his smell enveloped her, was all over her\u2014right under her nose, against her breasts, skimming down her abdomen to her thighs, brushing her pussy as she straightened and opened the bathroom door again. With every step, she felt that shirt against her skin, like he surrounded her.</p> <p>No way could she sleep in this without going insane. Tyler had been potent the night he\u2019d gotten deep inside her, and she\u2019d reveled in his heady, masculine scent.</p><p>It was twenty times worse now because she knew exactly what she was missing.</p><p>Shoving the thought aside, she pushed out of the bathroom, made her way to the kitchen\u2014and stopped short.</p><p>Tyler sat on a barstool with a beer in one hand, the other wrapped around Seth, now dressed in a fresh diaper and clean pajamas. He\u2019d perched his son on his lap and was reading one of Seth\u2019s favorites books about animals at a barnyard dance. Her baby boy was all smiles and turned to look up at Tyler with wonder, as if he recognized someone important and special.</p><p>Tears hit her eyes like a pickax. Damn, what was wrong with her tonight? She\u2019d known that coming here and facing her past would be emotional. She\u2019d had no idea what sort of reaction to expect from Tyler\u2014but this was almost as sweet as her wildest dreams. On top of all the danger, adrenaline, and sleeplessness, Del felt her emotions crashing off a cliff.</p><p>Without missing a beat, Tyler finished the book and closed it, then handed Seth to her and hopped off the barstool.</p><p>\u201cGive Mommy a hug,\u201d he told the boy.</p><p>Seth threw his chubby little arms tightly around her neck and squeezed. Del came apart, clutching her little boy tightly against her as she tried to hold the sobs in.</p><p>Her little boy pressed a sloppy little kiss near her mouth before Tyler gently pulled Seth away and wrapped an arm around her waist, bringing her tight against his chest. He felt so solid and alive. His heart beat loud and strong under her ear. More of his forestlike scent surrounded her, and Del realized this was the first time she hadn\u2019t been terrified since . . . that night.</p><p>\u201cLet it out, angel. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed against him once, twice. God, how easy would it be to lean on him. And how unfair.</p><p>Stepping back with a shake of her head, she swiped away the scalding tears. \u201cNo. My problems. My cross to bear. I\u2019d just be grateful if you\u2019d take care of Seth for me. I\u2019d die if anything happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be fine. So are you. Deep breath.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a shuddering breath, then let it out, already feeling better. But she\u2019d be lying if she said she didn\u2019t miss Tyler\u2019s warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s all ready,\u201d a booming voice called from the archway behind her.</p><p>Del gasped and spun around, pulling her T-shirt down. She was acutely aware of the fact that, since Tyler had swiped her bag, she\u2019d had no panties and wasn\u2019t wearing any now. The shirt covered her ass and then some, but . . .</p><p>Deke strolled in, looking like he was suppressing a grin. \u201cDid I interrupt something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so hopeful, pervert.\u201d Tyler crossed the kitchen to the refrigerator and threw Deke a beer. \u201cAny trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Slick as butter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>What the hell were they talking about?</p><p>\u201cCan you give us a second?\u201d Tyler asked his buddy.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Deke twisted the top off his beer with a beefy fist, then tossed the cap in the garbage. \u201cI\u2019ll plop in front of the TV. There\u2019s a basketball game with my name on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>With that, Deke whipped past them and into the family room. Tyler held Seth in the cradle of one arm, biceps bulging. Del tried not to notice as she swept past him and grabbed her duffel bag off the counter with one hand, holding her T-shirt down with the other.</p><p>Tyler suppressed a smile. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Del followed. A part of her wanted nothing more than to get away from him. But she\u2019d be gone soon enough. If he wanted to talk to her, she owed him that.</p><p>Pulling her comb out of the bag, she dragged it through her hair quickly, then stashed it as she followed him out of the room and down the hall. When they arrived at his guest room, she saw a playpen set up in the corner with a colorful blanket and one of Seth\u2019s toys.</p><p>The sight stunned her. \u201cYou did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Deke. He brought it over and set it up since Caleb isn\u2019t using it now. Kimber and Alyssa both sent over some foods their kids like, along with extra diapers. Kata and Tara are promising to go on a shopping spree tomorrow for Seth, so if he needs more clothes or toys, just make a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any more money with me.\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cWould you stop trying to do every goddamn thing on your own? He\u2019s my son, too.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d offended him, damn it. Del sighed and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cSorry. Habit. What did you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going off alone. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let you throw yourself into danger that\u2019s over your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re what, five feet five, maybe? And a hundred twenty pounds, dripping wet? But you\u2019re going to single-handedly fight off a ruthlessly ambitious ADA trying to have you killed and the gangland assassin trained to do it? Are you listening to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight them with my bare hands. I\u2019m just going to dig up evidence and write a solid story that will expose Carlson for the creep he is. I need to do it fast. Word on the street is that he\u2019s going to run for district attorney. If he does and wins, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to indict himself. We\u2019ve already established that I might be the only person standing in his way. He isn\u2019t going to let this go.\u201d</p><p>Tyler kissed Seth\u2019s head, then held the boy out for her to do the same. Del scooped him up and inhaled his familiar soapy, boyish smell, wondering if this would be the last time she held him. Her heart tripped, stopped\u2014then started breaking at the thought.</p><p>Before she could change her mind, she maneuvered to the far side of the playpen and set Seth inside. Already, he rubbed his eyes. When he saw one of his favorite plush toys, shaped like a tow truck with a smiley face, he grabbed it, tucked it against his body, and closed his eyes with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t talk in here without keeping him awake,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>With a glance at Seth, Tyler nodded and held out his hand to her. Del glanced at her duffel. She really should wear underwear to any conversation she was going to have with Tyler. Then again, if he truly wanted her out of them, she\u2019d already be naked and flat on her back in the middle of his bed. He was that good.</p><p>But now, he was merely speaking to her as a concerned friend, the mother of his son. That look he\u2019d given her earlier . . . well, she\u2019d cut him off. Since then, he\u2019d respected her boundary. Mostly.</p><p>Silently, he led her down the hall, around the corner, and into his bedroom. He shut the door, and she stiffened.</p><p>\u201cIf Seth starts crying, I can\u2019t hear him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make this fast and agree that you can\u2019t fight this battle alone. I won\u2019t let you do it, Delaney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this harder than it already is. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m looking forward to leaving Seth, much less with a father he barely knows. But he and I have no future if I don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Tyler advanced on her, growling with anger. \u201cYou may well wind up dead if you try to play the hero all by yourself. Like I asked before, what the fuck do you know about taking down a corrupt public official and evading a street killer?\u201d</p><p>Delaney swallowed. God, he was big. She\u2019d forgotten just how tall and solid and male he was. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run into the city with flashing lights and announce my presence with a bullhorn or try to single-handedly round up the bad guys with guns blazing. I just need to collect a little more proof, and as long as they don\u2019t know I\u2019m back in town, it shouldn\u2019t be too dangerous. In the last week, I\u2019ve learned how to lay low, disguise myself. Maybe I\u2019ll hire a PI in L.A. to help me. I\u2019ll think of something. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>Tyler stalked even closer. \u201cBeing too brave for the situation is. Goddamn it, I\u2019m angry with you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m leaving you with a kid you don\u2019t know and aren\u2019t prepared for? Forgive me, but I don\u2019t have more appealing options. Even if he\u2019s your son, do you think it was easy to come here and ask for your help?\u201d</p><p>As soon as she said the words, she knew she was being unfair. Nothing he\u2019d said or done since she\u2019d arrived indicated he was less than thrilled with having Seth here. But the alternative, admitting that Tyler\u2019s anger was wrapped up in concern for her, was too sweet to bear. A tiny part of her would love to lean on him and let him fix all her problems. She couldn\u2019t do that to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m happy Seth is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just . . . so tired. I haven\u2019t slept in days.\u201d And she was making a bad situation worse. That had to stop. No one liked a bitch.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. I wish to fuck you\u2019d come here about . . . oh, twenty-three months ago. What I\u2019m saying is that, even if you think you\u2019re just fact-finding, it\u2019s potentially dangerous. You\u2019re not equipped for the kind of threat you\u2019re going to be facing. You need to let Deke and Kimber or Luc and Alyssa keep Seth while I go with you to fight these fuckers.\u201d</p><p>It was so tempting to give in and have his strong, comforting presence beside her. But she couldn\u2019t accomplish her task if she was worried about Seth. Tyler might be a playboy, but he was also a protector. No way would he let anything happen to their son, and that would give her the reassurance and strength to do what she must. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease, let me go. I know best, really. If you\u2019ll just . . . do this for me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean leave you now when you need me most, just like I did after I touched every inch of your body and got deeper inside you than any man ever has? Leave again, simply because you asked me to? Because you think you know best?\u201d</p><p>Tyler advanced even closer, and suddenly, his bedroom door was at her back. He planted both of his large hands on either side of her head and leaned in. Her heart picked up speed viciously. That woodsy, testosterone-oozing scent swamped Delaney, and her legs trembled beneath her. She flattened herself against the door . . . but Tyler kept coming closer, leaning in, his green gaze darkening, drilling into her.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you think me listening to you worked out last time?\u201d he challenged.</p> <p>Terribly. Eric had eventually screamed that Tyler slinking off only made him wonder how long they\u2019d been fucking each other. Her protestations otherwise had fallen on completely deaf ears. The positive pregnancy test had been the death knell of their marriage. By then, Tyler had been long gone, and she\u2019d missed him so much. But . . .</p><p>Delaney closed her eyes. \u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s worse. Seth could lose you for the rest of his little life. I could lose you forever instead of for two years. Not happening, angel. Last time I saw you, I listened to you about everything. This time? It\u2019s my way.\u201d</p><p>Tyler cradled her face in his big hands. His stare zeroed in on her mouth. He pressed the length of his body against hers. The thin T-shirt she wore did nothing to protect her from the blistering heat of his body. He notched his heavy, steely erection against her mound. Delaney\u2019s heart stuttered.</p><p>And then his lips hovered right above hers, his head cocking to the side as his gaze ensnared her. He lowered his mouth so, so close. She curled her fingers into fists at her sides so that she didn\u2019t wrap her arms around him, her legs around him, and beg for everything he could give her\u2014safety, comfort . . . feverish desire, shattering pleasure.</p> <p>He exhaled against her mouth, parted his lips. God, she couldn\u2019t breathe. Already, she wanted him desperately. Her heart pounded. Her pussy ached. If he kissed her, it would only make everything ten times more difficult.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He hesitated, dropped his head near her ear. \u201cMy way, Del.\u201d</p><p>Then Tyler nipped at her lobe with his teeth. A shiver wound through her, all the way to her toes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get in another breath before Tyler\u2019s lips took hers, at first hungry but searching, as if testing his reception. The past, his long list of conquests, the pain between them\u2014all instantly obliterated in the comfort of his solid embrace. His aching familiarity. His seductive kiss. There was no way she could stop the welcome bubbling inside her. Her lips turned pliant, yearning.</p><p>An instant later, Tyler groaned, bulldozing his way into her mouth. His heat crashed over her, inside her, surging low in her belly\u2014then spearing deep between her thighs. The warmth of his breath as he seized her mouth and shoved her lips farther apart with his own burned her up. His arms twisted around her body, jacking her tight against the inferno of his taut muscles and steely cock.</p> <p>She gasped into his mouth. He went deeper, even as his palm worked under her shirt, branding the suddenly feverish skin of her back, holding her against him without a breath of air between them.</p><p>Without conscious thought, she whimpered, her body melting into his, hands fisting his T-shirt, then clutching his shoulders to drag him closer. She opened wider for the hot thrust of his kiss. Needed it. Tyler gave it to her, then grabbed her thigh in one hand, slung it over his hip, and pressed harder against the needy flesh throbbing between her legs. She moaned.</p><p>Then Del caught herself.</p><p>No, no, no . . . Please let the response shimmering inside her be like a mirage on a hot highway, glimmering with promise. Not real.</p><p>Because if it was, she was in a whole world of trouble.</p><p>But it felt all too genuine, too intense. It had been so long since she\u2019d experienced the tug and pull of attraction, that agonizing want making her sink against a man\u2019s body.</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t the time to be distracted. Her life\u2014and her son\u2019s\u2014were on the line.</p><p>Delaney tore her lips from his and turned her head away. She\u2019d love to push him aside and tell him that he didn\u2019t affect her in the least. But her trembling and panting were dead giveaways, along with her heart galloping madly in her chest. Tyler wasn\u2019t stupid or blind. His stare was all over her, weighty and scorching, cataloging her reactions. Her breath hitched at the thought. Her only consolation was that he was breathing hard, too.</p> <p>Don\u2019t let him kiss me again. If he laid his lips on her now, she\u2019d be toast.</p><p>Gently, he tucked a finger under her chin and forced her to look at him. \u201cDel?\u201d</p><p>What the hell did he want her to say? Was he looking for permission to continue?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his jaw ticced. \u201cWhy did you come to me? Honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had nowhere else to turn. Please don\u2019t make me regret it. Just . . . watch Seth for me. I\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>With that, she twisted out from beneath the solid warmth of his body and turned, yanking frantically at the doorknob. Damn it, she had to get free before she did something with Tyler that she\u2019d regret.</p><p>With a low curse, he stepped back and let her go. Then she was in the hall, running toward the guest room as if she was on fire.</p><p>Because she was, and Tyler had done that to her with a single kiss. Del had no illusions; he\u2019d let her leave his bedroom because he\u2019d chosen to. If he ever decided to put his hands on her again, chances were he wouldn\u2019t release her until they were both utterly sated\u2014because she feared that she wouldn\u2019t be able to find the willpower to say no.</p><p>WHAT the hell was going through his head? Tyler winced. He knew the answer to that question, and it wasn\u2019t G-rated. Damn it, Delaney flipped his switch in a way it hadn\u2019t been turned on in forever. Why was it that one reluctant kiss from her had been better than any blow job he\u2019d gotten from Alyssa\u2019s girls? It was more than the addicting flavor of her kiss, more than the feel of her pussy against his denim-covered cock, getting hotter with each second.</p><p>As he watched Del\u2019s sweet little ass sway down the hall while she sprinted back to safety, he started asking himself some hard questions. Why had he kissed a woman who\u2019d said \u201cno\u201d? For the same reason her quick little breaths and hungry eyes got to him. He wanted her\u2014bad. Beyond sense. Beyond scruples. After he\u2019d gotten over the initial shock of seeing her at his door and knowing that he\u2019d fathered a son on her, desire had settled in, vicious and unrelenting.</p><p>Why?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to delve too hard for the answer.</p><p>His dick couldn\u2019t seem to think past the fact that he\u2019d pinned her against his bedroom door and felt every inch of her soft body against him, her shy little tongue touching his before retreating, her pert nipples hardening against his chest. And Jesus, those little gasps and whimpers? He groaned and swiped a hand across his face.</p><p>If this had been strictly about desire, he\u2019d be okay. He\u2019d rip his jeans off, take himself in hand, and settle matters quick. He\u2019d done it many times in his life. But right now, his own hand wasn\u2019t going to do a damn thing to cool the throbbing settling deep in his cock. It wanted to fuck. Hard. Now. Until he was exhausted. And no one except Delaney would do.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>With a sigh, Tyler sat on the edge of his bed. It wasn\u2019t wanting her that agitated him. Desire was easy. What he felt for her was far more complex.</p><p>Drawing in a shuddering breath, Tyler adjusted his hard dick in his jeans, willing his erection to subside. The last thing he wanted was a verbal ribbing from Deke.</p><p>Finally under some control, he stalked back to the den, TV blaring a Dallas Mavericks game. Feeling itchy, edgy, he plopped down on the dark leather sofa next to Deke.</p><p>\u201cI saw Delaney race back to her room like her ass was on fire. I take it you kindled that?\u201d</p><p>Was this his way of meddling? \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p><p>Deke barked out a superior laugh. \u201cYou got it bad, you poor bastard. And she\u2019s trying hard to hate your guts right now.\u201d</p><p>Tell me something I don\u2019t know. Tyler gave his buddy the finger.</p><p>It only made Deke laugh again. Then he slowly sobered and glanced at his cell phone. \u201cI need to keep Kimber in the loop. How long do you think it\u2019s going to take Delaney to run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours. She\u2019s going to wait until she thinks I\u2019m good and asleep before she makes a move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should pretend to hit the sack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan. I\u2019ll crash on the couch. She\u2019ll have no idea I\u2019m here. But . . . can we wait just a few minutes? This game is getting good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Tyler tried to get interested. Instead, he stared sightlessly at the TV, everything swimming before his eyes as he remembered another hot May evening . . .</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Los Angeles\u2014two years earlier</p><p>\u201cWHY\u2019D you knock? It\u2019ll take me two weeks to answer the door. I unlocked it a few minutes ago. Just come in.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his friend\u2019s voice, Tyler entered the house with his key. Eric sat in his wheelchair as he had every day for the last three months, since the fucking suspect Tyler had been chasing sneaked up on Eric and capped a cheap shot in his back, grazing his spine and paralyzing him from the waist down. The doctors hoped the injury was temporary. But maybe not. The good news was, for the first time in forever, Eric looked clean, healthy, freshly shaved. Almost happy, given the grin stretching across his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here with beer, as promised.\u201d Tyler held up a twelve-pack.</p><p>Eric rubbed his hands together, his dark brows rising. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice appetizer, but tell me you brought something harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, did I neglect to mention the Jack?\u201d Tyler grinned, then pulled a half gallon of whiskey from behind his back.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Eric wheeled himself into the living room, then motioned Tyler to follow. \u201cIce that shit down and let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Del?\u201d He looked around the little character Craftsman house she and Eric had bought last year, shortly after their first anniversary.</p><p>\u201cOn her way. I can\u2019t believe you both took the whole weekend off.\u201d Eric stuck out his hand. \u201cThanks, man. For everything. For saving my life after the shooting, for being there during the surgery, for taking care of the yard since I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tyler shook his hand. \u201cHey, you\u2019d do the same for me. We\u2019ve walked through fire together. I\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>Eric nodded, his dark hair groomed for once. It was even short again, like he\u2019d had a trim. Tyler hoped to God that meant that he was finally ready to stop being angry with the world and get on with his life. Even if he couldn\u2019t return to Vice, even if he never walked again, Del needed him to start recovering mentally and be the guy he\u2019d been before the shooting. Caring for a man so lost in self-pity and depression weighed on her. She\u2019d been so busy meeting Eric\u2019s needs that she hadn\u2019t seen to any of her own. She\u2019d lost sleep, lost weight. Tyler tried to shoulder as much as he could for her, but the stubborn woman kept insisting that she was fine.</p><p>They\u2019d all been looking forward to this long Memorial Day weekend. Tyler handed Eric a beer, hoping this would be Eric\u2019s turning point. Then he grabbed a cold one himself.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you quit the force.\u201d Eric sounded genuinely regretful. \u201cI feel responsible.\u201d</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t regret it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same without you. That new partner they tried to give me was all kinds of gaping asshole. The PI gig is a nice change, being your own boss, making your own hours. Some days with the force, I just felt helpless. Too much case load, bureaucracy, and red tape. So many douche bags on the street, willing to roll over an innocent for fun and cash. So little justice for victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you hated that part of the job. I guess I kind of accepted that it came with the territory. I\u2019m not sure that always made me the best cop.\u201d Eric shrugged. \u201cBut that\u2019s irrelevant now. I\u2019m not going anywhere anymore.\u201d</p><p>At Eric\u2019s uncomfortable laugh, Tyler tried not to wince. Maybe Eric wasn\u2019t moving on, after all. The guy needed to be more positive about his future. The doctor had given him a 50 percent chance of rehabbing back to normal. His loss of functionality might only be the result of swelling where the bullet embedded near his spine, near thoracolumbar vertebrae eleven and twelve. At worst, the nerve damage was minimal. In that case, he\u2019d probably never do anything more than work a desk again, but he might walk. In the back of his mind, Tyler wondered why Eric wasn\u2019t happier to be alive and have a wife who still loved him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A thousand times, Tyler had wondered why he hadn\u2019t been the one to take the bullet. No one in his family gave a shit about him. Sometimes, he felt guilty for still walking, for being whole, while Eric was stuck in a wheelchair. If only they\u2019d waited for backup . . .</p><p>\u201cYou will. You\u2019re recovering.\u201d Tyler tried to sound positive, then took another sip of his beer. He had to keep Eric thinking happy thoughts, looking forward to the future. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re up again, maybe you should tell Captain Rogers to fuck himself and come work for me. I follow a lot of cheating spouses and shit, but I also help people. Just this week, I think I found a guy\u2019s long-lost, runaway sister. He hasn\u2019t seen her in almost fifteen years. It\u2019s a good feeling to put families back together. Tell me you don\u2019t want to be a part of that and keep more of the pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChasing cheating spouses sounds crappy.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and seeing all the infidelity had put Tyler off of marriage. Not that he\u2019d been a deep believer in the institution before. God knows, his parents had sucked at it before his father split. Eric hadn\u2019t been perfect, either.</p> <p>Tyler took another sip of beer. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have Rogers yelling at me, and it pays the bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the cheating cases are cheap entertainment, too. Like free porn, eh, man?\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, the back door opened. \u201cIf you two are swapping porn collections, I\u2019m going shopping.\u201d</p><p>Del breezed in, wearing a beige pencil skirt that hugged the slender curve of her hips, a silk blouse in a shade of blue that reminded him of a male peacock\u2019s feathers, and shiny black high heels. The latter she stripped off the second she cleared the kitchen. Then she spotted them sucking down brews and doubled back to the kitchen, pulling the pins out of her glossy, mahogany hair as she went.</p><p>When she emerged again, she clutched a beer and handed it to him with a pleading look. After Tyler twisted off the cap for her, she downed a long sip with a groan. \u201cGod, that tastes like Friday. Thanks.\u201d Then she turned her smile on Eric. \u201cHi, handsome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, gorgeous.\u201d Eric turned on his megawatt smile, flashing white teeth against that dark Italian skin of his. That smile had persuaded more than one girl to part with her panties in the five years they\u2019d been partners. If Eric had been fully functional, Del would likely have gotten some action tonight.</p><p>But neither of them had been remotely sexual since the shooting. Tyler knew it bugged the shit out of Eric. The guy flat loved fucking, the raunchier, the better. He\u2019d drunkenly confessed once that Del wasn\u2019t that into sex. Glancing her way, Tyler thought that was a shame. She definitely had all the right curves in all the right places. A damn pretty girl. But more, she gave off this vibe . . . subtle, but undeniably sensual. Teasing. Then again, part of her appeal for Tyler was that she was off limits. Sure, he\u2019d been attracted to Del when he\u2019d first met her, but she was Eric\u2019s. Tyler refused to break the buddy code for a woman, no matter how appealing.</p><p>For the last two years, he\u2019d put all sexual thoughts of her aside\u2014well, as many as he could\u2014and regarded her as a good friend he drank beer and watched TV with . . . who also happened to have a great rack. Since then, they\u2019d established a great platonic connection. He\u2019d never been friends with a female and was surprised that he actually enjoyed spending time with her, even without the sex.</p><p>Delaney turned to him, eyes narrowed. \u201cYou started drinking without me. How many beers do I have to drink to catch up?\u201d</p><p>She would absolutely keep up with the boys if he challenged her. She had determination and grit. He liked that about her. It had seen her through the darkest days of Eric\u2019s recovery.</p><p>\u201cNot telling. You\u2019d better change clothes and get started if you have any prayer of lapping us in the alcohol department.\u201d</p> <p>With a little mock pout, she stuck out her tongue and flounced away. Tyler laughed and swatted her ass. \u201cMove faster.\u201d</p><p>When she rubbed her offended cheek, Eric laughed deep and loud. It was great to hear the sound. Even Del glanced over her shoulder with a grateful smile.</p><p>Relief flowed through him, almost peaceful, at seeing the couple on a more even keel. These were the people he knew\u2014happy, teasing\u2014not the gloom-and-doom grouch bringing down the end-of-her-rope worrywart.</p><p>This weekend was going to be good, for all of them. For Eric\u2019s sake, he\u2019d glossed over the fact that PI work could be boring. Finding a missing woman in Lafayette, Louisiana, had been the only interesting case he\u2019d taken since starting his business a few months back. He\u2019d have to go out there next week and sew the case up. Maybe a change of scenery would be good. Lately, he\u2019d felt really . . . unsettled, unsatisfied. No clue why. Lingering concern for Eric?</p><p>Moments later, Del emerged holding her beer, wearing a pair of denim short-shorts with rhinestones and white stitching across her sweet little tush, along with a deep red V-neck tank that flowed around her slender figure. He\u2019d always liked that shirt on her. Good color, and it showed off her breasts. Eric smiled, and Tyler bet she\u2019d worn the shirt so her husband could appreciate her, even if he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Tyler tried to shove aside the fact that he appreciated the hell out of it, too.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she asked, tossing back a healthy swig of beer. \u201cPizza? Should we call now? I didn\u2019t get to eat lunch today.\u201d</p><p>And her bottle of beer was nearly empty.</p><p>\u201cLunch flew the coop on me, too,\u201d Tyler complained. \u201cDamn executive fucking his secretary over lunch at the little love nest he keeps for her. Why don\u2019t these dumb asses ever close the drapes before they drop trou and go at it?\u201d</p> <p>They all laughed. As he described the couple\u2019s sexual gymnastics, they finished their first beers and started the second. It wasn\u2019t long before they popped open a third.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tyler.\u201d Del sent him a saucy stare. \u201cYou still dating that skank at the strip club on Wilshire?\u201d</p><p>He tensed, looked at Eric\u2014who glanced away. Shit. He needed to change the subject fast. Now wasn\u2019t the time for this cat to come out of the bag. \u201cDestiny and I didn\u2019t \u2018date.\u2019 We just fucked.\u201d</p><p>Del rolled her lively blue eyes. \u201cDuh! I was being polite, you horndog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then, no.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWhen the \u2018dates\u2019 got boring, I moved on.\u201d And that was enough on that. He turned to Eric. \u201cSo, what did the physical therapist say this morning?\u201d</p><p>As they discussed Eric\u2019s recovery, they opened their fourth beer each and had a contest to see who could suck it down the fastest. After Tyler\u2019s easy victory, his memories of that night started getting hazy.</p><p>With the beer gone, they broke out the whiskey. But soon that bottle was gone, and the sun had barely set. Then they broke into Del\u2019s stockpile of wine while they raided the pantry and munched on some chips and salsa. But they never managed to order that pizza.</p><p>Critical mistake. The worst move? Allowing the alcohol and his dick to form the committee that made his decisions. Yeah, epic fail there. After that, everything went to shit.</p><p>Suddenly, Deke bounced beside him on the sofa. Tyler blinked, returning to the present as the last four seconds of the basketball game ticked down.</p><p>Just before the buzzer, one player made a killer three-point shot, and Deke rose to his feet with a fist pump. \u201cYeah, the Mavs won!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d He dropped his voice to a whisper. \u201cI should \u2018go to bed\u2019 now.\u201d</p><p>Deke\u2019s demeanor changed instantly, becoming all business. \u201cI\u2019ll, um . . . let myself out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a pillow or blanket?\u201d Tyler whispered.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ll be fine for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Plenty of time for Del to flee. She couldn\u2019t wait to leave him and throw herself into danger. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cGood night. Thanks for the playpen, man,\u201d he called out for Del\u2019s benefit.</p><p>The front door opened, closed. Ten silent seconds later, Deke returned to the family room and settled on the sofa. With a nod in his buddy\u2019s direction, Tyler headed to his bedroom, stripped down, and slipped between the sheets.</p><p>As he lay in the dark, he tucked his hands behind his head. The day washed over him. He had a son. Ten fingers, ten toes. So perfect. So life altering. A precious baby boy who\u2019d need a father to teach him to play catch, learn right from wrong, help him become a good man\u2014something his own father hadn\u2019t stuck around long enough to do. Tyler\u2019s eagerness to embrace fatherhood surprised him; he\u2019d never thought much about kids . . . but he already loved that little boy, would lay down his life to keep Seth safe.</p><p>But thinking of the child led Tyler too easily back to the night he\u2019d been conceived.</p><p>His mind drifting back to that unseasonably hot evening in Los Angeles two years ago, he recalled the instant the mood in the room had changed from drunk and jovial . . . to sexually supercharged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky, dude,\u201d Eric intoned. \u201cI miss fucking. Nothing like sinking balls deep into a tight, wet cunt. I\u2019d kill to have that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Del slapped him on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWith you, of course, babe,\u201d he hastily added. \u201cHell, I\u2019d even settle for watching.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Eric raised a brow at Del, then slid a stare back at him, a slow smile spreading across his dark face.</p><p>Tyler feared he knew what the next words out of his friend\u2019s mouth would be. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>But as the thought of taking Del to bed entered Tyler\u2019s head, lightning streaked through him, shocking, unrelenting. Fuck if his cock didn\u2019t get hard at the mere thought\u2014and not just slightly. In seconds, he\u2019d gone from zero to dick of steel pressing insistently and painfully against his zipper.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d Eric cajoled, his words not as sharp as his stare. \u201cFor me. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 here. Help a guy out. I need to remember what it\u2019s like to really fuck a woman. I need something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>On the chair across from him, Del leaned forward, bracing her forearms on her knees. Tyler could see straight down her tank top, to the barely there white lace bra. The overhead lights clearly illuminated her fair, slightly peachy-toned cleavage and the rosy brown of her nipples through the lace.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought it was possible, but he got harder. Tyler\u2019s gaze crawled up to Del\u2019s face, to her rosy, bee-stung lips, to her sultry, slightly unfocused blue eyes with their thickly fringed lashes. She blinked, met his stare, her own questioning.</p><p>How would her kiss taste? Would she orgasm with her eyes closed and a moan? Or with her gaze wide and surprised, screaming for the man who\u2019d delivered it? He\u2019d wondered more than once over the years. And as the questions rolled through his mind again, Tyler swallowed down a hot ball of lust. It settled south, making the throbbing of his cock like an insistent, nagging ache. Del was his best friend\u2019s wife, and with every one of these thoughts, he sank deeper into a thick cesspool of guilt. But now that Eric had planted the possibility of being Del\u2019s lover in his head, Tyler wondered how the fuck he was going to keep his hands off her?</p><p>He just would. Eric was like a brother . . . who\u2019d had enough booze to be a few sandwiches shy of a picnic. Sober, he\u2019d know this was a really fucking bad idea.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking Tyler to sleep with me?\u201d Del\u2019s voice slurred just a hint. She looked adorably confused. \u201cYou want me to have sex with your best friend?\u201d</p><p>This was his cue to get up and leave, even though his dick really wanted to stay and party.</p><p>Before he could find his feet, Eric hammered his point home. \u201cI\u2019m asking him to be our middleman, Del. But it will be like you\u2019re with me, like it\u2019s my cock sinking into you, like me making you come.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then frowned. \u201cBut won\u2019t that be . . . cheating? Won\u2019t you be hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, babe. You\u2019re not sneaking behind my back. I\u2019ll be right here, and I\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re with me.\u201d He grabbed her hands, then sent Tyler a pleading glance. \u201cI might not ever be with her again. You\u2019re the only way I have to experience that. The only one I trust.\u201d</p><p>Tyler sucked in a shuddering breath. \u201cDude, she doesn\u2019t sound okay with it, and I won\u2019t do this against her will.\u201d</p><p>Del laid trembling fingers on his forearm. He could still see down her shirt, and he was so damn hot for her that he had to restrain himself from kicking aside his chair, pinning her to the sofa, then getting deep in her pussy and fucking her breathless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m willing,\u201d she whispered to him, then turned to Eric. \u201cI\u2014I mean, if this is really what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Oh babe.\u201d Eric trailed his fingers down her cheek, dark eyes bright with gratitude. \u201cSex will give me something to look forward to while I rehab, something I can focus on and work toward when the therapy gets hard. Whaddya say, Ty?\u201d</p><p>Scrubbing a hand across his face, Tyler paused. The fraction of his brain that wasn\u2019t alcohol soaked was sober enough to wonder what would happen if he crossed the friend line with Del. Sex was usually casual as hell to him . . . but she wasn\u2019t a meaningless fuck. A woman that smart, compassionate, and together deserved more than to be banged in a drunken orgy of whiskey and hormones because her husband wanted to watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Eric, for all his faults, hadn\u2019t deserved to be shot near the spine and paralyzed, either. Still . . . Tyler wondered, if he agreed to Eric\u2019s request, how would his pal truly feel tomorrow about the fact that his best friend had fucked his wife?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never asked you for anything this important,\u201d Eric pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for a few weeks now. I need this, Ty.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Eric had been thinking about this sober? The guy had never pleaded for anything, not even his life when the asshole who\u2019d shot him stood over him with a gun and threatened to do it again. Tyler wanted to do what was best for everyone . . . but his thoughts were complicated by the undeniable fact that he wanted to grab Del, strip her, lay her flat, and get his cock inside her ASAP.</p><p>Still, he hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know, man . . .\u201d</p> <p>Eric\u2019s face closed up. \u201cI\u2019m asking too much, aren\u2019t I? Sorry. \u2019S okay. I\u2019ll ask Jim Becker. He\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, because Becker the Pecker would fuck anything that moved. And he stared at Del like a piece of meat every time she walked in the precinct. Eric knew that. Tyler\u2019s chest tightened at the thought of Del in the creep\u2019s clutches.</p><p>\u201cFuck no! Becker wouldn\u2019t be good to Del. He won\u2019t care about her experience or treat her like she\u2019s special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe . . . maybe not.\u201d Eric shrugged. \u201cI have to hope for the best. You\u2019re my first choice, but if you\u2019re not able . . .\u201d</p><p>Tyler shook his head. Not able? He snorted. Right now, he felt like he could fuck Del ten times without pausing. \u201cDude, are you really sure this is what you want? And you, angel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want whatever is going to bring Eric and me closer together,\u201d Del whispered, eyes tearing up. \u201cThe last three months have been . . .\u201d</p><p>Awful. He knew. She had to have felt like she\u2019d awakened to a never-ending nightmare. Nothing in her life was the same anymore, least of all her husband.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eric nodded emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the idea to sound kinky. I just need to feel like a man again. I need something good.\u201d</p><p>How about an ice cream cone?</p><p>Once upon a time, Eric would have been too self-assured to make this request, no matter how drunk. Tonight showed just how desperate he\u2019d become. How the hell was he supposed to turn down this plea?</p><p>Tyler palmed the back of his neck, then decided to shoot straight. \u201cDude, you know me. You know my reputation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. You love \u2019em and leave \u2019em. I don\u2019t think for one second that you\u2019d try to stake any claim on my wife.\u201d</p><p>Eric had him there. He wasn\u2019t the forever type. His mother had been saying it since he was a kid. Hell, he, Eric, and Del had even joked that he usually didn\u2019t stay more than five minutes post-orgasm. But he respected Del too much to fuck and run. Where did that leave him?</p><p>\u201cIf I do this, you need to understand that I\u2019m gonna be thorough and make sure she enjoys every minute, because your wife is hot. I\u2019ll definitely enjoy it, too.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Eric nodded. \u201cI want her to enjoy it. She probably needs the release. I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s spent any time with her battery-operated boyfriends lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric!\u201d She batted his shoulder playfully.</p><p>The thought of Del masturbating just got Tyler hotter. Fuck, he wanted her bad.</p><p>\u201cWill you do it?\u201d That pleading note was back in his buddy\u2019s voice.</p><p>Did he really have a choice?</p> <p>Taking a deep breath and hoping they didn\u2019t all regret this, Tyler nodded. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for you, man. You know it.\u201d</p><p>He also hoped to God that after he thoroughly enjoyed fucking his best friend\u2019s wife, he could live with the guilt.</p><p>Eric beamed, then shook his hand. \u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, any boundaries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I trust you to do what\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>A bad choice on Eric\u2019s part. Tyler feared he\u2019d be unable to stop himself from unleashing a whole bunch of naughty fantasies on Del and pushing every one of her limits.</p><p>Eric grabbed her and pulled her in for a quick kiss before snagging the wine bottle and taking another long swig. Then he turned to Tyler. \u201cYou gonna kiss her?\u201d</p><p>Fuck, he wanted to. At the suggestion, need surged through his body, settling into his inflamed cock. How would she feel against him? Around him? Curiosity was eating him alive.</p><p>She climbed off Eric\u2019s lap, then drew in a deep breath that lifted her pretty, pert breasts. Her nipples were already hard, but she stared up at him through her dark lashes, her blue gaze surprisingly shy. She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cDel?\u201d Tyler held out his hand to her. His own shook.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, she nodded, then curled her fingers around his.</p><p>Desire jolted its way up his arm, short-circuiting his brain. More blood rushed south. Tyler swallowed. Go slow. If you don\u2019t calm the fuck down, you\u2019re going to inhale her. Scare her. Hurt her.</p><p>Apparently, Del mistook his pause for reluctance. She stepped against him, grabbed his face with both hands, and jammed her mouth against his in a desperate kiss.</p><p>That was all it took to unleash his hormones off the chain. His conscience quickly followed.</p><p>He fisted both hands into her long hair and yanked her head back, arching her body against his. With his lips, he shoved her own apart. He didn\u2019t just kiss her; he violated her mouth, plunging inside, dying to taste her completely. Possess her.</p><p>She moaned, rubbing that lithe little body of hers against him, accepting everything he gave her. Her flavor detonated like a bomb in his system, setting fire to his skin, dropping hot lava into his veins. As she wrapped her arms around his neck, desire settled with relentless insistence in his iron shaft, his heavy balls.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Eric hissed the words. \u201cGod, that\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Tyler jumped back as if he\u2019d been scalded. He breathed like he\u2019d run a fucking marathon, his lungs pumping hard and fast. A gorgeous flush stained Del\u2019s cheeks. Her mouth, always full, now looked downright red and swollen. She swiped the tip of her tongue across her bottom lip inquisitively, as if trying to taste his kiss all over again. The sight grabbed him by the cock and yanked hard.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop now, babe.\u201d Eric wheeled close enough to caress her waist, her breast, then tugged at her shirt. \u201cTake this off. And your bra. Remind me what gorgeous tits you have. Show Tyler.\u201d</p><p>She gave Eric a shaky nod but turned to him for confirmation. Insecurity crawled across her face. She bit her lip again, turning an even rosier red. Did she think for a second that he didn\u2019t want her? Probably. Whatever attraction he\u2019d felt for her had been one-sided, and he\u2019d done his best to bury it. After all, the concept of sex between them had never been even a whisper until five minutes ago.</p><p>With Eric watching, Tyler stepped into Del\u2019s personal space and cupped her breast through the red silk. He dragged his thumb across her nipple. It drew up tight and needy at his touch. She whimpered. Del was welcoming him? Oh hell, that turned him on. She probably did it for Eric\u2019s sake, but Tyler pushed that fact aside. Tonight, she\u2019d let him fuck her. Suddenly, he couldn\u2019t think of anyone he wanted more.</p><p>He snagged her gaze, held it as he thumbed her nipple again. \u201cTake it off, Del. Show me your breasts.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. She licked dry lips, sending another spark of desire through Tyler. Then she crossed her arms at her waist, grabbed the hem of the tank, and whipped it over her head.</p><p>Tyler blinked, stared. Del was . . . utopia. She\u2019d been a contemporary dancer for years, and it showed in the firm lines of her delicate shoulders and arms. Her stomach was flat, the long, lean line of her abdominals visible under flawless skin. Her low-rise shorts clung to slender hips. But her gorgeous breasts had him stuttering. All natural, a perfect mouthful, they were beyond arousing. He wondered how he\u2019d ever look at her again and not see her this way, tentative but flushed, her breathing almost as hard as her nipples, so pretty through the white lace.</p><p>Tyler swallowed. \u201cThe bra, Del. Off. Now.\u201d</p><p>Aw, hell. He couldn\u2019t even form complete sentences. But she understood exactly what he meant. Holding his gaze, she reached behind her back and released the hooks. A second later, the underwire contraption with the wispy lace slithered to the floor.</p><p>Fuck. Me. He almost swallowed his tongue. The palest skin of her body surrounded the most succulent pinkish brown nipples he\u2019d ever seen. Wide, hard, drawn up so tightly, as if begging for a warm mouth to cradle them. Tyler was more than happy to oblige.</p><p>\u201cPretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Eric said proudly.</p><p>The stuff of wet dreams. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, babe.\u201d Eric crooked a finger at her. \u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>She complied, and Tyler had to bite back a protest. But Del wasn\u2019t his, so he stood silently and watched as his buddy placed a soft kiss on her lips, then ran his knuckles across one of her nipples. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to look at me. I want to see your eyes. I want you to think of me.\u201d</p><p>Hell no. That was Tyler\u2019s first instinct. He kept the words in. He was doing a favor for a buddy, not greedily fucking the guy\u2019s wife for his own pleasure. His head\u2014both of them actually\u2014needed to get on board with the plan.</p><p>Del gave Eric a tremulous smile full of devotion. Tyler wanted one of those with an ache that didn\u2019t make sense. He\u2019d never have it from her. The thought was a stab in the chest.</p><p>But he\u2019d have her body tonight, and he planned to devour every inch he could.</p><p>Tyler grabbed Del\u2019s arm and pulled, yanking her into his embrace. With an insistent grip, he clutched her nape, pulled her flush against him, and devoured her mouth again. Those sweet berry lips, her shy tongue stroking and retreating, her little catches of breath as he grabbed her firm little ass and hoisted her against him, notching her pussy right against his cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck, that\u2019s hot,\u201d Eric murmured.</p><p>He liked what he saw? There was way more coming. Tyler vowed that he wasn\u2019t letting go of Del until she was completely sated. If he had his way, she\u2019d stay under him until she was wrung out, sore, and smiling from ear to ear.</p><p>He tore at the fastenings of her shorts, undoing them and shoving down the denim, along with her little lace thong, in one swipe of his big hands. Once they reached her knees, he stomped them down with his foot, his mouth fastened to hers hungrily as he savored her taste.</p><p>Del didn\u2019t hesitate or back away. She clutched his shoulders, rubbing herself against his body. The second her shorts hit the ground, she shoved his T-shirt up his torso and over his head.</p><p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d She skimmed her palms over his chest, dragging her fingertips across his sensitive nipples. \u201cAre you sure? I mean, if you don\u2019t want . . .\u201d</p><p>Her? At this point, only an army could drag him away from Del. Maybe. If they were really insistent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Are you sure?\u201d he croaked out.</p><p>Nodding, she explored his skin again so lightly that goose bumps rose all over his chest. He sucked in a deep breath at the feel of Del\u2019s hands on him. God, that was spec-fucking-tacular. They\u2019d barely started, and already Tyler wanted to beg for more.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to get his cock deep inside her sweet pussy. And it would be sweet, he could already tell, as he swiped his fingers across her smooth flesh there. Eric had told him once that she waxed down south, and Tyler appreciated a bare cunt. Correction: bare, wet cunt. Hers was perfect. Fuck, he could get lost there.</p><p>He tripped a finger across her clit. Hmm, already getting hard. But her appeal went beyond the way she looked or felt. Del had held his hand in the emergency room once after he\u2019d tangoed with a perp\u2019s knife and needed twenty-three stitches near his kidney and hip. She\u2019d shown him how to cook more than frozen meals. Last year, after her parents\u2019 deaths, she\u2019d clung to him during the funeral as Eric and the other pallbearers carried the caskets to the graves.</p><p>Tyler loved her openness. Del was totally, completely real. No plastic smiles, no silicone, no artificial bullshit designed to impress. Every emotion, every expression she laid bare. No hiding, no fronting. Just beautiful honesty. That took guts he didn\u2019t always have. And he admired her for it.</p><p>\u201cThat feel good?\u201d He rubbed her clit again.</p><p>She gasped, and her head fell back as she melted under his touch. \u201cYes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to get her off manually, and it\u2019ll take time,\u201d Eric coached. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t usually come during sex.\u201d</p><p>Yeah? Tyler stared down into Del\u2019s face. She flushed, averting her gaze. Eric had embarrassed her. Did she think for a second that not climaxing was her fault? Tyler loved the guy like a brother, but if he wasn\u2019t manning up to Del\u2019s lack of orgasm during sex . . . well, Tyler would be more than happy to show Eric that he was wrong.</p><p>In fact, impatience clawed at Tyler. Everything about her body said that she was hungry. For him or just for sex? Whatever. He\u2019d gladly feed her need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He trailed openmouthed kisses along the hot satin skin of her neck as he shoved a finger inside her cunt. Instantly, her flesh clamped down on him as if trying to suck him deeper.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you\u2019re tight.\u201d He leaned in, nipped at her ear, and whispered, \u201cHow long has it been for you, angel?\u201d</p><p>Del grabbed his shoulders, eyes wide as he stroked her, mouth gaping. \u201cS-six months.\u201d</p><p>What the fuck? Tyler tried to wipe the shock off his face. He\u2019d give Eric a pass for the last three months. But before that? He\u2019d been too busy fucking Destiny and had neglected Del completely.</p><p>Tyler stroked her again, deeper, slower. Eric thought he needed this? He\u2019d bet Del needed it more. Who\u2019d been holding her and reassuring her lately? Telling her that she was beautiful, desirable, worthwhile? Tyler vowed to fix that tonight.</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod, mewling and gyrating on his fingers. A pretty flush crawled up her chest, to her face. Her breathing shallowed as he rubbed at her clit. Then he pressed on that sensitive spot inside her.</p><p>Del dug her nails into his shoulders. \u201cOh my . . . Yes!\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, she already felt moments from climaxing. Over the years, Tyler had seen a lot of women in the throes; he knew the signs. Not responsive? Eric had to be a flaming idiot in bed because Del was about to combust. Damn, he couldn\u2019t wait to see how she reacted when he had every inch of his cock buried inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou going to come for me?\u201d Tyler whispered.</p><p>She swiveled her hips again, panting against his neck. When he bent and laved each of her nipples with his tongue, then drew one deep into his mouth, Del sucked in a deep breath. Her pussy squeezed like a vise on his fingers, then began to pulsate. She screamed as she came.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s entire body hummed at the sound.</p><p>He thumbed her little knot of a clit through a long, wrenching climax. Shit, her pelvic muscles were strong, and he couldn\u2019t wait to feel them clenching around his dick. He\u2019d kiss her, trap her screams in his mouth as he rode her from one orgasm to the next.</p><p>\u201cBabe, that orgasm was intense,\u201d Eric said. \u201cWow, you did need it. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She whimpered. \u201cI still ache.\u201d</p><p>Eric stroked her thigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix you.\u201d</p><p>The second her pulsing muscles let up, impatience clawed Tyler. He grabbed the snap of his jeans and wrenched it open, shoving his zipper down. Since he usually went commando, nothing else stood in their way.</p><p>His cock sprang free, and he palmed it, stroking slowly as she caught her breath and backed up, watching him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d The whisper slipped out of her mouth, as her gaze fused itself to his cock. She blinked, and then blinked again. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Tyler shrugged. He\u2019d been told before that he was big, but he\u2019d never had problems fitting. \u201cWe\u2019ll go slow.\u201d Though it will kill me. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to dissipate her fear. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Eric wheeled over to the sofa and used his arms to lift and throw himself onto the cushions, then leaned against the arm. \u201cI need to see more. God, I remember how much I\u2019m missing. I want this back. I\u2019m going to work to get this back.\u201d</p><p>Del smiled at Eric, then turned to him. As she did, her expression turned saucy. \u201cYou\u2019re not shy, right?\u201d</p><p>Tyler snorted, his blood on fire. \u201cWhatever you\u2019ve got, angel, dish it out. I can take it.\u201d</p> <p>She liked the challenge\u2014her smile said so. Then she dusted kisses across his jaw, her fingers skimming, teasing down his torso, to his thighs. She gripped his cock in her hand, stroking with authority and a clever grip.</p><p>He groaned long and loud at the pleasure screeching through his body.</p><p>She giggled. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you thought us old married broads were dull.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never thought that about Del. He\u2019d certainly never think that about her in the future. She knew way too well how to run her thumb over the sensitive head, then gently scratch on the nerve-laden indentation just beneath. Tyler sucked in a breath.</p><p>Then she started shimmying down his body until she sank to her knees.</p><p>\u201cDel. Jesus, don\u2019t\u2014 Oh, fuck me, that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth closed around his cock like hot velvet, all soft and wet and welcoming. Tyler gripped his fists in her long hair and eased deeper into her mouth. It was like quicksand, sucking him under until he felt as if he was drowning. Tingles hammered through his cock, down his thighs, and when she swirled her tongue around the head of his dick, then tried to take him to the back of her throat, he groaned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so hot,\u201d Eric murmured. \u201cYou know how, babe. Give it to him. Yeah . . . Fondle his balls.\u201d</p><p>Shit, it was like Eric could read his mind. Instantly, Del complied, her fingers cupping, stroking, sliding. Those tingles swirled, concentrated. He looked down at her lush little mouth, lips parted so wide, trying to accommodate him in that hot silk haven. She\u2019d never take all of him, but when her lips slipped down another inch of his cock, Tyler thought he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>A blow job was a blow job, but this . . . Damn, how was he going to keep it together and not come down her throat in the next thirty seconds? Knowing it was Del\u2019s hot little mouth all over him was killing him. He wanted to take her in every way possible. In that moment, he couldn\u2019t deny a primitive urge to stake a claim.</p><p>Using his grip on her hair, he eased back. \u201cLick the head.\u201d</p><p>She did, just like she\u2019d eat a fucking ice cream cone, laving as if he was a delicious treat she\u2019d craved. And she looked up at him through those lashes, dark blue eyes soft and sultry. Aroused.</p><p>\u201cNow lick your lips,\u201d Eric told her.</p><p>Tyler watched her sweet pink tongue cover her top lip in a slow sweep before darting inside again. Then it emerged again, the tip tracing the sexy little line in the middle of her bottom lip as it turned glossy and slick. Her chest rose and fell more rapidly with each moment. And still she never looked away.</p><p>\u201cGood, babe. Now let him fuck your mouth. Do it slowly.\u201d</p><p>Crap, Eric was trying to kill him, and Tyler would object if it didn\u2019t feel so fucking good.</p><p>Del thrust out her tongue again, this time cradling the underside of his cock, then slowly luring it back, drawing him back into her mouth.</p><p>He tightened his fists and threw his head back. \u201cDel. Goddamn it . . .\u201d</p><p>Then she made it twenty times worse, taking his cock even deeper in her pretty mouth and humming around it. She swallowed, and the head bumped the tight, working muscles of her throat. Pleasure spiked through his system. The tingles were becoming a storm, centered at the base of his spine. His balls felt heavy, loaded.</p><p>Grimacing, he yanked on her hair and dislodged himself from the sweet grip of her lips. He glanced down, seeing her blink in confusion, in arousal. Her wet lips, her dilated eyes . . .</p><p>\u201cI have to fuck you now.\u201d Tyler heard the desperation in his own voice and winced.</p><p>She gasped, then a kittenish smile curled the corners of her mouth. Tyler wished he could put that sexy, mischievous look on her face every fucking day.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Eric interjected. \u201cDo it, dude. Bend her over the sofa right next to me. I want to kiss her and play with her.\u201d</p><p>While Tyler fucked her. He gritted his teeth. This so wasn\u2019t what he wanted with Del. He\u2019d like a cozy bed at her back and hours on end to explore her. He wanted to suck her nipples raw, taste that pretty bare cunt, get drunk on her flavor. But the driving urge to get deep inside her and pound away until she screamed his name was shutting down his good sense.</p><p>Reaching down to his discarded jeans, he pulled a condom from the pocket. Palming it, he helped Del stand, brought her against him, then brushed his thumb across her lip. No matter how badly his cock ached for her, he forced himself to ask, \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod, then whispered, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The little word damn near undid him. He thumbed her hard nipple, caressed the long, lean line of her belly, then slid his fingers back over her pussy. Fuck, she was even wetter than she\u2019d been just after her orgasm. Given how hard he planned to fuck her, she was going to need it.</p><p>\u201cFace me,\u201d Eric demanded.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t want that. He\u2019d give anything to stare into Del\u2019s eyes, watch them widen, watch her lips part, as he sank every hungry inch of his cock into her. He held in a curse. This wasn\u2019t his show.</p><p>Before he let her go, he cupped her cheek and settled his mouth over hers. He ached to be inside her utterly, devour her whole. Instead, he curbed himself, reassuring her with a deep, slow stoke of his tongue against hers, showing her silently exactly how gently but thoroughly he planned to fuck her. When he finally lifted his head and stared into her eyes, she gripped his shoulders and stared breathlessly.</p><p>She understood him completely.</p><p>\u201cFace Eric, angel.\u201d</p><p>Del sent him a last glance, begging for reassurance. Whatever she saw on his face settled her. She nodded and turned.</p><p>As he donned the condom, Tyler couldn\u2019t deny that the view from the back was every bit as luscious as the front. That firm, round ass . . . The long line of her spine bisecting the flawless, peachy-hued skin of her slender back . . . The exaggerated nip of her waist, and the graceful slopes of her shoulders . . . The long, silken strands of her hair brushing her back, then the curve of her ass as she tossed her head impatiently.</p><p>When was the last time he\u2019d wanted a woman this much?</p><p>Never. And he wanted her so much because no one was like Del.</p><p>Tyler palmed her hips, gently guiding her to bend over the arm of the black leather sofa, bringing her face inches from Eric\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou look hot, babe.\u201d He brushed a kiss over her mouth, reached out to toy with her nipples.</p><p>Fuck. Suddenly, Tyler didn\u2019t like watching Eric touching Del. Over the years, he\u2019d seen his buddy kiss her many times. He\u2019d heard a story or two about the escapades of their honeymoon. But tonight, in this moment, Tyler wanted Del to belong to him.</p><p>He intended to claim every inch of territory he could. He\u2019d feel like shit about it tomorrow, but right now . . .</p><p>Fitting his hips to her ass, he slid his cock between her cheeks and laid his chest over her back. Del gasped. Yeah, the heat was intense. Tyler closed his eyes and let sensations wash over him. He should probably feel guilty for wanting her so much, but he refused to acknowledge it tonight. Del needed him\u2014with any luck, half as much as he wanted her. The breast Eric didn\u2019t fondle, Tyler cupped, toying with the engorged tip, rolling it between his fingers until she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, angel,\u201d he whispered for her ears alone. \u201cWe\u2019ll work and wriggle. You\u2019ll gasp and tighten. But you\u2019re going to take every inch of me. And you\u2019re going to come for me. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI want to hear everything you\u2019re feeling. Every second, every stroke. I have to know this is what you need and that I\u2019m not hurting you. Stop talking, and I stop fucking. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She wriggled back against him, her voice breathy.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Taking himself in hand, Tyler fitted the head of his cock to her tiny, slick opening and began pushing his way inside slowly.</p><p>Oh hell. What a constricting little vise of pleasure. Hot and tight. Sinful and so fucking necessary to his next breath. All attached to the woman making his blood sing like no one ever had.</p><p>As he shoved in the next inch, then another, she tensed, gasped. He gripped her hips tighter, forcing himself to pause.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d It had been a long time for her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she panted. \u201cGive me more.\u201d</p><p>Who the hell was he to turn that down? And how the fuck would he ever get his sanity back afterward?</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>DELANEY stared at the ceiling of Tyler\u2019s guest room. Weariness pulled at her. The bed was insanely comfortable, and Seth\u2019s deep breathing coming from the playpen relaxed her. She didn\u2019t lie to herself; being this close to Tyler made her feel safe. How easy it would be to snuggle down, close her eyes, and drift off. Here, she could almost forget that a bomb meant to kill her had exploded not quite four days ago.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t think of her comfort now. Seth\u2019s safety was more important. Though Tyler hadn\u2019t known the boy more than a handful of hours, she had no doubt he would move heaven and earth to keep his son from danger. That had to console her. She would return to Los Angeles, investigate very quietly, write a kick-ass article, and lay low until it released. Once she\u2019d nailed the bastard, she could come collect Seth . . . and say good-bye to Tyler.</p><p>He had a full life here in Lafayette, and she was both envious of and happy for him. But Tyler had always made friends easily. Once he cared about a person, he was as loyal as the day was long. He\u2019d give a friend the shirt off his back.</p><p>Or his friend\u2019s wife the release she\u2019d desperately needed.</p><p>Del tried to keep thoughts of that night at bay. But like a song she couldn\u2019t banish from her head, they came back. The heat, the alcohol, Eric\u2019s pleading request. And the pleasure. Dear God, she\u2019d never felt anything like the ecstasy Tyler had given her that night, hadn\u2019t even known it existed. She remembered the moment he\u2019d pressed inside her, slowly possessing her until all thought had fallen away, leaving only him and the searing need. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those memories tumbled through her exhausted brain. No matter how tired she was now or how drunk she\u2019d been then, everything about that night was crystal clear. Tyler bending her over the arm of the sofa. Eric brushing a kiss over her mouth, before glancing around her to watch Tyler press his thick cock into her pussy slowly, without mercy.</p><p>Though she had whimpered, she\u2019d loved it.</p><p>This was really happening, Del remembered thinking two years ago. She was going to have sex with Tyler Murphy.</p><p>As he\u2019d penetrated her that sultry night, she\u2019d tried to swallow against lust, but it was useless. His huge hands engulfed her hips, and need flared through her, hot and unrelenting. He pushed deeper into her, stretching her, then withdrew again, only to inch in once more, so grindingly slow. The raw ache he spurred nearly drove her insane.</p><p>\u201cTyler, please . . .\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time that night she\u2019d begged. And it definitely hadn\u2019t been the last.</p><p>Del knew she should put a stop to this before the situation careened any further out of control. She\u2019d stood in front of her family and friends\u2014including Tyler as best man\u2014only two years ago. That day, she\u2019d promised to love and honor and be faithful to Eric for the rest of her life. Then, everything had seemed so natural and easy.</p><p>The days had become weeks, then months. Her husband\u2019s job consumed him, and it wasn\u2019t easy to know that he saw drug dealers and prostitutes all day. She\u2019d talked to other cops\u2019 wives and knew that, behind the badge, they were still men who could be swayed to ignore crime for money or sexual favors. Not that she believed Eric would take either, but . . . the last few months before his shooting, they\u2019d been more like friends than spouses, doing crosswords, watching movies, eating together. Their lack of connection was probably her fault. She\u2019d been stressed, worrying that because she covered fluff pieces in a nothing section of a financially shaky paper, she\u2019d lose her job. Whatever the reason, sex between them had stopped.</p><p>She\u2019d begun to wonder if someone else was picking up her slack.</p><p>Then Eric had been shot, and everything else ceased to matter. Then, there\u2019d been nothing but endless days in the hospital, pain, and sleeplessness, along with the grim fear that he might not live, and if he did, would he ever walk again? Del knew she\u2019d take care of him, regardless. After all, in sickness and in health. But as time had crawled by, he\u2019d grown more surly. Angry at her, at the world. Affection had ground to a complete halt in favor of snide disdain and petulance. Never had she imagined this side of Eric. He\u2019d become a completely different man. And she\u2019d despaired that she\u2019d ever reach him again.</p><p>Would letting Tyler fuck her in Eric\u2019s place finally change something?</p><p>She remembered Eric brushing his lips over her jaw, down her neck. She\u2019d closed her eyes and kissed his cheek in return, searching desperately for that connection she\u2019d once felt with him, praying to find it. Praying that she was doing the right thing to save them.</p><p>Even if she wasn\u2019t, Del didn\u2019t think she could stop. Her body was burning up. It wasn\u2019t just the pleasure that had her crying out. She needed to be held, loved. Reassured of human comfort. Tyler clutched her tightly, suffusing her with a searing heat that made her ache down to her toes.</p><p>Since the second Eric had been wounded, Tyler had been by her side. He\u2019d helped with the insurance and departmental paperwork. He\u2019d taken care of her lawn and household repairs. He\u2019d picked up the pieces when she\u2019d been too distraught to carry on . . . or when she\u2019d cried. If she called, he was never too tired or too busy. In some ways, he\u2019d been more devoted than Eric ever had been. While she knew that love for his friend\u2014not her\u2014made him so loyal, she had to believe that he felt something for her.</p><p>God, she wanted to be wanted, to feel alive. Wanted to share something vital. And she craved all that with Tyler. Guilt was eating her alive. Her feelings made her a terrible wife. A terrible person. But . . . human. In this one moment, she wanted to be selfish\u2014before she resumed caring for a man she wasn\u2019t entirely sure loved her anymore.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you want, angel,\u201d Tyler whispered.</p><p>She wriggled back on his cock, but he held her steady with those strong hands, controlling her until she answered.</p><p>\u201cI ache.\u201d She sobbed.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m going to fix it.\u201d But he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, man. Fuck her!\u201d Eric urged.</p><p>Yes, please.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s finger dug deeper into her hips. He spread his legs a bit more, stabilizing himself, before he pushed another scant inch of his cock inside her. She clawed at the sofa and looked at Eric in helpless surprise as pleasure tore through her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s tight, man,\u201d Tyler growled. \u201cSo fucking tight. I won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. She wants it,\u201d Eric argued, taking another long sip of wine from the bottle. \u201cShe\u2019s goddamn begging for it. Shove it in her cunt and make her take it.\u201d</p><p>Her husband seized her lips, took her mouth with his own, stabbing his tongue inside ravenously. Then Tyler eased in another inch between her folds.</p><p>Dear God. She couldn\u2019t breathe. Tyler fired up nerve endings she\u2019d never felt before. He surrounded her, warm skin sizzling her back, hot breath in her ear, fingers dropped to her thighs, clutching them possessively. He was on her\u2014in her. Overwhelming her. Del tore her lips from Eric\u2019s with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d Tyler growled, sounding at the end of his restraint.</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d She tossed back her head and groaned. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can take more, but I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Eric said. \u201cShe wants it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Tyler cursed. \u201cThe goal is pleasure. Not porn,\u201d he tossed at Eric. \u201cNot pain. You have to relax for me, angel.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew a fraction, scraping along her nerve endings. Then his fingers drifted over her clit again as he dragged his cock through the shallow channel of her vulva, coating himself in her juices, back and forth, bumping the little bundle of nerves he circled.</p><p>Unbelievably, need spiked again. She rarely orgasmed twice, so the desire balling in her belly, tight and urgent, pressing down on her made her thrash and mewl. \u201cTyler . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I feel it, too.\u201d He fitted the head of his dick at her opening and began pushing in again. \u201cJust let me in and let go.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold in a gasp as he parted her wet flesh with the blunt tip of his cock and forged deep, spreading her so damn wide. As he opened her, her flesh stung, burned, trying to take every bit of him she could. The thick, hot feel of him stole her breath. And still he kept thrusting forward, stretching and working with absolute focus.</p><p>\u201cYou look fucking hot,\u201d Eric murmured, fondling her nipples before twisting them.</p><p>Behind her, Tyler groaned. \u201cFuck, she just clamped down on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d Eric manipulated her nipples again. They felt tight and raw and burning. Her body hummed, tensed, waiting for something more.</p><p>\u201cBack the fuck off for a minute,\u201d Tyler snarled. \u201cLet me finish getting inside her.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t yet? Already, she felt deliciously split in two.</p><p>Del breathed out. It had been so long since she\u2019d felt her blood roaring, her pussy aching\u2014and it had never been like this. She\u2019d been so focused on Eric and his needs that she hadn\u2019t even used her vibrator once in the last three months. So she was totally unprepared for Tyler.</p><p>But beyond the pain, he was making her feel like a woman again. She couldn\u2019t disappoint him. This was supposed to be for Eric, but somehow, it had ceased being exclusively about his sexual needs.</p><p>She should probably be angry that Eric wanted her to sleep with another man. But right now, she was damn glad. And she owed Tyler. He\u2019d stepped across his personal boundaries to give her immense pleasure and made her feel treasured. No way would she repay him by failing to give him her all.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, Del forced herself to relax her pelvic muscles and open in welcome. She wriggled back against him, sucking in a shocked breath as he sank deeper than before, deeper than she\u2019d ever had a man. God, she\u2019d never felt anything so consuming. With his tight grip and controlled breaths, she sensed Tyler\u2019s restraint, his concern for her\u2014and the desire burning inside of him. It spilled on to her, urging her to tilt her hips to take even more of him.</p><p>On a long groan, he eased the last of his cock inside her, settling so deep, she gasped and clawed at Eric\u2019s forearms, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice sounded like gravel. He panted.</p><p>\u201cYou should see her face, man.\u201d Eric grinned.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Tyler demanded.</p><p>Del paused, trying to school her features, but there was no way to hide the confusing, sublime pleasure-pain drugging her system. So she looked over her shoulder at him, letting him see how much he affected her.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he praised, his green eyes burning.</p><p>Brutal lust stamped across his face, and her body liquefied as she met his stare. She\u2019d known Tyler wanted her enough physically. He was hard, after all. But the sheer force of it stunned and excited Del. Desire, dark and compelling, gripped her. Blood ran thick and hot in her veins. It looked like she wasn\u2019t the only one afflicted.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He withdrew slowly, letting her feel every inch.</p><p>Then he shoved his way back in, and she gasped. And nearly came undone.</p><p>\u201cBabe?\u201d Eric called.</p><p>She turned to look at her husband again, his brown eyes desperate as he grabbed her hand, brushed his palm across her cheek. Del closed her eyes and sank into the sensation of feeling utterly adored by them both for a perfect moment.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ready now.\u201d Tyler circled his arm around her waist and pressed kisses across her shoulder.</p><p>Eric nodded. \u201cGive it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, talk to me, angel. I can\u2019t see you, so I need to hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-okay,\u201d she managed to get out. What she really wanted to do was scream at him to hurry up and fuck her.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel now, Del? What do you want?\u201d Tyler smoothed a hand across her ass.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her voice trembled. \u201cI need . . .\u201d</p><p>God, did she. Having Tyler at her back, deep inside her, as he exercised his iron control blistered her with something so beyond desire, she had no name for it. She only knew if he didn\u2019t take away this fiery ache that gaped inside her soon, she\u2019d implode.</p><p>\u201cWhat, angel?\u201d He wrapped his arm around her and fitted his fingers over her clit, swirling slow circles around the screaming little bud. \u201cYou need to come?\u201d</p><p>It sounded selfish to admit, and guilt slid through her for demanding more of Tyler. But the ache assailed her, pressing down until she could no longer hold it in.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She couldn\u2019t catch her breath. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDel?\u201d Eric asked, frowning. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>Explaining herself wasn\u2019t at the top of her agenda now, especially when Tyler took her confession as a sign to get busy and began shuttling in and out of her in a measured, maddening pace.</p><p>She climbed toward the pinnacle, sobbing. Every one of Tyler\u2019s strokes generated friction that robbed her of words and coherent thought. His rough fingers twirled over the sensitive bud of her clit, driving her even higher.</p><p>\u201cLet me have it, Del,\u201d he demanded gruffly. \u201cCome for me, angel.\u201d</p><p>Pleasure spiraled, centering deep in her womb, before it sucked her deep. Blood roared in her head until she could only hear her beating heart. Then Tyler\u2019s relentless thrusts pushed her over the edge, breaking her open, and hurtling her into a thick pool of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He moaned. \u201cDamn, you feel good on me. That\u2019s it. Yeah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Eric jammed his mouth over hers. \u201cYou look hot, Del. Whatever he\u2019s doing is working for you because you\u2019ve never gotten off like that.\u201d</p><p>Del whimpered. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long . . .\u201d</p><p>Any moment now, Tyler would pump into her hard, fast, coming in a shout and a rush. She wasn\u2019t ready to let him go yet, but she\u2019d already been too selfish. This night was about Eric\u2019s wants.</p><p>\u201cThat was so fucking pretty, Del,\u201d Tyler breathed into her ear. \u201cDo it again for me.\u201d</p><p>Come? If he\u2019d asked her an hour ago, she would have sworn it wasn\u2019t possible. But with the thick slide of his cock inside her and every one of her senses attuned to him, he was making her a believer.</p><p>Eric cradled her breasts in his hands again, thumbing her swollen nipples and sending a jolt straight to her pussy. \u201cGood luck, man. Two is really her limit.\u201d</p><p>Tyler just grunted. \u201cFuck that. Faster or slower, Del?\u201d</p><p>Normally, she laid back and waited for Eric to finish. But Tyler wasn\u2019t going to take that. He was going to make her participate in her own undoing. And she loved the idea.</p><p>How would Eric feel about it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she gasped. Tyler would want it that way. It would send him racing to climax.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He whacked a playful slap across her ass and slowed his pace.</p><p>The increased friction lit her pussy aflame again almost immediately. She sucked in a huge breath and clawed the arm of the sofa. Nothing had prepared her for this kind of thrill.</p><p>\u201cMove with me,\u201d Tyler demanded.</p><p>Del rocked back into him as he established a rhythm, deep, steady, and overwhelming. And he held a possessive arm around her as he crashed into her again and again, the flat of his palm sliding over her mound as the pressure rose. The need swelled. Then the explosion became inevitable.</p><p>With a scream, she careened over the edge a third time. The orgasm was low and long and deep. Pulsing, throbbing, taking all her energy and will.</p><p>Afterward, exhaustion swamped her. Her body went limp. Her eyes almost refused to open . . . but Tyler still kept slowly thrusting his way into her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, that\u2019s amazing, Del,\u201d Tyler praised.</p><p>\u201cIt is, babe. It really has been too long for you.\u201d A line worried itself between Eric\u2019s brows as he frowned.</p><p>Was he concerned that she\u2019d been so deprived or that she melted in another man\u2019s arms?</p><p>A moment later, it didn\u2019t matter as Tyler hit a spot so deep inside her that it sent her racing headlong for climax again. Her tissues swelled. Each thrust burned low, sensations gathering so deep, all so new. Her entire body tensed, thighs trembling as she hung between insanity and thrill.</p><p>Tyler groaned long and loud. \u201cJesus. I\u2019m pressing against her cervix. I feel her against the head of my dick. So damn snug. She\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>Del cried out at the cacophony of sensations hurtling her deeper into pleasure.</p><p>He eased back immediately. \u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she panted. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even take a breath before he shoved his cock into her so hard, he knocked the sofa a few inches across the hardwood floor\u2014and her senses all to hell. She took a soaring cliff dive off the edge and flew into a consuming, throbbing bliss. Her shout of satisfaction roared in her ears as her swollen walls pressed down on Tyler relentlessly. Surely, he\u2019d follow her into orgasm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Del realized that a few shocked seconds later when he started pumping hard and steady into her again. The room spun. Her vision swam. And still, Tyler continued fucking her.</p><p>Eric grabbed her arm. \u201cDel . . . oh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tyler demanded.</p><p>Better than okay. Del nodded, happy and sated.</p><p>\u201cA nod doesn\u2019t do it. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>His voice kept getting deeper and deeper. That shouldn\u2019t turn her on. She should be incapable of being aroused at this point.</p> <p>As he surged into her again, he brushed every stimulated inch of flesh all the way up her pussy. Del knew for certain that she was still fully capable of being aroused.</p><p>\u201cTyler!\u201d she tensed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, angel.\u201d She heard the strain in his voice. \u201cTell me you can take more.\u201d</p><p>The idea was crazy, beyond insane . . . \u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I want to see you come again. Your skin flushes, your body shudders. It\u2019s so fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, I don\u2019t think so . . .\u201d Eric looked skeptical\u2014and perplexed.</p><p>She\u2019d have to say something to explain her shamelessness\u2014no idea what\u2014but that was later. Right now, Tyler strummed his fingers over the bundle of nerves between her legs and drove her up, up, up as he pressed his cock deep once more, making her nerve endings beg.</p><p>\u201cShe can,\u201d Tyler assured. \u201cShe\u2019s clamping down on me. Her clit is hard. I can get another orgasm out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she forced herself to say. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be about her pleasure, and suddenly, she wondered if Eric was ready for the experience to be over. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Tyler. Do what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave you hanging? Fuck no. What I need is to see you come again. Will you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s dark gaze snagged hers, probing, raw. His expression tightened\u2014and that kicked her in the gut. What did she say with her lover demanding more and her troubled husband looking on? She blinked, her mind raced. The silent moments stood thick.</p><p>Tyler ceased all movement. \u201cI told you earlier, Del, you stop talking, I stop fucking.\u201d</p><p>Anguished pleasure ratcheted up inside her, damn near stopping her breath, her heartbeat. She gripped leather from the sofa cushion in her hand and cried out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d Tyler growled.</p><p>\u201cGive him a goddamn answer,\u201d Eric snarled, grabbing her chin. \u201cCan you come again?\u201d</p><p>Lie? Don\u2019t lie? Del suspected that each man wanted a different answer. How could she betray Eric? But how could she fail Tyler after all he\u2019d done?</p><p>Her husband stared with burning eyes, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too hard. Your body wants it bad, angel.\u201d Tyler pressed his cock deeper in her pussy. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip to keep her keening cry in, but she failed. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Before she finished speaking, Tyler thrust into her again\u2014and lit her up like a city skyline. Eric clenched his fists, his mouth pressing into an angry line. She could feel the fury radiating off of him now.</p><p>Tyler paid him no mind and murmured in her ear, \u201cYou ever been taken anally?\u201d</p><p>Del had pondered it. Some of her friends admitted to loving it. Eric had mentioned it a lot early in their marriage, but she\u2019d always shied away.</p><p>Tyler pushed her hair off her damp neck, letting his lips linger just below her ear. \u201cYes or no, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I . . .\u201d</p><p>He withdrew from her pussy and plunged two fingers inside her. Purpose driving him, Tyler rubbed a spot against her front wall, just behind her clit that had her eyes bulging and her breath stuttering.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re burning me up. You have one hot, tight cunt, angel. I could stay here all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s exhausted.\u201d Eric\u2019s voice was low and tight.</p><p>Del frowned. Did his objection really have anything to do with her well-being?</p><p>Tyler blew Eric off. \u201cNot entirely. I can make her come.\u201d</p><p>Could he ever . . .</p><p>The thought had barely crossed her mind when he pulled his fingers free. Immediately, he eased those two digits into her untried backside\u2014at the same time he shoved his cock deep in her clutching, swollen pussy again.</p><p>Nerve endings roared, swirled, gathered, tensed. She held her breath, the world stopping completely, except for her roaring heart. Tyler pulled back, then slammed home again, his fingers in her backside creating sensations she\u2019d never imagined and couldn\u2019t repress. She went off like a fireworks display, all explosions and bright colors behind her eyes. Her body jerked, shuddered. She\u2019d never felt anything so intense.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like having your ass fucked,\u201d Tyler murmured silkily in her ear before she\u2019d even caught her breath. \u201cI\u2019d love to give it to you so sweet and slow that you\u2019d cry.\u201d</p><p>Del believed he could do that. And, God help her, she wanted it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere near my wife\u2019s ass.\u201d Eric\u2019s eyes had darkened from annoyance to condemnation. \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a prick,\u201d Tyler groused. \u201cWith as much shit as she put up with lately from you, she needs this. Don\u2019t you want your woman happy?\u201d</p><p>Warmth suffused Del. How had he known how badly she needed to be held and wanted?</p><p>Eric\u2019s face simply closed up.</p><p>No matter how much she\u2019d love to stay in this moment with the lover who\u2019d given her more consideration and pleasure than any other, she had to think about her marriage.</p><p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d she tried to protest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not giving up for him.\u201d Tyler punctuated the statement with a honey-slow slide into her pussy and a gentle thrust of his fingers into her ass. \u201cYou\u2019ve given up everything in the last three months to care for him. The least he can do since he started this is to let us finish it.\u201d</p><p>Del melted. Her body felt so heavy and boneless, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to move. Then Tyler rocked into her, one smooth stroke after another. Sensations danced again. Her libido was like a car engine: Once revved, she was ready to race. It seemed like seconds before pleasure clutched low in her belly and another orgasm raced through her veins.</p><p>Before the burning pressure gave way to ecstasy, Tyler stopped, cursed, and withdrew.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she protested automatically. \u201cPlease don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Eric grabbed her face and forced her gaze to him. \u201cYou like him fucking you?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, her own anger swelling. But unleashing it wouldn\u2019t solve this situation. \u201cYou started this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019s being an ass about it,\u201d Tyler asserted. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about you, dude.\u201d</p><p>Before her husband could reply, Tyler turned her into his embrace and perched her butt on the arm of the sofa. With impatient hands, he spread her legs impossibly wide, then surged back into her pussy.</p><p>Then he drilled his stare deep into her, somehow fusing them together. \u201cI fucking need you, Del. Now.\u201d</p><p>His first thrust came hard and fast. And deep. So damn deep, Del swore she\u2019d never lose the sensation of him being inside her. She groped behind her, trying to stabilize herself.</p><p>Before she could fall, Tyler reached around her waist and hauled her closer, spreading her legs even wider with his hips. He kissed her neck, her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Helplessly, her gaze flew up to his, so green, so intent. In that moment, she could read him: his determination to make her feel good, the surprise at their insane sexual chemistry, the need to see her not just sated but happy.</p><p>He tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, then placed a lingering kiss over her mouth. Electric longing jolted through her body. For that fraction of time, it was just the two of them, and Del gave herself completely to Tyler.</p><p>Eyes closed, she threw her arms around his neck, trusting that he would hold her in place tightly against him. And he did as he eased in again and again, deep inside her, fusing their mouths together.</p><p>God, he was not just inside her now, but a part of her. She and Eric had been married for two years, and she\u2019d had her fair share of college sex, but nothing had been more intimate than this. Tyler\u2019s hot breath against her lips, followed by the probe of his softly searching tongue. His sweat-damp chest smashed against hers, their hearts both pounding crazy fast in sync. Him clutching her backside and pulling her so close . . . No one else existed. It was just the two of them and the steadily rising tide of pleasure that threatened to drown her.</p><p>\u201cDel.\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s voice sounded damn near frantic. His deep, rapid breaths betrayed his excitement, and it spiked a thrill within her.</p><p>\u201cDel!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m here. Whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, I need to be deeper inside you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she wanted that, too. \u201cYou\u2019re as deep as you can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Unbelievably, his cock hardened even more. Her heart swelled with the thought that he needed her so much. She felt that need as he shoved a fist in her hair and pulled until her lips fit perfectly against his. Then he kissed her, hot, urgent, until she clutched at him and gasped into the hot cavern of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he swore against her lips. \u201cNothing has ever been better. Take all of me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded frantically.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Del didn\u2019t think that was possible until he was shuddering and shouting, his entire body tense, his cock pulsing thickly inside her. His pleasure provoked hers. Desire broadsided her. She held her breath as a short, violent release stormed its way through her body.</p><p>\u201cTyler!\u201d she screamed, orgasm ravaging her until she leaned limp and sated against his chest, her breathing slowly coming back under control as he cuddled her against him, a tender hand soothing her back.</p><p>Suddenly, clapping erupted behind her. Instantly, the spell was broken.</p><p>Del jerked her gaze around to see Eric slowly clapping, fury dripping from his expression. \u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if that was great porn or just a really fucking disloyal stab in the back.\u201d He gripped his chin in mock thought, then shook his head. \u201cNo. Actually, I know the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe gave you what you asked for here,\u201d Tyler bit out, holding her protectively, still buried inside her.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You were supposed to fuck her at my direction, not cling to her like she mattered and make love to her.\u201d</p><p>Tyler had made something that felt a whole lot like love to her. She\u2019d made love back with him at the end. Guilt swamped her.</p><p>Using his arms, Eric clambered off the couch, heading for his wheelchair. There was no doubt in Del\u2019s mind that he intended to charge Tyler and . . . what, pick a fight? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced back at Tyler, meaning to warn him. He met her stare, his face tightening.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare regret this now, Del,\u201d he growled under the panting and huffing Eric made as he tried to work back into his chair.</p><p>Del winced. Too late. \u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here to deal with his shitty mood alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cH-he\u2019s just being a mean drunk. I can handle him.\u201d Tyler\u2019s mouth pursed, like he was going to get stubborn. She shook her head and gave him a gentle shove. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>Tyler cursed, then sighed. Slowly, he began to withdraw his softening cock from her. The second he pulled free, she noticed the copious wetness\u2014and the pieces of latex.</p><p>The condom had broken. Her eyes bulged in dismay. Before she could release the gasp on the tip of her tongue, Tyler slapped a finger over her lips. She had no trouble reading his warning expression. Shh. This will only piss Eric off more.</p><p>And riling her husband more now would definitely make matters worse, so she gave Tyler a shaky nod, but . . . She had stopped taking the pill after Eric\u2019s accident. Tyler had to suspect that. Quickly, Del did the math. Her last period had ended eleven days ago. How likely was it that she was fertile now?</p><p>Her eyes slid shut, but everything inside her trembled. Very.</p> <p>Tyler grabbed his T-shirt from the floor and used it to quickly wipe them both clean as Eric situated himself in his wheelchair. Then Tyler buttoned his jeans, wadded the shirt into a ball, and shoved most of it in his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay?\u201d he asked reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cFine. Go. I\u2019ll call you when he\u2019s calmed down.\u201d</p><p>He still hesitated, and Del knew he didn\u2019t like leaving her to Eric\u2019s wrath. She could handle it. She\u2019d become all too used to his terrible moods since the shooting.</p><p>With a final caress on her cheek, Tyler stepped around her and got in Eric\u2019s face, leaning down, hands braced on the arms of his wheelchair.</p><p>\u201cYou going to fight me about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I asked for, and you damn well know it! Get the hell out of my house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a douche bag. I couldn\u2019t come at that angle, so I flipped Del around. And now you\u2019re pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just fuck her. Admit it. And you weren\u2019t simply trying to come, but to shut me out. If I\u2019d realized how badly you\u2019ve got it for Del, I would have called Becker the Pecker.\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s assertion startled Del. Her husband thought that Tyler had feelings for her beyond friendship? No. She knew better.</p><p>Or she had before tonight. The way he\u2019d touched her, cared about her pleasure and well-being, the way he\u2019d kissed her . . . All that had been way beyond friendly.</p><p>She flipped a startled gaze over to Tyler. He wasn\u2019t denying Eric\u2019s accusation. Instead, he clenched his jaw and refused to look at her.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, get out now!\u201d Eric growled.</p> <p>Tyler flinched. Del rushed over, placing a soft, reassuring touch on his shoulder, as she often had. But now everything was different. The feel of his bare skin under her hand swamped her with longing. They\u2019d just had sex minutes ago. He\u2019d given her five amazing orgasms. But it wasn\u2019t just about sex. She ached to be close to him, feel his arms around her. Why?</p><p>Suddenly, she wasn\u2019t too certain she wanted the answer. More guilt crashed over her. She\u2019d agreed to Eric\u2019s request to save her marriage, not have great sex. Not fall for someone else. She had to put tonight out of her mind and focus on the man she\u2019d pledged her life to.</p><p>Slowly, she withdrew her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Go. Eric and I have to work this out.\u201d</p><p>Tyler stiffened at her dismissal, no matter how soft. \u201cCall me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She drifted toward the door. \u201cAre you okay to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk. Let me know if you need anything.\u201d He grabbed her hand. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hand off my wife and get the hell out the door,\u201d Eric shouted.</p><p>Del cringed. How could such a loving, giving friendship have gone so south in one night? She prayed that tomorrow everything would go back to normal. Would Eric be able to put this behind him, forgive and forget? And how would she ever look at Tyler again without remembering that feeling of being one with him?</p><p>She feared she never would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered to Tyler.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I fucked everything up.\u201d He drilled his stare into her, eyes so green and direct. \u201cI just . . . I couldn\u2019t say no to having you.\u201d</p><p>Shock vibrated through her at his confession. He\u2019d wanted her before tonight?</p><p>She was still grappling for a response when he slammed the door behind him.</p><p>In that moment, Del had never imagined that she wouldn\u2019t see Tyler again for two years or that she\u2019d give birth to his son on her own. She only knew the profound sadness of someone really valuable leaving.</p><p>The second the door shut, Eric began shouting, \u201cWhat the hell? You came for him five times! You\u2019ve never let yourself go like that for me. What\u2019s that supposed to mean, that I\u2019m not man enough for you? That you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d argued all night, and as the hours slipped past, no amount of reassurance had been enough for Eric because she couldn\u2019t deny that being with Tyler had fundamentally changed her feelings for him forever. In the days that followed, she\u2019d cut off contact with him\u2014at Eric\u2019s insistence\u2014to try to save her marriage. In the end, she\u2019d lost both men.</p><p>Del blinked, returning to the present, to Tyler\u2019s guest room and Seth\u2019s little grunt as he rolled over in his sleep. It was time\u2014and her heart was breaking.</p><p>Before she remembered all the reasons that she\u2019d rather stay in Lafayette with Tyler and Seth and enjoy life, rather than risk it, she rose from the bed, scrambled into her clean clothes, shoved on her shoes, grabbed her bag, and leaned over to pat Seth. Del wished desperately that she could kiss him once more, but didn\u2019t dare risk disturbing him. So she found the note she\u2019d written earlier with Seth\u2019s care instructions and left it on the nightstand, then slipped out the window as silently as possible with a last glance back at the little boy. She hoped that father and son would forgive her someday\u2014if she made it out alive. If not . . . at least she\u2019d die knowing she\u2019d done so trying to give her son life once more.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>JUST before dawn, Del parked her neighbor\u2019s run-down car in the long-term parking garage at the airport in New Orleans. She was exhausted, but she\u2019d have to sleep on the plane back to Los Angeles. No time now. Still, second-guessing haunted her. Had Tyler discovered her absence yet? Was he angry or resigned? Would he be able to care for the son he knew so little about? She wished she could have left him more than a note. Would Seth be all right, happy? Regret weakened every muscle in her body with the need to run back to her little boy. She had to keep reminding herself that dealing with Carlson now gave her and Seth the only chance for a future.</p><p>After a long trek to the terminal, she made her way to the ticket counter. She\u2019d stopped briefly at a twenty-four-hour diner on the outskirts of town for a cup of coffee and an egg. She was down to her last five bucks. It would have to hold her for now because she refused to ask Tyler for money. He\u2019d already taken on caring for their son. That was more than enough responsibility for a man used to easy living and fucking even easier women at every possible opportunity.</p><p>At the caf\u00e9 near the airport, she\u2019d used a pay phone to call the airlines to book a fare home. It was heinously expensive since she was traveling last minute, but Glenda\u2019s car wasn\u2019t reliable enough to risk trekking back across the country alone. And she didn\u2019t have the cash for more gas.</p><p>To book her flight, Del had been forced to use a credit card. She prayed that Carlson\u2019s reach didn\u2019t extend all the way from Los Angeles County to Orleans Parish. Or that he wouldn\u2019t have a team of thugs waiting for her when she arrived.</p><p>Inside the mostly deserted terminal, the chill of the air-conditioning hit her, a relief after the sweltering humidity outside. A bleary-eyed airline rep manned the ticket counter. A check-in kiosk blinked nearby, clearly on the fritz. She chose another, trying to keep her head down and her face out of the security cameras, just in case. If Carlson had influence here somehow, she had no doubt that he could have her arrested on some trumped-up charge and thrown into a backwater jail to rot. The deeper she\u2019d dug, the more she\u2019d realized that he dealt with his enemies ruthlessly. She hadn\u2019t told Tyler the half of what she\u2019d been through. He\u2019d berate her for not coming to him sooner if he knew.</p><p>In a few moments, the machine spit out her boarding pass. The sliding doors behind her opened. An old lady with a cartful of luggage, pushed by a hunk of man wearing jeans and a low-slung cap entered. Dismissing them as a threat, Del turned toward the security line, dragging her duffel. The bleary-eyed TSA agent talked to a guy in a suit.</p><p>As she approached, another man sporting his Brooks Brothers look emerged from the nearby men\u2019s room\u2014and kicked her instincts into high gear for two reasons: First, he and the dude talking to the TSA agent locked gazes and had a tense, seemingly silent conversation. Second, the air conditioner caught his suit coat. It flapped open just enough to see the shiny black semiautomatic in a shoulder holster.</p><p>A moment later, they both turned and headed straight for her.</p><p>If they were packing heat and in the airport\u2019s security line merely to board a plane, they\u2019d be flashing badges and marching through, not looking at her.</p><p>So there was a good chance they\u2019d come here for her, and they meant business.</p><p>Delaney looked around for an exit. The TSA agent watched raptly, like he might a good action flick. She spotted the old lady with the mountain of luggage standing at the ticket counter, deep in conversation with the agent. The man who\u2019d been carting her luggage was nowhere to be seen. And her only means of escape was the glass double doors she\u2019d entered through. She turned and darted for them.</p><p>The first of the suited-up guys looking stylish enough to star in a TV cop drama reached her quickly. He grabbed her arm. She felt something distinctly hard and metallic poke her ribs. \u201cNot a peep, Ms. Catalano. Come with us quietly. We\u2019d like to ask you a few questions.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes were hard and challenging, as if he knew she was going to be a problem. As if he\u2019d been warned that she didn\u2019t want to just die quietly. His partner\u2019s strawberry blond hair should have given him an Opie Taylor, \u201caw shucks\u201d appearance, but a pair of flinty eyes and the hard set of his mouth made him look entirely menacing.</p><p>Del\u2019s instincts told her they had orders to kill her.</p><p>She resisted the tug on her arm, digging in her heels. \u201cWho are you? What do you want? I need to see your identification.\u201d</p><p>Neither offered up a badge. The dark one just tugged on her arm again.</p><p>\u201cNo! You have no right to do this. I won\u2019t go with you. Anything you have to say to me can be said here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not make a scene,\u201d Opie said to her. \u201cCome quietly.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no.</p><p>Having been married to a cop and good friends with another, Del knew more than a bit of self-defense. Yes, the pretty bastard could shoot her, but she was guessing that he wanted her someplace private to kill her so that he didn\u2019t have to make a scene and do a lot of explaining later.</p><p>She nodded meekly. When he began to lead her away, she elbowed him in the gut. He grunted and released her, then she kicked Opie in the balls. After a rousing chorus of moans, she turned and punched the dark one in the nose, satisfied when he began to bleed. Opie grabbed her by the hair viciously, making Del\u2019s eyes water. But she stomped on his toes as hard as she possibly could. He released her instantly, muttering a foul curse.</p><p>Breathing hard, heart racing, she ran for the exit. For now, she pushed away the implications that she wasn\u2019t going to make her flight, wouldn\u2019t make it home to put Carlson away so she could get her life back. Instead, she focused on her deep suspicion that if pretty boy and Opie caught up to her again, she\u2019d be hauled away\u2014then silenced for good. Her only hope was to keep running.</p><p>As she hauled ass for the exit, dragging her duffel, Del prayed for a waiting taxi, but even if she could find one, the two thugs were hot on her heels. She could hear them over her pounding feet and pumping heart. She\u2019d have no time to negotiate with the driver and store her luggage, much less make a clean getaway. Not that she had any money to pay her fare, either.</p><p>Now what?</p><p>A grunt and a splat behind her had Del glancing over her shoulder. Pretty boy was sprawled face down on the floor, gasping and flailing. Had he tripped? Opie was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Del didn\u2019t know what had happened and wasn\u2019t about to the question her good fortune as she made her way back outside, bathed in the morning sunlight and New Orleans humidity. A taxi driver waited nearby, leaning against his cab, looking at her hopefully. It would be the most anonymous form of transportation\u2014if she had cash. She was going to have to retrieve that ramshackle car from the garage and drive . . . where? To another airport? A bus station? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d figure it out later.</p><p>As she crossed to the parking garage, a man emerged seemingly from nowhere, peeling himself away from the shadows. She didn\u2019t get a good look at him before he glued himself to her backside and gripped her arm. She had no time to shriek or scream for help. He clapped his free hand over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNot a sound, angel. Let\u2019s make a nice, clean exit.\u201d</p><p>Tyler?</p> <p>Slowly, he lowered his hand from her mouth but kept a hold on her arm, guiding her left. Del risked a glance over her shoulder. She could see Tyler\u2019s beefy chest and neck, his full mouth. Shadow concealed the rest under a familiar cap.</p><p>Relief flooded her. She shouldn\u2019t be so thankful. She shouldn\u2019t blindly put her trust in him to save her when he didn\u2019t know the situation. But instinctively, she already had.</p><p>\u201cYou helped the old woman in with her luggage?\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly. \u201cYou would have noticed me if I\u2019d come in alone.\u201d</p><p>By blending in and giving himself a role, she hadn\u2019t given him another thought.</p> <p>Then a terrible thought occurred to her. \u201cWhere is Seth? Oh my God! You didn\u2019t leave him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have known I was a father for less than twenty-four hours, but I would never leave him home alone. Deke stayed the night with him when I took off after you. Kimber and Alyssa are watching him today, with a little help from Tara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know them.\u201d It killed her to think of her baby with strangers. They didn\u2019t strike her as predatory or mean at all, but he was a defenseless child among many adults with seemingly interesting sexual proclivities . . .</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve trusted them with my life. They will treat Seth like one of their own. He\u2019s far safer with them than with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go back and take care of him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking chance. I\u2019m with you every step of the way until Carlson is dead or behind bars. You\u2019re not getting more than five feet from me. No negotiations, no arguments. If you don\u2019t like it, Jack and Deke will be happy to help me keep you locked down in Lafayette while I put Carlson away myself. Your choice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going! You have no right to take over or make decisions for me,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making it my right.\u201d</p><p>Del didn\u2019t dare ask what that meant. It sounded possessive. Her belly flipped. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that! I\u2019m a grown woman and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho almost got herself killed not five minutes ago. You\u2019re out of your element and in over your head. If you insist on coming with me, this is where I take over. You stand a much better chance surviving to raise Seth if you let me help you.\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s words sank in. Del couldn\u2019t deny that he was right. It bugged the hell out of her, but she\u2019d be stupid to insist that she had this under control. Clearly, Carlson\u2019s reach was farther and his methods more ruthless than she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>Still . . . \u201cThis can\u2019t be your fight. What if Carlson kills us both? Then Seth has no parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>What a male thing to say. \u201cIs that you being arrogant or trying to make me feel better?\u201d</p> <p>Wrapping his arm around her waist, Tyler brought her even closer as he led her toward his truck. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! My car is this way.\u201d She pointed across the garage in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d With another tug, he dragged her away from her neighbor\u2019s old compact.</p><p>A part of her was infuriated\u2014at both him and herself for allowing it. Another part was simply relieved.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the two goons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit the one with the dark hair in the back of the head with a luggage cart. I tased the other and sat him on a nearby chair so that he looks asleep. I have their weapons tucked in my waistband.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done all that by himself, without wasting a second or raising a ruckus?</p><p>Eric had always called Tyler a bad ass when they\u2019d been partners, but he\u2019d never been anything but teasing and kind with her. Del felt like she was seeing a whole new side of her son\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Carlson sends more assholes after you? Thirty minutes, tops. We\u2019ve got to get on the road ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving you to L.A. We\u2019re going to put Carlson down together.\u201d</p><p>Del opened her mouth to object . . . but didn\u2019t have any new excuses to give him. Seth wouldn\u2019t be safe with them, and she had to believe that he was in capable hands. She\u2019d be safer with Tyler by her side while she regathered her evidence, wrote her article, and put Carlson down.</p><p>The thing she feared for most now? Her heart.</p><p>Tyler shoved Del into his truck and down to the floorboard. She glared at him with confusion before he thrust a khaki green blanket at her. \u201cCover up. Security cameras are swarming. They\u2019ll catch us walking together in the parking garage. I parked in a very dark corner, so there\u2019s a chance they won\u2019t be able to see if you got in the truck. It has to look like you\u2019re not with me when we leave the airport.\u201d</p><p>He was right. With a nod, she crouched down and covered herself, thankful when he turned on the air-conditioning. The sun\u2019s zenith might be hours away, but the stifling Louisiana humidity was nothing this California girl had ever felt.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he grunted. Then he set a backpack on top of her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the lightest thing, but it wouldn\u2019t take long to get out of the airport. The extra cover would be more convincing for the cameras.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>The first few minutes were nerve-racking. A million thoughts raced through her head in the silence. Every bump in the road was magnified on the floorboard, as was the purr of the engine. Moments later, his phone rang.</p><p>\u201cYeah? I got her, Deke. Seth okay?\u201d He paused. \u201cGood. Let him sleep. Listen, get Tara up and to her computer. We need to find out exactly how Del might have been traced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy credit card.\u201d Del knew her voice would be muffled by the blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d From that tone, Del knew that Tyler had heard her and questioned her sanity more than her words.</p><p>\u201cI waited as long as I could. I hoped that Carlson didn\u2019t know anyone in Louisiana.\u201d</p><p>Tyler sighed. \u201cHe can hire guns in a heartbeat. No more credit cards. They\u2019re too traceable. Did you hear that?\u201d he asked Deke. \u201cRight. See if Tara can prove that Carlson\u2019s been tapping her credit card records. Del?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She wished she could see him, but it shouldn\u2019t be too much longer before they exited the airport\u2014provided airport security hadn\u2019t picked up the entire altercation in the terminal and decided to hunt her down.</p><p>\u201cHang on and stay quiet.\u201d</p><p>The truck slowed. Her heart stopped.</p><p>The electronic window rolled down a moment later, and Tyler said, \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d The cashier made a noncommittal sound. \u201cIs it? You\u2019re here early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust dropping off someone for a flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo dollars.\u201d</p><p>After a rustling of bills, the window buzzed back up and the truck started moving again, picking up speed every second they rolled.</p><p>He lifted the backpack off of her, then tossed the blanket back a fraction. Cool air washed over her face, and she sighed with something between pleasure and relief.</p><p>Tyler jacked the phone back up to his ear. \u201cStay down another minute, Del. There are a few cops hanging around. Until we know who\u2019s involved . . .\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t trust anyone. That had been his and Eric\u2019s motto when they\u2019d been together on the force.</p><p>The cab of the truck remained deathly silent except for her own breathing for the next few minutes. Finally, Tyler reached down and helped her into the passenger\u2019s seat. \u201cGood. Now, tell me, do you have a copy of the police report about the bomb that exploded your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know who I could trust. I\u2019d been asking questions at the precinct. I couldn\u2019t get anyone to help me. I thought about calling Eric, but . . . After the bomb exploded, I just grabbed Seth, borrowed a neighbor\u2019s car, and left town with nothing but the cash in my pocket. I stopped for a few supplies along the way and called an investigative reporter friend of mine, Lisa. She\u2019d been helping me track you down. Once we pieced all the clues together, I drove straight to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Tyler\u2019s jaw tensed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know if it was C4 or a binary explosive? If it was an engine ignition or a remote detonation device?\u201d</p><p>God, she\u2019d seen the blast in her head a million times since it happened. Felt the shock, the roaring heat, heard the deafening roar of the blast. But she\u2019d never picked the scene apart mentally with that much detail.</p><p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know anything about explosives, so no idea what they used. I started the car with my key fob. As I turned to pick Seth up, everything blew up. Damn near vaporized it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear that, Deke? Yeah, I agree, sounds like it was rigged to blow when the ignition turned over.\u201d Tyler turned a serious gaze on her. \u201cDo you remember anything else? See anyone unusual loitering? Notice that your car had been tampered with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It was early morning. There was no one on the street. The sun wasn\u2019t all the way up, so I couldn\u2019t see anything unusual about my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the explosion, I screamed and stumbled back, shoving Seth to the ground. I covered him with my body. I got some scratches and bruises. He was okay, just scared. Oh, and it smelled terrible. A weird kind of . . . burned-orange-peel smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Tyler gripped the cell phone even tighter. \u201cSemtex, Deke?\u201d He paused. \u201cYeah, run it by Jack. He\u2019d know since he likes things that go boom. Let me know what he says. I\u2019ll call later.\u201d</p><p>With that, he hung up and turned to her. Whatever she\u2019d said . . . Tyler\u2019s face more than hinted it wasn\u2019t good. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even pretend to misunderstand. \u201cSemtex is the former Eastern Bloc\u2019s version of C4. It often smells like a burnt orange peel. None of the other explosives really leave a signature odor like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEastern Bloc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopular with the Russian Mob. They come up during your research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. From what I can tell, Carlson deals with street thugs and local drug dealers, not organized crime. Where would he get that kind of explosive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom some really bad assholes. This shit is worse than I thought.\u201d</p><p>Del dropped her face into her hand. Suddenly, staying alive felt like something way beyond her ability. \u201cHow\u2019s Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, angel. Still asleep. Kimber and Alyssa will be there to get him soon and take him for a playdate with their kids.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Seth would enjoy having new friends and the chance to run around like a kid, not spend the day cooped up in a car. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Still, worry plagued her. What happened if they didn\u2019t catch Carlson right away? What happened if all her sources had dried up or refused to talk? She couldn\u2019t leave Seth indefinitely.</p><p>Or what if Carlson found him?</p><p>\u201cI see that look. Stop worrying,\u201d Tyler warned. \u201cJack and Deke will never let anything happen to Seth. I swear it. Jack is a former Army Ranger. Deke was also military and did a little time with the FBI and still has connections all over the place. Seth couldn\u2019t be safer.\u201d</p><p>Those credentials did make her relax a bit. Her son was definitely safer with them. \u201cIf I thought for a second that giving up this story would make Carlson go away, for Seth\u2019s safety, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere along the way, you drew blood. You could have flown under Carlson\u2019s radar if you hadn\u2019t confronted him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to catch him off guard and that he\u2019d say something for the record that was incriminating.\u201d</p><p>Tyler just shook his head. \u201cBut since you did confront him . . . he\u2019ll do anything to prevent what you know from going public. Today demonstrated that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he destroyed all my latest notes, it\u2019s going to take some backtracking to put the pieces of his warped puzzle back together so I can prove what I know. Right now, all I\u2019ve got is my word about a conversation I overheard, plus a thug willing to pin a crime on a respected member of the community\u2014none of that will hold up in court. I did get a chance to back up some of my evidence a few weeks before the explosion.\u201d</p><p>Tyler sat up, hyper-focused. \u201cIn a safe-deposit box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She bit her lip. He wasn\u2019t going to like her answer. \u201cI put what I had at the time on a flash drive. I tried to think of the very last place that anyone would look for it. It couldn\u2019t be my house or office. A safe-deposit box seemed too obvious. So . . . I snuck into Eric\u2019s place.\u201d Tyler\u2019s eyes went wide, and before he could object, she plowed ahead. \u201cEveryone in law enforcement circles knows our divorce was ugly. I figured if Carlson asked around about me, he\u2019d never imagine that I\u2019d hide my backup at Eric\u2019s. I put it where I used to hide anything I wanted to keep private.\u201d Even from Eric. Birthday cards from Tyler and her journal came to mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen you called, he didn\u2019t respond. So you need to get in the house and retrieve your evidence. Any chance Carlson knows that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he? People don\u2019t normally leave valuable items at their bitter ex\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bank might have been more obvious, but it would have been more secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil he found some trumped-up way to subpoena the contents.\u201d</p> <p>Sighing, Tyler reached for her hand. \u201cYeah. This is all kinds of fucked up, but we\u2019re going to fix it, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to come with me.\u201d</p><p>Tyler gritted his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t start that again. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>Del knew that tone of voice well. Conversation over. He\u2019d used it countless times before on suspects\u2014and a time or two on Eric. That deep conviction rumbling from his chest always gave her the shivers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one who wants to protect our son,\u201d he said softly.</p> <p>And she loved that about Tyler. When he cared, he cared big.</p><p>\u201cI understand, but I want to be clear: What happened last night in your bedroom can\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare let him melt her resolve to keep distance between them. That kiss had been a huge mistake. They had a clear objective to take down Carlson and make Seth\u2019s life safer. Anything else just complicated the situation. Tyler, being a heartbreaker, made it all even more complicated. She\u2019d never forget the breathless, sublime moments she\u2019d touched him, had him deep inside her. They\u2019d connected in a way she never had with any lover. But he\u2019d taken a chunk of her heart . . . and then he\u2019d moved on. That\u2019s who he was, and she\u2019d be a fool to think that she\u2014or even Seth\u2014was going to change him.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to back off, keep my hands to myself?\u201d</p><p>Even the thought of his hands on her made her belly flip. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tyler turned to her as the empty road flew past and the sun crawled up the sky. His green eyes gleamed. He sent her a cocky grin. \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath, angel.\u201d</p> <p>THE morning passed by in a blur of tense silence and road stripes as mile after mile of back roads rolled by. They drove in a meandering path west as the sun rose. Tyler\u2019s cell phone rang off and on, but his terse, one-sided conversations made little sense. But she understood that they were meeting someone in Houston for an exchange. If Tyler intended to pass her off to someone else for safekeeping, she\u2019d leave him in the dust.</p><p>Del didn\u2019t start the argument because he was strung really tight. He looked in the rearview mirror constantly. The police scanner tucked under his dash sputtered off and on, and he jumped to attention every time it did. She realized that he expected someone to be following them from New Orleans.</p><p>They hit the outskirts of Houston just before lunch. The morning rush had dissipated, but they still slogged through some heavy traffic. He stopped behind a gas station/mini-mart a few miles off the highway and told her to use the bathroom if she needed to. She did, keeping her head low around their cameras. On her way out, she longingly eyed the water bottles, but she was almost flat broke. And she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d ask Tyler for anything more. He was already extending himself to help her. She refused to be a leech. When they got to L.A., she\u2019d access the emergency fund she\u2019d stashed in her garden.</p><p>Emerging from the little service station as traffic lazed by in the muggy air, Del came to a complete stop when she saw Tyler talking to a beautiful Asian woman with sleek curls brushing the top of her ass and a dress that wasn\u2019t much longer.</p><p>The woman spoke in animated hand gestures and a wink. Tyler grinned. An immediate stab of jealousy knifed her in the heart. Del took a deep breath. Tyler wasn\u2019t her man. He\u2019d kissed her. So what? Apparently, he had a mad crush on his boss, Alyssa. Ex-boss. Whatever. Del knew that Tyler\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t hers, and that was for the best. Once this was behind them, they\u2019d figure out some custodial arrangement beneficial to all and go their mostly separate ways. Tyler had always had a healthy sex drive and liked a lot of variety. Obviously, nothing had changed.</p><p>He caught sight of her and motioned her over. Swallowing the anger she didn\u2019t want to feel, she made her way to the duo.</p><p>\u201cDel, this is May. Remember Tara, back in Lafayette, married to one of the Edgington brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe redhead who isn\u2019t pregnant, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYet. Logan is taking a land-based assignment in a few months. He\u2019ll fix that quickly, I\u2019m sure. Anyway, he has a friend named Xander who sent May to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She grabbed his arm. \u201cExcuse us,\u201d she said, dragging Tyler away from the beauty with the kohl-rimmed eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe fewer people who know what\u2019s going on the better,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI don\u2019t know Logan, much less his friend. And who is this woman? We\u2019re trusting her because she\u2019s a friend\u2019s friend\u2019s . . . girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, then wrapped an arm around her waist, the gesture meant to comfort. \u201cI get it, but we don\u2019t have more appealing options. I\u2019d trust Logan with my life. Xander is solid. This woman hasn\u2019t been told anything except to exchange cars with us. Carlson\u2019s goons will have gotten the license plate number to my truck from the security cameras at the airport in New Orleans. They\u2019ll be tracking a black truck with Louisiana plates and giving law enforcement my plate number. I guarantee you, if we\u2019d stayed in the truck longer, we would have been pulled over on some bullshit charge and detained until Carlson could reach us. Since you bought a plane ticket, he knows your destination, angel. If you think he isn\u2019t watching I-10 like a hawk, you\u2019re deluding yourself. Now get in the car.\u201d</p><p>Del closed her mouth. Of course Carlson would have law enforcement on his side. For all she knew, he\u2019d put out an APB on her. Did that make Tyler guilty of aiding and abetting? Was some crooked, small-town cop waiting just around the next bend for Tyler\u2019s big truck to appear so they could pull it over? She realized now that she\u2019d only crossed the country unaccosted because Carlson hadn\u2019t known her destination, and he hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d be driving her neighbor\u2019s car. The kind widow had gone for a month to visit her daughter who lived overseas and wouldn\u2019t miss the little Honda for weeks.</p><p>But with her stunt this morning, Del realized that she\u2019d killed their element of surprise and put them both in danger.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t . . . think it all the way through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to thinking like this. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, angel. Get in the car, and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then thanked May as she walked toward the sleek, gray Lexus sedan. She pulled the doors open, marveling at the new-car smell of the leather seats. Everything was pristine. The car probably cost more than she\u2019d made last year. It was love at first sight.</p><p>Especially when she spotted the small cooler of water bottles sitting on the floorboard of the passenger\u2019s side. She grabbed one gratefully as Tyler climbed in and pulled away. He watched May drive off with his truck in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving her your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truck isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou own it, right? It\u2019s worth a lot of money and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not worth your life.\u201d</p><p>Del\u2019s heart flipped. He was so damn loyal. How could she not melt a little?</p><p>\u201cMay is taking it to a nearby garage, where it will stay out of sight. If everything goes well, I\u2019ll collect the truck later.\u201d</p><p>Del heard the note of finality in his voice. It was better if she stopped arguing. She didn\u2019t cede control of anything easily, but Tyler had a plan he\u2019d apparently thought out pretty well. She\u2019d been running for days on caffeine and adrenaline.</p><p>As they left Houston, they grabbed a fast-food lunch and headed toward San Antonio. The gentle rolling hills and greenery turned peaceful. The traffic tapered off to damn near nothing. The purr of the engine and the motion of the car lulled her to sleep.</p><p>She woke hours later to the sun setting. Her neck was stiff, and the landscape had given way to pure, flat desert. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout halfway between San Antonio and El Paso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I conked out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last sleep a whole night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week. Thursday.\u201d</p><p>Tyler reached for her hand. \u201cYou risked everything to bring Seth to me. I know things went to hell between us before, but I\u2019m glad you trusted me.\u201d</p><p>Tears axed the back of her eyes, stinging. \u201cHe\u2019s the most precious thing in my life. Our parting may not have been great, but I knew you\u2019d take care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you down, Del. My friends will give him the best care possible. And I\u2019m going to take care of you, too.\u201d</p><p>How easy it would be to lean against him and let him handle everything. She did trust him. He would keep her safe and do a killer job investigating. He\u2019d been a great detective, after all. But doing that would be so damn unfair to him. She\u2019d upended his life after dropping a major bombshell on him. She had to pull her own weight. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in over her head. Just let me handle everything.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a request. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>Del bit her lip and nodded. She\u2019d prove useful as soon as they got to L.A.</p><p>In a little town with a population south of ten thousand, they stopped for a restroom and dinner break. They had limited food options. A rubber chicken sandwich and some fries later, they were back on the road. Del offered to drive. Tyler just shook his head.</p><p>Hours later, they pulled up into a dated motel off the highway in El Paso. Tyler unfolded himself out of the car. \u201cWait here and lock the doors.\u201d</p><p>He had to be exhausted . . . yet he continued to worry about her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Go.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a ball cap from the backseat and shoved it over his head, pulling the bill low. Then he disappeared into the hot, windy night. A few minutes later, he returned and, without a word, pulled the car around to the back of the motel.</p><p>\u201cNo one driving by will see this car from any road. I gave the manager a fake name and extra cash not to care.\u201d He exited the car, then grabbed her duffel from the trunk.</p><p>Inside, the room was painfully clean. Aging industrial carpet and stark white walls made it clear this wasn\u2019t the Ritz. She didn\u2019t care. There were two beds and a shower. She could kiss Tyler for making this happen.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t\u2014for her sanity.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She shut the door and locked it behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo argument about not having separate rooms?\u201d</p><p>Staying with him was a bit dangerous, since she was feeling so ridiculously vulnerable yet grateful, but . . . \u201cNo. Safety in numbers. I appreciate the separate beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, and I\u2019d prepared my speech, too.\u201d</p><p>Despite her exhaustion, Del smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not a good idea. I\u2019d just planned to say that you weren\u2019t getting your own room. Separate beds is as much space as I\u2019m willing to give you.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie. I\u2019d rather spend the night in your bed. In your body. I\u2019ve missed you like hell, Del.\u201d</p><p>His words shocked her. God, she could even hear the longing in his voice, and it did something to her that wasn\u2019t good for her resolve. Cuddling up to Tyler all night, feeling the demanding press of his kiss, the hard thrust of his cock, waking up in his arms\u2014it all sounded heavenly. But not smart. She was a mom now; she couldn\u2019t afford flings. And Tyler didn\u2019t do permanent.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say things like that. We can\u2019t do things like that. There\u2019s too much at stake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that. It\u2019s just . . . the thought of you in danger makes me want to kill the motherfucker threatening you, then rip off every stitch of your clothing and take you in every way known to man.\u201d</p><p>Del swallowed, trying to absorb the impact of those words. They reverberated through her, pinging wildly, before finally rousing an ache in her chest and her pussy. She\u2019d never known another man who could give her such pleasure, make her feel so safe. He was right there in front of her. The temptation to reach out and touch him damn near drowned her good sense.</p><p>But she had Seth and tomorrow to think about. And honestly . . . by the time Eric had encouraged Tyler to have sex with her, she\u2019d been half in love with him. He\u2019d been so steady, patient, kind during her ex-husband\u2019s recovery. Cutting him loose had hurt so badly. She didn\u2019t want to suffer it twice.</p><p>\u201cCaveman much?\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cAlways. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I already heard that you have a thing for Alyssa. I get why. She\u2019s gorgeous. I\u2019ve never seen a woman that sexy. I know she\u2019s married, but . . . I\u2019m living proof marriage doesn\u2019t always last. But while you wait for her, I won\u2019t be a substitute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d Tyler approached, eyes narrowing. He ripped off the cap, then his T-shirt. He flung it to the floor.</p><p>Del swallowed hard. Dear God, she\u2019d forgotten how overpoweringly masculine Tyler was. But now that he was half naked, that fact was front and center, evident in every bulge of his shoulders, every ripple of his abs, the veins running down his arms. Hard pectorals. Lean waist. Jeans hanging low on his lean hips . . .</p><p>He snapped, and she raised her stare back to his face, but Del was equally dazzled there, especially by the heat in his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight: You could never be a substitute for Alyssa. It was the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p> <p>WHAT the hell was he thinking? Open mouth, insert ass. He\u2019d blurted something so . . . true. Fuck. He\u2019d been burying everything he felt for Del for two years. In an instant, she\u2019d swept into his house and made him realize how damn much he cared about her. Still wanted her.</p><p>But Tyler sensed that, after everything that had passed between them\u2014and whatever damage Eric\u2019s abandonment had caused\u2014men, and him especially, weren\u2019t high on Del\u2019s to-do list.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t letting her go easily or without a fight.</p><p>\u201cLook, let\u2019s just . . .\u201d Del sputtered, then looked away. \u201cI\u2019d like to call about Seth. I won\u2019t be able to sleep until I hear he\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside Tyler wanted to argue. Or better yet, get her supine, get on top of her, and prove his point. But she was exhausted and scared. Now wasn\u2019t the best time.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do that.\u201d He reached for his phone.</p><p>\u201cWho has him tonight?\u201d</p><p>Tyler tried not to wince. \u201cAlyssa.\u201d</p><p>Before Del could comment, he punched the speed dial and jammed the phone to his ear. Alyssa answered right away.</p><p>\u201cYour son is as mischievous as you are.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile as he turned the phone on speaker so Del could hear. \u201cYeah, well . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bundle of energy and climbs everything. I\u2019m not used to that with Chloe.\u201d Alyssa sounded somewhere between amused and exasperated. \u201cBut he\u2019s so sweet. He must get that from Del.\u201d</p><p>Del looked choked up, and Tyler wrapped an arm around her waist and whispered, \u201cSee, he\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and leaned into the phone. \u201cHi, Alyssa. Thank you for taking care of Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids are having fun. Chloe has loved having a playmate, even if she\u2019s not sure what to do with plush trucks and toy airplanes.\u201d She laughed, the sound light and elegant.</p><p>\u201cSeth is a climber, and if you have anything chocolate, he\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. Luc keeps so many things in the kitchen. He\u2019s bound to have good chocolate here. I\u2019ll hide it. Can he have a little tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he eats his vegetables and tries a bite of everything on his plate.\u201d</p><p>After the women talked about Seth\u2019s naps and bedtime, Del pulled away from him. \u201cThanks again for everything.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler watched with a frown as she disappeared into the bathroom and shut the door. He heard it lock, then the shower turned on. He sat on the edge of the thin mattress and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou still there?\u201d Alyssa asked.</p><p>Turning the phone off speaker mode, he tucked it back against his ear. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Del wanted nothing to do with him, and it hurt like fuck. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa snorted. \u201cLiar. What about Delaney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhausted and afraid. I\u2019m doing everything I can to keep her safe and calm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d His former boss paused. \u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s going on between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ends with you finding out fifteen months too late that you have a son. You had no clue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. She\u2019s a friend\u2019s wife. Well, ex-wife now\u2014and ex-friend. I know that raises a million questions, just . . . not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa sighed. \u201cHow do you feel about her?\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that a fucking ironic question? Now Alyssa wanted to know how he felt. It was just as well she\u2019d never taken him seriously. Maybe she\u2019d always seen through him and known he was trying to substitute her for Del. But why? They really weren\u2019t alike, except their backbone and determination to see something through.</p><p>His silence went on too long, and Alyssa broke it. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with her.\u201d</p><p>What the hell did he know about love? \u201cI wondered for a while if I was in love with you, and you see how that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dumb ass. I get it now. You latched onto me because I was unavailable. The more I said no, the harder you pursued. I thought maybe you liked the challenge. But you were trying to forget her.\u201d</p><p>Tyler closed his eyes. That sounded so painfully close to the truth. Great time to realize that his hard-on for Alyssa hadn\u2019t been about her at all. He\u2019d buried all his hurt and yearning under lust. After all, Alyssa and all the girls at Sexy Sirens looked damn fine in corsets, thongs, and garter belts. But no matter how many Krystals, Jessis, Candys, or Aspens he fucked, he\u2019d felt nothing but desire.</p><p>Not like the night he\u2019d given every bit of his body and passion to Del. He\u2019d been searching for that high again\u2014for her\u2014in every other girl. He\u2019d come up empty.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>The tangle of crap between them was deep and wide. They shared a son, and that mattered, but it didn\u2019t guarantee that Del was going to care about him beyond being her baby daddy.</p><p>\u201cYou going to marry her?\u201d Alyssa asked.</p><p>The question blindsided him. The thought of marrying Del, of having her in his bed every night . . . His dick stood up, totally approving the idea. His heart beat faster. But he doubted she was in a rush to get married again. Besides, he knew exactly zero about being a good husband or father. His own had packed up and walked out when he was six. His mother had always said that he had no business getting married because he\u2019d be just as restless and irresponsible. The way he\u2019d moved from bed to bed since puberty, Tyler had believed her.</p><p>But Del was different. Not just sexy, though she absolutely was in a way that flipped every switch in his body. She wasn\u2019t just smart, but funny, tenacious, loyal. Perfect. If he were going to find one partner for life, he couldn\u2019t do better.</p><p>He probably wasn\u2019t going to get that chance. Even if she was willing to try forever, what if he wasn\u2019t cut out for a picket fence? How badly would he hurt her if he couldn\u2019t deal and left? She\u2019d already been burned by Eric. Tyler couldn\u2019t risk doing that to her again. He refused to cause her pain.</p><p>But the idea of just being an occasional father to Seth and even less to Del set off all kinds of fury bombs inside him. And if he left her to raise Seth alone, didn\u2019t that make him the same kind of shithead as his own father?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking way too hard.\u201d Alyssa sighed.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know how the hell to answer you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. How do you know when you\u2019re ready to marry someone? How do you know it\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to trust that, no matter what, you\u2019re going to be there for one other,\u201d she said softly. \u201cSo decide quickly if you can be her rock. If not, that girl is going to walk out of your life again and never look back.\u201d</p><p>THREE a.m., and he was wide awake. After learning about Seth, missing a good night\u2019s sleep, then driving the better part of eighteen hours, he should have been fucking exhausted. But no. His brain raced. Anxiety clawed up his spine. He hoped he and his buddies had been clever enough to elude Carlson\u2019s network until they could cruise into L.A. and put that motherfucker down.</p><p>And Alyssa\u2019s words kept turning themselves over in his head.</p><p>In the next bed, Del slept restlessly, her bare legs sliding against the sheets. Staring into the dark at her, Tyler could only think about two things: some career criminal being after her, and the fact that, even if the danger ended today, he wasn\u2019t prepared to let her go again. Both trains of thought made him ache to hold her. Protect her. Feel her safe and warm and luscious against him.</p><p>He probably should leave her alone, simply watch over her from his bed. But no one had ever accused him of being a gentleman. And he needed to start expressing now exactly how he wanted things between them.</p><p>Slowly, Tyler tossed back his covers and slid off the bed. Del thrashed in the middle of her bed, as if she\u2019d gotten used to sleeping alone in the last two years. He smiled at that thought. Then it faded. What he was about to do might piss her off, but . . . she had all her defenses up, and until he found a way to get under them so she could at least consider how good they might be together, he had no shot with Del. They\u2019d once been friends. Things had been good between them. Now, he needed to have her in whatever way he could, even if he simply held her.</p><p>He needed to start staking his claim.</p><p>Besides, as scared as she was trying not to be and as much as she worried about Seth, he\u2019d bet she needed someone to hold her.</p><p>He lifted her sheet and slid underneath. Her body heat reached into him. Her personal scent, like sunlit cotton and springtime, comforted him. Tyler spooned her back to his chest, and closed his eyes, breathing her in. Holding her again took him back to the night Seth had been conceived, the hint of summer looming in the air, the sultry look of Del\u2019s flushed cheeks and wide eyes as she orgasmed. The regret on her face when she\u2019d said she was sorry\u2014the last words she\u2019d spoken to him for two long years.</p><p>Her body relaxing, Del sighed, melting into him in sleep. He found his face in the crook of her neck and his palm on her stomach, thinly clad in a little black tank. She felt both familiar and brand-new. That night, he hadn\u2019t really been able to explore her. Did she like having her nipples pinched during sex? What did her pussy taste like when she came? How much would she blow his mind if he fucked her right now?</p><p>Three simple questions, and he turned hard as stone. He probably shouldn\u2019t . . . but Tyler couldn\u2019t stop his hips from pressing forward, into that sweet, slender ass.</p><p>Did she like being spanked? Would she enjoy anal sex?</p><p>A groan rumbled from his chest. Jesus, he had to stop this now, ease her into the idea of being with him so they could explore what might be between them, not to rattle her so much that she ran screaming.</p><p>Had Del missed him at all? Have any idea how many times he\u2019d been in bed with a woman and wondered why they never felt as good as her?</p><p>Fuck. He needed to touch Del.</p><p>Tyler gripped her tighter and arched into her again, this time brushing his lips down her neck. Pleasure cut through him in a wide arc. In his arms, she shivered. Wriggled. Her breast was right under his fingers . . .</p><p>Damn, he was going to hell for this.</p><p>He inched his palm up just a fraction and . . . yeah, right there. He closed his eyes. Even through the thin cotton, Del\u2019s breast fit his hand perfectly, a bit heavier than he remembered. So damn lush.</p><p>Despite the heat of his palm, her nipple tightened. She shifted, her ass generating mind-blowing friction as she rubbed against his dick in her sleep. Del made his entire body throb, sent fire ripping through his veins. Shit, he might have to jack off in the bathroom to keep from attacking her in the next thirty seconds. Hell, he might even have to jack off twice.</p><p>Crap, he needed to slow down. Earlier, Del had emerged from the bathroom after her shower with tight, red-rimmed eyes. She\u2019d refused to let him comfort her. He needed to show her\u2014and himself\u2014that he could be her rock. He couldn\u2019t accomplish that by feeling her up.</p><p>But she felt so fucking good, and he\u2019d never wanted someone so damn bad. Just one touch . . .</p><p>Slowly, he slid his hand from the soft weight of her breast, down, down, until it slipped under the loose elastic of those shorts. His fingertips brushed over the flat of her belly, then\u2014oh, holy shit. Her pussy. No, her bare pussy.</p><p>Tyler cupped his fingers around her flesh, parting her folds with one finger. Yeah, there was her clit, soft and slightly damp. He wanted his tongue there, lapping at her, making her fist the sheets and cry out his name. He pushed his cock into her ass again, knowing that if he didn\u2019t pull away, he\u2019d wake her up and piss her off.</p><p>He\u2019d rather get her off instead. She\u2019d been so stressed and worried, she needed release.</p><p>Del shifted, backing up to him. Smiling at her unconscious gesture, Tyler grabbed her top leg and eased it over his thighs, spreading her open. Instantly, two of his fingers slid against her clit, gently stirring. It turned hard. Moisture seeped, coating his fingers.</p><p>It was a matter of time before Del woke. She was going to hand him his ass when she did. But he intended to enjoy this time with her . . . and help her realize that she enjoyed it, too. And make her feel good. He couldn\u2019t assure her a safe future right now, but he could give her a moment of pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rubbed a pair of fingers across her hardening knot of nerves as he slid his other arm under her\u2014and fondled the sweet curve of her breast. He brushed a thumb over her nipple, back and forth, as he swirled his other fingers over her clit. Moaning lightly in her sleep, Del arched up, into his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he whispered against her neck. \u201cLet it feel good, angel.\u201d</p><p>The soft skin right under his lips beckoned. Tyler was way past resisting, and he swept kisses from the slender column, into the crook of her shoulder, where her scent pooled, driving him mad.</p><p>He reached below her clit, gathered more of her increasing moisture, then dragged it over the little bud of nerves. It pulsed under his fingers. Del\u2019s breathing turned hard. She wriggled against his dick again. Her arms flailed for a moment before her hand found his thigh. Her entire body tensed.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d she panted.</p><p>His fingers didn\u2019t stop plucking her hard nipple, rubbing that delicious clit in a light, now teasing circle.</p><p>He kissed her neck again, nipping at her ear. \u201cI\u2019m here, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . Oh my God, I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome. Yeah.\u201d The thought made him even harder.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But the word was a wail, a despondent cry of need.</p><p>Her body thrashed. More juice slicked his fingers, and she pushed into his hands, her breathing ragged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to let me give you an orgasm.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask; he knew from her body that he\u2019d taken her past the point of no return. She\u2019d be pissed afterward . . . but he\u2019d always lived by the motto that it was easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>He backed off just a fraction. He didn\u2019t want to rush her pleasure. It would grow bigger, feel better, if he kindled it slowly, letting it build and build and build.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d He nipped the back of her shoulder and moaned against her skin.</p><p>Del fought back, rubbing her ass against his cock again, streaking fire through his veins. If she kept that up, he was going to come in his shorts, like some teenager with a wet dream. Hell, Del was a wet dream.</p><p>Pressing the flat of his hand against her belly, he shoved up, grinding against her. She gasped, spreading her legs wider. Tyler took the opportunity to shove two fingers into her cunt.</p><p>She gasped, clamped down, then trembled around his fingers. That was also going to get her off too fast.</p><p>He withdrew, and she mewled in distress. \u201cDamn it, Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard. You said you wanted me to\u201d\u2014she gasped as his fingers found her clit again\u2014\u201ccome.\u201d</p><p>Then she wiggled her ass against him, slow and sexy, intentionally lighting him up. God, he was desperate to get inside her, feel her sweet little cunt all around him, know that it was Del taking him, clawing into his back and calling his name.</p><p>For a long moment, Tyler couldn\u2019t breathe, so he just absorbed the pleasure mowing down every one of his better intentions.</p> <p>They fell into a quick rhythm, Del gyrating back on his cock, then lifting into his fingers now circling her clit. Their breathing synced up, fast and shallow and loud.</p><p>\u201cTyler!\u201d she all but begged.</p><p>And he could feel how distended her clit was, straining, jolting. She dug her nails into his thigh and cried out.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes! Del . . .\u201d He pushed against her, standing at the edge of a chasm of pleasure he couldn\u2019t wait to tumble into. He was going to soil his shorts, and he didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Then it hit. Fire danced up his cock. The base of his spine tingled. His balls turned tight and heavy. He exploded. Under his hand, Del tensed and whimpered, her hips bucking, drawing out her own pleasure and his until it made his whole body seize. Until he gave himself over completely. Warm jets of semen shot between them, coating his belly and her back where the tank top had ridden up. It made him twelve kinds of primitive to be glad that if his seed couldn\u2019t be inside her, at least it was on her.</p><p>Moments later, their heavy breathing stopped. Del stiffened and pulled away.</p><p>Now it was time to pay the piper.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d She wrenched away.</p><p>Tyler resisted the urge to point out that she\u2019d been complaining thirty seconds ago that he was withholding her pleasure. Big guess, but it would only piss her off more.</p><p>\u201cGetting close to you and making you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I think I want you for longer than a road trip, and I need to give you a reason to feel the same. Hmm. Maybe that explanation would have to wait.</p><p>He rose, flipped on the bathroom light, and grabbed a cheap washcloth from the towel rack and ran hot water over it. Wincing, he shucked his shorts and wiped himself clean, then rinsed the scrap of terrycloth and wrung it out. Stark naked, he crossed the room to Del, all wrapped up in the sheet and looking at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>She judiciously avoided looking south of his face. \u201cI told you earlier not to touch me.\u201d</p><p>I told you earlier not to hold your breath . . . \u201cWho else is going to clean your back?\u201d</p><p>Del hesitated, then scrambled out of bed. \u201cI\u2019ll take a shower. I have to clean my clothes anyway.\u201d</p><p>When she would have walked off, he grabbed her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t. I made the mess. Let me clean it up.\u201d</p><p>With one hand, he pushed her shorts down her legs until they hung around her thighs.</p><p>Fuck, she wasn\u2019t wearing any panties, and her pert ass was totally bare.</p><p>Before that thought could roll through him and awaken his libido again, he yanked her tank over her head.</p><p>She shrieked. \u201cI have to be naked for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work better if I can actually get to your skin.\u201d He swept the damp cloth over her back, into the sexy hollow at the base of her spine, over the firm globes of her ass. He\u2019d take any excuse to put his hands on the sweet flare of her hip and run a finger up the shadowy line bisecting her backside, where he was pretty sure no man had ever taken her . . .</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d She pulled away.</p><p>Prickly. Okay, he\u2019d stepped over the line. He\u2019d meant to comfort and release her. Instead, he\u2019d almost molested her. If he wanted to ever touch her again, he was going to have to downshift, go slower. With her, that was so hard. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you, but it felt damn good to hold you. I\u2019m not going to apologize for something I don\u2019t regret.\u201d</p><p>Del grunted as she stripped off the shorts and grabbed a towel from the bathroom. She tucked it around herself as she made her way to her duffel, picking through the garments. He rinsed out his shorts, throwing a little soap on them. The silence was tight and awkward.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d He frowned at the thought.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re mad because I touched you without permission or because you got off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we don\u2019t need this complication now. Someone is trying to kill me, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right this second. The only person in the world who knows exactly where we are is Alyssa. You\u2019re safe.\u201d He walked toward her, as naked as the day he\u2019d been born. \u201cSo tell me what this is really about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014us\u2014isn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? When did I ever hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Guilt crossed her face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. I probably hurt you by shutting you out. And I know it\u2019s not fair of me to paint you with Eric\u2019s brush, but you were best friends. I\u2019m just not ready to be . . . involved again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no one has been taking care of your needs, Del?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Who\u2019s going to hold you, make you feel desirable, protected, and adored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too busy to worry about any of that. Divorce and parenting by yourself sort of kills the sex drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours seems to be working fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d She yanked a pair of panties and a T-shirt from the heap of her duffel. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you want to talk about my sex drive before you ask about the birth of your son. But it\u2019s you, so I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re going to talk about Seth, too. I want to know everything I missed in his life. But let\u2019s finish one conversation before we start another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy. This conversation is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re pissed off at me, why? Because I made you feel something for me that you\u2019re afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Tyler knew he\u2019d hit a nerve but shrugged. \u201cIf you say so. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019d be less angry if I got you off with my tongue.\u201d</p><p>Del gasped. When he reached for her, she hustled into the bathroom and slammed the door in his face. By the time she emerged again a few minutes later, all covered up, she looked composed and pristine. He supposed now wasn\u2019t the right time to mention the love bite he\u2019d accidentally left on her neck. He smiled.</p><p>\u201cAre we going back to sleep or are we driving?\u201d Her tense face and posture warned him to back off.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t his style. \u201cWe\u2019re talking. I told you that we\u2019re doing things my way this time. I think you needed to be held. I damn sure needed to be closer to you. The thought of you with some killer makes my blood run cold. The way you\u2019ve been stressed is not good for you. Sue me for caring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between caring and feeling me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know the difference. It\u2019s not like I have a lot of experience with wanting more from a woman than a simple fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel that way about me. We were friends. You\u2019re confused because of Seth.\u201d</p><p>He curled a hand around her neck, breathing onto her soft lips. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I feel. How the fuck would you even know? I put myself out for Eric that night, not just because he asked but because we both wanted it. For days, I waited for you to call me afterward. You never did. I was his best man at your wedding. I was your friend. No one saw fit to tell me that you were pregnant or getting divorced. It slipped your mind to find me before you went into labor? Or you just didn\u2019t give a shit about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Guilt tightened her face. \u201cIs that what you think? Of course I cared. Because of that night, Eric realized that the feelings I\u2019d been having for you weren\u2019t totally platonic.\u201d</p><p>Tyler froze. She\u2019d wanted him before they\u2019d made love?</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t look surprised.\u201d Del frowned, and he wanted to kiss her. \u201cFor the next week, I tried everything I could think of to calm him down, to convince him to reach out to you and discuss it. He forbade me to call. Normally, I\u2019d tell him to go to hell, but I was trying to make the marriage work . . .\u201d</p><p>And his partner in crime fighting and best friend had cut him off cold\u2014all over the wife Eric hadn\u2019t lifted a finger to love or cherish. That motherfucker.</p><p>\u201cBut I always meant to call you.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to believe it, and something in his chest jolted at the thought that she might want him, too. \u201cI tried to text you about a week later.\u201d</p><p>Regret flitted across her face. \u201cWhile I was out one day, Eric bummed a ride and went to the wireless store. He traded in my phone and got me a new number. When I flipped through it, all your contact information had been deleted, along with every picture I had stored of you.\u201d</p><p>So Eric had been a jealous bastard and done everything possible to come between them. Because he\u2019d wanted to repair things with Del, or just because another man had challenged him for a place in her heart? And Tyler bet that once he\u2019d gone to Lafayette, Eric had directed all the anger about his inadequacy at Del, making her feel guilty and miserable.</p><p>At the time, Tyler assumed leaving L.A. to wrap up his case in Lafayette would give them the space they needed. When Del hadn\u2019t returned his messages, and Eric had answered him in monosyllables, Tyler had stayed in Louisiana and tried to convince himself that he was in love with someone else while drowning his hurt in sex. That had been his worst move of all. How much different would everything be now if he\u2019d admitted then that he wanted Del and had pursued her?</p><p>He sank onto the edge of the bed. \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both tried to make it work for a while, but we never really talked about . . . that night. With every day that passed, he just sank deeper into anger, then depression. It was like the first few weeks after the shooting, but worse. He began to drink. A lot. The positive pregnancy test was just the final nail in the coffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left then?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, hesitating. \u201cEric asked me to leave.\u201d</p><p>Tyler jumped to his feet. \u201cThe son of a bitch threw you out when you were pregnant? He knew you had no family, nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found a place after a week in a motel.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIt was for the best.\u201d</p><p>Fury boiled inside Tyler, hot and insidious. The guy hadn\u2019t always been a true and faithful husband, but Tyler had thought that Eric would at least ensure her well-being. What a prick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So, all alone, Del had gone through, what? Morning sickness, her body changing. He\u2019d been around Kimber and Alyssa through their pregnancies. They\u2019d complained about peeing all the time, backaches, swelling ankles, food cravings and aversions. Deke and Luc had catered to their every whim, taken over responsibilities so they could rest. Who\u2019d taken care of Del through all of that? When she\u2019d gone into labor? When she\u2019d come home with a newborn?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to beat the fucking hell out of him.\u201d</p><p>Tyler realized that he hadn\u2019t been much better, hanging out in Lafayette, up to his eyeballs in Jack Daniel\u2019s and pussy. Guilt serrated him.</p><p>What else had he expected? He could hear his mother\u2019s voice, Like father, like son . . .</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Del sounded tired. \u201cIt won\u2019t solve anything. If it helps, I didn\u2019t go through everything alone. Eric and I were together, signing the papers so he could buy my half of the house, when I went into labor. He took me to the hospital. He actually stayed through the delivery. He\u2019s not a terrible person, just insecure. At times, he took it out on me. You know the shooting totally changed him.\u201d</p><p>Eric had seen his son brought into the world. Tyler wondered what he\u2019d been doing that night. Cracking skulls and fucking some stripper?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I knew that you could be pregnant and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t really have a way to reach me. I didn\u2019t expect you to be psychic.\u201d</p><p>No yearning, no anger. Nothing. Goddamn it, he\u2019d rather have her blame. \u201cDidn\u2019t you wish, at least once, that the father of your son was there to help you or hold your hand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s over and done, Tyler. I\u2019m okay, so don\u2019t waste your time feeling guilty. Let\u2019s move forward and end this shit with Carlson. Then you can go back to you life, and I can go back to mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? I\u2019m supposed to pretend that I don\u2019t have a son who needs a father?\u201d Or that his beautiful mother seems determined to raise him without me?</p><p>\u201cRight now, it\u2019s the middle of the night. You\u2019re just supposed to go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, she crawled back in bed. Tyler did the same, but sleep wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>Damn it, he didn\u2019t want to let this go. But even if she was willing to make a life with him tomorrow, what did he know about being a good husband and father? How could he convince her that he\u2019d figure it out and be ten times the man Eric had ever been when he wasn\u2019t completely sure himself?</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>BY six that morning, they pulled back onto I-10. In Phoenix, they stopped for lunch and another car exchange, again courtesy of Xander, via some gorgeous blonde who looked ready for a stripper pole. This time, Del didn\u2019t say a word as Tyler transferred her duffel into the back of a nondescript white SUV and thanked the woman. Then he climbed into the vehicle, and they took off again.</p><p>Del sank back against the plush leather seats, listening to the heavy alternative rock banging through the speakers. She peered at Tyler from beneath her lashes, trying to make heads or tails of him.</p><p>\u201cYou can let me do something, you know. I\u2019m not helpless.\u201d</p><p>He stopped at a light and turned his heavy gaze her way. \u201cYou brought my son into the world and raised him alone for fifteen months. You drove the two of you safely across the country with a madman on your tail. Helpless is the last thing I\u2019d call you.\u201d</p><p>His words made her glow. \u201cThen why are you taking responsibility for everything? The Tyler I knew would have brought the beer, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never have thrown the party.\u201d He surged ahead in the traffic, merging on the freeway. \u201cI know. You\u2019ve handled everything up until yesterday. I\u2019m going to take care of you now.\u201d</p><p>Del stared. Something had changed about him. She liked it\u2014more than she wanted to. And she was incredibly relieved. Of course, she needed to stand on her own two feet and be strong for Seth . . . but for this brief moment, it was so nice to lean on Tyler\u2019s broad shoulders. He\u2019d fed her, kept her safe, even taken care of her sexually. She was almost ashamed to admit how much she\u2019d needed that orgasm\u2014and how badly she\u2019d wanted it from him. For those blissful minutes, she\u2019d felt close to him again.</p><p>Afterward, she\u2019d directed all her guilt at him. Regret now weighed her down. Del knew that if the blame belonged to someone, it was her for being unable to resist Tyler. She knew who and what he was. He never turned down a willing female. They had so much unresolved between them. It was natural that he\u2019d come on to her.</p> <p>She could never make the mistake of thinking it meant anything important to him.</p><p>Still, once the orgasmic high had faded, Del realized that her life would become horrifically empty once Tyler was gone again. Yes, he made noise about sharing something in the future, but the Tyler she\u2019d known wasn\u2019t cut out for marriage and kids. Despite his changes, he might never be. Alyssa\u2019s strippers called him Cockzilla with good reason. As much as she cared for Tyler, she\u2019d never want him to put himself in the uncomfortable position of being a husband simply because he felt obligated. She\u2019d only end up hurt when he left her or strayed. Best to solve her problems, then keep her distance. Let Tyler be the eternal bachelor he was meant to be.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be able to take care of things again once we\u2019ve dealt with Carlson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, we have to convince Eric to let you back in to retrieve your flash drive.\u201d</p><p>Del sighed. How could she explain this? \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate me. He was really angry for a while. Once he started rehabbing in earnest and his ability to walk returned, he seemed better. I think that if I explain why I snuck in, it\u2019ll be okay. He might not love me anymore, but he wouldn\u2019t want me dead.\u201d</p><p>But there was a possibility he\u2019d be pissed. Or he might not care at all. Del really didn\u2019t know. It was a gamble. Everything right now was.</p><p>\u201cThe motherfucker better help you, or I\u2019m going to open his skull with my fists.\u201d</p><p>She reared back. In the hotel room this morning she\u2019d sensed hostility from Tyler toward Eric, but this was obvious. As tight as they\u2019d been, like brothers, it stunned her a little. If he\u2019d been in Eric\u2019s situation and felt like he\u2019d been cuckolded\u2014</p><p>No. She realized. Tyler would have never used Eric as a sexual crutch and asked his pal to fuck her. Tyler had always been more pigheaded and had more gumption. He would have used his words, his hands, even toys to get her off and give himself something to look forward to. Hell, even his tongue, as he\u2019d suggested this morning. The thought gave her a guilty tingle. But Tyler would have never folded and given his woman away to another man.</p><p>That\u2019s one thing that had helped Del accept her divorce from Eric. She\u2019d lost respect for her ex-husband that day. She\u2019d wanted to help him in his recovery, take an active part in saving her marriage. But after it was over and the blame started, she realized that she didn\u2019t feel the same about Eric anymore. His petulant anger diving into depression and vicious outlashes made her see a part of him that she\u2019d never seen\u2014and couldn\u2019t live with.</p><p>Things always happened for a reason. That night had happened to show her Eric\u2019s true colors and to allow her to have the most precious person in her life, Seth.</p><p>As Tyler flowed with the traffic on the freeway heading west, Del stared out at the road, which gradually thinned back into empty desert.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your friends in Lafayette,\u201d she asked into the silence. \u201cYou seem close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt snuck up on me, but yeah. I went to Lafayette for a case, and I went to work for Alyssa as part of my cover. Through her husband, Luc, I met his cousin Deke, Deke\u2019s brothers-in-law, Hunter and Logan, and Deke\u2019s business partner, Jack. They\u2019re all great, stand-up guys. We\u2019ve been through a lot together, protecting some of their wives from stalkers and assholes determined to hurt them.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThat sounds dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have dangerous jobs. They\u2019ve always had dangerous lives. We\u2019ve got the adrenaline-junkie thing in common.\u201d</p><p>Del knew that about Tyler. He\u2019d never played anything safe. \u201cYour friends also have some . . . interesting sexual preferences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaught that, did you?\u201d He smiled. \u201cDeke and Luc are total cavemen. The rest are into BDSM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBDSM?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBondage, dominance, sadomasochism.\u201d</p><p>Del sat back in her seat, shock and confusion pinging through her\u2014along with unexpected heat. \u201cLike restraints, whips, and chains? They hurt their wives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little pain to enhance the pleasure. As Jack is fond of saying, it\u2019s more about the mind fuck.\u201d Brow cocked, he shot her a speculative glance. \u201cWhat do you know about that stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d Not for anything would she tell him that the thought of Tyler tying her up and having his wicked way with her made her ache. \u201cYou into that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve picked up a thing or two listening to them. Interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cThen why are your cheeks flushed?\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hallucinating.\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s hand slid across her cheek before she could pull away. \u201cDefinitely flushed. Interesting . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and drive.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but Del had no doubt he was filing away the observation. \u201cI will . . . for now.\u201d</p><p>Damn, his playful side had always gotten to her. Her own nature tended to be far more serious, and Tyler had always done a good job of reminding her to laugh and enjoy life a little. It had been so long since she had anything to laugh about.</p><p>The sound of the phone ringing suddenly filled the SUV. Tyler grabbed it and glanced at the number, all business again. \u201cJack, what\u2019ve you got?\u201d</p><p>After a long pause, Tyler spoke a series of monosyllables, and Del lost total track of the conversation. Instead, she stared out into the desert, the late afternoon sun beating down relentlessly. A few minutes later, Tyler hung up with a ripe curse and turned to her.</p><p>\u201cTara dug around. Your credit card purchases are definitely being tracked by the DA\u2019s office, through the pretense that you have an outstanding warrant. What is that about?\u201d</p><p>The gravity in his tone hit her with anxiety. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have an unpaid speeding ticket. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlson is trumping it up to reckless driving. The warrant says you\u2019re a danger to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s more than you\u2019re telling me. Jack has the same theory I do. When a bad guy wants to off someone, they don\u2019t usually start with something as flashy as a car bomb. Because then it\u2019s obvious someone is trying to kill you and the police tend to look at that crime a lot more seriously. That wasn\u2019t Carlson\u2019s first attempt, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tyler raked a hand through his hair, clearly exasperated. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to watch Seth, not get involved with the case. I knew if I said more, you\u2019d jump into the middle of this mess, exactly like you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always going to get involved, Del. You were kidding yourself if you thought otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t need you to be responsible for me, just Seth. Just for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking care of Seth by taking care of you. He needs his mother.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to win this argument.</p><p>Delaney sighed. \u201cThe first incident, though I can\u2019t prove it, was nearly being run over while crossing the street one evening. I literally dived onto another car parked on the street. If that car hadn\u2019t been there, I think he would have followed me onto the sidewalk to run me over. Then a few days later, I went to the bank. When I came out, a thug with a gun tried to hold me up. But he didn\u2019t seem interested in the three hundred bucks in cash I had in my purse, just in shooting me. I kneed him in the balls and clocked him in the jaw as hard as I could. Then I ran. He shot at me. When I close my eyes, sometimes I can still hear the bullet whizzing right past my left ear. The next day, someone broke into my house. Thankfully, Seth and I weren\u2019t there. They didn\u2019t take anything, but they trashed the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Del . . . You should have told me sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could get the story written, expose Carlson, and get him put away before he got me. The morning the car bomb exploded, Seth and I were packing up to stay at a motel. I turned on the car with my fob to get the air conditioner going, then I\u2019d planned to strap Seth in and load up the car.\u201d Tears hit the back of her eyes when she thought about all the danger she\u2019d unwittingly put her son in. \u201cI keep thinking . . . what if I\u2019d strapped Seth in first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Tyler reached for her hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. Don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s okay. You did the right thing, coming to me. We\u2019re going to fix this. If you think for one second that Jack, Deke, and I are going to let this fucker get away with terrorizing you and threatening my son, you don\u2019t know me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew Tyler . . . and she didn\u2019t. He\u2019d definitely seemed to have changed. He\u2019d always been funny and on the protective side, but now defending her was like a code to him. A mantra. He meant every word he said, obviously committed in a way she hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>With watery vision, Del sent a grateful glance to Tyler. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to thank me. I want you to live.\u201d He wiped away the tears on her cheek. \u201cJack and Deke did some prodding and got ahold of the police report detailing your car bomb. It was definitely Semtex, a quarter-pound directional charge, under the dash. So Carlson has connections to some bad people. Angel, you shouldn\u2019t be involved in this.\u201d He gripped the steering wheel tighter. \u201cXander is flying to L.A tomorrow. I want you to go back to Lafayette with him. Take care of Seth. I\u2019ll deal with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I think Carlson has a lot of dirty cops in his pocket. So I\u2019m not expecting any help from that end. Carlson won\u2019t go away without public exposure. My editor at the paper is just waiting for this story. I have to do the legwork and write it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Seth needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to be safe even more. You can\u2019t write this story, only I can. So I\u2019m going to do it, then go back to my son. Besides, I\u2019m not leaving you to clean up my mess and risk yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are one hardheaded woman. Jack swears that a good spanking is one hell of an attitude adjuster. I\u2019m beginning to see his point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not touching my ass\u2014or any other part of me.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a lazy smile that did crazy things to her pulse. \u201cAngel, I wouldn\u2019t take that bet if I were you.\u201d</p> <p>Del swallowed. Yeah, she wasn\u2019t sure that was a wise bet at all. Within a few short days, she\u2019d gone from being certain that temptation was the very last thing on her mind to almost craving the feel of Tyler\u2019s skin on hers, his lips demanding her surrender, as he drove deep inside her. How long could she really resist? And did she genuinely want to?</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan? Are we rolling into L.A. tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019d get there late. You\u2019re tired, I\u2019m tired, and I\u2019ll bet Carlson has a whole network of people on the lookout for us. The closer we are to his turf, the more dangerous it is. We need to rest and have a solid plan. You\u2019ve got to get in touch with Eric, too. We need that evidence you stashed at his house.\u201d</p><p>And that fact really pissed Tyler off. Unfortunately, he was right.</p><p>It was early evening when they pulled into a little motel just inside Palm Springs that had seen its heyday forty years ago. They exited the air-conditioned SUV under a sign that advertised COLOR TV and SWIMMING POOL, then approached the sprawling blue-stucco structure surrounded by desert and palm trees. Tyler pulled a baseball cap low over his face.</p><p>Del frowned. \u201cWhy here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s off the beaten path. It\u2019s not a chain, so I can pay cash. There\u2019s parking around back, but no road behind us. Someone would have to be deliberately looking for us here to find us. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t look like anyone would come here voluntarily.</p><p>Tyler opened the door and stepped inside, body taut, eyes watchful. He glanced at her over his shoulder. \u201cWait by the vending machine. Keep your back to the guy behind the counter. We don\u2019t need witnesses or security cameras.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue, just filed in behind him, head down, and made her way to the soda machine humming in the corner. Within a few minutes, Tyler had secured them a room. He grabbed her arm and led her back to the car.</p><p>\u201cGood news. Our room is upstairs. There are two nearby stairwells that lead to the parking lot, a service elevator next door, along with roof access from the balcony. If Carlson is coming, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to muster enough guys to block four escape routes before we can blow this joint.\u201d</p><p>Del nodded gratefully. She would have chosen a nice hotel in the middle of a tourist area, hoping to blend in. She would have never considered where the parking lot was situated in relation to the road or how many escape routes the room might have.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. You\u2019re not going to like our accommodations.\u201d With a nod, he ushered her inside, then locked the door behind him.</p> <p>As she looked around, her stomach tightened. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bed.\u201d</p><p>One lumpy, king-sized bed decorated with a vinyl tufted headboard, cracked with age, and a turquoise bedspread with bright yellow flowers. Cheap wicker furniture that had seen better days, a fading mural of palm trees along the bathroom wall, and cracked off-white tile flooring rounded out the look.</p><p>\u201cTo get the bonus safety features I mentioned, we had to compromise.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you are, at least next to me, where I can keep you safe. We\u2019ll decide about sex later. My vote is yes because I\u2019m done tiptoeing around the fact that I want you damn bad. I\u2019m pretty sure this is the only chance I\u2019ll have to convince you that something about us works, so if I have to be ruthless . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI have no problem with that.\u201d</p><p>Del\u2019s jaw dropped. She should be pissed off. And she was trying to be. But she found something so compelling about Tyler\u2019s desire. He wanted her and he refused to deny it. She couldn\u2019t refute the ache flaring in her again. She hadn\u2019t missed sex in almost two years, and here he was, making her need and want it in a way she never had.</p><p>\u201cFor now, I\u2019m going to take a quick shower. Call to check on Seth, if you\u2019d like.\u201d He tossed her his phone. \u201cWhen I get done, we need to find some dinner, buy a few supplies, and exchange our car again. Xander will call to set it up.\u201d</p><p>With that, he disappeared into the bathroom. Del sank onto the bed, disquiet dawning. Tyler had never come after her with all his seductive prowess. For years, she\u2019d watched him turn it on other women, always somewhere between envious and grateful. As much as she wanted him now, resistance was going to be brutally difficult.</p><p>Was it worth the effort when they\u2019d only be together for a few days? Whatever he said, Tyler would likely go his separate way when this mess was over. Instead of pushing him away, maybe she should seize the opportunity to feel like a woman again, to feel loved, put closure to this chapter of her life.</p><p>Biting her lip as she considered the question, she turned Tyler\u2019s phone over in her hands and opened his contact list. She scrolled and scrolled and scrolled. Lots of females, first name that usually sounded artificial and overtly sexual with a phone number only. Jazmine, Krystal, Angelique, Chastity\u2014yeah, right\u2014and even a Lexxxie. Del rolled her eyes, trying to ignore the jealousy blazing through her. Tyler wasn\u2019t hers, and he never would be. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose sight of that fact.</p><p>Finally, she came across Alyssa\u2019s contact info and dialed. The woman answered almost right away. \u201cHey, Ty. Figure your shit out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelaney? Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to resent the woman he called friend, that he\u2019d clearly wanted\u2014and slept with?\u2014at some point. The woman now watching over her son. But she couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cHow\u2019s Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Kimber brought Caleb over to play with Chloe and Seth. They are having a great time. Magically, she\u2019s keeping the boys from fighting. He seems really happy. He misses you at bedtime, but we\u2019ve all done our best to comfort him.\u201d</p><p>Tears speared her eyes again. She\u2019d been strong for so long, but one thought of Seth sad or in need brought her to the brink. That\u2019s one thing she hadn\u2019t seen coming before giving birth, the power of a mother\u2019s love for her child. She\u2019d never known anything so pure and unconditional. For that alone, she was so grateful to Tyler.</p><p>After they chatted for a minute, Delaney ended the call. If she and Tyler were going to have a plan before they reached their destination tomorrow, she needed up-to-date information.</p><p>Digging through her purse, she found the disposable phone she\u2019d bought on the road and dialed Lisa, one of the paper\u2019s investigative reporters. They\u2019d been working together for just over a year. Lisa was wicked funny, but more importantly, she was razor sharp when it came to digging for dirt. That\u2019s exactly what Delaney needed right now.</p><p>\u201cDel, is that really you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine. I should be back in L.A. by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Seth?\u201d Lisa sounded all kinds of worried.</p><p>\u201cFine. I miss him, but he\u2019s better off being out of town with friends. Tell me what I\u2019ve missed.\u201d</p><p>Lisa\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cThe lid is about to blow here. If you have any intention of stopping Carlson, you better do it quickly. Rumor is, he\u2019s got some shit on the DA. Apparently, the esteemed Mr. Reed likes to swing both ways, and Carlson is threatening to publish pictures of him and a barely legal boy together in a park. And they aren\u2019t throwing a Frisbee.\u201d</p><p>Shock doused Del. \u201cSeriously? Mr. Family Values and Church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it always the ones you least suspect? But you haven\u2019t heard the worst. It\u2019s likely that Carlson will be appointed to replace him until the next election.\u201d</p><p>Del nearly dropped the phone. \u201cAs sneaky as he is about getting positive press, it\u2019s unlikely he wouldn\u2019t be elected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>This changed everything. If she couldn\u2019t get this story published before he became the district attorney, she feared he\u2019d have too much power for her to take him down via a mere newspaper article. Hell, for all she knew, he could have her thrown in jail and Seth taken away.</p><p>Fear lashed her.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do I have?\u201d Del whispered.</p><p>\u201cA few days, maybe. A week at most. I\u2019ve been staying on top of this for you, just like you asked. Sorry I don\u2019t have better news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for letting me know,\u201d she said woodenly.</p><p>But Del\u2019s thoughts raced. If she didn\u2019t succeed, what would happen to her and Seth? Every time she turned around, Carlson proved all over again how ruthless he was. He\u2019d already tried to have her killed more than once. She was the only one standing between him and power. He wasn\u2019t going to stop.</p><p>\u201cYou sound rattled.\u201d</p><p>To say the least. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Just keep your ear to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your next move?\u201d</p><p>Del sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll have to try calling Eric again. I tried while I was heading out east. Somehow, I\u2019ll have to explain that I hid part of my evidence on a flash drive and stashed it at his house.\u201d</p><p>She hoped that conversation didn\u2019t go badly. They\u2019d managed some civil conversations since their divorce. If he had a new girlfriend and was getting laid, he enjoyed rubbing it in her face. If he wasn\u2019t, well, Eric had proven during the divorce that he was fabulous at serving up a cocktail of acid and guilt. She\u2019d known when she hid the flash drive at his house that she\u2019d have to retrieve it sooner or later. She\u2019d simply hoped that time would continue healing him, and they\u2019d be on better speaking terms.</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted. I think he\u2019s been out of town. Newspapers are stacked in front of his house, at least when I drove by there on my way to work this morning to check for you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that explained why he hadn\u2019t been answering when she called the house. At least she hoped that was all. She had to get back in the little Craftsman quickly. She\u2019d simply sneak in again, but with everything going on, Eric had a right to know that someone might hit his house. But she also had to keep him and Tyler from coming to blows. Hmm. Maybe she should meet Eric by herself . . .</p><p>\u201cPlease let me know if you hear anything else.\u201d</p><p>Lisa agreed, and they hung up.</p><p>And Del saw her future teetering on extinction. So much was riding on these next few days, her ability to navigate Eric, get this story written, and dodge killers. She thanked God that Seth was safe and away from the danger, but every moment she couldn\u2019t talk to him, she worried something terrible was happening to him. If someone hurt him because of her . . . Guilt choked her.</p><p>Tears began to flow. God, she hated being weepy, but fear did that to her.</p><p>Del wished she could undo the day she\u2019d confronted Carlson with everything she knew. She\u2019d wanted to provoke him into admitting something. Be a hard-hitting investigative journalist. She\u2019d been determined to show the world what ruthless scum he was.</p><p>Na\u00efvely, she hadn\u2019t counted on him being this violent, and now she and Seth might pay with their lives.</p><p>TYLER emerged from the bathroom to see her set her phone aside. Then she dropped her face to her hands. Her shoulders shook with sobs. She was dead silent. Her pain was a blow to his gut.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, angel? Is Seth all right?\u201d He put a hand on her shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She jumped up and pressed a hand to her chest, quickly wiping away her tears. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just that . . .\u201d</p><p>Del stopped talking, her gaze grazing his face, then moving down his chest. The air conditioner kicked in, and he felt the rivulets of water cold on his skin. Once more, her gaze dropped to the little white towel wrapped around his hips. In the next instant, her cheeks flushed rosy. Her lips parted breathlessly.</p><p>His cock stood at attention. If she liked what she saw, Tyler wasn\u2019t above using that to his advantage, but not until she calmed down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, angel, unless you want me to accept that unspoken invitation and take you to bed. I\u2019m trying to be a good guy here and find out why you\u2019re upset.\u201d</p> <p>Del looked away, cleared her throat. \u201cI was just talking to an investigative reporter I work with, Lisa. She helped me find you. She\u2019s been keeping an eye on the situation in L.A. while I\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><p>Tyler stared. What the hell was she thinking? He didn\u2019t want to yell and upset her more, but damn it. \u201cDid you tell her where we are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just that we\u2019d be there tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Tyler breathed, trying to calm himself. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to help, but I don\u2019t like this. I know nothing about this woman.\u201d</p><p>Del turned imploring eyes on him. \u201cShe\u2019s my friend, I promise. You asked me to trust your friends. Now I\u2019m asking for the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe should have discussed this first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying my best.\u201d The angry tears that stabbed her eyes only made him wince with pain. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time. At the end of the day, it\u2019s my problem. And now we have a bigger issue. Carlson is about to be named district attorney.\u201d She explained everything Lisa had divulged. \u201cIf I can\u2019t take him down before that happens, he\u2019s going to find a way to shut me up for good.\u201d</p><p>Tyler wrapped his arms around her and dragged her against his chest. \u201cI won\u2019t let that happen. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got contacts everywhere and\u2014\u201d Tears overcame her again, and she swiped at them angrily.</p><p>\u201cAw, angel, don\u2019t cry.\u201d He brushed a tender hand down her hair, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared. I need to be strong, but . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLean on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already done so much.\u201d</p><p>In the last two years? No. The way he looked at it, even if he wasn\u2019t crazy about her, he owed her like mad. The excuse of needing to pay up kept her close\u2014a bonus that would buy him time with her.</p><p>\u201cNo worries. Whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip and looked at him with wary blue eyes that silently begged. \u201cHold me.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped her up tighter, all but drowning in her sweet scent. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Tyler would love to do a whole lot more, but as upset as she was, now wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>Del placed a hand on his chest, then backed away to meet his gaze again. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p> <p>His heart stopped. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she nodded. His hormones flew off the chain.</p><p>She was fragile; he had to remember that. No tossing her to the bed and devouring her. No ravaging her lips, violating her pussy, or making her take every bit of the hunger he felt for her.</p><p>Fuck. How was he going to manage that? He knew a shitload about getting a girl off. Not so much about comfort. But for her, he\u2019d do his best.</p><p>Taking hold of her shoulders gently, he let out a calming breath and cupped her face, resting his forehead to hers. \u201cAngel . . .\u201d</p><p>He laid his lips over hers, a soft press, a sharing of breath. Reverent. Connected. Tyler felt her all the way to his core. The moment was endless, effortless. He could simply breathe her in all night.</p><p>But she wanted more. Needed it, he knew.</p><p>He laid his mouth over hers, gently nudging her lips apart, then let her take the lead. Del grabbed his shoulders with a desperate gasp and surged against him, thrusting inside his mouth with a moan. Her fervency ripped away his restraint. Tyler grabbed her, met her, took her in greedily. Crap, he wanted to soothe her, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself from trying to consume her in one fiery kiss.</p><p>Everywhere, they were entangled\u2014arms, tongues, heartbeats. He clasped her hair tightly in his fingers, keeping her right where he wanted her. She felt so perfect to him. How the fuck could he ever let her go again?</p><p>Tomorrow, she might hate him, regret whatever happened next, but she needed something from him. He wouldn\u2019t turn her away, even if she just wanted to be held. The first time he\u2019d touched her, he\u2019d done it at Eric\u2019s request, trying to push aside how badly he burned for Delaney. But even then, he\u2019d wanted to give her what she\u2019d needed. Right now, he\u2019d think not of his throbbing dick, but only of Del and how he could ease her.</p><p>With a sharp intake of breath, she pulled away, chest heaving as she stared. Her eyes were so damn blue and resolved.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He panted.</p><p>Please, God, don\u2019t let her push him away.</p><p>She whispered, \u201cWill you . . . make me forget everything?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>EVERY word Del spoke tingled through Tyler\u2019s body. He clenched his jaw. \u201cI only know one way to do that, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She tugged at his towel and brushed her soft lips against his neck.</p><p>Lightning shot down his spine.</p><p>An instant later, he eased her back and pressed her to the mattress, staring at her through the shadows. Need and insecurity, fear and vulnerability\u2014they were all over her face, and it damn near broke his heart.</p><p>Maybe she and Eric would have divorced, eventually. But he\u2019d certainly helped the situation along, unleashing all his buried feelings for her that night. It was at least half his fault that she\u2019d been alone for the last two years. No fucking way was she going to be alone tonight.</p><p>Tyler wrapped his arms around her and captured her mouth under his. Sweet. Always so sweet. Open and ardent and tasting like soft woman. From the second he\u2019d torn away the veneer of their platonic friendship and kissed her two years ago, he\u2019d searched for this sense of connectedness with every other female he\u2019d touched.</p><p>As he sank into the kiss, he wondered if he\u2019d ever find it with anyone else. His road seemed to lead back to Del.</p><p>Tomorrow was far away, and he had no idea if he was truly built for the long haul, but he\u2019d stay with her and love her well until this road ended.</p><p>Pulling back, he cupped her cheek. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>A little smile lifted her rosy lips for a moment, then the frown came back. Damn, she was working hard to fight tears.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too. I wanted to talk to you so badly so many times.\u201d</p><p>Her words were like a stab to the chest. He didn\u2019t want to blame her; he hadn\u2019t tried hard enough to get over his hurt and pride and stay with her. Her rejection had stung like a bitch, and he\u2019d gone off to lick his wounds. Now he knew that she\u2019d been through a lot, but he looked at all his wasted time and wanted to punch a fucking wall.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you? I was aching to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d say. I wasn\u2019t anything like the girls you dated. I know me asking you to leave that night hurt you. Part of me wondered if you\u2019d take Eric\u2019s side, since you two were so tight. I guess I didn\u2019t want to burden you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cI would never have skipped out on you when you needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different now. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re more . . . solid.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI think at the time I felt incredibly guilty for betraying Eric in my heart. And I was most afraid of hearing that you\u2019d done it for Eric and didn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her confession shocked him, and fire charged through his veins. \u201cI know the guilt. I felt it, too, for making love to you because I wanted to for reasons beyond Eric asking. But regardless, we gave him exactly what he wanted. Don\u2019t ever forget that or take the blame on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to get to that realization, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt guilty because I wanted you too much.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI still do.\u201d</p><p>After a breathless pause, Del wrapped her arms around his neck and lifted her mouth to his. She didn\u2019t have to ask him twice. He angled his head and nudged her lips apart, opening her wider to him, sinking deeply to drink in that addictive taste of hers and the rightness flowing between them.</p><p>Refusing to waste another second, he tore off her T-shirt, exposing her delicate shoulders, narrow rib cage, so-soft skin. Tyler kissed his way down her jaw, her neck, nipping at her lobe, loving the way she turned her head to give him greater access. She clutched him, keeping him close, and moaned softly.</p><p>The sound went straight to his cock. Tyler closed his eyes. He wanted to pin her beneath him, taste her until he felt her pleasure on his tongue, then force his cock into her so he could drown deep inside her. He wanted to do every nasty, possessive thing to her that he\u2019d ever imagined.</p><p>But now wasn\u2019t the fucking time to unleash his inner caveman. She needed comfort.</p><p>With a ragged sigh, he propped himself on his hands, lifting his body off her. Slow, dumb ass. Go slow. \u201cYou okay? I\u2019ll back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She panted, reaching for him. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Did she know what she was saying? He eased down onto her again. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cSince the night we conceived Seth.\u201d</p><p>Shock blanched him, but a possessive fever rolled right behind it. It didn\u2019t matter that she\u2019d been married to someone else. He was the last man she\u2019d taken into her body. And right now, he burned to keep it that way.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>No way he could go slow now.</p><p>Tyler covered every inch of her, pinning her to the bed as he gave her a blistering kiss. He pressed her mouth open wider, demanding she take more. Del opened sweetly, accepting the ferocity of his desire, which only made him rage hotter. He wrapped one arm around her waist. The other worked the clasp of her bra. In seconds, it melted away. He tore it from her body and flung it across the room.</p><p>Del gasped and moved to cover herself. Tyler wasn\u2019t having any of that. He grabbed her wrists and pinned them to the bed, glancing down at the lush press of her breasts against his chest, her beaded nipples searing his skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my mouth on those, angel. I\u2019m going to roll them around on my tongue, suck and kiss and lick them until your pussy is soaked and you\u2019re scratching at my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Del\u2019s voice wobbled.</p><p>Yeah, she was finally starting to get the idea that he wanted her fiercely. And she still didn\u2019t completely understand. But she would.</p><p>Slowly, she arched up, offering herself to him so beautifully.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes.\u201d</p><p>Keeping her wrists pinned, he slid down her body until his lips hovered right over one of her nipples. Rosy brown, plump, puckered. Her clean feminine scent was strong here, and he inhaled. That hint of sunlit cotton on her skin, along with musky female, drugged him.</p><p>He could have started gently, kissed the side of her breast, tongued its swell. Fuck, no. He opened his mouth over her nipple, sucking it in fiercely, pressing it between his tongue and the roof of his mouth before nipping at it with his teeth.</p><p>Del gasped. \u201cTyler . . .\u201d</p><p>In her voice, he heard surprise and pleasure. That was green light enough for him. He did it again, swirling his tongue around the luscious tip, toying, torturing, swelling it. Then he pounced on the other and did the same.</p><p>Beneath him, she thrashed but didn\u2019t fight his hold. Her little sighs, gasps, and moans went straight to his dick. Her skin flushed; those gorgeous blue eyes were dilating. She liked being manhandled.</p><p>That realization ripped away what little restraint he had.</p><p>He needed more control, wanted her immobile, where he could do anything and everything he chose. A glance at the headboard had him cursing. Nothing to tie her to there, and he knew from their conversation earlier that she fantasized about it. Those pretty flushed cheeks had proven her denials false.</p><p>Tyler had never been much for bondage. He could take it or leave it. Del was different.</p><p>Flinging himself to his feet, he prowled around the room, searching, seeking . . . He wrenched open the closet doors and found exactly what he needed.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>He grabbed the two aging, overbleached bathrobes the hotel had provided from the closet, then tossed aside the hangers. As he dropped the garments on the bed next to her, Del frowned.</p><p>Yeah, she didn\u2019t get it. But she was going to real quick.</p><p>With impatient hands, he tore into the first robe, pulling the tie completely free from the garment. He did the same to the second.</p><p>Let the fun begin.</p><p>He gripped the two terry-cloth strips in his hand and stalked closer. Del\u2019s pretty eyes grew round. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cW-what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Tyler might think she was nervous if her nipples hadn\u2019t gotten harder.</p><p>He just smiled and tore through the snap and zipper of her capri pants, then shoved them down her thighs. She wore a little blue thong with a small, silky bow right above her pussy. The cotton was faded and comfortable and damn near transparent.</p><p>Enough to see that she was bare and lovely.</p><p>\u201cTake them off for me or I\u2019ll rip them. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, hesitated. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quick enough.\u201d He grabbed the little panties in his tight fists.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d On wobbly legs, she stood. He didn\u2019t give her a spare inch of space, but kept her wedged between him and the bed as she lowered the thong down her hips.</p><p>Tyler took over, forcing them past her thighs, to the ground. Then he threw them across the room, thinking that they really belonged in the trash. Damn things had been in his way. He was beginning to see that they\u2019d always be an unwanted barrier between him and\u2014he looked down and lost his mind, staring at Del\u2019s perfectly bare pussy.</p><p>God, he couldn\u2019t wait to have that.</p><p>He guided her back to the bed. \u201cGive me your wrist.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, warily, she extended it to him. She wasn\u2019t exactly sure what he was up to, but she trusted him, and it was beautiful. Suddenly, he began to understand Jack\u2019s, Hunter\u2019s, and Logan\u2019s quest to push their wives\u2019 boundaries. It wasn\u2019t just to please them, but to know how fully those vibrant women would surrender because they loved and believed in their men. The push-pull he felt now only seemed to reinforce his bond with Delaney.</p><p>Tyler wanted more.</p><p>Silently, he looped the tie around her wrist, then rested her arm back against the bed, near her shoulder. With his other hand, he grabbed her thigh, spreading her legs wide to get his first full look at her cunt.</p><p>Fuck. So wet, already swollen. Pink, perfect. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou want this.\u201d His stare drilled into her as he willed her to answer.</p><p>\u201cYes. I shouldn\u2019t, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck shouldn\u2019t. This is about you and me and what feels good. I\u2019m going to silence that destructive little voice in your head spouting this \u2018shouldn\u2019t\u2019 crap.\u201d And make sure you don\u2019t worry about Seth, danger, or death anymore tonight. \u201cI\u2019ll give you something much better to focus on.\u201d</p><p>Del\u2019s breath caught. The edge of fear was getting to her. The anticipation. He was loving dishing out the dominance and making her tremble.</p><p>Tyler looped the bathrobe belt around her thigh, then pulled on both ends, forcing her wrist down and her knee up at her side.</p><p>\u201cGive me your other wrist,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Understanding dawned in those pretty blue eyes. Del realized that he intended to spread her wide open and immobilize her completely.</p><p>He waited a second, breath held. He was asking for a lot of trust after everything that had passed between them. His heart chugged, and desire gnawed at him viciously while she worked it through in her head.</p> <p>Finally, she held her free hand out to him, looking right into his eyes with all the trust in the world.</p><p>That giving expression sizzled right down to his dick.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t hesitate another moment before he wrapped the belt around her delicate wrist, then reached for her knee, opening that leg to her side, and knotted the fabric there. Now, she was wide fucking open, each arm and leg attached, resting at her sides. The restraints lifted her hips to him perfectly. God, he wanted to pounce on her that second and lay claim to her sweet flesh\u2014seduce her into wanting only him.</p><p>He forced the urge down for a second. \u201cIs anything too tight? Hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sounded breathy, looked flushed, as she gazed at him softly, with need.</p><p>Clenching his fists, he forced logic for one more minute. \u201cAny requests before I take you in every way known to man?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. That pretty little tongue swiped across her lips, then she looked down his body, lingering on his hard cock, before her wandering gaze made it back to his face.</p><p>\u201cJust one,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCan you make the knots tighter?\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck. Six little words, and he was at the brink. She wanted to be more completely under his control? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He made a mental note to thank Jack and the Edgington brothers later for their frequent conversations about handling the pretty, willful women in their lives.</p><p>Tyler bent to his knots, tightened, rechecked that she still had circulation. \u201cMove your hands and ankles. Anything too tight now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes silently begging him. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get ready, angel. I might be done with you by dawn. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>Del barely gasped in a single breath before he was on her again. He pushed past her lips to taste the deepest recesses of her mouth, gripped her hips, and shoved his cock right against that pretty pussy. God, she was so wet and bare, he could feel her sliding all over him, coating him with her cream. He ground against her. It had been good this morning, feeling her lush curves all against his cock, but this . . . Fuck, he was going to lose his mind.</p><p>Tyler tore his mouth from hers to stare down at her. Oh yeah, she was still with him, jagged breathing, pleading blue eyes. How had he never gotten the upside of bondage before?</p><p>Because he\u2019d never wanted to keep someone open for him, and him alone, like he wanted with Del.</p><p>Tyler inched down her body. Her plush breasts waited for him, so soft, topped with hard, swollen nipples. He took the unspoken invitation and circled one with his tongue. God, those were good. He loved the scent of her, the flavor. She groaned as he shifted to the other, thumbing the hard tips, nipping at them, gratified when she whimpered his name.</p><p>\u201cI like this. Mmm.\u201d He swiped his tongue along her abdomen, loving the way she shivered. \u201cI remember my first night in Lafayette the week after I left your house. I had an empty apartment and a full bottle. I missed you . . .\u201d</p><p>It was the first night he\u2019d let himself masturbate to the thought of her. But not the last\u2014not by a long shot. He always saved her for the times he was too drunk to remember that Del had thrown him out of her life. Even so, she\u2019d still affected him like no one else.</p><p>\u201cI fantasized about doing this.\u201d</p><p>Tyler slid farther down her body, bracing himself between her thighs. She was slick and succulent. The tangy-sweet scent of her went straight to his cock. He glanced at her, wide-eyed and restrained, before dropping his gaze again.</p><p>Lowering his weight to his elbows, he eased her folds apart with his thumbs. Her clit looked tight and red. Needy. She clenched, and Tyler salivated at the thought of his tongue, his dick, working into that tight little spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat you up, angel.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a trembling breath. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>Fuck, he couldn\u2019t wait another second. He bent and ran the flat of his tongue from her hole slowly, slowly up to the hard berry of her clit. With a little moan, he swirled his tongue around it, his thumbs keeping her open wide.</p><p>Del stiffened as she cried out. Her entire body went taut. A glance up at the rapid pulse beating at her neck told him that her heart was racing.</p><p>He loved the idea that he\u2019d already driven her to the brink of orgasm\u2014and that he could keep her there and build on her sensations for as long as he wished.</p><p>With that thought, he dove right into that sugar-slick flesh and gorged on her, sliding his fingers inside her cunt, probing, testing, searching . . .</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>He found her G-spot. Leisurely, he rubbed at it with firm fingertips as he took her clit into his mouth. With every second, her skin flushed rosier, her body grew more tense, her breathing more ragged.</p><p>\u201cTyler. Tyler . . .\u201d She sounded desperate. Her long fingers closed into fists.</p><p>And he loved it.</p><p>He swiped a thumb across her clit, toying, keeping her on the edge. But no way was she going over before he was ready. \u201cYou like my tongue on you?\u201d</p><p>With a devilish grin, he demonstrated again.</p><p>Del gasped. \u201cI\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d She clenched her fists, swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cNever what?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cCome like this.\u201d</p><p>Eric had never done this for her? No man had? Damn if that didn\u2019t motivate him to make her scream with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh, angel. I\u2019m not letting you get away until you do.\u201d He gave the pad of her pussy a playful tap.</p><p>Her whole body twitched. Around his fingers, she clenched in need.</p><p>Then Tyler set about to prove that he wasn\u2019t all talk. He bent between her legs again, his hands at either knee, prying her apart even more. She hissed and arched, both protesting and begging.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to give her this experience. And he controlled it completely. The way she\u2019d put herself in his hands turned him on. Hell, everything about her did. No way would he let her down. Tyler intended to take very good care of her.</p><p>Latching onto her pretty, wet clit, he dove in, already addicted to her flavor, her pillowy-soft flesh that swelled with every swipe. God, she was like heaven, and responded to every touch with a gasp, a wriggle, an arch. He loved every offering of her passion.</p><p>Nothing about this experience was normal. He wasn\u2019t trying to get her off fast so that he could get his cock into her and get back home to his big screen or so she wouldn\u2019t be late for her \u201cdance\u201d number around a pole. Nothing else was in his head except making her feel good and giving his all to ensure that she wanted him.</p><p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d</p><p>Now her breath came fast and heavy. He smiled, staring up at her as he lashed her with his tongue again. \u201cI\u2019m right here. You going to come for me?\u201d</p><p>He had no doubt she would. Every muscle in her thighs was taut. Her clit twitched. The power of holding her pleasure in his hands gave him the biggest rush.</p><p>With a smile, he plunged two of his fingers right against the sensitive spot deep in her pussy again, then sucked the hard little bundle of her nerves into his mouth. Within seconds, she screamed his name, then began jolting wildly. Tyler stayed with her, riding her to the very edge of her climax, milking every moment.</p><p>When she went limp and sighed, Tyler untied her and eased off the bed to grab a condom out of his jeans. Yeah, he was assuming. Or hoping, anyway. But if she said no, he\u2019d respect it\u2014and keep trying to convince her they were good together.</p><p>After donning the condom, he slid back onto the bed, right between her legs. He grabbed a thigh in the crook of his arm and started kissing his way up her body, lifting her leg with him, opening her to his seeking cock.</p><p>Spreading soft kisses around her breasts, he sucked in her nipple, savoring the plushy-hard texture with a moan. Delaney wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get inside you, angel. Make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry, or I\u2019m going to roll you on your back and take over,\u201d she panted.</p><p>Later, yes. Much later, he\u2019d indulge in the visual of her straddling his hips, taking every inch of his cock inside her, breasts bobbing, hair flowing, face racked with pleasure.</p><p>But now, he needed control.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a threat. That\u2019s a great idea.\u201d He grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll get to it. But first . . .\u201d</p><p>He pushed his way inside her.</p><p>Dear God, she was a tight, wet heaven, gripping him as she spread kisses across his face and neck. No way could she take him all in one thrust, and he stopped trying to fight his way in.</p><p>\u201cHey, angel, relax. We\u2019re going to get there.\u201d He kneaded the muscles of her hips and lower back with his fingers, slowly feeling her give way and let go. He pushed in a bit farther, pausing when she tensed and gasped.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more?\u201d she squeaked.</p><p>More than she probably wanted to know. \u201cJust a bit. We\u2019ve done this before. We were good together the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>Nuzzling her neck, he smiled against her skin, then eased back languidly. He took her free leg into the crook of his other arm and spread her even wider. It would keep her from being able to tense up too much, and he didn\u2019t want to hurt her. Just make her feel so damn good. And happy to be with him.</p><p>Once he spread her completely, he slid in slowly, like butter melting over a hot stack of pancakes. Finally, he pressed deep, deeper\u2014all the way in. Del cried out, but it wasn\u2019t in pain, thank God. Her skin flushed rosy. Her nails dug into his shoulders as she arched up to him.</p><p>Fully seated, Tyler released his hold on her thighs, then wrapped his arms around her, cradling her. He took handfuls of that luscious ass into his palms and tilted her up to his cock as he pounded down.</p><p>On the first stroke, her eyes flew wide open, deep blue pools of wonder. She grasped at him, lips parting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Slowly, she nodded, then arched up, taking him a fraction deeper. Del didn\u2019t just feel good, she felt important. Perfect. He\u2019d had so much sex in the last twenty years. Skanky sex, sweaty sex, forgettable sex, indoors, outdoors, under water, in a car, on a boat, on a plane, on a train. Hell, he could rhyme better than freaking Dr. Seuss when it came to all the places he\u2019d fucked someone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the one and only time it had really meant anything . . . that belonged to the woman under him.</p><p>Tyler brushed the hair from her face and fused their lips together, shuttling inside her over and over, feeling her body tense, build, reach out for another orgasm. He closed his eyes, intentionally filling her with long, deep strokes that awakened both her G-spot and all the nerves he nudged around her cervix.</p><p>\u201cTouch your clit for me,\u201d he whispered, propping himself on his elbows to give her room to maneuver.</p><p>Del reached a slender hand down her belly\u2014then stopped. \u201cReally? You want me to touch myself while you\u2019re inside me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it going to get you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She bit her lip, eyes closing shyly. \u201cI\u2019m really sensitive there.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cGet your fingers on your pussy, angel.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate again, just slid her fingers between them and started rubbing that little sweet spot with slow, gentle strokes. He filled her, deep, sure thrusts, one after the other, that rasped over all the dark, sensitive corners inside her. With every thrust, she tightened until she forced him to take shorter, faster strokes, dig right at those nerve-laden spots that had her gasping once, twice, as she wrapped her long legs around his hips and thrashed under him, silently begging for release.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sounded as if she\u2019d run a marathon and stroked her clit faster. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he growled the command at her, feeling his own pleasure creep up his spine and tingles gnaw their way through his belly.</p><p>An instant later, her entire body jolted, and she let loose a guttural cry. A rosy hue flared across her cheeks. God, she was so fucking beautiful. Tyler fought to stave off his climax. He wasn\u2019t ready for this to end. For the last two years, he\u2019d been floating through life. In Lafayette, he\u2019d found the place he now considered home. He\u2019d found the friends he knew would always have his back.</p><p>But he\u2019d been missing Del, trying to fill her void with anyone he possibly could. He knew now that no one else would do. And he couldn\u2019t keep from releasing the need boiling inside him.</p><p>Del held him tightly, her pussy gloving him perfectly, squeezing and pulling him in. Pleasure suspended him seemingly in midair. The tension reached its zenith until he didn\u2019t breathe, didn\u2019t hear, didn\u2019t think. He simply felt Del\u2014then released everything he had inside her in an outpouring that exploded through him, damn near overwhelming him. Tears stung the back of his eyes, and his throat closed up. He clutched Del tighter.</p><p>Under him, she clung to him, sobbing softly. He brushed the dark strands from her rosy cheeks and dried her tears. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded but closed her eyes against him. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me. Just . . . go.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, her dismissal was frustrating, but not surprising. She\u2019d known him for years as a player. Her first impression of his life in Lafayette wouldn\u2019t have changed that. He\u2019d gotten her pregnant and left before she could tell him. She\u2019d been through a messy divorce and birth all by herself. And now he\u2019d worked his way right back into her panties. Naturally, she was cautious and questioning how long he\u2019d be here for her.</p><p>Withdrawing from the warm clasp of her body, Tyler disposed of the condom and grabbed his towel. \u201cDel . . .\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and rose, clutching the sheet against her. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, she\u2019d darted across the room and closed the door. Shit. How ironic was this? All the times he\u2019d fucked and run, leaving some female most likely wondering how he felt about her. Tyler winced. Now he knew that feeling. And it sucked.</p><p>He sat on the bed with a sigh. What the hell did he do now? Go with his gut and pursue her? Did he have more staying power than his old man, or had his mom been right all along?</p><p>Tyler could still hear his mother and the bitterness that dripped from her every word. She would get drunk and tell him how much like his father he was. After a while, it had become the background noise that filled his childhood, but Del was bringing it all back. Was he like the old man? Destined to ruin everyone around him?</p><p>He had no clue, and he certainly didn\u2019t have time to deal with his past boo-boos now. He\u2019d call his mom at some point, tell her about Seth . . . but not today. Now, he had to focus on Del and what was happening between then. He wasn\u2019t calling the old bitch and letting her crawl in his head now.</p> <p>With a sigh, he picked up his phone and dialed.</p><p>Jack answered on the first ring. \u201cYou okay there?\u201d</p><p>Define okay. \u201cSince we got out of New Orleans, it\u2019s been pretty smooth sailing. Xander\u2019s contacts, while scantily clad, have been helpful. But the asshole trying to kill Del is about to be named DA.\u201d Tyler filled Jack in. \u201cSee if you can dig up any dirt on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Del\u2019s got this friend, Lisa. I didn\u2019t get a last name. Here\u2019s her phone number.\u201d Tyler prowled through Del\u2019s phone until he found her last call and repeated the digits to Jack. \u201cDel says this is a friend who\u2019s been helping her. I just want to make sure she checks out. If not, we might have a very unwelcoming party once we hit L.A. tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into her and get back with you in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound tired.\u201d</p><p>Tyler sighed, rubbing at gritty eyes. \u201cFucking exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve trekked across half the country in two days, been shot at . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t really the problem. Tyler tapped nervously on the phone with his thumb, then decided to go for broke. \u201cHow did you convince Morgan that you were the right one for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s out of left field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. To be honest, I was relentless about getting Morgan into bed. But then I fucked up, and I had to grovel a lot. Ultimately, I had to put the decision in her hands. I couldn\u2019t force her to trust me a second time.\u201d</p><p>Tyler squeezed his eyes shut. Jack was right, but that was the last goddamn thing he wanted to hear. Del wasn\u2019t ready to believe that he was into her for the long haul. Hell, despite the way he felt, he wasn\u2019t even sure. She had too much on her plate for him to expect her to sort it out now.</p><p>\u201cYou in love with Del?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>How the hell could he answer that? \u201cNever really been in love. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Alyssa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very beautiful crutch.\u201d</p><p>Jack paused. \u201cYou tried to use her and all the other strippers to avoid thinking of Del?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn.\u201d Jack sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to owe my wife something from Tiffany for being right\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She knew right away that you loved Del and that you were going to go after her.\u201d</p><p>Tyler sat back. Morgan had seen that? \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not good for her? I\u2019ve got a lot of feelings for Del, but I\u2019ve never tried the long-term relationship thing. Even the word used to give me hives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPicture the rest of your life without Del and give me a one-word description of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide between bleak or pathetic,\u201d Tyler admitted finally.</p><p>\u201cThere you go.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cBut I know fucking nothing about loving a woman for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink I knew anything before I married Morgan? I had subs, not girlfriends. The most bonding I did was a slave to the wall, never a woman to me. Thankfully, once I earned Morgan\u2019s trust again, she had most of it figured out. Follow your gut. Once you win Del back, work with her. Listen. Together, you\u2019ll find the answers.\u201d</p><p>Jack made it sound so easy. Tyler hoped his buddy was right.</p><p>AS they drove with the rising sun at their backs, Del tried not to look at Tyler. She\u2019d only remember waking up in his strong arms and feeling genuinely safe for the first time in weeks. She tried to forget how badly she\u2019d wanted to snuggle up to him, kiss him awake . . . and see where the morning led them.</p><p>Stupid. Of course, Tyler would have sex with her. He had a lot of sex, and none of it meant anything to him. Putting her heart out there with him just didn\u2019t make sense. Tyler was a great guy, but when it came to monogamy, she didn\u2019t think he was built for more than a night or two. And was she really ready to jump back into the relationship pool? She knew all too well how one minute everything could seem great, then in the next . . . anger, accusations, blame, heartache. Signing up for that possibility again simply didn\u2019t hold any appeal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not drinking your coffee.\u201d He glanced down at the fast-food cup full of java.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like battery acid eating away at my stomach. No, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat, either.\u201d Tyler sighed, rubbed his forehead. \u201cWe should talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we shouldn\u2019t. Unless you just want me to bolster your male ego, then I\u2019ll admit that you were great and rocked my panties. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about my ego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019ve had plenty of girls over the years tell you how good you are in bed. Dozens? Hundreds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t count, and stop trying to make what happened between us impersonal. You mean something to me, Del. I wouldn\u2019t fucking be here now if you didn\u2019t. If you\u2019re trying to protect yourself by acting like it doesn\u2019t matter, you can do that. But it matters to me, and I\u2019m going to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Shame stung her cheeks. She was being a bitch and hurting Tyler\u2019s feelings. Del didn\u2019t know why he was trying so hard to convince her that he cared about her. Because she was Seth\u2019s mother? Because he felt guilty? Or because she really did matter?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt you. I just can\u2019t chase Carlson, worry about Seth, and think about my love life now. I\u2019ll admit you\u2019re spectacular in bed. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t want you again. I\u2019m more than willing to be your lover until all this crap is over. Just . . . don\u2019t talk to me about emotions. Whatever you think you\u2019re feeling, it\u2019s the situation, not me. You\u2019ll get over it and move on. So let\u2019s just enjoy each other now and not worry about the rest, all right?\u201d</p><p>Tyler opened his mouth, looking like he was going to object, when Del\u2019s phone, sitting in her lap, rang. They both glanced at the display, and anxiety gripped her when she saw an all-too-familiar number pop up.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cERIC?\u201d Del\u2019s voice shook.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s gut tightened. She\u2019d been trying to call her ex-husband to get the flash drive she\u2019d stashed in his house, but it rubbed Tyler the wrong way that Eric thought he could call Del and expect her to answer after the terrible way he\u2019d treated her.</p><p>\u201cPut him on speaker,\u201d Tyler murmured.</p><p>She hesitated, then complied, hitting a button.</p><p>\u201c\u2014the fuck are you into?\u201d Eric was ranting. \u201cI come home from a week in Cancun to find a bunch of messages on my answering machine from you that abruptly stop three days ago. After my flight landed at LAX, I called in to the precinct to check in. Some of my buddies tell me your car exploded. I came home to find my house has been ransacked. Not robbed, but torn apart. What do your panicked messages, which they listened to, by the way, have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>Del sent him an alarmed glance. Tyler knew that she was thinking the same thing he was: What if whoever broke into Eric\u2019s had stolen her flash drive?</p><p>She clutched the phone, looking angry and nervous. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to your house while you were gone. I\u2019ve been away. I had to leave town after the car bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this start? The guys at the precinct said you were gone by the time they arrived on the scene to find your car was damn near ash. They have no idea who\u2019s behind this. From your voice mails, I\u2019m guessing you do. What\u2019s going on? Why didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re no longer married. I\u2019m not your problem anymore. I just called you for one small favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with that, Del. If someone is trying to kill you, tell me. We may not be married anymore, but damn it . . . I want to do something. Is the asshole who\u2019s trying to kill you the same one who broke into my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>He huffed. \u201cSince I solve crimes for a living, I think I can figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Del looked at Tyler, her expression a silent question. He shook his head. No telling who was onto her connection with Eric. Better not to talk more specifically until they were face-to-face. If Carlson had anything to do with Eric\u2019s place being trashed, the culprits could have just as easily planted listening or surveillance equipment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for me to talk right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eric hesitated. \u201cI understand. The kid okay?\u201d</p><p>Tyler gritted his teeth. He should probably shut up, but . . . \u201cMy son\u2019s name is Seth, and you can stop barking at Del.\u201d</p><p>Eric didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cTyler? When the hell did you meet up with Del? Are you sniffing at her skirts again?\u201d</p><p>Not \u201cHi, old friend\u201d or \u201cHow have you been?\u201d It rubbed Tyler entirely the wrong way. \u201cDon\u2019t be a stupid motherfucker. She needed help. I\u2019m helping her. Are you more concerned about what I might be doing with your ex than the fact that someone\u2019s trying to kill her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, both of you!\u201d Del insisted. \u201cEric, Seth is fine. My personal life is no longer your concern, so let\u2019s please keep this civil. I only have one favor to ask of you, and it won\u2019t take too much of your time. Can we come by in a bit? I\u2019ll help you pick up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? So you and my former best friend are a couple now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tyler said at the same time, then glared Del\u2019s way. \u201cDefinitely yes. I care about her and I\u2019m going to keep her safe, since you\u2019re too busy running off your mouth. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d</p><p>He heard the protest in her voice, and it just pissed him off all over again. But they had to deal with Eric first.</p><p>End that, he mouthed to Del, pointing at the phone.</p><p>Her mouth tightened. Yeah, she didn\u2019t much like being told what to do. Tyler understood, but there was more than pride at stake here.</p><p>\u201cSo can we come by later?\u201d She spoke into the phone.</p><p>Eric hesitated, and Tyler had no doubt his former friend wanted to refuse. \u201cShe can come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet your head screwed on straight, man. Someone is trying to kill her. I\u2019m not in a hurry to see you, either, but if you care an ounce for her, you shouldn\u2019t want her running around unprotected.\u201d</p><p>Tyler could almost hear Eric gnashing his teeth.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he snapped finally. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>Since they were still out in the middle of the desert, it was going to be a while. \u201cWe\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Moments later, they hung up. Del clutched her hands in her lap, looking ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out,\u201d Tyler demanded.</p><p>Like she\u2019d just been waiting for a sign, Del lifted her head and looked at him like he\u2019d gone mad. \u201cSeriously? You know Eric almost as well as I do. Everything you said to him was like waving a red cape in front of an enraged bull\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t going to treat you like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was an improvement! He called Seth a kid instead of a brat. He didn\u2019t tell me to go fuck myself or that I deserved whatever mess I\u2019d gotten myself into. You told Eric to get his head out of his ass and stop thinking with his pride. You need to do the same. This crap you\u2019re pulling isn\u2019t helping. We need his cooperation to search the house. I hid the flash drive really well. Hopefully, it\u2019s still there, but we won\u2019t ever find out if you don\u2019t stop the verbal equivalent of lifting your hind leg and pissing on me like a fire hydrant.\u201d</p><p>Tyler tried to swallow down his rising fury. The crappy thing was, she was right. He was being overprotective and possessive. Eric couldn\u2019t hurt her through the phone. But he didn\u2019t like her talking to the asshole, didn\u2019t like remembering that his former buddy used to sleep curled around her, kiss her awake, join her in the shower each morning\u2014then put on his uniform and cozy up to badge bunnies all day.</p><p>Del deserved better. But above all else, she had to stay alive. Which meant that Tyler needed to stop being an ass and focus on the flash drive.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I don\u2019t want to see him hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cThanks. Sometimes, you can be a great guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be a great guy for you.\u201d The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them.</p><p>Melancholy tinged her smile. Regret. \u201cWhen I was pregnant, I used to wonder what it would have been like if we\u2019d met under different circumstances. You know, if I\u2019d never married Eric, and you two weren\u2019t friends. Would we have had any connection or would I have just been another girl you tapped and forgot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the kind of girl I can forget, Del.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we have so much history, and it\u2019s all just tangled . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s you. You\u2019re what attracts me, not the fact that you\u2019re Eric\u2019s ex-wife or the mother of my son. You\u2019re sassy, smart, funny, and honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only woman in the world like that. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done a few and probably just never talked to them long enough to learn about them.\u201d</p><p>Tyler gritted his teeth. \u201cThey weren\u2019t you. What is your fascination with my sex life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Tyler. We both know that I\u2019m one of many. Yes, Seth puts me in a slightly different category, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d He pounded on the steering wheel. \u201cIs that the crap you tell yourself so you won\u2019t care too much about me?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI just . . . know you. I\u2019ve known you for years. I\u2019m not expecting that sleeping with me or being a father will make you be a different person. I\u2019m just being realistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn some ways, yes, you have. But according to the conversation I overheard you having on the patio with your harem, you\u2019re having anal sex with Alyssa\u2019s strippers in the dressing room regularly, causing them to catfight onstage about you. That sounds like the same ol\u2019, same ol\u2019 to me.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWhatever. Like I said, I don\u2019t expect to change you.\u201d</p><p>Tyler felt heat creep up his neck and face. She had a point, but she didn\u2019t really know how he felt on the inside. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe me if I tell you I marked time with them but always wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Her smile was faintly apologetic. \u201cBe reasonable, Tyler. I\u2019ve known for years that you\u2019re a playboy. I see that something about you is different now, but if you\u2019re really trying to convince me that you\u2019re a whole new person, I need more than forty-eight hours to believe it. And if not . . . really, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not asking you to be different.\u201d</p><p>Frustration carved up Tyler\u2019s composure, but he grabbed a ruthless grip on his temper. \u201cBut I think I am. So I\u2019ll be here for you, day in and day out. You\u2019ll get it eventually.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head at him and laid a gentle hand on his arm. \u201cI think you really believe that at this moment, but the first gorgeous Latina who walks by you with cleavage and a lush booty . . . I\u2019m pretty sure I know what\u2019s going to happen. You don\u2019t have to pretend to be something for me that you\u2019re not. If you\u2019ll just spend some time with Seth and let him get to know you, that\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>But Tyler wanted more. He couldn\u2019t dispute everything he\u2019d done before Del had walked back into his life. And he couldn\u2019t convince her with words in just a few short hours that she was different to him. Only time would do that. Tyler didn\u2019t know how much of that he had.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t his mother be laughing now, if she could see him? Even she would doubt his staying power in a relationship. He might never have had any before, but this felt different. He felt tethered to Del, and it may not make sense, but he knew if the strings connecting them were cut, something in him wouldn\u2019t survive it again.</p><p>But to Del\u2019s point, she needed time. In the midst of danger and crisis wasn\u2019t the best moment to expect her to notice or believe that he had become a different man.</p><p>Gripping the wheel with one hand, he tangled the fingers of the other in her hair, bringing her close to him. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you everything you need and want\u2014and more. I promise you that. Just give me time to prove it.\u201d</p><p>A few hours and another vehicle exchange on the outskirts of L.A. later, they rolled up in front of her house. Her former house. She\u2019d loved this little Craftsman but lacked the money to buy Eric\u2019s half in the divorce. He\u2019d come up with the cash somehow, so she\u2019d signed away her rights and turned over the keys. The money had given her the down payment on a new condo, allowing her to get a fresh start with Seth. It had all worked out.</p><p>But coming back here was always like visiting a haunted house. So many memories. Some good, like Eric carrying her over the threshold with a smile. Some not so good, like the morning her pregnancy test had come up positive. There\u2019d been the barbeques and holidays with friends and family. There\u2019d been the nights Eric had come home hours after his shift ended, looking utterly spent, and when she\u2019d needed his attention, he\u2019d merely flopped on the bed and fallen into a deep sleep. Del turned her gaze away from the little house.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Tyler grabbed her hand and squeezed.</p><p>She nodded. He was trying to help, and she had to lay off him about his past. It was really none of her business who or how many women he\u2019d slept with. The jealousy was misplaced and pointless. He still slept around a lot. That was Tyler. She agreed that in some ways he\u2019d changed, but so much that he was suddenly the model of fidelity? That wasn\u2019t likely, but it didn\u2019t matter. They were here to stop Carlson, not rekindle anything. Seth had to come first. Tyler wanted to protect and help her; she needed to be grateful for that\u2014and stop wishing that, maybe, they could have more.</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Tyler ducked out of the sedan, climbing the steps up the hill beside her, heading for the door. He wrapped a beefy arm around her waist.</p><p>She sent him a rueful stare\u2014but she\u2019d be lying if she said she didn\u2019t like his protectiveness. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d And he clearly wasn\u2019t going to budge.</p><p>\u201cEric isn\u2019t going to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we really even know him anymore?\u201d His face tightened. \u201cI\u2019m not taking a chance.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Tyler had a point. In truth, she felt more secure, and maybe Eric would dial down the volume on his asshole meter if he knew someone would defend her.</p><p>As they reached the door, she knocked softly. Eric unlocked the bolt and ripped the door open, his dark eyes glowering in a newly tanned and freshly rested face as they popped back and forth between her and Tyler. His gaze settled on Tyler\u2019s palm curled around the curve of her opposite hip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of nerve,\u201d Eric spit at Tyler.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who told my friend to fuck my wife, then got pissed off when they both liked it. You cast her out onto the street when she was pregnant and you never fucking called me once to tell me she was going to have my son. What kind of miserable bastard does that make you?\u201d</p><p>Eric flushed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough to know she\u2019s better off without you.\u201d</p><p>Del stepped between them. Clearly, seeing her with Tyler brought out all of Eric\u2019s insecurities and anger. She had to try to soothe everyone\u2019s anger or this was going to end badly.</p><p>\u201cGuys, stop. So you\u2019re never going to be great friends again. Fine. But let\u2019s bury the hatchet so we can all stay alive. I\u2019d rather not stand on the porch and scream out all our secrets.\u201d</p><p>At her reminder, Eric lifted his head and looked around at the surrounding houses. He had to realize that Mrs. Morris next door, the crazy cat lady, was hanging on every word. Who knew if the perpetrators who\u2019d broken into Eric\u2019s house were nearby, listening.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d he snapped, grabbing her by the wrist and hauling her inside. Tyler had barely cleared the threshold when Eric slammed the door behind him and locked it again.</p><p>Del eased from the foyer into the living area, sinking into the familiarity of the house, its antique rocker, the sleek leather sofa. The ceiling beams stained dark, their vintage pendant lights hanging, shedding warm light on the brick hearth. He\u2019d kept all the modern lamps and accessories in brushed nickel she\u2019d selected, which had been the perfect fodder for the house\u2019s character and charm.</p><p>But the rest of the place looked like a tornado had hit it.</p><p>Broken glass littered the floor, along with a slew of papers in nearly every color of the rainbow. The globe on the mahogany stand that had once belonged to his grandfather had been toppled over. The drapes were strewn across the floor, a puddle of fabric and splintered wooden rods.</p><p>\u201cOh my . . . This is terrible. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHow did anyone get in? You\u2019re always careful about keeping the place locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it in a minute.\u201d Eric turned his glare on Tyler, then shoved him into the kitchen. \u201cThirsty?\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d already proven that imbibing together led to trouble. \u201cNo, we just need to talk to you. Let\u2019s sit in the living room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I need something to drink.\u201d He shoved at Tyler again, who looked like he was itching for a fight, too.</p><p>He\u2019d done some really awful things to her, like throwing her out when she was pregnant, but he\u2019d been hurting and lashed out. Del felt a bit like she\u2019d started it. He\u2019d been fearful of never walking again, relying on his wife to stay with him through better or worse, in sickness and in health. Instead, she\u2019d succumbed to his best friend. Yes, Eric had asked, but he hadn\u2019t asked her to enjoy it so much. He hadn\u2019t asked her to fall half in love with Tyler. He especially hadn\u2019t asked her to get pregnant. At a time when she should have been focused on him and helping him recover, getting him past his anger at fate, she\u2019d shoved him into a deeper pit of despair.</p><p>Clearly, he hadn\u2019t worked through all those issues. And now, she\u2019d brought violence to his door, then followed it up with a reminder of the breaking point in their marriage. Talk about a post-vacation letdown. He had a right to be angry\u2014and her guilt kept piling up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three thirty,\u201d she pointed out, hoping to keep him on task.</p> <p>\u201cWhich makes it past five o\u2019clock somewhere.\u201d He reached over her to grab a glass. \u201cWine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She noticed he didn\u2019t ask Tyler if he wanted anything. He just slammed the cabinet door, then reached in the pantry for the liquor. Tyler leaned against the refrigerator, keeping his back covered, and watched with narrowed eyes. Suspicious eyes. They exchanged a glance. Eric was up to something; they could both feel it. Best to get what they came for, then clear this place.</p><p>\u201cI actually just came by because I left something here a while ago for safekeeping.\u201d</p><p>He frowned as he poured a shot of whiskey and downed it. \u201cBefore the divorce?\u201d</p> <p>This was where her explanation would get tricky. \u201cNo, after.\u201d</p><p>Eric hesitated, thinking, pouring another shot. \u201cYou let yourself in with the spare key on the patio without my permission?\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for her to confirm. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on a story, an expos\u00e9. I can\u2019t say a lot now, but it\u2019s really big. The person I\u2019m writing about caught wind of my investigation. I had some of my research on a flash drive and hid it here a few weeks back, just in case. I didn\u2019t think anyone would suspect that I\u2019d keep anything valuable at my ex\u2019s house. I never thought they\u2019d hit your place. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hid evidence in my house without telling me and dragged me into this shit unwittingly, but you won\u2019t cough up who or what you\u2019re investigating? Is that right?\u201d</p><p>Del winced at his bitterness. \u201cIt\u2019s safer if you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s dark gaze slid over to Tyler.</p> <p>\u201cBut you dragged him into it? Because you trust him more or care about his safety less?\u201d</p><p>As he tossed back the second shot and swallowed it, that question dropped between them like a bomb loaded with a ton of TNT. Either reply had the potential to turn this downright ugly. She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cNo answer for that, huh?\u201d Eric drawled, pouring a third shot. \u201cHow about I help you? You ran to him first because you trust him to help you, no matter how pissed he might be at you about the br\u2014\u201d He looked sideways at Tyler. \u201cAbout Seth. How long was it before you let him back in your pussy?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Del thought of lying, but Eric would see through that fast, and being dishonest would only make the situation worse.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already fucked you?\u201d Her ex-husband laughed bitterly, then sucked back his third shot of whiskey. \u201cGod, I\u2019m a stupid ass. Of course he did. My old pal fucks anything that moves, and you itched to take him for another ride, didn\u2019t you? You tracked him down so he could shove that big, prized cock of his right into your cunt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your goddamned mouth,\u201d Tyler growled. \u201cNow. Before I shut it myself. You begged her to have sex with me that night, just like you begged me to fuck her. We had never crossed the friend line before you suggested it. Don\u2019t shove your baggage on us. Shit happened. If you couldn\u2019t handle it, you shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d</p><p>Eric threw his hands in the air. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. I should have realized you two were hot for each other. I should have thrown you out of my life the minute I suspected you had a hard-on for my wife.\u201d</p><p>Before she could sputter a word, Eric charged Tyler, grabbing something from his back pocket. Handcuffs. Del tried to sputter a warning at Tyler. But with the refrigerator at his back and a wall of cabinets beside him, he had nowhere to go.</p> <p>Eric hooked one cuff around Tyler\u2019s wrist with a decisive click. Tyler punched him in the jaw with his free hand. Despite Eric\u2019s head snapping back, he maintained focus and yanked on the cuffs. Tyler stumbled, close enough for Eric to snap the other cuff around the handle of the refrigerator, tethering Tyler in a blink.</p><p>Del gasped.</p><p>Like an animal of prey, Eric whirled on her and began stalking. A terrible smile spread across his face. At six feet two inches and with an active life, he was a wall of solid muscle. No way she could outrun or outfight him. Apprehension tightened Del\u2019s stomach. What was he up to?</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to intimidate me? Because this is stupid. Just let me get what I came for, then we\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>Eric shook his head, his shaggy, dark hair moving with him. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten what I let you come for. That night he fucked you\u2014\u201d He nodded over at Tyler. \u201cI saw a whole other side of you, babe. I saw a very naughty vixen. You\u2019d have given him anything that night. You\u2019d have let him come down your throat or shove his dick up your ass\u2014all the things I never got out of you. I saw you come for him over and over. And I had to watch you not only take pleasure but demand it. I was fucking helpless to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou touched me,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you screamed his name when you came.\u201d Bitterness streaked across his dark features, the kind she hadn\u2019t seen since early in their split. \u201cYou put on quite a show. Do you know what that did to me?\u201d</p><p>Del could imagine. His self-confidence had never been the best. The resulting quirks were sometimes hard to live with. But everything had been much worse after the shooting.</p><p>Eric raised a dark brow at her. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going to put on a show for him.\u201d</p><p>His words sent panic thrumming through her body. She didn\u2019t like the sound of that at all. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay the fuck away from her,\u201d Tyler demanded, yanking so hard on his cuffs that the refrigerator rolled a few inches across the floor.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. With Eric squarely blocking her path to Tyler, she couldn\u2019t get to him. Even if she could run fast enough to escape her ex-husband, she wouldn\u2019t leave Tyler here to take his wrath. She had to stand her ground and get them both out of this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, babe. I just want to make you come while he watches.\u201d</p><p>Eric had never been particularly good at bringing her to climax when they\u2019d been married. And this now was nothing more than a power trip, one he wanted to take to salvage his pride. He didn\u2019t really even want her; he just wanted to rub Tyler\u2019s nose in her orgasm. After everything that had happened during their breakup and her pregnancy, the thought of Eric touching her again made her stomach pitch and roll.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t terribly surprised. In fact, she should have seen this coming. Eric had always looked for validation in everything. His lack of self-confidence sometimes drove him to take stupid risks. That\u2019s how he\u2019d been shot in the first place, trying to play the hero without adequate backup.</p><p>\u201cYou better not fucking touch her!\u201d Tyler shouted, jerking against his restraints.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eric asked, all innocence. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be great fun to watch the woman you love get off at the hands of another man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, Eric.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest, shooting him her sternest look.</p><p>He stalked closer, and Del had nowhere to go. She held up her hands to ward him off, but that was like hoping a butterfly net would stop a barreling semi.</p><p>\u201cSure, it is. I want to get my tongue on your pussy, Del. How does that sound, Tyler?\u201d Eric tossed a triumphant glare over his shoulder at his former friend.</p><p>Hell no. She had to put a stop to this now.</p><p>Del pulled her cell phone out of her pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t want this, and I don\u2019t want you, Eric. Are you planning to rape me? Really?\u201d</p><p>He cocked a brow. \u201cSince you basically cheated on me when I was crippled and wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever walk again, don\u2019t you think you owe me the chance now to prove that I can flip your switch as much as he does?\u201d</p><p>After throwing her out because she was pregnant? After divorcing her in nothing flat, despite the fact that she\u2019d taken care of him for months? His insecurity and feelings of inadequacy had been understandable, given how fast and hard she\u2019d fallen for Tyler that night, but he\u2019d pushed them together, and she couldn\u2019t change it now. Her bigger question was, why the hell hadn\u2019t he gotten over it in the last two years?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you want me back,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cOur marriage fell apart in six short weeks. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re not going to make me come, and I\u2019m not going to let you try.\u201d She focused on her phone for a second, then sent him a warning. \u201cCome a step closer, and I\u2019ll call nine-one-one.\u201d</p><p>That only made Eric laugh. \u201cWhich one of my friends will respond to the call? You think they\u2019re going to help the adultering whore who broke my heart and the traitor who knocked her up?\u201d</p><p>His words sank in and made her feel all kinds of sick, but Eric was right. No one who responded to her distress call would believe her or lift a finger to help her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Tyler growled.</p><p>He yanked on his cuff again, but there was no way he was getting free. The handle of the refrigerator was built seamlessly into the unit and made of solid steel, as were the cuffs. He cursed, then turned to riffle through the nearby drawers for the cooking knives. They were empty, and he struggled to tear them out of the cabinets, to no avail. She realized now that the counter had been cleared of the blender and other heavy knickknacks Tyler might have thrown or used as weapons. When he wrenched open the cabinet above, all the glasses had been removed. Eric sent his former friend a terrible smile.</p><p>Del\u2019s stomach plummeted, cramped. Eric had clearly put some thought into this plan. God, now she was actually terrified. How far would fury and insecurity push her ex-husband?</p><p>An awful feeling of vulnerability set in. Panic. After the shooting, Del had quickly learned that, when angry, Eric was capable of hideous insults that he may or may not regret later. Now that he was healthy and mobile again, she suspected he was capable of much worse than hurtful words. And that he was bent on some sort of revenge.</p><p>\u201cIf I ever meant anything to you, please don\u2019t touch me.\u201d Del heard the pleading note in her voice, and as much as she hated to show weakness, she hoped it penetrated the thick shell of his rage.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. He just came closer and gripped her wrist, tugging on it to drag her to him. \u201cIt\u2019s because you meant something to me that I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. This was about Eric\u2019s pride, about hurting Tyler. About losing out. Whatever love he\u2019d felt for her had died long ago.</p><p>\u201cYou look so pretty, Del. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d He wrapped his free arm around her waist and ground his erection against her stomach, tried to nuzzle her neck.</p><p>Apprehension soaring, she pushed at him. \u201cEric, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off of her, you motherfucker!\u201d Tyler shouted, yanking again on the handcuffs. The refrigerator rattled across the hardwood floor. Blood trickled down his wrist.</p><p>Del\u2019s heart lurched in her throat. Tyler was going to hurt himself getting free. And given the fury thundering across his face, he would kill Eric\u2014and enjoy every minute of it. If Carlson became DA and got wind of the fact that Tyler was trying to help her, the corrupt bastard would make sure that Tyler went down hard. Being convicted of murdering a cop never came with an easy sentence.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Tyler.\u201d Her voice shook. As frightened as she was, panicking wasn\u2019t going to help either of them. She had to keep him from doing his worst.</p><p>\u201cFuck that!\u201d He strained against the cuffs. But the two feet separating him from Eric might as well have been a chasm.</p><p>\u201cRelax, babe,\u201d Eric murmured in her ear, spreading kisses across her jaw, heading toward her mouth. \u201cI just want to kiss you, make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>No, he just wanted to flaunt her to Tyler.</p><p>She shivered. Familiarity mixed with her fear. A huge part of her was furious, even felt betrayed all over again . . . but even now, guilt clung like frost to a window. On the surface, her marriage had ended because Eric hadn\u2019t been able to handle the sexual favor he\u2019d asked of his wife and his best friend. But deep down, they\u2019d divorced because she had been more in love with Tyler than her own husband after that night\u2014and Eric had known it. It would be easy to lay all the blame at his feet\u2014but not entirely fair. She\u2019d played her role. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEric, don\u2019t . . .\u201d She almost couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to solve anything. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of her face and forced her stare into his. The anguish and lack of self-confidence there wrenched at her heart. Since she\u2019d gone, she knew he worked too many hours and drank too much when he was off duty. She\u2019d heard that he plowed through dozens of women, as if trying to prove that he was no less appealing than Tyler.</p><p>Fighting Eric physically was futile. Since regaining his mobility, he\u2019d clearly been working out. He\u2019d never been in better shape. Her only choice was to try to fend him off with words. And if she could give him any peace, maybe this would stop and they could all move on with their lives.</p><p>\u201cBabe . . . Did I\u2014I matter to you? Really?\u201d</p> <p>There was his painful insecurity. He hated it, and the vulnerability always made him so angry that he got mean. She had to talk fast. \u201cOf course! I married you. I lived with you. I bought a house with you. I took care of you when you were shot. I loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never once responded to sex with me the way you did to Tyler that night.\u201d Self-doubt clouded his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d she tried to argue. \u201cWhat we had is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of him. And I hate the way we ended, babe. I want to remember what you feel like again.\u201d Eric bent toward her.</p><p>His gaze caught hers, fused her stare with his as he came closer, closer. Before she could shove him away, he pressed their lips together, then nudged her mouth open and dove in. In the background, she could hear Tyler growl, his handcuffs rattle against the stainless steel. But the nervous roar of her heartbeat filled her ears. Eric tasted like whiskey and desperation. Aversion filled her, and she tried to wrench away, wishing she were anyplace else. But he couldn\u2019t stay in this emotional limbo where he both wanted and hated her, where he seemed determined to punish all of them for the past.</p> <p>Del pushed against the hard granite of his chest, dying a little inside. Two years ago, she would have been so grateful for any sign that he didn\u2019t hate her. Now, everything inside her rebelled. She pushed again, but Eric didn\u2019t notice, merely dragged her closer, fitting his hard body against her curves and moaning into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you come, babe. It\u2019s going to feel so good.\u201d</p><p>No chance of that happening. She gave him a little shove.</p><p>\u201cDel! Goddamn it, no!\u201d Tyler shouted.</p><p>When Eric tried to take her mouth again, she bit his lip. He yelped, and she broke away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? You want to play rough? Is that how you like it now? Fine by me.\u201d Eric licked at the little cut she\u2019d made in his lip and began to unbutton his shirt, looking at her with nasty promise in his eyes.</p> <p>Her belly flipped, turned. Nerves set in, but she forced herself to try to stay calm. Both men were damn near rabid with anger. If she lost it, too, this was going to get ugly fast. Tyler getting in the middle of it was only challenging Eric more and making him ratchet up faster. She gave Tyler a little shake of her head. He had to understand that they\u2019d get nowhere finding the flash drive or healing their past unless Eric could get some confidence and closure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to watch, is it?\u201d Eric gloated. \u201cSeeing me kiss her? Wait until I put my hands and lips all over her, then get my cock deep inside her and fuck her breathless. How furious and helpless do you think you\u2019re going to feel then?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>FUCK no. His inability to help Del brewed a raging fury in Tyler that he felt to the very core of his being. \u201cYou begged me to have sex with Del. I didn\u2019t ask for this shit today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you demanded she come for you repeatedly, then knocked her up, you absolutely did,\u201d Eric assured.</p><p>\u201cEric . . .\u201d Del protested. \u201cI don\u2019t want this. You\u2019re forcing me. If we were any other two people, you\u2019d arrest the bastard for what you\u2019re doing to me now.\u201d</p><p>His former friend just shrugged, seemingly determined to prove something to everyone in the room, especially himself. Del sought to defuse the situation, but the way he\u2019d worked himself up, Tyler doubted that saying anything to the stubborn bastard was going to do a damn bit of good.</p><p>Eric freed the last of his buttons and shoved his shirt off his shoulders. He\u2019d always been in good shape, but now his body was leaner, harder, roped with more muscle. Bigger. Del\u2019s breathing turned ragged. Her eyes went wide with fear.</p> <p>Anger pumped through Tyler\u2019s veins. Dread kicked him in the stomach. Again, he yanked on the cuff. The refrigerator was heavier than a motherfucker, and it screeched across the hardwood floor another inch or two. His wrist throbbed like a bitch. Drops of blood burned their way down his forearm. He didn\u2019t care. Whatever it took to get to Del.</p><p>\u201cCome here, babe.\u201d Eric brushed his knuckles across her nipples, tweaking one hard enough to make her whimper.</p><p>\u201cGet your fucking hands off her,\u201d Tyler demanded, grabbing both handles of the refrigerator now and trying to drag it close enough to kick Eric\u2019s ass. The heavy-duty plug tethered to the wall prevented him from going any farther.</p><p>And Tyler couldn\u2019t unsee the way his former friend manhandled her, the way she struggled against him futilely. The vision burned into his brain. A violent urge to pound Eric into the ground roared through him.</p><p>Then the bastard upped the stakes and yanked off Del\u2019s shirt in a few swipes of his hand. She screamed and shoved at him, fighting the panic dawning on her face. \u201cEric, don\u2019t. Please. Listen to reason. This is wrong and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo means no!\u201d Tyler roared.</p><p>Eric ignored them both and clawed her bra off, even as Del fought, kicking and slapping. In seconds, she stood half naked, backing away. When she tried to cross her arms over her bare breasts, he grabbed her wrists and held them together at the small of her back, forcing her to arch closer to him.</p><p>\u201cNone of that,\u201d Eric chastised her. \u201cGive me everything you gave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t want this! How many times do I have to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a chance. I\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d Eric cradled a breast in his hand, and a fresh need to kill crashed through Tyler. \u201cGod, I missed these. You\u2019ve always had pretty tits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, stop now!\u201d Tyler roared. \u201cOr I swear I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a glance that begged for his silence. Del wanted him to shut up and let her handle it? That went against every protective instinct he possessed. He knew she\u2019d be dead if she didn\u2019t get her hands on that flash drive, and Eric, the jealous bastard, wasn\u2019t about to let her search for it until he got his pound of flesh.</p><p>His former pal didn\u2019t respond to the threat, merely shifted so Tyler would have a great view of him pinching Del\u2019s bare nipple. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stop that night when I wanted you to. Instead, you fucked her more. I think I\u2019ll take a page out of your book.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d barely processed that stab in the back before Eric lifted her breast and bent toward it. Del cringed, screamed, and pushed at him with all her might. Tyler saw red.</p><p>Fuck, he\u2019d give anything to spare her this, to be able to fight this battle for her. Del needed him, and he\u2019d never imagined that Eric would force his point or try to heal his own inferiority complex this way. Tyler wouldn\u2019t make the mistake of underestimating him twice.</p><p>Her ex-husband came after her again, going after the sensitive tip of her breast she\u2019d managed to keep from him. She pushed hard at his chest. \u201cStop, damn you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen! The difference between that night and now? I wasn\u2019t forcing her,\u201d Tyler ground out. \u201cI would never hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Eric caressed her shoulder. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think she\u2019d be running out the door now if she didn\u2019t need your help? Call it what you want, but she said no. If you go any further, it\u2019s rape.\u201d</p><p>Eric merely grabbed Del\u2019s arm tightly, forcing her to be still, and licked her nipple, dragging his tongue across the tip, throwing every ounce of possessive fury to race through Tyler\u2019s veins. Del looked ashen, shaken as she punched at him.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t bother to fight the urge to rip Eric limb from limb. He lunged, dragging the refrigerator across the floor with a screech another few inches, pulling the cord from the wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to annihilate you into so many pieces, they\u2019ll need tweezers to find all the parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut first, you\u2019ll know the joy of watching the woman you love coming for another man.\u201d</p><p>As Eric backed Del against the counter so she had nowhere to retreat, he took her nipple back into his mouth. He tore at the snap of her pants. Even as Del shoved at him, he yanked her zipper down, jerking everything, including her panties, around her hips. Then he thrust his hand between her legs.</p><p>Del screamed and fought, but it only insinuated the bastard\u2019s fingers deeper in her folds.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wet yet,\u201d Eric chided. \u201cStay still. Let me fix that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of no don\u2019t you understand?\u201d She sounded damn close to hysterical, and Tyler had to fight back another wave of fury. \u201cYou\u2019re angry and feel betrayed. I understand.\u201d Del squeezed her thighs together, trying to dislodge him. \u201cBut I do not want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d She sobbed. \u201cIt\u2019s over, done. We\u2019re divorced. I didn\u2019t reject you. We grew apart and put an end to the marriage. Just move on.\u201d</p><p>As Eric shook his head and rubbed in slow circles around Del\u2019s pussy, frustration poured hot acid fury all over Tyler. He growled and kicked at the refrigerator. God, it hurt to watch them, especially when tears began to run down her cheeks. Another mountain of impotent rage crashed through Tyler, like the bowels of hell had opened up and poured in pure molten fury.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go back in time,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t force me to want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me.\u201d Eric tangled his free hand in her hair and yanked, snapping her head back. Del\u2019s eyes flew open, and he pinned her beneath his furious, dark stare. Violence poured off him.</p><p>Tyler feared there was a good chance Eric would leave Del violated and broken if he didn\u2019t do something fast. As much as he hated to give Eric the satisfaction, Tyler gladly swallowed his pride.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to hurt me, make me jealous? Angry?\u201d he challenged Eric. \u201cYou got it. You win. Watching you touch her is like having my insides gnawed on and spit out. It\u2019s fucking torture. You hate me, not Del, so stop hurting her, and let\u2019s settle this like men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Tyler!\u201d she protested.</p><p>Eric paused, clearly listening. \u201cGo on . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the chance to beat the shit out of me? Take it now. Don\u2019t be a coward and hurt the woman. Come fight me like a man.\u201d</p><p>Eric cocked his head. Some part of him was tempted. But then he turned his focus on Del again, as if he knew Tyler would hate seeing her mauled way more than having a black eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather touch her. Come on, babe,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Del recoiled, her expression filling with resolve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the way things turned out. I\u2019m sorry if what happened between me and Tyler makes you feel rejected.\u201d Then she shoved Eric\u2019s hand away from her pussy and finally got enough space between them to knee him in the balls. He doubled over and grunted out in pain. Tyler would have clapped if he could have.</p><p>\u201cDel . . .\u201d Eric groaned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for a lot of things, but I\u2019ll never be sorry for defending myself. Don\u2019t ever fucking touch me again.\u201d</p><p>Eric growled and grimaced as he tried to stand upright again.</p><p>She yanked her panties up, wriggled into her jeans\u2014then slapped his face. \u201cI won\u2019t let you use me to drive Tyler over the edge. Eric, you manipulated me, then took your anger out on me and abandoned me when I needed you most. I\u2019ll never trust you with my body again. Stop your pity party. My feelings have nothing to do with your looks or prowess. You showed me in a million different ways that you didn\u2019t love me. Blaming me for your request and the consequence of it was the worst. Just . . . move on. If it makes you feel any better, Tyler and I aren\u2019t planning any sort of happily ever after. We\u2019re just trying to keep Seth and me alive.\u201d</p><p>Eric winced, blinking at her in shock as he continued to cup his gonads. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to fuck him to stay alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I need reassurance and human contact from a man I trust.\u201d</p><p>Tyler was damn proud of the way she stood up for herself and told Eric exactly why he was a douche bag. But the tears filling her eyes\u2014and the dispassionate way she reduced their relationship to irrelevance\u2014stabbed Tyler right in the chest.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the first person to hold me since the divorce,\u201d Del went on. \u201cI know you can\u2019t say the same.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eric looked away, guilt all over his face. \u201cGoddamn it, Del. Why him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he never once let me down,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBecause he would never do what you just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Eric blinked, frowned, as if finally realizing that he\u2019d done something terribly wrong. He eased back into the nearest kitchen chair, folding his big body into it with a sigh and dropping his face into his hands. \u201cI guess I deserved that. I never meant to hurt you . . . But you bruised my pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bruised my trust.\u201d Once it seemed clear that the fight had gone out of Eric, she reached for the rest of her clothes and yanked them on. \u201cWhen we were married, I wanted to love and believe in you so badly, and when you turned your back on me for honoring your wishes . . . you crushed me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to handle what happened.\u201d His face tightened, a deep frown settling between his brows. \u201cI expected it to feel like I was with you again. Instead, it was like watching you reveal what was really in your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler made me feel beautiful and treasured that night. With all the anger you\u2019d blasted at the world after your shooting, I hadn\u2019t felt that in a really long time.\u201d</p><p>Eric whipped a stunned stare up to her, as if she\u2019d stabbed him in the heart again. The acceptance settled across his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I loved you in my way. Maybe that wasn\u2019t how you needed to be loved. God, I\u2019m so fucked up. So damn angry.\u201d His face crumbled, and he looked as if he might cry. But he manned up and swallowed the tears down.</p><p>With a frown, Eric waved a hand in the air. \u201cGo. See if you can find what you\u2019re looking for, then leave. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>Solemnly, Del nodded and approached Eric. \u201cThat makes two of us. Get some professional help. Find someone you can truly love. Handcuff key?\u201d</p> <p>After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Eric fished it from his pocket and set it in her palm.</p><p>Tyler watched her make her way to him, then fit the key into the hole. He breathed out. It wasn\u2019t a sigh of relief. Anticipation thrummed through him, making his heart race, his fists clench. He was going to destroy the fucker now\u2014and he couldn\u2019t wait. But the closer Del got, the more she looked pale and terrified. \u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze, her blue eyes watery. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t, and a renewed ferocity consumed Tyler. \u201cBullshit. He hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, he saw as Del tried not to reveal how much Eric\u2019s rough treatment had disturbed her, but it bled through. It wouldn\u2019t be enough to leave Eric battered and dead on the floor. Tyler wanted to tear the asshole up into small, unrecognizable pieces. Whatever it took to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAre you all right? You\u2019re bleeding.\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at his wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let me loose. Let me at the son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned the key and freed his wrist, leaving the other cuff attached to the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tear him limb from limb.\u201d He took a ground-eating step toward Eric, menace charging through him.</p><p>Del grabbed his arm tightly with both hands and tugged. \u201cBe smart. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>His entire body shook with the need to dismantle Eric. Rage gnawed at him. His fists clenched. His heart pumped.</p><p>\u201cIf you touch him, they\u2019ll throw the book at you,\u201d Del pointed out. \u201cAnd if you go to jail, what happens to me and Seth?\u201d</p><p>They probably died. Fuck. And if he disrespected her wishes, was he any better than Eric?</p><p>Tyler gritted his teeth and dragged her into his arms. God, she felt good here, and he wanted to eliminate Eric because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of seeing Del hurt or threatened ever again. But in this case, she was right.</p> <p>That didn\u2019t stop the adrenaline from coursing through his system like a drug, revving him up. He was jagged, on edge. How the hell was he going to make her feel safe while taking the top off his frustration? He needed to either fight or fuck.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I won\u2019t touch him.\u201d Yet.</p><p>Emotional overload hit Del. She melted against him, trembling in his arms. Tyler did his best to manage his raving frustration and pulled her closer, where she\u2019d be safe. But over her shoulder, he glared with blatant hostility at Eric.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Del breathed.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t thank him yet. His restraint was only going to last for so long.</p><p>Tyler eased her back and thumbed the fresh tears from her face. \u201cLet\u2019s find your flash drive and go.\u201d</p><p>He almost choked on the words. He really just wanted to kill the motherfucker, but Del needed his comfort and protection more than he needed to unleash his temper.</p><p>She gave him a watery smile and slipped her hand in his. The trust she showed him now, especially after Eric had abused hers so wretchedly, floored him.</p><p>Squeezing her hand, Tyler let her lead him through the house. They stepped over broken glass, around toppled furniture, their feet wrinkling papers beneath them. Finally, at the end of the hall, they entered one of the spare bedrooms. Del had used it for an office at one point. Now, it held Eric\u2019s weight equipment, all scattered across the floor.</p><p>She trotted over to the closet and opened the door. The house had been built in the 1920s, and the tiny closet was almost nonexistent. The dark hardwood floors gleamed, and Del knelt and shoved her fingernail into a little ridge in the floorboard, popping the wooden plank up with the first yank. The board clattered to the floor as she stuck her hand inside the little hidden cubby.</p><p>A moment later, she froze and looked up at him with wide eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>AS soon as they left Eric\u2019s house, Tyler folded Del into the car and pulled out his phone. Shit, she looked shell-shocked. Devastated. And his need to pound on the person responsible nearly pushed him beyond reason. He didn\u2019t fucking know how to make this better for her. Eric claimed he didn\u2019t know anything about her flash drive. Didn\u2019t even know she\u2019d ever hidden anything in that spot. He\u2019d had some work done to the floors last month after the hot water heater had leaked and caused some flooding . . . right around the time Del had hidden the little device. And of course, someone had broken into the house. Anything could have happened. Anyone could have taken it.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t like this shit. The urge to kill Eric still rode him hard. It had taken everything in him to leave the fucker alive. Now, dread gripped Tyler as well.</p><p>He grabbed Del\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out. Who would have broken into Eric\u2019s house? I doubt it was random or a simple burglar. You told your friend Lisa that you\u2019d hidden the flash drive here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but I can\u2019t imagine that she\u2019d betray me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever wants to imagine that someone they trust would willingly hurt them, but we have to look at every possibility. Who else knew where you\u2019d hidden your information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. Carlson must have decided to hit Eric\u2019s place on the off chance that I\u2019d hidden something there.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. He\u2019d keep working all those angles.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to be clever, but Carlson\u2019s mind works a lot more deviously than mine.\u201d Del sighed tiredly. \u201cEvery bit of my research is gone. I\u2019d been sketching a timeline, keeping track of contacts I\u2019d made. I can probably remember some of it, but not phone numbers and exact dates and . . . I\u2019d even started drafting a story. I never imagined that he\u2019d blow up my laptop and that I\u2019d have to start from scratch. That will take longer. I don\u2019t know if I have that much time before he\u2019s named DA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t back up at the office?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cA colleague had his work stolen about six weeks ago. He was working late at night, and some goons came in, roughed him up, and took everything he had on his story. The paper is supposed to be instituting new security procedures, but they haven\u2019t implemented them yet. So I didn\u2019t dare leave my stuff there.\u201d</p><p>And home wouldn\u2019t have been any better. In fact, Tyler bet if they went by her place now, they\u2019d see that it had been violated, too. This fucker Carlson was thorough and seemingly one step ahead.</p><p>She blew out a deep, troubled breath, looking exhausted. \u201cMaybe Seth and I should assume aliases and move out of the country. If I stay, there\u2019s no way Carlson won\u2019t hunt us down eventually and kill us. I don\u2019t want to be always looking over my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>Del covered her face with her hands. She didn\u2019t sob aloud or shake with tears. But Tyler felt her desperation deep in the gnawing of his gut. He swore under his breath, even as he wrapped an arm around her. A deep sense of possession gripped him. No fucking way was she simply going to disappear. If she needed protection, he\u2019d give it to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t ask you for more. You\u2019ve already dropped your life to help me, been so supportive . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no asking. It isn\u2019t negotiable. I will help you. You and Seth will be safe. Put that worry from your mind for now. You start thinking about who you can talk to in order to rebuild your story. I\u2019ll see about making sure we have a safe place to stay for a while. Now, how much did Eric hurt you? Do you need to go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe scared me and hurt my feelings more than anything. I . . .\u201d She blinked away fresh tears. \u201cI feel betrayed. I loved him once. If I hadn\u2019t talked him down, I don\u2019t know how far he would have gone.\u201d</p><p>No question in Tyler\u2019s mind that Eric would have pinned Del to the floor and done his worst. He didn\u2019t even know the bitter, vindictive bastard Eric had become since the shooting\u2014and the divorce. Just thinking about it made him violent again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Tyler whispered. \u201cDeep breaths. Sit back. Let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>With a soft touch, she reached up and cradled his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve been alone for so long, it\u2019s nice to have someone to lean on. I\u2019ll miss this.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d gone. That was her intimation. Tyler tightened his jaw. Yeah, fuck that.</p><p>As if she had no clue that his tension was escalating, Del leaned back in the passenger\u2019s seat. Tyler started the car, and a soft ballad drifted from the speakers, and though he hated the song, he didn\u2019t touch the radio. If it brought her peace, he\u2019d deal.</p><p>As he flipped a U-turn and gunned the car down the street, he looked back and saw Eric watching them from the front window, his gaze following until they turned out of sight. He gripped the wheel with white knuckles, wishing it was the asshole\u2019s neck.</p><p>Reaching for his phone, he punched in Jack\u2019s number. His pal and new boss answered on the first ring. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flash drive is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the ex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019s involved?\u201d</p><p>Tyler hesitated. Del likely thought Eric was just lashing out. But Tyler couldn\u2019t rule out the possibility that Eric was trying to sabotage her story, or worse, get her killed, for his vendetta. \u201cPossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dangerous?\u201d</p><p>Now, Tyler didn\u2019t skip a beat. \u201cVery likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t talk? Del near?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll add him to my list of people to look into. You might have another problem. Del\u2019s friend, Lisa? She\u2019s had a bit of trouble with credit cards. She\u2019s awfully fond of Nordstrom, Coach, and Prada. Has had a few maxed-out credit cards for a while. Transferring one balance to another card for lower interest rates, blah, blah, blah. She paid most of that off this morning, to the tune of thirty thousand dollars. I want to know where she suddenly got the money.\u201d</p><p>Tyler wanted that answer, too. \u201cAny record of interesting phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Squeaky clean. But that just means there may be a non-traceable, prepaid cell somewhere in the mix. I\u2019ll keep running it down. There\u2019s an answer, and I\u2019m going to find it.\u201d</p><p>Great. Another fucking traitor. That made Tyler\u2019s mood even peachier.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDigging into Carlson has been interesting. A lot of chatter. A lot of rumor and innuendo. If I had to bet, the guy is crooked as a dog\u2019s hind leg. There\u2019s a whole lotta people around him either toeing the company line or saying nothing at all. I don\u2019t like the way it smells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. Especially since someone broke into Eric\u2019s house and trashed the place, but apparently didn\u2019t take anything, except maybe her research.\u201d</p><p>Jack hesitated. \u201cWho knew you were going to see him?\u201d</p><p>Tyler was intensely aware of Del\u2019s eyes on him and couldn\u2019t say a damn thing.</p><p>But Jack was intuitive, as always. \u201cLet me guess, Lisa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He\u2019d bet she\u2019d sold Del out to Carlson for thirty grand. Tyler didn\u2019t like where this conversation was going. His frustration ratcheted up another notch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this car too long.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was just going to suggest a change of vehicle. Xander is on the ground in L.A. now. I\u2019ll have him call you to arrange something. Got a place to stay?\u201d</p><p>No, and night was coming in a few hours. Del was exhausted and needed somewhere she could feel safe. \u201cWe could go to a motel.\u201d</p><p>But Tyler didn\u2019t love the idea. Carlson would expect that in L.A. He had too many eyes and ears in this city. Motels were public. It would be too easy for Carlson to get a dirty judge to issue a warrant for their arrest and a SWAT team to come after them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got eyes on you . . .\u201d</p> <p>Clearly, Jack was thinking right along the same lines, and Tyler wasn\u2019t about to put Del in more danger.</p><p>\u201cAny other suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave it up to Xander. He\u2019s from that neck of the woods. Money can buy you a lot of security, and Logan says he has a shitload of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a handout or a babysitter, just a little help.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cXander likes playing at the edges of this dangerous shit, so if you want his help, you\u2019re going to have to suck it up and take it all.\u201d</p> <p>Just fucking dandy. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll try to find someplace to lay low until he calls.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. For all Jack\u2019s good-ol\u2019-Cajun-boy routine, he still had a lot of Special Forces and suspicious bastard in him. Tyler related.</p><p>He tossed the phone on the dashboard, aware of Del\u2019s stare. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Before he could shove his rage down again and find an answer, his phone rang. PRIVATE CALLER displayed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he growled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d a man asked.</p> <p>\u201cWho wants to know?\u201d</p><p>The man on the other end of the line laughed. \u201cAll you sons of bitches are cautious. It\u2019s Xander.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed. The cavalry had arrived\u2014damn quick. \u201cYeah. Thanks for the vehicular assistance across country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sweat. Your truck is making its way back to Lafayette as we speak. May likes driving it. She\u2019ll drop it off with Alyssa. I guess they know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Tyler frowned.</p><p>\u201cSame profession, at least once upon a time.\u201d</p><p>In other words, they\u2019d both been strippers. \u201cThank May for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I have something really special in mind.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler heard the playful lechery in the other man\u2019s voice. \u201cGreat. Spare me the details.\u201d</p><p>Xander laughed, something robust and genuine. \u201cI\u2019m not great at sharing anyway. Ask my brother. But that\u2019s another subject for another day. Tell me where you are and what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new car. A place to stay, if you\u2019ve got one. We have to start tracking down some people and information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Xander didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cCan you meet me at the little regional airport in Santa Monica in thirty minutes?\u201d</p><p>Tyler gauged the number of miles to the destination versus the traffic. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019ve never met, how will I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a pretty girl with you?\u201d Xander asked playfully.</p><p>He gnashed his teeth and gripped the phone. \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t fucking share at all.\u201d</p><p>Xander laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, Tyler frowned. He had no idea how to take the bastard. A prankster or a player? With a shake of his head, he tossed his cell back on the dashboard. God, more shit. It all just pissed him off.</p><p>Del\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cThat didn\u2019t sound like it went very well. How well do we know this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack says he\u2019s rich, knows L.A., and has connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he, a drug dealer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan wouldn\u2019t make friends with a criminal, guaranteed. He\u2019s as true-blue as they come. Xander apparently helped him save Tara from something really dangerous before they were married, and they\u2019re tight. Logan says he\u2019s a stand-up guy. I have to guess that Xander likes yanking people\u2019s chains a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>They spent the next few minutes in silence, Del using Tyler\u2019s phone to send Alyssa texts to check up on Seth and finding that all was well. Knowing that seemed to calm her. He was glad one of them was coming down from the rush. Tyler still felt like a ticking bomb.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she began. \u201cFor everything you\u2019ve done. You didn\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop there.\u201d Tyler sent her an unyielding glare. \u201cYes, I did. It\u2019s your problem, and Seth\u2019s problem. Therefore, it\u2019s my problem. Because I care. Don\u2019t act like I\u2019m doing you a huge fucking favor. I want to take care of you, and you know it. I\u2019m trying to prove it. After watching Eric damn near molest you, I\u2019m not really in the mood for the distance you\u2019re trying to put between us. You say you just want to fuck until we sort all this out, and no way am I turning that down. But don\u2019t pull this overly polite shit and try to keep walls between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he growled. \u201cRemember, we did it your way two years ago and it was a huge clusterfuck. It\u2019s my way now. And if you don\u2019t stop, you\u2019re going to find out exactly how possessive and insistent I can be. As it is, I\u2019m fighting my inner caveman. After watching Eric put his hands all over you, it\u2019s all I can do not to go back and beat the fuck out of him. Or stop the car right now, strip those annoying clothes off of you, and get you underneath me.\u201d He pulled the sunglasses down to the bridge of his nose and looked at her with a blatantly masculine demand. \u201cYour pick.\u201d</p><p>DEL blinked, then blinked again. Holy hell. This was affable, laugh-a-minute playboy Tyler?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I . . . Neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuzz! Wrong answer. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really have to ask?\u201d</p><p>No, she supposed she didn\u2019t. The situation with Eric had been beyond tense. Tyler might be laid back most times, but apparently he had a big ol\u2019 alpha streak, and she\u2019d just run smack into it. He was edgy, his thumb tapping rapidly on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully . . . aggressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the real me. When you were married to Eric, you saw the pal, the prankster. You saw the guy who didn\u2019t take much seriously because I didn\u2019t have anything to be serious about. I still want to have fun, but when it comes to you, I\u2019m serious as a fucking heart attack.\u201d</p><p>His words should scare her. But it felt so good to be so wanted. It was probably temporary. He\u2019d never been a forever kind of man. If she let him, he\u2019d screw her out of his system. That was probably for the best. She couldn\u2019t imagine trying commitment again.</p><p>\u201cTyler, we said we would just . . . be together while this stuff is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You suggested that. I never agreed. I walked away once because you asked me to. I told you, I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>Del saw the signs for the turnoff to the airport. She grimaced. \u201cWhen have you ever thought about settling down with one woman in your life? You, who nailed a different woman every night, sometimes more than one? You used to get drunk and talk about your daddy running off. Your mother told you that you\u2019re just like him\u2014and you agreed. You can\u2019t be hearing your biological clock ticking since you have a son. So what\u2019s with the sudden change of heart?\u201d</p><p>Tyler gripped the wheel. He looked mad. Madder than mad, actually. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to buy into the old bullshit anymore. So my mom thought I was a deadbeat. I can\u2019t prove that she\u2019s wrong. But there\u2019s a huge difference between marrying a girl straight out of high school that you knocked up and wanting a woman who makes you feel whole. Even when everything between us was supposed to be bad and wrong two years ago, I felt a connection to you. A . . . completeness. I\u2019m beginning to realize that I\u2019ve never given another woman a chance because they weren\u2019t you. I\u2019d built rituals around you, Del, like Tuesday tacos and Sunday afternoon movies, not because I loved the cuisine or the flicks, but because I loved\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d Del\u2019s heart pounded. She shouldn\u2019t, but she wanted to hear the words. God knew how badly she wanted the father of her son\u2014and the lover in her fantasies\u2014to care about her. \u201cYou\u2019re mixing up friendship and protectiveness with anything more lasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know shit about how I feel. But you keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better. I\u2019ll be right on your sweet ass, tackling all your misconceptions until you believe me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could get a word in, Tyler released her and swung the car into the asphalt lot, shoved the car in park, then hurtled out the door.</p><p>Del ran to catch up with him, blinking like she was seeing him for the very first time. And maybe she was. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, then backed her against the trunk of the car. \u201cYou\u2019re making me crazy. I need you. I need to know that you\u2019re safe. I need you naked now, with those pretty blue eyes all wide and dazed, your sweet thighs spread, and my name on your lips.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. Tyler made that sound way too appealing. The bottom fell out of her stomach, and she dug her fingers into him, trying to figure out how things had gotten out of hand so quickly. Before she could say a word, he propped his foot up on the bumper of the car and leaned in. No mistaking his erection, long and thick behind his zipper. Then he fisted her hair and gently pulled, positioning her lips right beneath his. He devoured her, no pleasantries. Just all possession and heat. And she melted against him with a moan.</p><p>She was probably setting herself up for heartbreak, given her skittishness since the divorce and the number of women Tyler had taken to bed. She couldn\u2019t forget the times he\u2019d said that he\u2019d rather cut off the protruding parts of his body with a dull, rusty knife than commit to one woman. What had changed about him, really? And why, when he touched her, did the craving dig in? Her brain shut down\u2014and her heart took over. Every time he touched her, Tyler made her feel like not only the most important woman but the only one in the world.</p><p>This time was no different. She wrapped her arms around his neck, knowing it wasn\u2019t smart, knowing she\u2019d probably wind up alone and hurt . . . but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care. It would be easy to tell herself that she needed a balm after Eric had made her feel dirty and used. But it was more than that. Way more. The first time Tyler had kissed her, she\u2019d felt a zing all the way to her soul. Some part of her had been overjoyed when she\u2019d learned she was pregnant because she\u2019d known she\u2019d have a part of Tyler forever.</p><p>Damn, she had it bad for him.</p><p>He angled his head to get deeper into her mouth. So hot, so single-minded. Delaney felt every nerve in her body light up in anticipation. When he cupped her breast and thumbed her nipple in the middle of the parking lot in broad daylight, she couldn\u2019t find the will to care. He was a drug to her system, and she was addicted.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get enough,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cI\u2019ll never get enough. Every time I taste you, I only want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d said a masculine drawl behind them. \u201cUnless you\u2019re trying to attract attention or you\u2019d like to get arrested for public indecency, you need to save it until I can get you a room.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she broke away from Tyler and glanced around him to see the familiar face of one the richest, most notorious, and most gossiped about playboys in Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cXander Santiago?\u201d She gasped, then turned to Tyler. \u201cThis is Logan\u2019s friend? He\u2019s your idea of laying low?\u201d At Tyler\u2019s nod, she shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>XANDER didn\u2019t try very hard to suppress a grin as he held out a hand to Del. \u201cNice to meet you. I guess you\u2019ve heard of me?\u201d</p><p>Who hadn\u2019t? Anyone who lived around here knew all about the money\u2014and the exploits\u2014of the infamous Santiago brothers. Tyler could hardly believe this was Logan\u2019s buddy from a Dallas BDSM club. Then again, if Xander was into tying up women and spanking them, he\u2019d have a more difficult time keeping a lid on that in this city, where everyone knew his face. With a private plane, the middle of the country and relative anonymity was just a few hours away.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. My name is Delaney.\u201d She shook his hand. \u201cI\u2019m an L.A. native.\u201d</p><p>The other man smiled at that, his hazel eyes sparkling with mischief under his sleek brows and two-hundred-dollar haircut. Tyler had no trouble understanding why he\u2019d had so many women all over the country willing to help him out. Besides being sinfully rich, Xander was a good-looking SOB and a natural flirt. Tyler fought the urge to punch him in his perfect face for caressing Del with his stare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gritting his teeth, he watched as Xander raised her hand to his lips. \u201cLos Angeles has some incredibly beautiful women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany of whom are taken. I\u2019m Tyler.\u201d He inserted himself between Xander and Del and sent the guy a don\u2019t-fuck-with-me glare.</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d Xander looked around his shoulder at Del and winked.</p><p>Del raised a delicate dark brow. \u201cI\u2019m also a reporter.\u201d</p> <p>In a lightning-fast move, Xander backed away from Del. His playful grin fell away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never written about you,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>\u201cKeep it that way,\u201d Xander demanded. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ve had a brief conversation with Jack about your situation. Being seen in public might be risky for you now. Carlson may be able to track your movements through security or traffic cameras. Normally, this place is monitored, but this is a small commuter airport, and I managed to arrange for a ten-minute camera . . . malfunction.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d covered the important angles. Tyler had to give him that. But after watching Eric maul Del today, he\u2019d be a lot happier not to have to fight off Xander, too.</p><p>A moment later, a pristine black limousine pulled up. A beautiful woman with pale hair in a professional twist and a skirt so short it was nearly illegal exited the vehicle and opened the back door for them. \u201cMr. Santiago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKarissa.\u201d Xander nodded as he approached and dropped a hand on her ass. \u201cNice to see you.\u201d</p><p>The driver\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but her body softened. She leaned closer. Clearly, the guy got around a lot.</p><p>Tyler grabbed Del\u2019s hand and led her inside. A moment later, he transferred their few pieces of luggage and other personal belongings into the limo and abandoned the car. He climbed in to find Xander handing Del a glass of champagne.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are we celebrating?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>Xander\u2019s mobile phone began ringing. \u201cThat you\u2019re about to disappear until you\u2019re good and ready for Carlson to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Del demanded.</p> <p>\u201cNot personally, but nothing I hear is good. I\u2019ve got my network digging.\u201d Xander pressed a button on his phone with a sigh. \u201cJavier, I\u2019ve been on the ground for less than twenty minutes. What?\u201d</p><p>Tyler did his best to zone out on Xander\u2019s conversation. He looped an arm around Del\u2019s shoulders and pulled her into him. They sank together into the buttery leather seats. The anonymity that the tinted windows provided should have made Tyler relax a little, but the need to pound something or someone was still jacking with his mood.</p><p>Fuck, he had to put a lid on it. Del didn\u2019t need more aggression now.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered to her.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cLong, tough day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you, whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Del turned and slanted those blue eyes at him, dark like an endless sea. He fought back the urge to tear off her panties, plant his head between her legs, and make her come until next week. She looked a bit like she wanted to argue about his commitment\u2014or lack thereof\u2014again, and Tyler steeled himself, tamped down his anger. Did she not understand that after the showdown with Eric and getting a sweet taste of her mouth, he was on an adrenaline high?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Xander insisted into the phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t need another liter of vodka. You need to get your head out of your ass. Christ, it\u2019s barely five o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201d He paused, listened. \u201cI know that I\u2019m your brother, not your fucking keeper. But you have to accept that. Francesca is gone, and I\u2019m sorry. But she was bad for you. You need to move on.\u201d</p> <p>The bite in the other man\u2019s tone made Tyler look up. So Mr. Perfect didn\u2019t have a perfect life after all.</p><p>Xander grimaced with concern and gripped the phone. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in an hour. Just . . . don\u2019t do anything. Promise me.\u201d He breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to L\u00e1tigo tonight. No arguments. You\u2019ll learn some self-discipline, even if I have to shove it down your throat.\u201d</p><p>L\u00e1tigo? Tyler knew enough Spanish from working for the LAPD to translate. It meant whip. Did that mean Xander intended to take his brother to a BDSM club? To train him as a Dom? He\u2019d learned enough from listening to Jack, Hunter, and Logan over the last two years to suspect so.</p><p>The call ended, and Xander pocketed his phone. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything all right with your brother?\u201d Del asked. \u201cI\u2019ve read about his wife\u2019s disappearance. Has anyone seen her since that security footage captured her in Aruba?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know as a reporter or a friend?\u201d Xander challenged.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kind person asking a question because she gives a shit,\u201d Tyler growled.</p><p>\u201cI would never betray someone trying to help me stay alive, especially for a story.\u201d Del laid a gentle hand on Xander\u2019s.</p><p>Tyler tried not to see red and rip her away, then rearrange Xander\u2019s face beyond all recognition. That response might be overkill for the situation. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cNot all of your brethren share your scruples.\u201d He sipped his champagne, then grimaced and set it aside. \u201cFrancesca was a headcase and a bitch, and Javier was too busy to rein her in, so she ran wild. He seems dead inside, and I don\u2019t know how to save him. But that\u2019s my problem. You have enough of your own.\u201d</p><p>Xander pasted on a stiff smile, and an uncomfortable silence filled the car as the limo driver headed east on I-10.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Tyler asked. He realized that he didn\u2019t sound terribly friendly, but he was having a hard time reversing that. The day had been awful. His mood was worse, and he needed to have Del all to himself, even if he did nothing more than cuddle her and reassure himself that she was safe and okay.</p><p>\u201cI recently purchased a little place for some privacy. It\u2019s got nice views of the city. The deed is in a corporation\u2019s name. It keeps the press away.\u201d Xander leveled a stare at Del. \u201cSo even if anyone manages to connect you two to me, no one will be able to guess that you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Again, he had all the angles covered. Tyler had to respect that.</p><p>Xander withdrew his phone again, dialed a number, and in less than three minutes, made the security cameras at the facility disappear for the next two days. Tyler wished he could pull that trick out of his bag. Money talked, and he supposed that since Xander\u2019s bank account equaled a small nation\u2019s GDP, he could probably shout with a bullhorn all day long.</p><p>Through the ever-heavy L.A. traffic, they wended their way up the 405 freeway, then disappeared into the very high-rent district, up in the hills. It wasn\u2019t long before a big wrought-iron gate opened. Lush bushes and flowers, along with well-placed trees, obscured whatever building lay beyond. Tyler had a feeling from the swank of the address alone and the size of the houses that this place would be anything but little.</p><p>The limo surged up the private driveway until a huge building came into view. The place was purely old Hollywood with a modern twist. A golden-hued stucco design with high arches, graceful porticos, and a shitload of windows. Palm trees, a lawn manicured within an inch of its life, and a natural stone fountain in the middle of the circular drive all screamed wealth. Del shrank back against him, looking a bit daunted. Hell, he\u2019d grown up in a rusted trailer with a sagging floor and a single mother who chain smoked. What was he doing here?</p><p>Keeping Delaney safe. Tyler tightened his arm around her.</p><p>Xander tossed him a key. Tyler caught it in his fist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old hotel that\u2019s been converted into eight units. You\u2019re in the penthouse. I\u2019ve got to go deal with my brother,\u201d the other man said, clearly not looking forward to it. \u201cMake yourselves at home. I\u2019ll check in with you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Del said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get out of your hair quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need. I don\u2019t keep much of a staff here, just a part-time maid. She can cook in a pinch. I\u2019ll bunk with my brother. He probably needs the company. And if he gets on my nerves too much, the family house has sixteen bedrooms. I\u2019m sure I can find one to suit me.\u201d Xander smiled faintly.</p><p>\u201cI hope all goes well with Javier. Maybe a pep talk will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a pep talk. He needs an intervention, and I\u2019ll have to find at least one other person on this planet who doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a ruthless cutthroat and actually gives a shit if he lives before I can stage one.\u201d Xander sighed. \u201cStay safe. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d Tyler shook Xander\u2019s hand, but only because he hadn\u2019t tried too hard to seduce Del.</p><p>The driver opened the back door, and before Tyler could climb out, the woman had removed their bags from the trunk. Key in hand, Tyler hauled them inside, Del in tow. The limo, with Xander inside, pulled away.</p><p>Tyler paced during the slow, silent elevator ride to the top of the eight-story building. It was either that or rip Del\u2019s clothes off and impale her on his wretchedly hard cock. The thought just made him harder. Damn it, she didn\u2019t need to be attacked twice today.</p><p>Fresh off the elevator, he approached a wall covered in natural stone. He dragged their luggage across the floor lined with rich, dark hardwoods, then inserted the key into the lone door. A moment later, the latch gave way, and he pushed inside.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s jaw dropped. The hardwood floor extended into the unit, but the rest of the room was a stark, modern white\u2014the walls, the plush sofas, the cushy throw rug. A pewter side table, a dark wicker ottoman, a brushed silver statute of a half-naked woman, her head thrown back in passion, filled the space. Yeah, there was a flat screen TV nearly as big as the wall itself, and in the distance, he saw a dining room and a kitchen, but the main attraction in this room was the nearly solid wall of windows that overlooked the city. The views were sick and went on forever. The place had to have cost millions.</p><p>Outside the French doors, a shaded terrace lined the back of the house. A mission-style table with chunky chairs and a built-in outdoor kitchen made the perfect place to enjoy the infinity edge pool. Wow, must be nice to finish laps and look out over the Wilshire District, see the city at work and play. It sure beat the hell out of the crappy apartment he\u2019d had when he\u2019d lived here.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Del breathed behind him. \u201cIs it wrong that I want to swim in that pool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hell, if she was getting in the water, Tyler wanted to get in with her\u2014and do a whole lot more than swim.</p><p>Damn it, he had to stop thinking about sex. It wasn\u2019t going to happen tonight. She needed some time, and he needed to get that through his thick skull.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll swim tonight, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a bathing suit.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Tyler got even harder. If his T-shirt wasn\u2019t covering that up, it\u2019d be fucking obvious for sure.</p><p>\u201cAnother reason to wait until dark. Cuts down on the possibility of any sort of aerial surveillance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think of that.\u201d She looked shaken. \u201cI should focus on the case, anyway. I need to spend some time jotting down all the details I can remember so I can go back to some of my key informants and interview them again.\u201d</p><p>Bright, driven, dedicated\u2014everything about Del just made Tyler want her more. \u201cAre you up for that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI have to be.\u201d</p><p>Good point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he murmured and took the luggage down the unit\u2019s main hallway.</p><p>After a quick glance through the rest of the rooms, Tyler found one guest bed and bathroom, a fully stocked home gym, a home office, and a locked door on one side of the hall. On the other, a master suite, complete with the most opulent bathroom he\u2019d ever seen and more endless city views. He set their luggage in the room. She might want to sleep alone, but that wasn\u2019t happening. He\u2019d do his damndest not to touch her until she was no longer shaken by Eric\u2019s rough treatment, but he wasn\u2019t leaving her in another room without protection.</p><p>Ambling back down the hall, he found Del standing in front of the windows, her arms wrapped around her like she was cold. She stared out into the afternoon, her profile looking pensive.</p><p>Tyler walked up behind her, wanting so badly to touch her, wishing her shirt would melt away with his touch and leave nothing behind but her beautiful bare skin. He dug his fingers into his thighs. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I peeked in the kitchen. I don\u2019t see the maid, but the fridge is stocked, if you are.\u201d</p><p>He was, but it could wait. \u201cYou look dead on your feet. I know the case is important, but why don\u2019t you lie down for a few minutes? Rest. There\u2019s a huge bed and blackout drapes. I\u2019m sure the thread count on the sheets is probably north of a million.\u201d</p><p>A little smile lifted the corners of her lips. Fuck, he wanted to kiss her again. No, that wasn\u2019t it. He wanted to possess that mouth. Own it. Have the right to take it in whatever way and at any time he wanted. He blew out a breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This whole \u201csex for the duration\u201d thing wasn\u2019t going to work. Tyler saw no scenario in which he walked away from Del at the end of all this and left her alone to raise their son. His mother might have believed deep in her bones that he was the kind of man to abandon his family, like his own father. But he didn\u2019t want to be that same scumbag. And he didn\u2019t want to let Del go, leave her free to fall in love with another man who would put a ring on her finger and plant more children in her womb.</p><p>Oh fuck, even the thought of it made him violent. Not that he\u2019d been far away from that feeling since leaving Eric\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Bleed off some of his pent-up energy and frustration. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go pound the treadmill and the weight machine down the hall.\u201d</p><p>Del turned to him, wearing a little probing frown that made him feel like she was trying to crawl into his head. \u201cWould you hold me, Tyler?\u201d</p><p>His entire body tensed at her suggestion. Of course. The problem was, would he stop there? Somehow, he had to find the fucking will.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He wrapped an arm around her waist, filtering his other hand into her hair, as he held her in what he hoped was a gesture of comfort\u2014and kept enough distance between her body and his pike-hard dick.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your wrist?\u201d</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t thought about it since they\u2019d left Eric\u2019s. He lifted his arm and glanced. The blood had dried. It would leave a nasty scab and a shitty scar for a while, but he\u2019d deal. \u201cI\u2019ll wash it up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were worried about me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t know what the motherfucker was going to do to you. He\u2019s not the same guy I was partners with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric came on strong and acted like a total ass. I\u2014 It surprised me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt all seemed so surreal. I never imagined that the man I married would actually hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? He strapped me to the refrigerator and made me watch him paw you. I wanted to kill the son of a bitch. I still might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . I kicked him in the balls, and it was like shutting down his penis turned on his conscience. Or like the pain finally pierced through his anger. I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either, angel. I\u2019m just glad you fought back, and that he didn\u2019t do more.\u201d And all this talk wasn\u2019t going to help her forget. He opened his arms to her. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Del burrowed closer to him, nestling right against his erection. She froze. He closed his eyes. Busted.</p><p>\u201cYour entire body is . . . tense.\u201d</p><p>Tyler tried to take a deep breath and relax. The last thing he needed to do was scare her. She\u2019d had enough of that today.</p><p>But the tension wouldn\u2019t ease. Tucked in the corner, he saw a sleek, marbled wet bar. A new bottle of C\u00eeroc vodka sat on the counter. His name was all over that. Tonight, after she\u2019d gone to bed . . . Yeah, that was his. A five-mile run on the treadmill, a quick session or two with his hand wrapped around his dick, and that bottle might bring him down enough so that he didn\u2019t pounce on Del the second she got supine. At least he hoped so.</p><p>TYLER backed away from her, and Del frowned. He was so tense, he was pinging. Jumpy. Hard everywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhere can I settle you before I hit the treadmill?\u201d</p><p>She started to tell him not to bother before she realized what Tyler was saying without saying it. He\u2019d been tense since the encounter with Eric. He was buzzing with leftover adrenaline. After a lot of action on the job, Eric had often wanted to run, fight . . . or fuck.</p><p>Swallowing, she stared. That was it. He needed to release this tension, and he was willing to put that aside and take his aggression out on the home gym, rather than risk upsetting her. Something inside her melted.</p> <p>Yes, she had to resume work on this case today, but Tyler needed her right now. After the way he\u2019d turned himself inside out to help her since she\u2019d shown up on his doorstep, she wanted to give to him in return. And she wanted to replace the ugly memory of Eric\u2019s pawing with Tyler\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cHow about the bed?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>She saw a muscle in his jaw tic, but he nodded, then gestured her down the hallway. Del walked slowly, aware of his hot gaze all over her backside. Purposely, she swayed her hips as she made her way into the master bedroom. Maybe she should be more afraid of being near a man as keyed up as Tyler after Eric\u2019s crap earlier today, but she knew Tyler would cut off his arm before hurting her.</p><p>A huge king-sized bed dominated the space, done up in cream and chocolate, with a floor-to-ceiling studded, padded headboard towering over the bed. Two sleek nightstands flanked the bed, their modern lines almost stark, but the warm tone of the wood saved the room from being sterile.</p><p>In the corner, a big barrel-backed chair in a welcoming gold tone rested, framed by more warm wood. Del turned away from Tyler, peeled off her T-shirt, and draped it over the back. A quick flick of her hand later, and her bra dropped to the ground.</p><p>Behind her, Tyler sucked in a breath.</p><p>God, the tension in the air between them was thick and buzzing. It flew across her skin, hovering, leaving tingles dancing all over her body. Her blood sang. Already, her panties were embarrassingly damp.</p><p>Tyler did this to her every time. Made her feel desired, womanly. Whole and perfect.</p><p>She reached for the snap of her jeans. Suddenly, he was behind her, grabbing her wrists in a grip just shy of painful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Del looked at him over her shoulder. His face was taut, mouth compressed. A vein bulged in his temple. He crowded her personal space, and no way she could miss that erection against the curve of her ass.</p><p>She locked gazes with him, looking him right in the eyes. \u201cCome to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. His grip tightened a fraction. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re inviting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a ledge. You need to come down. Let me give you what you need.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, he released her and turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea, and I don\u2019t want a pity fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t pity you, Tyler. I desire you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and stared out over the city, resolutely not looking at her. \u201cDon\u2019t think that spreading your legs for me is some sort of Band-Aid for my foul mood. I want you, too, but not like this. Not after what Eric put you through. Let me bleed off this frustration some other way.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply, just doffed her jeans and panties.</p><p>Del doubted Tyler could fail to hear the rustle of her clothes. His stance squared, his ramrod spine straightened further. Even with his feet slightly spread apart, nothing about the way he stood looked casual. He was keeping himself together with a teeny thread of self-control. She wanted all that passion unraveled and directed at her. She wanted to ease him, be what he needed. Now wasn\u2019t the time to examine why. If she did, it would probably scare the hell out of her. For now, it was enough just to be here for him.</p><p>On quiet feet, Del made her way across the rich Berber carpet. She grabbed a handful of Tyler\u2019s T-shirt and pulled slightly, revealing that place where the cords of his neck smoothed, then flared again into the bulge of his shoulder. She put her lips there. He tensed even more beneath her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He clenched his fists. \u201cAfter what Eric put you through, you deserve tenderness. I can\u2019t be gentle right now.\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his ear and pressed her breasts against his back. \u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Del!\u201d Tyler turned, backed away. \u201cI\u2019m telling you flat out that . . .\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off as his gaze trekked all over her body before settling between her legs. He swallowed hard, then met his stare. The look he drilled her with was so hungry, her pussy tightened. Need throbbed.</p><p>She pressed a hand into her fluttering stomach, then eased it down, down, until she settled her fingertips over her clit and rubbed in slow, soft circles. Tyler\u2019s gaze latched on, unblinking, transfixed. Burning.</p><p>For once, Del felt not just sexy but powerful. She had no doubt this man wanted her badly. Sex with Eric had been erratic and often somewhat meh. Most times, when she\u2019d instigated, he\u2019d blown her off with something between dismissal and annoyance. Not so with Tyler. She was getting to him. And when he unleashed his dark side . . . The thought made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Tyler.\u201d She closed her eyes and tossed her head back, slowly driving herself insane with a teasing touch.</p><p>He ate it up with his stare. Del could feel his gaze fused to hers. She dared a peek at him. His fists were clenched, his breathing ragged. He looked ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Tyler bellowed as he took a ground-eating step toward her. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her hand away from her clit. \u201cIf I hurt you, you goddamn tell me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cSay it out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Del didn\u2019t get a chance to say more before Tyler shoved her wet fingers into his mouth. He licked, groaned\u2014and it broke open everything he\u2019d been holding inside.</p><p>He lifted her and lunged to the nearest wall, shoving her against it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to have your pussy, Del. It\u2019s mine. To taste, to fondle. To fuck. Mine.\u201d</p><p>Those green eyes of his drilled into her, and her heartbeat tripped, then picked up speed. Her nipples beaded. He seemed to be waiting for some response, so she nodded. In an hour, she\u2019d be her own person again, and he\u2019d back off. But now, she\u2019d be what he needed.</p><p>Primal satisfaction crossed his face. His nostrils flared. Then he reached down and wrapped an arm around each of her thighs and lifted her up, back sliding against the wall.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled in answer.</p><p>The next thing Del knew, he\u2019d hoisted her thighs over his shoulders, wedging her back high against the wall. He aligned her pussy with his mouth. His intentions became crystal clear.</p><p>In this position, she had no leverage, no way to move. No control.</p><p>\u201cTyler.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he swooped forward and latched onto her wet flesh, his tongue unerringly flicking her clit. Del gasped. Sensation wound through her instantly, hot, drugging. She felt so alive and aware. He gripped her so tightly, she wondered if she\u2019d bruise. The two days\u2019 growth of whiskers on his cheeks abraded her inner thighs with every plunge of his tongue. His breath on her folds was hot, rough as he latched onto her, totally unrelenting, and ate her like a ripe fruit, nipping at the flesh before licking up the drops of nectar that flowed freely.</p><p>Her orgasm built so quickly. He hadn\u2019t kissed her, hadn\u2019t touched her anywhere else. Before this, she would never have believed that she could be this aroused this quickly without more seduction. But the absolute insistence in Tyler\u2019s demand ramped her up. Her thoughts clouded over as more pleasure rushed in. She gasped, flattened her hands against the wall, and let it happen.</p><p>When he speared his tongue inside her, Del couldn\u2019t help but clamp down on him.</p><p>\u201cCome for me.\u201d He laved her clit, then shoved his tongue deep again.</p><p>The disparity of sensations, the stimulation of so many nerves nearly at once, sent her spiraling closer to release.</p><p>She wailed as everything built. Her legs stiffened, her breathing grew erratic, and under it all, she was weeping, dying. This orgasm was going to roll over her, harsh and insistent, and leave her shaken to her core. But Tyler wanted it now. Demanded it. Del was helpless to do anything but give it to him.</p><p>The tension rose, tightened. Everything between her legs throbbed with need. Then Tyler nipped at her clit and sucked it into his mouth again mercilessly. She let go with a scream.</p><p>Waves of pleasure crashed over her like lightning, fierce and mind robbing. Del\u2019s cries echoed through the big penthouse, filling her ears in an endless stream of desire that left her panting and spent.</p><p>Tyler wasn\u2019t about to slow down. Her orgasm didn\u2019t pacify him at all. If anything, it revved him up more, and he ate at her with even more hunger.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I can\u2019t. Oh God.\u201d Her womb continued to pulse with every flick and caress of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Everything about him told Del that he intended to prove her wrong.</p><p>\u201cToo much. Too fast,\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he growled. \u201cTell me to go the fuck away or take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d She\u2019d die if he left her now.</p><p>Without hesitation, Tyler lapped at her again and again, and his unrelenting attention to her clit became a pleasure so sharp, it was almost pain. She balanced on the edge, whimpering. Del reached out for something to claw, but he\u2019d positioned her so that she was powerless to move or do nothing except allow his head between her legs, his tongue on her aching flesh. She could only feel. God, no way she could avoid that.</p><p>The sensations he forced on her grew, multiplied. They ratcheted up higher than anything she\u2019d ever imagined, much less felt. Every breath, every lick of his tongue, every scrape of his teeth magnified inside her. And still she hurtled toward ecstasy with no end in sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let loose a keening cry. \u201cTyler!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Del.\u201d Primal satisfaction rang in his tone. \u201cYou\u2019ve swelled so sweetly. Like eating a ripe fucking peach. Feed me more. Come again.\u201d</p><p>Her body stiffened, jerked. She slapped the wall behind her, flailing helplessly as the pleasure rolled over and over her. It coiled inside her so tightly, her stomach cramped. She whimpered again. But there was no way she could resist his command.</p><p>The orgasm didn\u2019t just seize Del; it flattened her. Devastating. Destructive. The breath left her body. Her heart roared, stopped, then started beating hard and deep. And the pleasure of it, dear God . . . She gasped, then screamed until her voice gave out. And still she cried out silently, nails clawing the wall. The ecstasy gripped her ruthlessly, shaking her body, stunning her.</p> <p>Finally, the pulses slowed, giving her a moment to catch her breath. Thoughts gradually returned. Del felt exhausted, heavy and boneless.</p><p>Tyler trembled as he shrugged her legs off his shoulders and set her on her feet. She didn\u2019t have to worry about supporting herself, though. He pressed her against the wall and grabbed her face in his hands, locking her stare onto his.</p><p>The need she saw screaming there made her heart jump and something that felt too much like desire pulse behind her clit again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother begging for mercy. He wouldn\u2019t have any, and she\u2019d invited him to do his worst. Right now, that\u2019s exactly what she wanted.</p><p>He tangled his fingers into the hair framing her face, then slanted his mouth over hers, taking complete possession, tongue plunging deep. She tasted herself on his lips, along with his frantic desire. With their lips fused together, he inhaled sharply, as if he could breathe her in, while he gripped her tighter. Her nipples chafed against his T-shirt, and she felt drunk on the euphoria of two massive orgasms and the promise of more.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around him and clung. Tyler took and took, devouring her, grabbing her ass, and pulling her tightly to him. He pumped his cock right against her mound, rhythmic and hard. Instantly, Del felt empty. Her sex clenched with the craving to be full of him.</p><p>She dug her fingers into his shoulders, tiny whimpers of need escaping her as she raised her legs around his waist and ground against that monster erection of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice sounded rough, like someone had ripped out his voice box, ran it through a blender, then shoved it back in.</p><p>\u201cF-for what?\u201d</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t answer. He merely tore her limbs away from him, grabbed her by the hips, and turned her around. Before Del knew what was happening, Tyler jerked her to the bed and bent her over the mattress. She heard the rasp of his zipper, the rustle of denim, the rip of foil. He shoved his fingers into her hair, fisting at her nape, and lifted her head. No way Del could miss his hard cock sliding between her thighs as he leaned over her. \u201cLast chance. Do you want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p> <p>\u201cN-NO.\u201d Delaney couldn\u2019t keep her voice from shaking. \u201cI want you. Inside me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nipped at her earlobe, then shoved her hair out of his way and pressed kisses up her neck. \u201cEven a please. So fucking sexy.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure evident in his voice suffused her with longing and a strange sense of pride. He wanted her. Yes, he\u2019d had sex with a lot of women, but everything about his behavior told Del that the intensity of his want was totally new even to him. Until now, he\u2019d always loved \u2019em and left \u2019em. Yet he\u2019d told her over and over that he\u2019d be by her side. She doubted that he\u2019d ever said that to a woman before.</p><p>Del didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d gone so far out of his way to help her. Maybe he had more feelings for her than she\u2019d imagined. God, she feared that she wasn\u2019t just falling in love with Tyler again, but plummeting. She didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d bottom out and find stable ground.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Del wriggled her hips back at him, and he hissed in a breath. His fist tightened in her hair.</p><p>\u201cTake me, angel. Every fucking inch I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s all for you.\u201d</p><p>He positioned himself at her weeping entrance and pushed in, a steady, forward drive that made her flesh burn as she rapidly stretched to accommodate his thick cock. He bumped against her narrow walls, stopped. Del tried to relax and let him in, but he felt huge. He was barely inside her, but the fire and yearning to have him fill her made her whole body tighten in anticipation. Nothing felt like taking Tyler deep.</p> <p>\u201cAngel, let me in. Fuck.\u201d His palm trailed fire down one of her hips. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Del took a deep breath and tried to focus on relaxing and releasing her muscles to open herself up for him. Tyler pressed in again, this time sliding smoothly into her farther, deeper, faster, until his hips rested against her ass and he filled her completely.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. That\u2019s it. Like a hot knife through butter.\u201d He tightened his grip on her and groaned. \u201cAll wet and all mine. Aren\u2019t you? Tell me you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>His demand made Del clench down on his cock. But it also went straight to her heart. She nodded and whimpered.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSay it for me now, and I\u2019ll make you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>The admission he sought to extract was a just a mirage, but the fantasy of having Tyler all to herself, of him wanting her to be exclusively his, was too sweet to resist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, angel,\u201d he breathed in her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve ached for you all day. I\u2019m dying to see you come again, this time on my cock.\u201d</p><p>The burn of his desire turned her on. She wondered if he\u2019d ever been this intent or possessive before. What they shared was supposed to be just sex, but it felt far deeper. His every touch and word seemed designed to bind them together. But she knew he might not be truly ready to jump in and be a full-time husband or father. She might never be ready for the commitment thing again. So she\u2019d accept some money from him for Seth\u2019s college fund someday. And she\u2019d take this irresistible desire now.</p><p>When he withdrew, Del held her breath. She wasn\u2019t disappointed. He thrust in again with slow, ruthless power, awakening every nerve ending of her slick sex. She whimpered, clutching the covers in her fists. God, he\u2019d barely gotten inside her, and the burning urge for climax was already disintegrating her. No other man had absolutely mastered her body the way Tyler had.</p><p>\u201cI need more!\u201d she panted.</p><p>\u201cIn good time, angel. I\u2019m not racing through this. No way. I\u2019m here to stay, and I\u2019m going to wring every drop of pleasure from you. I\u2019m going to pound you until you scream again and again. After I\u2019ve come, I\u2019m only going to want to do it all once more.\u201d</p><p>Conviction rang in his tone. He exuded something so primal and male as he demanded total surrender from her. Beneath him, Del trembled and shuddered.</p><p>He withdrew almost completely from her body again before driving deep once more. His thrusts were controlled but remorseless. Then his fingers cupped her mound possessively, honing in on her clit. She gasped.</p><p>\u201cPerfect, angel. You\u2019re all tight and wet around me. I\u2019m never giving this up, you know that? I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get inside this pussy every day and give you so much pleasure you\u2019ll never think about walking away from me again.\u201d</p><p>God, when he said things like that, Del wondered how she\u2019d ever work up the will to let him go. She should probably write off his words. They were spoken in passion, after all. But the woman inside her who yearned for him wanted to lap those words up greedily.</p><p>As his fingers swept over her sensitive clit once more, Del melted. If he kept touching her like this, how the hell would she ever disentangle herself from Tyler once the danger had passed? Having not just someone to lean on these last few days but a man she genuinely trusted had been nothing short of a godsend. He\u2019d taken so much off her shoulders and put them onto his own, for no other reason than to keep her safe and make her feel protected. How could she not appreciate that? Not fall for that?</p><p>But what would happen once they returned to real life? She\u2019d still be a mom and busy reporter in Los Angeles. He\u2019d still be doing who knew what in Lafayette . . . and probably nailing a bevy of easy women. They\u2019d never work, no matter how tantalizing the fantasy.</p><p>Tyler caressed his way up her body until his hands cupped her breasts, fingers toying with her nipples. He leaned over her, as if he wanted to join not just bodies, but skin, breaths, souls. Del closed her eyes.</p><p>In and out, he moved with ruthless control\u2014and maximum devastation. Every stroke into her body awakened more nerves, and the ramp-up to orgasm began to overtake her body, shut down her thoughts.</p><p>He thumbed her nipples, and they beaded for him. She felt the blood rush through her body like a heady cocktail. And just like if she were drunk, the sensations overloaded her. Nothing mattered in this moment but Tyler and connecting with him.</p><p>\u201cI feel you everywhere,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cGod . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, angel.\u201d He kissed his way up her shoulders, to her neck. \u201cI feel you, too. Every fucking perfect bit of you surrounding me. Are you going to come for me again?\u201d</p><p>With anyone else, that would have been practically impossible. With Tyler, it was inevitable. It was like her body was hardwired to his, like he knew all the right buttons to push. Like every touch between them was magic.</p><p>No sense in teasing him or drawing this out. He had to feel the way her sex clamped down on him. Her breathing turned erratic again. She reached behind her and clutched at his thigh.</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t know how, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re good together, angel. Always have been.\u201d He brushed rough palms down her body again, then settled his fingers over her clit once more. \u201cGive me everything. I need it.\u201d</p><p>No way could she deny him. The pleasure surged and grew, seizing and spiraling. She couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t stop herself from letting go.</p><p>Del didn\u2019t just come undone in his arms, she shattered. And Tyler was there to catch her, holding her together with his embrace and his growled encouragements.</p><p>\u201cSo good, angel. Oh, fuck yes. That\u2019s it. No one feels like you.\u201d</p><p>Every emotion inside her poured out, spilled over onto him. She grabbed his arm, held it to her chest like she never wanted to let go, and rode out the wave of her pleasure.</p><p>When it was over, she felt raw and hollow and frighteningly exposed. Del could almost feel her heart reaching out, trying to attach itself to his. She took a deep breath and reminded herself that her feelings were hers and hers alone. Regardless of what he said\u2014or even believed at the moment\u2014Tyler had never been built for forever. He\u2019d changed, no denying that. But how could he become the sort of man who suddenly practiced fidelity in a handful of days?</p><p>God, she had to protect herself. She had to find some way to keep from falling in love so deeply that once this was over and they parted ways, she wouldn\u2019t be a flattened, crushed shell.</p><p>She wriggled away and made it across the bed, turning over to plaster on what she prayed looked like a cheery smile. And Del hoped like hell he couldn\u2019t see that, inside, her heart was on the verge of breaking.</p><p>THE uninhibited bliss of Del\u2019s climax slid over Tyler\u2019s senses, and he clenched every muscle in his body to keep himself from following her over. The urge to join her in ecstasy was so strong, but he wasn\u2019t done with her, not even close. He wanted to spend half the night inside of her\u2014at least.</p><p>But the second her orgasm swept past, Del moved away from him. Not just physically\u2014across the bed wasn\u2019t that far\u2014but her guarded eyes, her body language, the way she crossed her arms over her chest and curled her legs in front of her, hiding that sweet pussy from him\u2014it all had him gritting his teeth. And if that smile was any more plastic, the folks at Tupperware would pull her aside for a chat.</p><p>Distance. Tyler recognized what she was trying to put between them immediately. He\u2019d played this game with countless other women once they\u2019d bored him. He knew how to read the signals. She\u2019d probably be willing to do whatever it took to get him to come quickly\u2014then she\u2019d end all intimacy between them and try to act like this didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>Bullshit.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Del frowned, a furrow appearing between her dark brows. \u201cI\u2019m right here, silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack where you were, angel. Right in front of me, bent over to give me that pretty pussy and ass. Where you can\u2019t hide from me.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not hiding.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow at her. She was a terrible fucking liar. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind coming back here and giving yourself to me again.\u201d</p><p>Del glanced at his dead-serious face, the hard rise and fall of his chest as he took deep breaths and struggled for calm, then down to the hard stalk of his cock that stood tall and thick and beyond ready. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Patiently, he sat back and watched her decide. Finally, she crawled back across the bed to him, then stopped without turning around. \u201cDo you want me on my back?\u201d</p><p>Tempting, but . . . \u201cNo.\u201d He wanted her absolutely vulnerable, where she couldn\u2019t see what he was doing but would have to simply trust him.</p><p>She bit her lip. Tyler saw her tension rise. He made her nervous. She had good reason to be. A faint smile fell across his mouth. He wasn\u2019t playing her bullshit game. He planned to get closer than ever and make her feel him in a way she never had. So she\u2019d never again doubt that he meant to have all of her, now and always.</p><p>Still, she hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m, um, sore.\u201d</p><p>Stunning that she\u2019d lie simply to put distance between them. Definitely, he had to fucking address that now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Turn around, Del.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cCan\u2019t we take a shower? It will ease my muscles, and I can, um, suck you.\u201d</p><p>Nice offer, but far more impersonal than what he had in mind. \u201cEither come back here, in the position I\u2019ve indicated, or tell me what the hell is really bothering you. Because I haven\u2019t fucked you enough to be sore. When I have, you\u2019ll feel it.\u201d</p><p>Del hesitated, debated, then took a breath to steel herself. Then she turned around, bent over, with her ass exposed and her pussy looking all swollen, wet, and vulnerable.</p><p>Knowing a bit about Xander, Tyler suspected he\u2019d find exactly what he needed in the nightstand drawer. Silently, he padded over and opened it. Bingo! Grabbing it quickly, he stood behind Del again. She looked over her shoulder at him with vulnerable blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, angel.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, and the look was gone. \u201cNothing to say.\u201d</p><p>More crap. There was plenty left unsaid, and if she didn\u2019t want talk now, they\u2019d get to it soon.</p><p>In the meantime . . . Tyler unscrewed the cap on the tube in his hand and squeezed out a healthy dose of lube, realizing this could backfire on him in a major way. They hadn\u2019t discussed anal sex, and she had no experience with it. But he had more than enough to know that no act was more intimate. She\u2019d be allowing him where no other man had been. And she\u2019d feel every inch of him inside her, all through her. She wouldn\u2019t know how to counter the pleasure or put up barriers between them. He\u2019d strip away all this fronting and get strictly to him and her and whatever she was trying to hide.</p><p>He slathered the lube on his cock with one hand, then grabbed her hair in his fist with the other. \u201cI told you we were going to do things my way. I want this. I want to give this to you. I want you to feel it because I intend to make sure this is unlike any experience you\u2019ve ever had. And when it\u2019s over, we\u2019re going to talk, and you\u2019re going to tell me whatever is in that head of yours that you\u2019re hiding from me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could deny it again, he rubbed the rest of the lube on his fingers across the untried rosette of her ass.</p><p>Finally understanding, Del gasped. \u201cTyler, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t yet,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBut you will. Because you can, and there\u2019s no reason to hold back from me, angel. I\u2019m going to make it so good for you.\u201d</p><p>To bring his point home, he pressed one finger into her back entrance. She gasped. Her hips wriggled. Trying to seat him deeper or dislodge him? He wasn\u2019t sure, but the result was that his entire finger slid all the way into her hot depths.</p><p>Fuck, she felt beyond hot and tight. He wasn\u2019t going to last long once he got his cock in there, but it was going to be one sweet ride. Nothing ever felt like Del, and knowing that he was the first\u2014and the last\u2014man to take her this intimately was going to blow the top of his head off.</p><p>He withdrew for a moment, then pressed two fingers inside her ass. Del didn\u2019t gasp this time. She moaned, a little involuntary animal sound of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to feel even better when it\u2019s my cock back here, angel. You think you feel every touch now? Just wait. I\u2019m going to fuck you so deep and slow, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be able to deny the pleasure. You\u2019ll absolutely feel every inch of me, totally joined with you.\u201d</p><p>And he was going to use every weapon he had to get under her defenses, strip her bare, and overcome her objections. As far as he was concerned, he\u2019d tear down a cement wall with his bare hands to get to her. Whatever emotional barriers she was trying to erect now should be no match for his determination.</p> <p>Slowly, he slid his hand out of her hair, caressing his way down her spine, circling her waist, before he slid over her belly, then between her thighs to rub her tender, swollen flesh. She might be slightly sore, but more than anything, she was needy. Her cunt wept, and when he put his fingers over her clit, her body leapt to life, bucking. She tossed her head back, and the spill of her dark hair across her skin, almost to her ass, turned him on even more. Everything about this woman\u2014her intelligence and determination, the way she loved his son unconditionally, the fact that she represented home for him\u2014all made her downright perfect.</p><p>With his right hand, he lined his cock up with her little rosette and gently pushed in until his head began to breach her tissue.</p><p>\u201cTyler.\u201d Her body went taut, and she was already clawing the sheets.</p><p>It was nerves, not pain. He hadn\u2019t tried to push past the tight ring of her muscle. Yet.</p><p>\u201cRelax, angel. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She was panting. \u201cYou\u2019re big. And you\u2019re going to get too deep.\u201d</p><p>Tyler heard the fear in her voice, and he caressed her hip, trying to gentle her. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to get deep. Very deep. But there\u2019s no such thing as too deep, angel.\u201d He pressed his hand into the small of her back. \u201cArch for me.\u201d</p><p>She succumbed to his demand, and he focused on his cock sinking into her body. He parted the cheeks of her ass with his fingers and watched her body slowly accept him.</p><p>Finally, the thick ridge of his flesh encountered the barrier of her tight muscles. Tyler pressed his thumbs across her tense lower back, then caressed her hips again. \u201cRelax. Just take a deep breath and push out.\u201d</p><p>To entice her, he brushed his fingertips across her clit again. She gasped instantly and arched a bit more. The action opened her up just enough that the head of his cock slipped past that tight ring. After a little scream of panic, she gasped long and low. Fuck, she was like a burning vise, pressing in from all sides with a heat he\u2019d never known.</p><p>Forcing himself to move slowly, he penetrated her, sliding down, down, down into the tightest recesses of her body. Beneath him, her head thrashed, and she clawed at the sheets.</p><p>\u201cHurt, angel?\u201d He paused immediately and waited, swirling a little friction against her clit to keep her pleasure high.</p><p>\u201cYes. No. More. God, more!\u201d</p><p>A feral smile stretched across his face, and he finished burrowing his cock in her backside. A giant rush of air filled her lungs. Her body tensed as she screeched out in a sound of pleasure unlike anything he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, angel. I\u2019m in. All the way in. Now it\u2019s just going to feel good.\u201d</p><p>She nodded frantically. \u201cNow! Please. More. Everything.\u201d</p><p>Del was completely with him, thinking only about the pleasure coursing through her body, not about protecting her heart. He wasn\u2019t about to risk hurting her, so he couldn\u2019t fuck her too hard, but he\u2019d definitely give her something to scream about.</p><p>Tyler picked up the pace a bit, experimentally withdrawing and plunging into her. Tight. Silken. Perfect. And all his. He draped his body over her back. The sheen of perspiration across her skin merged with the sweat beginning to dampen his. This wasn\u2019t going to be a simple, gentle ride. The more she felt, the more she\u2019d fight. The more he\u2019d have to hold on. And he was determined to do exactly that.</p><p>He circled her clit with his fingers again and settled his chin in the crook of her neck so he could whisper in her ear, \u201cAngel, I\u2019m going to stay right here, keep after you so deep and hard until you come for me like you never have. You\u2019re going to take me here, just like this, until you let go for me.\u201d</p><p>Her panting grew rougher.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes!\u201d she screamed as he put a bit more force behind his thrust.</p><p>Jesus, the pleasure staggered him. Lightning shot down his spine. Electricity gathered in his balls. Inside, a perfect storm of need, possessiveness, and love brewed. He wanted to claim her, mark her, leave her\u2014and every other man on the planet\u2014absolutely no doubt who she belonged to.</p><p>He worked his fingers a bit faster over her clit. Del responded, thrusting her body back at him, taking his cock even deeper in her ass. God, he couldn\u2019t stand it. He absolutely needed more of her, needed her against him.</p><p>Tyler stood tall, lifting her torso upright until her back rested against his chest. Her nipples stabbed the air, and he trailed a hand up to them, pinching one, then the other. Instead of trying to get away, she reached behind her and clasped her hands around his head, sinking her fingers into his hair.</p><p>With a last brush against her nipples, he latched onto her hip and drove into her even faster, even deeper. \u201cTake me. Every bit. All the way inside, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gyrated back on him, and the slap of their flesh together was frantic, intimate. \u201cI need more.\u201d</p><p>He pumped inside her in a measured, relentless pace and watched her skin flush, her muscles begin to tense and quiver. Her breathing grew erratic. Another brush of his fingers over her nipples told him they were harder than he\u2019d ever felt. Her pussy was so swollen and dripping.</p><p>As much as he wanted to just lose himself in the pleasure, now was the time to press his advantage.</p><p>\u201cJust when you think we\u2019re done here, I\u2019m going to fuck you again. And again. Until you admit that we\u2019re good together and beg me to never stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. God, yes.\u201d She turned her head to press frantic kisses across his jaw.</p><p>\u201cNot just sexually,\u201d he growled. \u201cWe\u2019re good, period. We\u2019ve got something, and it\u2019s more than lust, angel. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Del thrust back on him again. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t talk. I just need . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need it? Or you need me?\u201d</p><p>She nipped at his neck, then pinched her own nipples. The sight nearly undid Tyler. Goddamn, everything about her was so beautiful, so sexual, yet so familiar and sweet. He\u2019d always been able to walk away from anything or anyone. He\u2019d done it once for Del because she\u2019d asked him. Never fucking happening again.</p><p>No matter how much it killed him or how much restraint it cost, he had to show her that he meant business. He froze and clutched her hips, not allowing her to move. He was still lodged deep inside her, but not moving, not touching her sensitive little clit, now so hard it was a ticking time bomb.</p><p>\u201cTyler!\u201d she screeched, her body bucking frantically.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d he growled in her ear. \u201cIs it just sex, angel? Or is it me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she demanded, trying to gyrate on him, sliding her fingers over her clit.</p><p>With one hand, he grabbed her wrist and held it away from her body. With the other, he exuded an iron grip on her hip, keeping her still.</p><p>\u201cThat cheap orgasm you\u2019re trying to steal isn\u2019t going to make you feel half as good as I can, and you know it. Answer the fucking question.\u201d</p><p>Her pants turned to sobs, and the starch left her body. Tyler had to hold her to keep her against him, keep his breath in her ear to remind her that he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou, damn you. It\u2019s always you. Is that what you wanted to hear?\u201d</p><p>The accusation in her voice was a knife to the chest, but she\u2019d been completely honest. Tyler had no doubt about that. Now that he\u2019d wrung the truth from her, he had to please her, gentle her, complete her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, angel. It\u2019s always you for me. From the first minute I touched you, it was always you. Every other day and every other minute, I was marking time. No one else ever meant a damn thing. But you haunted me. The moment you knocked on my door in Lafayette, you sealed your fate. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you get away from me again.\u201d He might not know a damn thing about commitment firsthand, but he wasn\u2019t letting his mother\u2019s bitter voice crawl up in his head and fuck this up. He was determined to work it out and keep her. \u201cNow move with me.\u201d</p><p>Tyler withdrew slowly and inched in once more, his pace maddening. Beneath him, Del released a string of short, stuttering gasps, each one higher-pitched than the last. Her body tensed again.</p><p>He slid his fingers over her clit again. \u201cWe\u2019re going to come together. And you\u2019re not going to hold anything back. Afterward, you\u2019re going to fall into my arms and kiss me with all the emotion racing through you. I\u2019m going to kiss you back with the same intensity.\u201d</p><p>Then he lowered her to the bed, covering her body with his own, and shoved a pillow under her hips. Tyler gripped the edge of the bed and used his grip as leverage to fill her in agonizingly slow, deep strokes. Under him, Del melted, and he linked the fingers of one hand with hers, splayed across the mattress. The other hand, he fitted against her clit. Every stroke into her rubbed that bundle of nerves into his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon, her gasps became sobs. She tightened under him, around him, moving recklessly with him, taking him completely. There was nothing between them now but shared breaths, passion, heartbeats, unspoken emotion, and the glittering promise of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me, angel. Come for me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s too big. It\u2019s going to wipe me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here for you,\u201d he crooned. \u201cGive yourself to me.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed into her again. With every breath, he got behind each thrust. He poured everything he felt into her, held nothing back. Against his hand, her clit hardened unbearably. She stood at the edge of the cliff and held her breath, just waiting for the right touch, the perfect penetration. Tyler was right there with her, feeling the electric tingle of orgasm brewing in his balls, everything inside him gripping, coiling. Motherfucker, this was going to be huge.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>And he plowed into her hard, deep, fast, no stopping, no holding back, no mercy.</p><p>Under him, Del cried out, a guttural moan that sounded torn from her chest. She jolted, shuddered, and clamped down on him in a long, strong pull of muscles around his cock that sent him hurtling into a pleasure so intense, Tyler couldn\u2019t hear anything but the roaring of his heart. The switch flipped inside him, and he unleashed the last of his restraint, releasing jet after jet of semen. Spots danced before his eyes, and his entire body stiffened as he emptied everything he had and was inside her.</p><p>Finally, he found his ability to breathe. His mind kicked back online a few seconds later, and he found Del shuddering and sobbing underneath him.</p> <p>Fear kicking him, he gingerly withdrew and threw the condom in the nearest bin. Then he rolled Del into his arms and looked down at her with a frown of worry. She wasn\u2019t hurt, but her blue eyes were a sea of pleading. Tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d She clasped her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He scooped her against him and held her tight.</p><p>He\u2019d undone her utterly. Now he had to put her back together.</p><p>Still struggling to get his breath under control, he fused their lips together and let her have all the emotion roiling around inside him. The sated exhaustion, the reverence of a man who knew he\u2019d been blessed by someone special, the silent promise to love and protect her, the determination to never let her go.</p><p>Beneath him, she opened and accepted. Everything he gave, she took, then gave back all that was in her heart: her confusion that he\u2019d stripped her so bare, her fear that it meant more to her than him, her gratitude for giving her a pleasure so profound there weren\u2019t words to express it. And love. Yeah, there it was. Under all the complicated tangle of flavors in her kiss, there was the grim acceptance he\u2019d been looking for. She wasn\u2019t ready to trust him totally with her heart yet. But she was going to roll the dice with him, give herself, and hope that he didn\u2019t let her down.</p> <p>Now, maybe, they had a chance.</p><p>THIRTY minutes and a long, hot bath later, Tyler deposited her back in the bed. As he held her in the silence, she felt the gravity of the moment. If he\u2019d meant this afternoon to be a bonding experience, he\u2019d succeeded. Even now, she could still feel him deep inside her, where no man had been, laying claim to her body. She could still feel the avalanche of pleasure burying her. And as she lay across the bed and curled up beside him, she could feel the care in his touch.</p><p>And Del was forced to admit that Tyler had real feelings for her, more than she\u2019d believed him capable of.</p><p>So, what came next?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too hard,\u201d Tyler whispered. \u201cJust . . . let it be.\u201d</p><p>Del winced. She\u2019d always tried too hard to plan her future, know where every path in front of her was leading. Age and wisdom had taught her that sometimes that just wasn\u2019t possible. Now was one of those times. But it still frustrated her.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You forced me to feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re a team. We\u2019re fighting Carlson together. We\u2019re Seth\u2019s parents. We\u2019re lovers. I want more, and I think you do, too. We owe it to ourselves to be honest. You were hiding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I have feelings for you. I\u2019d think that would be obvious. I trusted you with our son, with my life, with all my secrets. I tried to keep the rest to myself. The you I knew two years ago would have never wanted more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime away from you has made me see things differently. I lost you once. Not happening again.\u201d</p><p>She absorbed his vow in shock. He really, really meant that. \u201cTyler, what\u2019s this about? You care, but it\u2019s not like you\u2019re in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d His green stare burned into her, daring her to disagree. If she did, he was fully prepared for another battle that would be just as wholly and ruthlessly waged as the last one.</p><p>Del hesitated. If he\u2019d challenged her on this subject yesterday, even an hour ago, she would have confidently said that whatever Tyler might be feeling was temporary. Now . . . He hadn\u2019t merely had anal sex with her; he\u2019d told her with his body how much he wanted to be with her, to claim her and make her his. And now he was saying it out loud. Maybe . . . maybe he did love her, at least a little.</p><p>Was she ready for that?</p><p>Her breath caught. A part of her desperately wanted to believe him. The rest of her was scared shitless.</p><p>He sighed and held her tightly. \u201cI get that you\u2019re gun-shy. I\u2019m asking you to believe something that would have seemed impossible two years ago. After all this time apart, your bitter divorce, becoming Seth\u2019s mom alone . . . I get it. But if you care for me at all, can\u2019t you take a chance on me? If you don\u2019t, won\u2019t you always wonder \u2018what if\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tyler had her there. Del remembered all the months she\u2019d been pregnant and wondered what Tyler would have thought of her expanding body, of the fact the life he\u2019d planted there was growing inside of her. She remembered all the nights she\u2019d stayed awake with Seth when he was an infant, and she\u2019d wondered if Tyler would be proud of their son. She\u2019d yearned for the man\u2019s love and approval then. Nothing had changed\u2014except that she\u2019d grown comfortable with this icy, walled-off heart beating in her chest.</p><p>Staying frozen was safe; was it really going to make her happy?</p><p>She clasped her hand in his. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I just need time.\u201d</p><p>Tyler hesitated, then folded her against his body, trying to smile. \u201cAll right. Since I have you here, whatever shall we do?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>AFTER a quick shower, they made love again, once by the bedroom window overlooking the city as the sun went down. Then again, as they slipped into the pool after dusk and looked at the lights of L.A. glittering like somewhere far away and magical. Xander\u2019s \u201clittle place\u201d became their paradise. They fed one another tidbits out of the refrigerator, opened a bottle of very expensive champagne and drank it, then fell into bed together again and gorged on the love growing between them, hour by hour, minute by minute.</p><p>Tyler was almost afraid to hope. Del had been through a lot in the last two years, largely because he\u2019d been thinking with his hurt, not his heart. He\u2019d heeded her dismissal and walked away from her. Now, he planned to stay right by her side, no matter what she said or did.</p><p>As their breathing returned to normal, he wrapped his arms around her and let her melt on top of him, brushing his hand down her spine.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Seth, angel.\u201d He pressed a kiss to her swollen mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve missed so much. I want to hear everything.\u201d</p><p>She blinked down at him, frozen.</p><p>Tyler rolled over, putting her beneath him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt him or take him from you. I just want to know about him.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, she relaxed and nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve just been his only protector for so long . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep him safe now, too. I\u2019d lay down my life to do it. I love him.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, seemingly puzzled. \u201cI know you\u2019ll protect him. That\u2019s who you are. But you barely know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt the bond right away. He\u2019s my son. Our son. That means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a tremulous smile that made everything in his chest tighten and ache. She wanted to believe . . . and she was afraid. It was frustrating, but not surprising. Eric had done a hell of a number on her. But, God, she had no idea how hard and fast he had fallen for her again. And he was falling deeper still. No stopping it.</p><p>\u201cSeth was born almost two weeks early, on Valentine\u2019s Day. It was cold that day, rainy. I\u2019d left work early to meet Eric so we could sign the papers giving him my half of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he get the money?\u201d Eric had often complained about being broke.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cHe got some settlement from the department for getting shot. I\u2019m sure his parents gave him the rest.\u201d</p><p>Probably so. To the parents of a big Italian family, their only son could do no wrong, and Mr. Catalano had done pretty well in the restaurant business.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d Tyler prompted.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t been feeling right all day long. I\u2019d had faint contractions since the middle of the night, which wasn\u2019t unusual. But I was tired and feeling really . . . down. I wondered if this was the last time I\u2019d see Eric, and I\u2019d hoped we could be civil. But he hadn\u2019t seen me in almost three months, and now I was so pregnant that he couldn\u2019t ignore it. He took one look at me, and his eyes got so cold.\u201d</p><p>Tyler squeezed her hand. \u201cFuck him. Get back to Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust after we signed the papers, my water broke. I couldn\u2019t afford an ambulance, but I couldn\u2019t drive. Eric took me to the hospital. I think he knew then how afraid I was, and he stayed with me. I dilated pretty quickly, then stalled out at six centimeters for a while. I was exhausted, but I\u2019ll always be grateful to Eric for staying there to feed me ice chips and massage my aching muscles.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he probably owed Eric some gratitude, too, if he\u2019d made Del\u2019s time giving birth to Seth a better experience. But that took a big person, one capable of a lot of forgiveness. Tyler wasn\u2019t sure he had that in him just now, not mere hours after Eric had handcuffed him to the refrigerator with every intention of raping Del and making him watch.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Del went on. \u201cThe doctor came in at about ten that night when I started dilating again. After that, they administered an epidural, and Seth with born just after one in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you were exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never forget hearing his first cry. It was a healthy wail, so loud that it made the doctors laugh. I heard one of the nurses say that he was just beautiful. They weighed and measured him, eight pounds, four ounces, and twenty-two inches. Then they laid him on my chest.\u201d She drew in a shuddering breath. \u201cI felt so complete. I felt as if God\u2014and you\u2014had given me this beautiful boy to help reward me for all the dark days I\u2019d been through.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d missed every bit of that. He hadn\u2019t heard his son\u2019s first cry, hadn\u2019t been able to hold Del\u2019s hand as she\u2019d pushed their son into the world. He\u2019d missed Seth\u2019s first tooth, his first steps . . . all because Eric had contrived to keep them apart. Tyler\u2019s own hurt had been too great to swallow his pride and follow Del. Yeah, he was furious with Eric. But he was angry with himself most of all.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of infant was he?\u201d He brushed damp tendrils of hair from her flushed cheek.</p><p>She smiled, and Tyler was sure she\u2019d never been more beautiful to him. It was like a kick in the gut, and with every passing moment, he knew he belonged with this woman. He had to convince her somehow that he wasn\u2019t her past coming back to haunt her but that her future had finally arrived. He had to convince her that he wasn\u2019t going to turn on her, change on her. That she could trust him.</p><p>\u201cHungry.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe ate constantly. I breast-fed as much as I could, but it wasn\u2019t enough for him, so I augmented with bottles. He was so healthy and big. He weighed nearly thirty pounds at his one-year well visit. He\u2019s always at the top of the height and weight charts. And smart. Just a few weeks ago, he figured out how to open the drawers to my desk and climb up to get to the jar of chocolates I keep there. I came back into the room from doing laundry and found him sitting on the desk, the jar empty, and chocolate smeared all over his face.\u201d</p><p>Tyler laughed. According to his own mom, he\u2019d been a bundle of mischief, too. He wished he could prove to her that he could, in fact, be the kind of husband and father who stayed. When this danger was behind them, maybe . . . he\u2019d contact her, tell her that she was a grandmother, see if she wanted to meet Seth. But for now, he had to let her bitterness go. Her words no longer had the power to hurt or haunt him.</p><p>\u201cWas it very hard trying to take care of him by yourself?\u201d</p><p>Del hesitated, closed her eyes. Then she sent him one of those too-bright smiles, and he knew she intended to put a cheerful spin on the topic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Her face fell, and her eyes glossed over. \u201cYeah. He didn\u2019t sleep through the night for nearly six months, which means I didn\u2019t sleep. He was colicky nearly every evening. I didn\u2019t love the day care I had him in, but it was close to work and all I could afford. He got very sick his first Halloween, and we spent it in the emergency room, me fearing the worst. The sitting and pacing all alone while they ran tests . . .\u201d</p><p>Behind her back, Tyler clenched his fists. She\u2019d needed him, and he\u2019d been cock deep in women he hadn\u2019t really given a shit about because he\u2019d been licking his wounds. He didn\u2019t totally regret going to Lafayette. He\u2019d found friends who felt a lot like family, and he knew without hesitation that they\u2019d do anything for him. They were doing it now, safeguarding his son. He\u2019d do anything for them, too. That network of people, even if they didn\u2019t know it, had seen him through some lonely times. Del had had no one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so damn sorry, angel. You\u2019ll never have to worry about being alone again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe last few days have been intense. I have to think about everything when Carlson isn\u2019t breathing down our necks. Let\u2019s just see how we feel when this is over.\u201d She pushed him off and rolled away, turning her back to him, then grabbed the TV remote and flipped it on.</p><p>Goddamn it, she was afraid. Tyler gritted his teeth, trying to remember that happily ever after hadn\u2019t worked out for her before. That she needed time and patience. But those were two things he didn\u2019t have much of.</p><p>Suddenly, Del gasped, turning white as a ghost. She trembled, her eyes wide.</p><p>Tyler focused on the screen, showing a sunny afternoon\u2014then a body bag being wheeled out on a stretcher of a little kitschy retro cottage. A reporter filled the picture next. \u201cThe body of thirty-one-year-old Lisa Foster was found early this afternoon. According to authorities, this was definitely a homicide, but they\u2019re declining to give further details. At this point, they have no leads and no suspects. Neighbors are shaken.\u201d</p><p>An older woman looked into the camera and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue. \u201cShe was a sweet girl, always had a smile and a wave. She didn\u2019t have any enemies. I can\u2019t imagine who would want to hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>A cold slither of dread went through Tyler. \u201cYour friend Lisa, from work?\u201d</p><p>She nodded sharply. \u201cOh my God. How . . . Why . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Tyler edged closer and wrapped his arms around her, pressing his chest to her back. \u201cAngel, I think she may have been up to her eyeballs with Carlson and his goons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she burst out. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she did what they asked for a lot of money. She was over thirty thousand dollars in debt last week. As soon as you told her that you were headed to Eric\u2019s to retrieve your flash drive, someone broke into his house. Now, it\u2019s missing. Around that same time, she magically paid off all her credit cards. And now she\u2019s dead. You got another explanation?\u201d</p><p>Del looked over her shoulder at him, mouth gaping open like she wanted to argue. Then resignation crossed her face, and she knew she couldn\u2019t. \u201cShe sold me out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think so. I\u2019m sorry. I know you trusted her.\u201d</p><p>She clapped a hand over her mouth, like she was trying to hold in a scream. Then her eyes went wide, and she gasped. \u201cOh my God. Lisa is the one who helped me track you down in Lafayette. What if she told Carlson that? Seth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her where we\u2019ve hidden Seth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014I think I just said that he was staying with friends.\u201d She trembled.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Tyler stroked her back. \u201cCarlson wants you, not Seth. He\u2019ll only step that far out of his jurisdiction if his back is against the wall. His power and his backup is here, and now you\u2019re on his home turf. Besides, even if he knew my address, he\u2019s not going to find Seth at Deke or Luc or Jack\u2019s homes. He\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll text everyone and tell them to be on the lookout, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She nodded, then broke his embrace and hopped to her feet. \u201cWhy is it that I always let people in my life who are destined to hurt me? Eric. Lisa. Maybe you. Did I have such a drama-free childhood that I unconsciously seek assholes determined to rape my trust?\u201d</p><p>Tyler winced. He could see where she\u2019d think that, but he had to set her straight fast. \u201cNo. You\u2019re a kind, trusting person, and sometimes scumbags take advantage. You\u2019re not wrong; they are.\u201d</p><p>Defeat slumped her shoulders. \u201cIt makes me wonder who else I\u2019ve na\u00efvely trusted that I shouldn\u2019t. I know nothing about your friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re solid, angel. You\u2019ve talked to Alyssa or Kimber every day since we\u2019ve been on the road. Seth is fine. Xander put us up here. We\u2019re safe. Jack and Deke are doing everything they can to help behind the scenes. We\u2019re going to work this out. I swear.\u201d He scrambled to his feet. When he gathered her close and stroked a hand down her hair, her shoulders began to shake. Tyler murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to anyone else from work, not until we can vet them.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod. \u201cI need to talk to Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a laptop in one of the bedrooms. I\u2019ll see if I can get it up and get Skype running. Alyssa has an account. You might be able to video chat and see Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The hope in her eyes was almost painful. No doubt, she missed that little boy. Tyler ached, too. For the chance to comfort her. For the chance to know his own son.</p><p>But now wasn\u2019t the time for sentiment. Now that Carlson was leaving a body trail, there was work to be done.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why don\u2019t you put on some clothes and grab yourself a glass of wine while I set the computer up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m stunned and terrified and probably more numb than I will be tomorrow, but you . . . make everything better for me.\u201d She put her arms around him and drew him close.</p><p>Tyler felt a hundred feet tall. Those words, a measure of her growing trust and caring, gave him a whole lot of fucking hope.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He kissed her lips softly.</p><p>She darted into the bathroom to toss on her clothes. Tyler yanked on his pants, grabbed his phone from his pocket, and made his way to the home office across the hall. He had Jack on the line before he\u2019d even sat down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a body.\u201d Tyler explained what he\u2019d heard on the news.</p><p>Jack cursed. \u201cWhy pay her, then kill her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to think that she\u2019d outlived her usefulness somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlson wouldn\u2019t want to leave her as a loose end indefinitely, but something happened. Maybe the thirty thousand was a down payment for more information,\u201d Jack surmised.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe Lisa grew a conscience and threatened to talk.\u201d Tyler raked a hand through his hair. \u201cAnything is possible.\u201d</p><p>As long as he and Del stayed here in Xander\u2019s posh cocoon, they were safe. But they couldn\u2019t nail Carlson from behind these secure gates. At some point, they\u2019d have to start making moves. Already, they\u2019d wasted time eluding goons and dealing with Eric.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he ground out in frustration.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d Jack offered, \u201cthe best defense is a good offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking that. I\u2019ve got to go after this dirtbag where he lives and breathes. Without the flash drive, Del is trying to remember all the pertinent facts so she\u2019ll know where to start, but I\u2019ve got to figure something out fast. They\u2019re going to come after her. Or Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth is perfectly fine. Put that worry out of your head. He and Caleb are becoming fast friends, except when Chloe is in the room. Then it\u2019s an all-out battle to keep the pretty girl happy.\u201d</p><p>Despite the tension, Tyler laughed. Chloe was such a girly-girl, already well versed in batting her eyelashes to get her way. Or like her mother, she toughed things out until she got what she wanted. If this trend continued, his son and Deke\u2019s would spend years bowing and scraping to the princess.</p><p>From across the hall, he heard a soft sob, and Del\u2019s murmurings, as if she were giving herself a pep talk. Reality intruded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to catch this fucker. We\u2019re running out of time. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Jack said. \u201cDeke has been talking to some of his contacts at the FBI. Apparently someone over there has got a file on Carlson, but we have no idea what\u2019s in it yet. Xander has a hundred bankers who will bend over backward to get or keep his business. He\u2019s looking into any money trail. Carlson\u2019s wife and brother both seem to deal with large sums of money periodically, but no details yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. No one who has that much shit going on around them can possibly smell sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as we get anything solid, we\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it fast.\u201d Tyler started the laptop on the desk with a heavy sigh. \u201cDel is reeling from her so-called friend\u2019s murder. But that won\u2019t last long. Soon, she\u2019ll go on a rampage, all furious about what\u2019s happened to her life, Seth\u2019s life, her friend, the community . . . you name it. I\u2019ll have a hard time restraining her then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recommend nylon cords securing her to your headboard and a swift spanking. It might not stop her for long, but it will get her attention.\u201d</p><p>Tyler was beginning to see the wisdom of that. Despite the hours he\u2019d just spent inside Del, his dick stood up at the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll ring you if anything happens.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call just before Del entered the room, chin held high, all that mahogany hair swirling around her shoulders. She didn\u2019t wear anything enticing, just a pair of jeans and a gray tank top. But Tyler had the sudden urge to tear all that off, tie her to the bed, spank her ass red, just like Jack suggested. Then get deep inside her\u2014stay inside her\u2014until the danger passed.</p><p>God, he should have been sated, but instead, he only felt hungrier. The difference between lusting after a woman and truly loving them, he guessed. Whatever it was, he liked it and refused to let go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take me another few minutes to install Skype.\u201d</p><p>Del nodded, then held up her prepaid cell. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about the case. I know a few people I can call to start recreating my evidence. When I talked to them a few weeks ago, several were really interested in taking Carlson down.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me all the background on the case before you go jumping in? What do you remember being able to truly verify and what were you still working on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think this conversation is probably overdue.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat I\u2019d been able to piece together was that Carlson had struck a deal with Double T, who runs the 18th Street gang. He\u2019d look the other way when their cases came to trial. Felony possession would only be entered as a misdemeanor, and sentences that should have ensured hard time ended with probation or community service. In one particular case, a street dealer got pissed at a customer who tried to stiff him. He shot and killed both the customer and a four-year-old playing in the yard next door. Community outrage didn\u2019t seem to mean a damn thing. The guy stayed in jail while his case came to trial. He was found guilty, but only given three months. As soon as the verdict was read, he was released for time already served and given a small fine. That\u2019s it! Earlier this year, a similar situation with an MS-13 member netted the assailant a sentence of over three hundred years. In the case of the 18th Street gang, the guy trying to buy the drugs didn\u2019t have a weapon. The kid certainly didn\u2019t, either. What should have been two counts of at least second-degree murder was reduced to involuntary manslaughter and given the lightest sentence I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Tyler didn\u2019t like the way any of that sounded. There\u2019d be danger at every turn, both from authority and in the streets. The gang would protect Carlson and their livelihood using their brand of violence. The scum ADA\u2019s reach was far longer than he liked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also heard that some arrests that should be made aren\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cYou think Carlson\u2019s got dirty cops on his side, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I had a source just before the car bomb who was ready to talk to me and name names. Lobato Loco is from the 18th Street gang, second in command. He was trying to convince Double T to break the deal with Carlson. Lobato Loco thought that Carlson wanted too much money for his protection. Double T refused to end the agreement. Lobato Loco was pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd willing to talk. Let\u2019s start there. Call this guy. See if he\u2019s still willing to name names.\u201d</p><p>Del nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking. I\u2019m just not sure I still have his number. I\u2019m afraid it blew up with my notes, or I\u2019d have been on the phone with him days ago.\u201d</p><p>Tyler glanced at her and bit back a curse. She looked exhausted, nearly ready to fall down. He hit a few keys on the computer. \u201cCall Seth. Let me find something for us to eat, then we\u2019ll get back to work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d She moved to the computer eagerly, already putting his suggestion out of her mind.</p><p>He slammed the laptop lid shut. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask; I\u2019m telling you. This case is going to be ugly, and it\u2019s going to take a lot out of you. It already is. Eat a meal. Keep up your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being bossy.\u201d She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cGet used to it. I\u2019m also right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d She rolled her eyes, but he saw a hint of a smile there. She might rebel against his care for show, but she liked it.</p><p>He prowled toward the kitchen on bare feet and was scrounging through the refrigerator when his phone rang. PRIVATE CALLER displayed again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Xander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two lovebirds settling in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I interrupting anything?\u201d He sounded almost hopeful.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or beat the guy\u2019s face in. \u201cNot at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I usually have better timing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Javier?\u201d That ought to stick in his craw.</p><p>Xander\u2019s sudden silence bled across the line. \u201cThe same, with his head still mostly fermented. So I\u2019ve been spending my time more productively, digging for shit on Carlson. This is interesting. I obtained all of his financials about two hours ago\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Bank records were notoriously hard to get unless you were law enforcement. Granted, Xander had contacts, but . . .</p> <p>\u201cEasily. I would have had them sooner if I hadn\u2019t had to rip a bottle out of Javier\u2019s hands and send him off for a sobering shower. Dumb ass. Anyway, besides being an ADA, which doesn\u2019t pay for a family of three to live in the kind of luxury he does, he also has a business called Communications Redirect. It\u2019s supposedly a multimillion-dollar-a-year business and the source of most of his income. Their website talks about the latest in personal communications, so I stopped by their \u2018corporate headquarters.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a storefront in a strip mall in a lousy part of town,\u201d Xander said. \u201cKnow what they sell? Beepers. When was the last time you saw a beeper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, ten years ago, at least. No cell phones or mobile hotspots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort. And this corporate headquarters had one employee. She barely lifted her head at me enough to say that they weren\u2019t taking on new customers at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who the fuck says that to a potential customer, especially in these economic times?\u201d Tyler sighed as the truth hit him. \u201cUnless your business isn\u2019t legitimate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my thought, too. Nor can you make millions and millions of dollars a year selling old technology to no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he uses the business to launder the money he gets from his scam with the 18th Street gang.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely. I\u2019ll fax you over all the financials I\u2019ve got. I also had my driver take some discreet pictures of Communications Redirect. It won\u2019t prove anything except that something odd is going on, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s more than we had. Thanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. If I get more, I\u2019ll let you know. In the meantime, take care of that pretty girl. You never know how valuable she is until you don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>Did he speak from experience, or in riddles, just to piss him off? Tyler shoved the question aside. He had bigger fish to fry.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know exactly how valuable she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, I was hoping you were stupid,\u201d Xander teased.</p><p>Or was he teasing at all?</p><p>\u201cI appreciate all your help. Now leave us the hell alone.\u201d Tyler hung up, grabbed a few things from the kitchen, and headed back to the office down the hall.</p><p>As he got closer, he heard Del\u2019s high-pitched, singsong conversation with their son. Her baby talk did something to his heart. She loved that boy and didn\u2019t try to hide it in the least. That amount of loyalty and love was somehow a huge turn-on.</p><p>Seth gurgled something back, and Del waved. Tyler stepped behind the computer to see Luc bouncing Seth on his lap, Alyssa bustled around in the background with Chloe.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Luc responded. \u201cYour boy is a healthy eater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d Tyler turned his attention to Seth. \u201cHey, little man.\u201d</p><p>Seth smiled wide, like he understood, then shoved part of a crumbling biscuit in his mouth.</p><p>The exchange opened up his chest and poured more love in. Shit, he wanted to be with Seth right now, able to pluck the little boy into his lap and tickle him or talk to him. He had to start finding ways to ingrain himself in the toddler\u2019s life because he intended to be a father\u2014and a damn good one.</p><p>\u201cYou want to talk to him for a bit?\u201d Del asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He almost choked on the word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in the other room to start making my phone calls.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded as she said good-bye to Seth, then walked out. He turned his attention to the little screen in front of him. \u201cSo my boy is being good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s really fun. A little temperamental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder who he gets that from?\u201d Alyssa called out with a grin from the background.</p><p>When Seth looked away for a moment, Tyler gave her the one-fingered salute.</p><p>\u201cOur biggest problem is getting him to sleep,\u201d Luc admitted.</p><p>\u201cIs he ready for bed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Fresh diaper, full belly, the whole nine yards.\u201d</p><p>An idea crossed Tyler\u2019s mind. When he\u2019d been a little guy himself, he\u2019d spent a few precious weeks a year with his grandmother. Unlike his own mom, she wasn\u2019t displeased with her lot in life, didn\u2019t smoke all the time, and hadn\u2019t preferred party life to parenthood. And he remembered one thing that had comforted him more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cPut him in his playpen and set the laptop just outside, at eye level, will you?\u201d</p><p>Luc frowned and groused about the amount of work Tyler was causing him, but he complied. There was a lot of bouncing and muffled sounds as Luc dragged the laptop through the house and into a guest bedroom. With a brush of a soft hand over Seth\u2019s hair, Luc laid him down in the playpen. Seth started wailing immediately.</p><p>The chef set the laptop on a little stool and leaned down in view of the webcam. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>No, but he had to try. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, Luc got out of the way and pointed the built-in webcam at Seth\u2019s little face, currently turning red from all his exertions.</p><p>Tyler did the only thing he could think of. He began to sing.</p><p>DEL paced the kitchen, grabbing a few spare grapes from the refrigerator. She was so tempted to call her boss, Preston, and find out what he knew about Lisa\u2019s murder. But she didn\u2019t dare. At this point, she didn\u2019t know who she could trust, and she had to focus on tracking down people would could help her implicate Carlson and make all this go away.</p><p>Eric might be a source of information, but no way was she going there again. She didn\u2019t hate him for what he\u2019d done; in a weird way, she understood. He\u2019d always had a lot of pride, and she\u2019d trampled over his by being \u201cunfaithful\u201d and enjoying Tyler\u2019s lovemaking so much. He\u2019d always been a golden boy and didn\u2019t know how to process such a slight. But his hungry ego wasn\u2019t her problem, and no matter how badly she needed some phone numbers to get started on her quest, she\u2019d have to start somewhere else.</p><p>Just before the car bomb had destroyed her phone and all her contact information, she\u2019d received a voice mail from Lobato Loco. Maybe she\u2019d saved it. The phone was gone, and it was a long shot, but the only possibility she had at the moment.</p><p>Dialing her cell phone\u2019s voice mail number from Tyler\u2019s phone, she retrieved her messages, including one from Lisa that had her near tears. She\u2019d been one of her closest friends for two years, always there when she needed something. Del could always use more money, but she didn\u2019t understand how Lisa had simply sold her out, knowing the people paying her would more than likely kill her.</p><p>She closed her eyes and deleted the message.</p><p>Two more incidental messages, and she heard what she needed. A muffled, hurried voice with a heavy Latin-American accent rambled on about Double T, Carlson, and all the \u201cshit going down.\u201d He didn\u2019t leave his name or any details, but she\u2019d figured out his identity based on the information he\u2019d left. And he\u2019d left a phone number for a restaurant in the Pico-Union district\u2014a little hole-in-the-wall burger joint. He instructed her to call back on Thursday between seven and ten p.m.</p><p>Del winced. She was over a week late, and who knew if he\u2019d talk to her anymore or if anyone there would even know to expect her. Still, she dialed.</p><p>On the seventh ring, a woman picked up and greeted her in Spanish. She knew only enough of the language to be dangerous.</p><p>\u201cSe habla Ingl\u00e9s?\u201d she asked hopefully, because that was about the extent of her Spanish.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d the heavily accented voice on the other end of the line answered.</p><p>Crap, how did one ask for a known gang member over the phone? \u201cI received a voice mail from a man asking me to call here. I\u2019m a reporter for the L.A. Times. The man didn\u2019t identify himself but said he had information I needed and he was willing to share.\u201d</p><p>The woman started sobbing and babbling incoherent curses in Spanish. Del recognized a few street terms that made her wince.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve caused a problem. I\u2019ll call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not you who causes the problem, yes? It is my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son? Is he called Lobato Loco by all the other . . . homies?\u201d God, she hoped that asking the question wasn\u2019t going to upset this woman more.</p><p>\u201cThat name is est\u00fapido! Esteban was a good boy until all those others come around. Now he gets into all the guns and the drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, se\u00f1ora. Is there another way I should reach him?\u201d</p><p>The woman sniffled and rattled off ten digits. \u201cThis is his phone number.\u201d</p><p>Del jotted it down, thanked her, and ended the call, then ran for the office in the back of the massive house\u2014and stopped abruptly to find Tyler singing into the computer, his rich baritone voice a deep, soothing presence in the room.</p><p>He lifted his head to stare at her and stopped abruptly.</p><p>Gripping the doorframe, she blinked, stared. She\u2019d had no idea Tyler could sing so beautifully, such a haunting, gentle lullaby. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth is asleep,\u201d Alyssa\u2019s voice sounded over the computer before he could answer. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Tyler flushed. \u201cGlad I could help. We\u2019ll call again tomorrow.\u201d He quickly severed the connection with Alyssa, looking almost embarrassed. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s just a song.\u201d</p><p>No. To Del, it was much more than that. He\u2019d been singing their son to sleep, trying to be a father to Seth, even though they\u2019d barely met and were over a thousand miles apart. A fresh bolt of love ripped through her chest. If she\u2019d had any hope of getting through this tough time without losing her heart altogether, it had just died a fiery death. She closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d He pushed out of the chair that rolled across the floor. \u201cDel?\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Focus, damn it! \u201cI have the number for my informant inside the 18th Street gang, someone who might be able to give us some information or proof\u2014someone who can help us.\u201d</p><p>Tyler smiled and patted his lap, indicating that she should sit there. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant. Let\u2019s call.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>THREE rings later, someone answered the phone. \u201cBueno?\u201d</p><p>The heavy beat of Latin dance music pounded in the background, and Del could hardly hear. \u201cEsteban?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuien habla?\u201d he barked.</p><p>Del thought he asked who was speaking. \u201cI\u2019m the reporter from the Los Angeles Times. You called and left a message a while ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. I did.\u201d He paused. \u201cTook you long enough.\u201d</p><p>Del was aware of Tyler hanging on her every word. He looked ready to grab the phone out of her hand and rip the guy on the other end a new one.</p><p>\u201cSomeone put a bomb in my car, and it exploded in front of my eyes. I\u2019ve been shot at, escaped across the country and traveled back, and spent a lot of time just trying to stay alive.\u201d</p><p>On Esteban\u2019s side of the line, Del heard rustling. The music began to fade. Then she heard a door squeak once, twice, followed by blessed silence in the background.</p><p>\u201cCarlson knows about you,\u201d Esteban said. \u201cYou still want to take him down? You still want that information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Desperately.</p><p>\u201cI got everything you need, names, details. If I get rid of him, then business goes back to usual, yeah? Meet me at midnight at Desnuda. It\u2019s on Ninth. I\u2019ll be inside the club, near the front.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Del had no idea where or what that was, but she figured she could find it. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome alone,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be bringing a . . .\u201d She stared at Tyler, trying to decide what to call him.

You look hermosa, yeah?\u201d</p><p>Del thought that meant \u201cpretty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOrder wine at the bar. You\u2019ll stick out for sure.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>But she feared the joke was on her. Still, she didn\u2019t have much choice but to agree.</p><p>As soon as she hung up, Tyler frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either, but what are our more appealing options?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNone. Until midnight, I need to keep working. Let me see the computer, please.\u201d</p><p>Tyler stepped away, letting her sit. The seat was warm, and his scent lingered everywhere, soothing her, even as her thoughts whirled and she longed to throw herself into his arms. Instead, she forced herself to concentrate on the task at hand.</p><p>\u201cI need to send an untraceable e-mail. Any idea how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to test Preston and find out if I can trust him. If my boss is at all in league with Carlson, I\u2019d rather know it now than when it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cUntraceable e-mails aren\u2019t my area of expertise, but I know someone who can help.\u201d Tyler called Deke. In less than five minutes, Deke had walked them through the process. Tyler gestured in her direction. \u201cType away.\u201d</p><p>Quickly, she began composing an e-mail to her boss. Then stopped. \u201cI need to talk to Xander.\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked like he really wanted to object.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s urgent,\u201d Del assured.</p><p>With a curse, he handed over his phone. She flipped through the numbers and found the record that said PRIVATE CALLER. When she dialed, Xander answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, Tyler?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Delaney. If I wanted to . . . misdirect someone who might be playing for the dirty team to somewhere in town that\u2019s being watched and has security, where would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCautious little cat, aren\u2019t you? I like that,\u201d he drawled. \u201cJot this address down. It\u2019s a warehouse I own. Round-the-clock surveillance with state-of-the-art equipment. Logan and his brother, Hunter, made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Thanks! I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Careful, or I might come around to collect.\u201d</p><p>Tyler ripped the phone from her hand. \u201cOver my dead fucking body. Back the hell off.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, Xander hung up.</p><p>Del rolled her eyes as she typed quickly. \u201cHe only does it to annoy you. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to him.\u201d</p><p>With a snort, Tyler sat on the edge of the desk and stewed.</p><p>She put the warehouse\u2019s address in the e-mail to Preston, claiming that\u2019s where she was hiding, then asked about any information he might have on Lisa\u2019s murder. All done, she hit send. If he or a group of thugs showed up at the warehouse instead of answering via e-mail, she\u2019d know that Preston was dirty. Now, all she could do was prepare for the coming night and hope that her upcoming chat with Esteban was the big break she needed.</p><p>TYLER hated this whole plan. Going to visit a gangbanger on his home turf when they had no idea what they were walking into? Something like suicide, he feared. But no, he didn\u2019t have a better idea. While Del showered, he had to fucking call Xander again because Del didn\u2019t have any red shoes, and it was too risky to walk into a well-lit public place to shop. There\u2019d be a lot of security cameras there. And who knew how many dirty cops Carlson had and if their beats included the mall?</p><p>He managed to force another few bites of food into Del before he hopped in the shower and readied himself for the meeting to come. He\u2019d feel better with firepower and backup, but that wasn\u2019t in the cards. Then Xander rang the doorbell.</p><p>Tyler pulled it open to find the man dressed casually in jeans and a clearly designer shirt. He dangled a pair of red fuck-me peep-toe pumps in one hand and had a duffel bag slung over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThanks for picking the shoes up.\u201d Tyler reached out to take them.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast.\u201d Xander stepped into the house. \u201cJavier is so predictable it\u2019s making my head hurt. He was a complete disaster at L\u00e1tigo. We\u2019ll try again tomorrow night. In the meantime, you\u2019re my ticket out of boredom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re coming with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xander smiled wide. \u201cI have experience with Desnuda and the guys who roll there. I can help. And I come bearing gifts.\u201d He held out the shoes.</p><p>Del walked down the hall just then and grabbed them. \u201cOh my God, they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Christian Louboutin. Enjoy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are crazy expensive. Did you just have these hanging around?\u201d Del frowned.</p><p>\u201cNo. I shopped. I tried to imagine the shoes you\u2019d look sexiest in naked and bent over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your fucking mouth,\u201d Tyler growled.</p><p>Xander just laughed. \u201cI brought you presents, too. Happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birthday is in September.\u201d Tyler gritted his teeth.</p><p>\u201cThen happy fuck-off day.\u201d Xander shoved the duffel bag in his midsection.</p><p>As Tyler grasped it, the metallic sounds of the jostling contents told him immediately what lay inside. \u201cHardware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of it. A nice collection of semiautomatics, a sniper rifle or two, a few hand grenades\u2014though I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that since Desnuda is a decent club\u2014and even a Corner Shot.\u201d</p><p>Tyler gaped. As much as Xander got on his nerves, Tyler kind of loved the guy in that moment. \u201cWow, money really does buy everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly.\u201d Xander shrugged. \u201cThe rest . . . I\u2019m still figuring out how to get.\u201d</p><p>Unable to imagine anything Xander lacked or wanted for, Tyler shrugged. \u201cAre we ready?\u201d</p><p>Del nodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m ready to go anywhere in shoes this fabulous. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>She closed the distance between her and Xander and placed a kiss on his cheek. Xander wrapped his arm around her waist, looking like he hoped to bring her in for a big, juicy kiss. Tyler wasn\u2019t having any of that.</p><p>He grabbed Xander\u2019s shoulder, pinched hard on the nerve, then slammed him back into the front door. \u201cStraight up? I appreciate your help, and we wouldn\u2019t be doing this well without you. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to let you touch my woman.\u201d Tyler got in the other man\u2019s face and forced him to meet his stare. \u201cAre we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler! Stop!\u201d Del insisted, gaping at him in shock.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a caveman? Absolutely. She\u2019ll come to her senses soon and find me irresistible.\u201d Xander shrugged free and winked at her.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Tyler let him go. If not, he\u2019d risk really pissing Del off. And given the bastard\u2019s grin, Xander knew it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a car outside,\u201d the billionaire said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Tyler slung the bag over his shoulder, then grabbed Del\u2019s hand. Following Xander, they made their way out into the night air. It was crisp and light, with a hint of a cool breeze. Xander stopped beside a sleek black Audi so new it didn\u2019t yet have license plates and opened the door for Del.</p><p>She bypassed the open door and climbed in the back. Tyler grinned as he slung the duffel onto the floorboard and eased into the passenger\u2019s seat where Xander proffered the door open.</p><p>\u201cShithead,\u201d he muttered, and slammed the door.</p><p>Within minutes, they were off, heading out of the hills and down into a seedy part of town. Clusters of older homes merged with liquor stores and pawnshops, flashing lights, ladies of the night, and drug deals going down everywhere. They parked in a shadowed lot behind an old stucco building. As Tyler tucked a couple of the Glocks into his waistband at the small of his back, he watched Del. He didn\u2019t like the dark surrounding them or the cautious, tense expression on her face. Xander didn\u2019t seem to notice as he grabbed a pistol, tucked it away, and led them around the side of the building, to the front door, painted a garish red. Tyler glanced behind him and stared at the club\u2019s sign, then winced at the neon dancing woman edging red panties down over her ass.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a nightclub; it was a strip joint.</p><p>Xander stopped them before they could enter. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk in first, get the lay of the land. They\u2019ve seen me here before, so I won\u2019t stand out. If there\u2019s anything wrong. I\u2019ll call. If you haven\u2019t heard from me in five minutes, the coast is clear.\u201d</p><p>As much as Tyler wanted to object, the plan made sense. Del nodded.</p><p>The minute Xander disappeared inside, Tyler wrapped his arm around her waist and dragged her into the shadows, just in case Lobato Loco had sold her out, too. He wished he could tell her that they didn\u2019t have to do this, but that would be a lie. Her life literally depended on this, and there was no way around it until they could prove how dirty Carlson was.</p><p>Del stood stiffly against him. \u201cI\u2019m way out of my element. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Gnawing on her lip, Del nodded. She looked so nervous, and Tyler just wanted to wrap her up and hide her away. It wasn\u2019t in the cards.</p><p>After five minutes, they hadn\u2019t heard from Xander, so Tyler led her into the club. It wasn\u2019t upscale in the least, and he wondered why a billionaire came here for kicks. The music was loud, and everything smelled steeped in alcohol, with a slight tinge of musty underneath. A pretty Latina woman danced on the stage, wearing only a spangled thong. She dragged a sheer red scarf back and forth, across her hard, rosy brown nipple. Seen it, fucked it. Not this particular woman, but after a while, women like her were all the same.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Del eased over to the bar and ordered a white wine. The bartender looked at her like she was crazy, but shrugged and poured her a glass. She looked around the room then and spotted Xander, who looked engrossed in the journey that red scarf was taking around the stripper\u2019s body.</p><p>Tyler approached her, and he felt Del\u2019s tension as she scanned the room for her contact. He glanced at his cell phone. They were still a few minutes early. Maybe Lobato Loco wanted to make a big entrance.</p><p>\u201cWe should sit toward the front, someplace visible so he sees you when he comes in.\u201d</p><p>Del clearly didn\u2019t like it, but she nodded. Together they found a table in the front corner of the room. She crossed her legs, and those red shoes were like a beacon in the club. No way any man entering could miss those long, slender thighs and those shoes so provocative, they were an X-rated invitation all their own. Tyler sat closer to her, threw an arm around her shoulders, wanting every bastard in the joint to know exactly who she belonged to. Behind them, he could almost feel Xander laughing.</p><p>Five minutes slid into ten. The woman with the scarf was replaced by a naughty nurse, then a cowgirl who made chaps look downright indecent. A few years ago\u2014hell, two weeks ago\u2014he would have grinned and whistled, coughed up a twenty, and hoped for a little action later. And how fucking pathetic was that? He\u2019d been using sex like a drug so he didn\u2019t have to confront how lonely he\u2019d been without Del.</p><p>At the twenty-minute mark, Del had finished sipping her wine and was looking around for her contact. Still nothing\u2014except the painted-up beauty who\u2019d wielded the scarves earlier headed in their direction. She wriggled her curves in between him and Del.</p><p>Then she straddled his lap with a lascivious smile.</p><p>Del backed away, her brows raised and her mouth open with annoyance. The dancer thrust her breasts in his face and wriggled down on his lap. Tyler reared back and closed his eyes. This had to be Xander\u2019s work, and he was going to throttle the asshole.</p><p>He grabbed the dancer by the hips. It took him a few moments to stop all her gyrations and unplaster her from his chest. Undaunted, she grabbed his face and smothered his mouth with her too-red lips.</p><p>Tyler wrenched away. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a hundred bucks just to go away.\u201d</p><p>She paused. Her come-hither glance fell away, then she shrugged and held out her hand. Snarling, he pulled bills out of his pocket and thrust them into the dancer\u2019s hand. \u201cThe guy who hired you? He\u2019s loaded. Absolutely stinking rich.\u201d</p><p>The dancer smiled wide, then planted another kiss on Tyler\u2019s mouth, this time in gratitude. He pushed her away again and set her off his lap with a grimace. God, she smelled like booze and sweat and other men. He\u2019d done a hundred girls who smelled just like her, and it had never bothered him before. But it bugged the shit out of him now, and he knew the cause: Del. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked over at her chair. Empty. Fuck.</p><p>He jumped up and looked around the room. She wasn\u2019t hard to spot, trolling the room, looking around for her contact. Xander had an eye on her, but Pimphead Warbucks was a lover, not a fighter. Tyler doubted he would be able to save Del if she needed help.</p><p>Throwing his chair aside, he stormed after her, catching up to her mid-aisle. He grabbed her arm. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for Esteban.\u201d She wrenched free of his grip and crossed her arms over her chest, refusing to look his way.</p> <p>Tyler gritted his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe or smart for you to do that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite her to dance on my lap.\u201d</p><p>Del rolled her eyes. \u201cFrom what I saw, you weren\u2019t trying terribly hard to make her leave.\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s ire rose. \u201cXander pulled that shit on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She kept strolling, looking everywhere but at him.</p><p>\u201cI paid her to go! Seriously?\u201d He planted himself in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be mad because a woman I didn\u2019t want danced on my lap?\u201d</p><p>Del stopped, pondered. \u201cI think I have to. I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the other women around Eric when we were married. I thought he loved me, and their attraction was one-sided. So I let it slide. But after a while, a healthy twentysomething man not having sex with his wife for months . . . I can\u2019t prove that he cheated on me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Tyler admitted.</p><p>Fidelity would always be a concern of hers if he didn\u2019t come absolutely clean. Now wasn\u2019t the best time, but Esteban was looking like a no-show, and putting this off only left Del with a festering wound. As soon as everything was out in the open, he could reassure her that he wasn\u2019t the same guy he used to be\u2014and he definitely wasn\u2019t Eric.</p><p>She sucked in a stunned breath, looking pale, as if the truth had flattened her. But she didn\u2019t deserve more lies. In for a penny, in for a pound . . .</p> <p>\u201cI was seeing this one girl in particular. We didn\u2019t have anything special, just a good time. But then I realized that Eric was . . . with her, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDestiny.\u201d Del\u2019s face closed off.</p><p>He hated like hell to hurt her. \u201cYeah. She wasn\u2019t the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d she exploded. \u201cI knew it. Deep down, I knew it and didn\u2019t confront him.\u201d</p><p>Some of the patrons turned her way. Attracting attention wasn\u2019t a good idea, and he had a feeling that Del was too overwrought to hold all her fury in. When he tried to take her hand to lead her outside, she wrenched it away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Tyler scowled. \u201cI\u2019m not Eric, Del. I didn\u2019t lie. I didn\u2019t cheat on you. I never would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked every girl who moved, even after having sex with me. And you, one of my best friends, didn\u2019t tell me that my husband was being unfaithful. Why? Because it didn\u2019t occur to you that it was an issue? I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p> <p>She stalked off, forcing Tyler to follow. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught Xander frowning, then beating feet to the door. He could accuse the bastard of a lot of things. Thankfully, being stupid wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>Xander pushed outside first. Del followed, shoving the big red portal out of her way, leaving it to fly in Tyler\u2019s face. With a curse, he slammed it against the wall and jogged until he caught up with her. \u201cThink about what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re supposed to be meeting a contact who will give you information you need to make all this danger go away.\u201d</p><p>She stomped her pretty Christian Louboutin pumps onto his toes, and he reared back, clutching his injured digits with one hand and glaring at her. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? Esteban is now thirty minutes late. I doubt he\u2019s coming.\u201d She pulled out her cell phone, punched a few buttons on her prepaid cell, and shoved it up to her ear.</p><p>\u201cDel . . .\u201d</p><p>She turned her back on him.</p><p>A long minute later, she stabbed a finger at the buttons again and pocketed the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering. Maybe he\u2019s spooked. Or in the middle of a big deal. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll call him again tomorrow. All I know is that right now, I want to get in bed and sleep. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Del!\u201d He turned her to face him again, ready to have it out.</p><p>Xander whacked him between the shoulders. \u201cAs entertaining as this little lovers\u2019 quarrel is, I think we\u2019re being watched. I\u2019ve got a bad feeling. If this contact didn\u2019t show, maybe someone else will appear in his place\u2014and it might be one of the bad guys.\u201d</p><p>That possibility washed over Tyler in a cold surge. He\u2019d been too fucking tied up in his own drama to keep his head clear. As soon as he realized his mistake, he heard a gunshot out of nowhere whiz right between him and Del and strike the building. Stucco kicked up, then crumbled onto the sidewalk. They all ran, and Tyler drew his weapon, hoping like hell that they all made it to the car alive.</p><p>DEL could literally feel her legs shaking out from under her as she sprinted around the side of the club toward Xander\u2019s car. Tyler popped off a few shots back. The men flanked her, ready to pick her up or help her, but she was determined not to be a detriment in platforms, no matter how pretty. Hard not to be scared as hell as more bullets whizzed past, coming dangerously close.</p><p>Shooters started coming from the opposite direction on foot, too. Somewhere in the dark parking lot, there were dangerous men with guns, intent on killing her.</p><p>She, Tyler, and Xander were all creeping low, ducking bullets, dodging shooters in between cars. Del\u2019s heart pounded; terror ate at her. She hoped like hell that she got back to Seth alive. Beside her, Tyler reached out and grabbed her hand, as if telling her to hang on. As if underscoring that he was there for her.</p><p>She should be blazingly pissed at him now for keeping Eric\u2019s infidelity from her for all these years. But right now was about life or death.</p><p>Del squeezed his hand in return.</p><p>A few feet from the car, Xander deactivated the locks. The alarm chirped and the lights flashed. The shooters immediately darted closer; Del could hear their footsteps pounding against the pavement. It was going to be a footrace to the car to see who got there first\u2014and if anyone died.</p><p>Tyler reached the car first, opening the back door as he shot at the gunmen, then all but threw Del inside. As Xander dove into the front seat and started the car with a button, Tyler scrambled in, covering her body with his own.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he shouted to Xander.</p><p>But the other man was already peeling out of the parking lot with a ripe curse. \u201cWhat the fuck happened?\u201d</p><p>Del\u2019s heart beat so hard she felt sure it would fall out of her chest. She\u2019d barely caught her breath when she heard Tyler say, \u201cSomehow, Carlson must have figured out where we were going to be. Maybe Esteban was a setup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But why not send thugs into the club?\u201d she asked, pushing Tyler off of her.</p><p>He eased away reluctantly. \u201cToo visible?\u201d</p><p>Xander sped down the mostly deserted streets and nodded. \u201cIf he\u2019s up for appointment as the DA, even temporarily, he has to keep his nose reasonably clean. Everyone is going over his records with a fine-tooth comb right now. He must know that you don\u2019t have enough hard evidence now or you\u2019d have already written your story. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s trying to scare you off more than kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d Tyler disagreed. \u201cThose were real bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this neighborhood . . .\u201d Xander trailed off. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t raise too many eyebrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. But if Carlson was behind this, and they\u2019d managed to kill us, we wouldn\u2019t have been the first innocent bystanders to become victim to seeming gang violence. It would have been tragic, but not unheard of. And not worth much of an investigation. If they\u2019d gone into the club and caused a scene, it could have raised a red flag, especially if there had been lots of collateral damage.\u201d Tyler cursed, clearly not liking it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to track Lobato Loco down again and feel him out. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a setup. Maybe something spooked him.\u201d Or he was dead. But Del hated to think about that. Not only did she not want someone else dying for this story, she had no leads if this homey bit the dust.</p><p>Damn, it was cold in here. She trembled, gathering her arms around her, huddling to keep warm. Tyler was right there, arms around her.</p><p>\u201cDel?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and pushed him away. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He refused to be put off. \u201cYou\u2019re having trouble coming down from the adrenaline.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and he knew the signs. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He put his arms around her again and stubbornly stayed. It felt too good to push him away.</p><p>Within moments, Xander dropped them off at his lovely \u201clittle place\u201d in the hills and helped them into the house. \u201cDamn, there went that car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething happen to it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Carlson\u2019s goons didn\u2019t identify me, they can identify a new Audi with temporary plates. And I just bought it today.\u201d He sighed glumly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a car,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou were shot at. All things considered, wouldn\u2019t you rather save your ass than worry about a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he conceded. \u201cTo be safe, I should swap out.\u201d</p><p>Del frowned as she watched him jog back to the Audi. Suddenly, the garage door opened, and he pulled the car inside. Thirty seconds later, he backed a red Mercedes convertible out, window rolled down.</p><p>\u201cMuch better. Now I can get home without worrying about being pulled over and questioned. Besides, this is a sweet ride, too.\u201d</p><p>You think? Del sighed. Some poor woman someday would have her hands full with Xander.</p><p>\u201cWhat if security or traffic cameras picked you up, and the police come to your door?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>Xander raised a brow. \u201cI dare them to try to arrest me or hold me for questioning. Carlson might be dirty, but he\u2019s not stupid. He knows I can call a press conference faster than he can spit. It would be a PR nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded, and Del agreed. Carlson was smart enough to leave Xander alone.</p><p>\u201cYou leaving?\u201d Tyler shoved his thumbs through his belt loops and stared.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I shouldn\u2019t turn my back on Javier for too long. Call me if anything develops.\u201d</p><p>With those words and a jaunty wave, Xander burned rubber out of the driveway and sped down the private road.</p><p>Tyler shut the door, and the evening rushed back to Del. What the hell had gone wrong? She turned it over and over in her head, trying to understand how Carlson could have traced her through Lobato Loco if the gangster hadn\u2019t sold her out. Their only common point was one phone call. She took out her cell phone, stared.</p><p>And a cold wave of suspicion crashed over her. She dropped the phone onto the coffee table with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tyler demanded, running over to her.</p><p>\u201cI think I know how Carlson tracked us down, but now I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>Tyler frowned, thoughts turning, then suspicion narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou called Lisa with this phone before her murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If they got this number, they could trace who else I\u2019ve called, including Lobato Loco.\u201d</p><p>She turned up to him with a lost stare. She was a fluff reporter, for God\u2019s sake. All this subterfuge and danger was over her head. She didn\u2019t know how to cope, how to compensate. What the hell was she supposed to do?</p><p>\u201cBefore Lisa\u2019s murder. I\u2014I don\u2019t remember who else I\u2019ve called with this phone. What if I called someone in Lafayette and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. You haven\u2019t.\u201d He grabbed the phone and looked back through her call history. \u201cAll clean. We just need to ditch the phone.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod. \u201cI\u2019m scared. Really scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Tyler leveled a grave stare at her. \u201cWhen you started this investigation, did you know you\u2019d be starting a shit storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I thought I\u2019d fly under the radar. I never believed he\u2019d really take me this seriously. I write about baby showers and dog shows. I had no real proof, just a supposition based on a conversation I overheard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be damn close to the truth. And you work for the most important paper in his city, angel.\u201d Tyler sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do tonight. Let\u2019s just . . . try to unwind. We need to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>He was right; it was late. Her fear warred with her anger. He could not only keep her safe but make her feel safe. Del always felt protected in his presence. But damn it, he\u2019d kept the knowledge of Eric\u2019s indiscretions a secret. She was furious and wondered what the hell else he\u2019d keep from her in the future if she let him. It might not be rational, but that was how she felt.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I want space. Can you just . . . let me spend some time alone for a while?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth flattened into a grim line. \u201cYou\u2019re still angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes.\u201d She paced. \u201cI\u2019m hurt that I wasn\u2019t important enough for you to tell me the truth. That you didn\u2019t realize how much I valued fidelity. Of course you didn\u2019t. What am I thinking? It\u2019s you I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>Tyler darted after her and grabbed her arm. \u201cWhat the fuck is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you should have to ask? When have you ever been faithful to any woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never made a promise to any woman, ever. I\u2019ve never had a reason to be faithful. And I\u2019ve never made a habit of spending time with a woman who would have given a shit about my fidelity. Except you. I\u2019m making you a promise here and now. As long as you\u2019re with me, I won\u2019t ever touch another woman.\u201d</p><p>She reared back and stared at his rapt expression. Those green eyes of his penetrated her, tearing away what little protective armor she had. He pulled her closer. Del fought . . . but not very hard.</p><p>God, when he said things like that, it was so tempting to believe him. And if he turned out to be a liar, how much would it hurt?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Your past\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the past. Stop letting it hang you up. When you\u2019ve got no one to care about and nothing else in your life, playing Lothario and nailing hot girls fills a void. For a while. But when you\u2019re with someone who means everything, you realize what a stupid, pathetic existence it was. I can say it over and over to you, but words won\u2019t convince you.\u201d He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI get it. Eric burned you. You think I condoned his behavior. Should I have said something? Probably. But every day, we hit the streets together. He put his life in my hands; I put mine in his. At first, I rationalized that if I was the kind of partner to stab him in the back, it would damage the partnership. My first allegiance then was to him.\u201d</p><p>Del looked like she wanted to argue and throw it back in his face. But instead, tears welled in her eyes as she crossed her arms over her chest. Damn it, he was right.</p><p>\u201cAfter the shooting,\u201d he continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t see the point. Destiny and all the other faceless girls were in his past by then. We didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d ever walk again, much less have an extracurricular sex life. Letting him heal and having you take care of him while he did were the most important things.\u201d Tyler sighed. \u201cThen came . . . that night.\u201d</p><p>Del closed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m not keeping quiet anymore. Being with you was like finally watching the sunrise after decades of dark. I could see what life was supposed to be. I\u2019d felt it, touched it, held it close. Then I fucking had to let you go because you asked me to. Don\u2019t think the truth didn\u2019t cross my mind in that moment to tell you about every one of the girls he\u2019d been fucking since almost the day you were married. But I knew I\u2019d be spilling for my selfish reasons and that you didn\u2019t need my shit right then. I\u2019d planned to sit you down in a day or two and come clean. My allegiance had shifted from my friend to the woman I loved. But then you were gone from my life.\u201d</p><p>His words crushed Del. He\u2019d given her so much information, she didn\u2019t know what to process first. His poetic admission about how important she\u2019d become to him? The fact that she\u2019d hurt him by letting him go to try to reconcile with her douche bag ex-husband? Eric apparently having far more lovers than she\u2019d imagined? The fact that Tyler had admitted straight out that he loved her stood above all those, and she trembled.</p><p>Del believed him. How could she not? But did three words guarantee that he could love only her? Tyler had never been a one-woman man. Not that he couldn\u2019t change\u2014he had in some ways\u2014but trusting in the constancy of his feelings . . . After everything she\u2019d endured with Eric, how was she supposed to just open herself up again without time and healing?</p><p>But if she didn\u2019t put her faith in Tyler, what would they have together?</p><p>She let out a sob.</p><p>\u201cFuck this,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Before she could understand what he meant, he bent and thrust a shoulder in her midsection and stood again. That quickly, Del was over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s carry, and he was strutting down the shadowed hall toward the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cPut me down. Damn it, I don\u2019t need a caveman.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he dropped her on the bed, then covered her body with his own. He was hot and hard everywhere. Del trembled.</p><p>\u201cYou need a firm hand. You need to be restrained and spanked. And then you need for me to make love to you until you can\u2019t see straight, until you understand how goddamn serious I am and that I\u2019ll never let anyone come between us again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>UNDER the hot weight of Tyler\u2019s body, Del panted, stared. She froze under the gravity of his words, but inside her heart took off like a rocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what to say? Care?\u201d he shot back. \u201cI\u2019m done talking.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the rough hands that pinned her to the bed were on her, moving down her body, pulling at her clothes, flipping her over to lie on her stomach.</p><p>In seconds flat, Tyler stripped her bare\u2014except the red shoes. She should be indignant. He\u2019d picked her up like a sack of potatoes. But she was already wet and aching. And so hopeful that he meant even a word he\u2019d said.</p><p>Then he hauled her across his lap and braced one of his forearms into the crook of her knees. The other anchored her at the small of her back. \u201cI\u2019m sure if I searched this place, I could find a whole room full of perversions because that\u2019s how Xander rolls. But I don\u2019t need nylon cords or wooden paddles to get my point across.\u201d</p><p>He really meant to spank her? She froze, but a traitorous ache took up residence right between her legs.</p><p>The question had barely cleared Del\u2019s thoughts before she felt the first whap of his hand across her ass. She yelped. Pain bubbled across her backside, but tingling followed. Then heat.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Tyler groused. \u201cI need light.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over to the nightstand for the lamp. Del knew his grip wasn\u2019t as sturdy in those moments and that she could probably wriggle free. But she needed him. Not just for sex, though that would likely be mind-blowing as always. She needed to see how insistent he was, how far he was willing to go to prove his point. So she waited, breath shallow.</p><p>A second later, soft golden light bathed the bedroom. Tyler sighed and palmed her ass. \u201cYou\u2019re already pink. Fuck, that\u2019s pretty.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his palm into the small of her back and took another whack at her ass, sending a new shiver of sweet pain and heat through her body. \u201cThat\u2019s right, angel. Listen to me, feel how fucking much I want you. You\u2019re going to stay here and take me until you believe it. Then we\u2019re going to talk. You\u2019re going to nod and tell me that you love me, too. Then we\u2019re going to nail Carlson\u2019s ass to the wall.\u201d</p><p>Tyler made it sound so easy to open herself to him, body and heart, to admit how she felt. But even if she didn\u2019t, he saw right through her. He knew she loved him. And he knew they had to stop Carlson before the bastard stopped them.</p><p>\u201cNo arguments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to just believe that you\u2019ll be faithful. I want to, but . . .\u201d</p><p>He turned her so that she rested on her side, her breasts against his chest, her head now on his shoulder, back cradled by his strong arm. He delved into her eyes with a stare so open and searing, more of the fear and ice inside her melted.</p><p>\u201cI know, angel. You\u2019ve been through a lot. I\u2019m asking you to take a big leap of faith. But don\u2019t assume that I won\u2019t be faithful before you\u2019ve even given me a chance. We owe it to each other. To our son.\u201d</p><p>Del gulped. Yeah, she had no defense for that.</p><p>Suddenly, sobs racked her body. The rest of her walls crumbled down, and she threw her arms around Tyler\u2019s neck. He gripped her tightly, holding her crushingly close. And she didn\u2019t care. The sounds of his breathing and heartbeat filled her ears, but he said nothing. The moment was timeless, endless. So deep. Words couldn\u2019t possibly fill it.</p><p>Instead, she raised her face to his, layered her mouth across his lips, and kissed him with everything exploding from her heart. Swift, deep, ravenous, she took him. And he responded in kind, grasping at her as if she was a precious treasure he would never let go, sinking into the kiss again and again. His heartbeat quickened against her chest, in time with hers. Del melted into him.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t close enough for Tyler. He laid her across the bed and followed her down, his lips searing across her cheeks, her neck, down to her breasts, suddenly tight with need. His lips closed around one nipple and sucked hard.</p><p>Electric desire shocked Del. She arched up. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give you more, angel,\u201d he murmured, switching to her other breast. \u201cI\u2019m going to be at you until you can\u2019t think about anything except the way we feel together.\u201d</p><p>They should talk about this more. She should really have her head clear before she fell into bed with him. He\u2019d take this to mean forever. But her heart urged her to grab him and accept him. They could sort out anything else later. For now, this felt right.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She was whimpering.</p><p>And Tyler was loving it. He pressed his lips over hers, thumbing both of her nipples in firm strokes that only made the gaping gash of need inside her grow. She thrust her hips up at him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait an instant before he accepted her invitation.</p><p>Tyler reached behind him and yanked off his T-shirt, revealing slabs and ridges of golden muscle. He was taut everywhere, veins standing out strong. Primal, perfect male, intent on having her. Del shivered.</p><p>Then he tore off his jeans, shoved them around his hips, and plunged into her with one demanding stroke. She gasped and spread her legs wider to take him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he breathed as he wrapped his arms around her and clutched her ass to tilt her up, then set up a rhythm of relentless strokes, slow, deep. Every one rubbed against that sensitive spot inside her as he entered. As he filled her completely, he roused nerves deep in her cervix\u2014a sensation she\u2019d never known before him. And he ground his pelvis against hers, nudging the nerves of her clit.</p><p>Del couldn\u2019t find her breath. Every muscle in her body tightened, and rapid heartbeats coupled with the thick honey of arousal soared in her veins. She clutched Tyler, knowing that she\u2019d never felt this way about any man. At every turn, he surprised her. He\u2019d protected her, despite the total upheaval of his life. He tried to build a relationship with the son he barely knew. Even now, he tried to claim her like some primitive warrior of old, using his body and the pleasure he gave to brand her as his. And God help her, she didn\u2019t think she would ever be whole without him again.</p><p>If she ever wanted to be happy, she was going to have to throw herself into his arms, put her heart at his mercy, and love him with her whole being. If he betrayed her . . . then she\u2019d know. But she refused to walk away a coward.</p><p>Pleasure coursed through her now. Del dragged her lips up his neck and bucked into Tyler\u2019s thrusts.</p><p>Within seconds, her body was aflame. Ecstasy breathed against her skin, about to overtake her, and Tyler was too attuned to her not to know it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, angel. Come for me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to ask twice. The ache deep in her pussy grew, tightened. She could actually feel the rising tide of orgasm overtake her just before it exploded like a skyrocket, sending her soaring high and fast. She clamped down on his cock, still deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he groaned, his body tensing above her as he tried to breathe through each stroke and prolong her pleasure.</p><p>But it was costing him, and the way he clamped his eyes shut told her more than anything how much the effort tortured him.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to do. Del wanted him to feel as good as she felt. She shoved him to the side, urging him to roll to his back. He played along until she was seated above him. Tyler\u2019s gaze fastened on the heavy sway of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m really fucking glad I turned on the light. You\u2019re beautiful. Move with me, angel.\u201d</p><p>He set a leisurely pace, scraping that thick cock of his across every nerve endings he\u2019d already stimulated. Despite her recent climax, the crescendo to pleasure was inexorable. Determination firmed his jaw as he plowed up into her, going even deeper than before.</p><p>Del had thought to turn the tables on Tyler, make him lose his self-control. But here he was, ratcheting her pleasure up again. And here she was, helplessly falling into the fray of need until she screamed out in a gush of release and clutched him with her arms, legs, sex. Still, he just kept pumping into her until one orgasm became another, then a fourth, until she couldn\u2019t count anymore.</p><p>He pressed kisses across her face, then lingered on her mouth. \u201cI will never want anyone more than I want you. I could do this all night with you and still want you the next day. Angel, please give us a chance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Del absorbed his words. He\u2019d unraveled her, turned her inside out, and all that was left was the raw woman who bled and feared . . . and hoped. Tears fell down her cheeks, even as another orgasm clawed its way through her and left her speechless.</p><p>So she simply nodded.</p><p>As if that had turned on some switch inside Tyler, he shoved his cock into her rougher, faster, grabbing her hips and looking her right in the eye. \u201cCome with me. Yeah?\u201d</p><p>It astounded her that she could. She could barely move at that point, she\u2019d been so drugged by the pleasure. But she managed to nod, then clamp down on him in a thundering climax harsher and more demanding than all the rest. She screamed until she lost her breath, her voice\u2014and still the ecstasy racked her. It turned up a notch when she felt Tyler jolt, then the wet jet of his semen blasted deep inside her.</p> <p>With a long, low growl, he filled her again and again with his pleasure and his seed, clutching her. The growl became something like a moan. Then his body went completely limp underneath her.</p><p>Their hearts thundered together. Breaths mingled. And reverent silence filled the rest of the room. Something had happened here. She\u2019d given a piece of her soul to Tyler that she\u2019d never be able to take back. It scared the hell out of her.</p><p>Walking away from him scared the hell out of her more.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d he breathed. \u201cGod, you\u2019re perfect. It\u2019s never been just sex with you. It\u2019s like . . . melding. I only wanted to get deeper inside you and never leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She didn\u2019t have prettier words, just a fresh batch of tears at the touching way he\u2019d described their lovemaking. \u201cIt\u2019s like my body knows how much you mean to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you sooner about everything . . . the past.\u201d</p><p>Del swallowed. The stark honesty on his face couldn\u2019t be a lie. He meant every word he said. His apology and his sincerity choked her up. Could this man get any more perfect? \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Relief filled his expression, and he burrowed his face into her neck, breathing her in. \u201cI want to hold you all night.\u201d</p><p>It sounded heavenly . . . except they were going to need a change of sheets if they didn\u2019t get up soon.</p><p>Then their situation struck her. She gasped. \u201cYou didn\u2019t use a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean,\u201d he offered immediately, then peered closely at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not on the pill?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo reason to be.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. No reason at all. Seth needs a brother or sister.\u201d</p><p>That quickly, Del felt his cock growing, lengthening. She gaped at him. \u201cTyler, we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be good parents to the boy we have. Don\u2019t you want more children? I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen all this danger is over, we can talk about it, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His strokes grew deeper, longer. \u201cI\u2019m not letting this motherfucker dictate my future. We\u2019re going to get him, and when we do, we\u2019ll celebrate. If you\u2019re pregnant again, we\u2019ll celebrate even more. Angel, please. I want to be with you every step of the way this time. I want to make you utterly mine.\u201d</p><p>Damn, the picture Tyler painted was so seductive. He made it sound heavenly and ridiculously simple, like all she had to do was lay back and let him love her until nature took its course and a new baby to love grew in her belly.</p><p>Reality intruded. Carlson could even now be on their asses. They were still in danger, and until this slimy bastard was caught, none of them were safe. That wasn\u2019t her only objection. She wasn\u2019t terribly old-fashioned, but she\u2019d just gotten divorced last time she\u2019d given birth. This time she wanted to be married and settled.</p> <p>Still on top, Del disentangled herself from Tyler and pushed off the bed before he could grab her. \u201cNow isn\u2019t the time to be careless or make rash decisions. I need to think about this.\u201d</p><p>Confusion racked Tyler\u2019s face. \u201cI love you. I love Seth. I want our family, and I want it to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, we don\u2019t even live in the same state,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd neither of us can rent a moving van and fix that?\u201d He raised a tawny brow at her.</p><p>She flushed with something between anger and shame. \u201cWe can. Like I said, this is happening awfully fast. I knocked on your door in Lafayette a handful of days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved you for years. You love me. I think you\u2019ve loved me for years, too. I\u2019m not letting anything come between us again. What else is there to know?\u201d</p><p>Del couldn\u2019t answer that. But she felt like her life was on fast-forward. She didn\u2019t know how to cope. The most prolific playboy she\u2019d ever met now talking about forever and babies and commitment just didn\u2019t compute when she was still rattled from danger and mind-bending sex.</p><p>\u201cJust . . . let me sleep on it, okay?\u201d</p><p>His face closed over. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hurt his feelings, and that hadn\u2019t been her intent. All she\u2019d needed was for him to slow down a bit and let her breathe.</p><p>On silent feet, she padded over to Tyler and wrapped her arms around him. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m not walking away again, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019d just come after you.\u201d He relaxed a bit and enfolded her into his embrace, placing a soft kiss on her mouth. \u201cTake a bath and get ready for bed. I\u2019ll see if I can find out if your phone has been traced and if there\u2019s anything new on Lobato Loco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cFor everything.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded, slapped on his jeans, and walked away.</p><p>DAMN it.</p><p>Tyler stomped into the office across the hall from the master bedroom, slammed the door shut, threw himself into his chair, and shoved his head in his hands.</p><p>Real smooth, fucktard. She got shot at tonight after finding out her ex-husband was cheating scum, and you want to make babies. Want to hunt for unicorns and rainbows next?</p><p>He was angry, not just at himself\u2014but at the fear that coursed through him. The last time Del had been sweet but distant after sex, he hadn\u2019t seen her again for two years. No fucking way would she get that far from him again. She was his now. Was always going to be his. Once all this shit with Carlson was over, she\u2019d stay his. There\u2019d be time for more babies then. Oh, and she\u2019d probably want to get married first. Duh! He probably should have mentioned that.</p><p>The \u201cM\u201d word that had once made him break out in shivers and hives now had him smiling. She\u2019d look gorgeous walking down the aisle toward him in white lace with Seth beside her and all their friends around him. Of course, he liked the picture better with her sporting a baby bump. Guess that made him a caveman after all.</p><p>Right now, he had to get his head out of his ass. He couldn\u2019t possibly hope for that future if he didn\u2019t untangle this danger. Despite the clock reading something like two in the morning, Tyler resolved to press on. There was a reason Lobato Loco hadn\u2019t shown up, and Tyler wanted to know why.</p><p>First, he had to solve the problem with Del\u2019s prepaid cell. Wincing, he called Jack. No doubt, his new boss would love the oh-dark-thirty wake-up call.</p><p>To his credit, Jack answered on the second ring and didn\u2019t sound remotely sleepy. \u201cTyler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shit is hitting the fan.\u201d Tyler explained what had happened at Desnuda.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of shit.\u201d Jack agreed with his assessment.</p><p>\u201cHow can I tell if Del\u2019s calls are being monitored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, and it doesn\u2019t matter. You need to dump that phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only number Lobato Loco has for Del,\u201d Tyler argued.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s either a traitor or he\u2019s dead. In either case, he\u2019s useless to you.\u201d</p><p>Tyler raked a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s going to kill her. We\u2019ve got nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXander\u2019s money trail is interesting, but inconclusive. It looks shady, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t prove a damn thing. I don\u2019t know where to turn. She needs something, Jack. She\u2019s a strong woman, but being away from Seth, being in this much danger, it\u2019s too much upheaval. It\u2019s killing her. I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so in love with this woman.\u201d Jack laughed. \u201cThe girls here are already planning a wedding, you know?\u201d</p><p>Despite the grim situation, Tyler smiled. \u201cTell them to make it sooner, rather than later. I don\u2019t want to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Get some sleep for now. Deke is supposed to have a follow-up with his guys in the FBI later today. Maybe they\u2019ve dredged something up. They sounded real eager to talk.\u201d</p><p>With that, Tyler disconnected the call. The computer hummed in front of him, and he opened the lid, checking some local sites and blogs to see if there were any news or warrants following the shooting at Desnuda.</p><p>The flash of Del\u2019s e-mail at the bottom of the screen caught his attention. She had a new message.</p><p>Jumping up, he found her soaking in the tub, looking frail and exhausted. But when she opened her eyes, the look inside them was fierce. She was totally committed to ending Carlson and\u2014he hoped\u2014getting on with their future.</p><p>\u201cYou have a new e-mail. You should come check it, just in case.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask questions or protest about being tired. Del just rose, water dripping from her body like some Venus. Inch after inch of creamy skin looked rosy, and he could see the marks of his possession on her body\u2014whisker burns, faint bruises, swollen nipples and mouth. She couldn\u2019t look more gorgeous, and all he wanted was to sink back into her body and love her again.</p><p>Adjusting himself in his jeans, Del watched with a raised brow. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he promised hoarsely.</p><p>A blush rushed up her cheeks as he helped her out of the tub. It took a lot of restraint to let Del cover herself. Right now, nailing Carlson was more important than nailing her. At least that\u2019s what he told his dick.</p><p>She tossed on a fluffy robe they\u2019d found on the back of the bathroom door, and Tyler took her hand. Together, they padded across the hall. Wordlessly, Del sank into the chair and concern crept across her face. As she put her fingers to the keyboard and accessed her mail, she looked tense, ready for flight. He cupped her shoulder in a show of silent support.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Preston,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBefore we read whatever he\u2019s said, we should know if he tried to go to the warehouse you misdirected him to.\u201d</p><p>Del sat back in her chair, leaving the e-mail closed and waiting. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I have to know whether I can trust him.\u201d</p><p>Tyler picked up his cell and called Xander again. God, as often as he\u2019d been reaching out, the asshole was likely going to think it was either a joke or a come-on.</p><p>Xander answered, panting. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Something laced his voice, not sleep. Not exhaustion. Something happier, something\u2014 Shit, it was satisfaction. \u201cAm I interrupting something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got lousy fucking timing.\u201d</p><p>Tyler winced and paced across the room. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do if you\u2019re dying, right? Spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone try to hit your warehouse tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he ground out. \u201cNot even a mouse stepped foot on the premises. I looked into it before I . . . settled in for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe anyone we know?\u201d</p><p>Xander laughed. \u201cWell, let\u2019s say now I know what\u2019s under the red scarf and thong.\u201d</p><p>Tyler couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cThanks, man. Um, carry on.\u201d</p><p>Xander didn\u2019t even bother to reply, just hung up.</p><p>Tyler set his phone down and turned to Del. \u201cLooks like Preston might be in the clear. It\u2019s not one hundred percent . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is,\u201d Del agreed. \u201cBut if he\u2019d been working for Carlson and had a supposed lead on our location, I think he\u2019d have followed it up quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially after everything went south at Desnuda.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Del opened the e-mail. Her gaze flew across the screen, her eyes getting wider and wider until she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tyler demanded, his gut clenching.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Lobato Loco is dead\u2014at the hands of his own gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tyler scowled, then demanded. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreston says that after he finished answering questions for the police about Lisa\u2019s murder and identifying her body, they dropped him off at the office so he could get his car and go home. On the office\u2019s stoop, he found a box and a note that proclaimed Lobato Loco a rata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rat. Okay, but why do you think he\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u201d\u2014her voice trembled\u2014\u201cthey sent the note along with his head.\u201d</p><p>The bottom dropped out of Tyler\u2019s stomach. Del looked pale as a sheet, and when she looked up at him, eyes frightened and mouth trembling, he nearly jumped over the desk to take her into his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTyler . . .\u201d She looked so damn scared that it broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cShh, angel. We knew they were terrible bastards. We\u2019re still here alive, still safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut for how long? He\u2019s not going to stop coming after me, and I have no evidence to expose him. I can\u2019t keep running forever.\u201d</p><p>Thoughts buzzed through Tyler\u2019s brain. He wanted this fucking bastard gutted. Carlson needed a hole in his skull, and Tyler wanted to spit in it before he fed the son of a bitch to the fish. It went against his every instinct to give up. But he\u2019d been a cop. Del was a mom, a reporter. She had no experience with this relentless danger, and it was wearing her down.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to, we can. You, me, and Seth can go someplace totally new. Jack will help us change our identities. We can get married, start a totally new life. Carlson will be looking for a single mom, not a family. He\u2019ll never think to look for us in BFE, Oklahoma, or wherever you want to go.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, looking up at him through wet lashes. \u201cYou\u2019d do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive up . . . everything. Your job, your friends, your past and future?\u201d</p><p>His offer surprised her? He grabbed her arms and dragged her body against him. \u201cAngel, I\u2019d do anything for you. When are you going to get that?\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth opened like she wanted to say something, but the silence dragged on. Instead, she threw herself into his arms and clung.</p><p>Del needed an anchor, and Tyler was not only happy to oblige, he was thrilled. She was leaning on him, trusting him\u2014coming to him and needing him.</p><p>More tears fell as she looked at him, and the love on her face made his heart go boom. Jack was right; he was so in love with this woman, he\u2019d never recover. And he never wanted to.</p><p>Moments later, her hands were at his zipper, and his jeans were sliding down his hips. He hadn\u2019t bothered with a shirt, figuring he\u2019d just be going to bed.</p><p>He kicked his pants away and looked up in time to see Del peel the robe off her shoulders, leaving her to stand alabaster perfect by the room\u2019s faint light. Her eyes looked feral, hungry, and so needy.</p><p>Craving torqued in Tyler\u2019s chest, and his cock stood up, harder than it had been all night. Del didn\u2019t gently layer her mouth over his, but attacked it, urgently forcing his lips apart and running inside. She moaned, not merely like she liked kissing him, but like he was vital\u2014her shelter from the storm. He wanted to be that and more for her.</p> <p>Del stunned him when she shoved him back into the desk chair and mounted him in a flash, legs straddling his hips. The head of his cock flared against her entrance, and he felt her soft flesh, already wet, grasping and clenching above him.</p><p>Fuck, he wanted her so badly, he couldn\u2019t breathe. But he felt compelled to point something out. \u201cAngel, no condom.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him completely, sinking down on his shaft with a long moan that ripped into Tyler\u2019s self-control. Still, he held off. In Del\u2019s head, this wasn\u2019t about forever or babies or anything other than needing to feel safe and alive. He had to relax and let her ease the terror bubbling inside of her. If that was sex . . . well, he wasn\u2019t going to complain.</p><p>And if she sported that baby bump before the wedding, he\u2019d just grin.</p><p>Tyler grabbed her hips. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She gyrated on him frequently. \u201cJust you. Please. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard and fast.\u201d</p> <p>She was really asking him to make her forget, even for a while, that everyone around her was dying. Tyler was happy to oblige. He pressed his cock deep into her. \u201cTake me, angel. All of me.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, she nodded frantically as he filled her again. And again. And again.</p><p>Fuck, the friction was almost a burn. Deep, so tight. The pleasure seared, not just because her pussy gloved him so perfectly but because Del needed him. Because she wasn\u2019t just opening her body to him. This was love. This was trust. He\u2019d never gotten off on those things before, but with every pump of his cock into her body, he could feel her giving way, giving herself over to him. Giving him everything.</p><p>He was going to come.</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d Her muscles around him began to ripple, and she increased the pace of her thrusts. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>An invitation to totally let go and give her everything in return. No way was he turning that down.</p><p>Tyler gripped her hips even tighter and unleashed the blazing ache in his cock, now tingling at the base of his spine. He shoved all the emotion choking his throat and clogging his chest into the kiss he seized her lips with. He filled her in every way he could in that moment, and when she shouted into his mouth, he gave over the last of his control again and flooded her deep with his seed.</p><p>God, he couldn\u2019t love her more.</p><p>He lifted his head and brushed her damp tendrils away from her face. \u201cAngel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything now. We have a lot to sort out, especially if I get pregnant again. I know what I said earlier, but I needed to feel you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cAnd I need a goddamn plan. Two people have died simply for coming into contact with me. I won\u2019t be the cause of any more murders. Let\u2019s put a stop to this now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>DEL awakened the following morning wrapped up in Tyler\u2019s warm embrace, tangled in the soft blankets of the big bed they shared. And the damn ringing of her disposable cell phone.</p><p>She opened an eye and realized the sun had risen, but it was still fairly early. The clock confirmed that it was just minutes past eight a.m. Who would be calling her little throwaway phone? She\u2019d given the number to no one. Nearly everyone she\u2019d ever called with the number was dead. Unless Carlson himself was calling her. The possibility chilled her.</p><p>Scrambling out of bed and across the room, she grabbed the phone off the dresser, pressing the speakerphone button so Tyler could hear, too. Just in case. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDel? It\u2019s Eric.\u201d</p><p>Oh shit! She\u2019d forgotten that she\u2019d called her ex-husband on this phone. He might not be her favorite person in the world, but she wouldn\u2019t wish the sort of death on him that Lisa or Lobato Loco had experienced. Despite all the sunshine and warmth in the room, she shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk to me on this number. It\u2019s been compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be quick, and if something happens, I can defend myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not risk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have your flash drive,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cI want to talk to you about what\u2019s on it.\u201d</p><p>Del froze for a long moment, then her heart began to pound. Eric had her evidence. If she could recover it, she\u2019d have a jumping-off point for saving herself and Seth. This nightmare might actually come to an end. Then she frowned. \u201cHow did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything when you get here.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she felt Tyler\u2019s heat at her back, heard his breathing in her ear. Del turned at his grip on her elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going there again,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we meet for breakfast somewhere?\u201d Del suggested. \u201cIs that little omelet place around the corner from the house still open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know that what\u2019s on this flash drive shouldn\u2019t be discussed in public. It needs to stay as hidden and safe as possible.\u201d</p><p>Eric made a valid point, but Del wasn\u2019t about to give in. \u201cRemember what happened the last time I came to the house? I\u2019m not in a hurry to repeat the experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was an ass, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cI won\u2019t touch you. I give you my word. But if you want this back, I want to talk to you first, make sure you know what the fuck you\u2019re getting yourself into. Ten o\u2019clock, sharp.\u201d</p><p>Del opened her mouth to argue with him when she realized Eric had hung up. She punched the END button on her phone with a curse. \u201cBastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you going over there.\u201d Tyler had no compunction about voicing his opinion. \u201cNo fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I want the flash drive back, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say that you had to go alone.\u201d</p><p>Del pondered that statement. She\u2019d feel personally safer taking Tyler, but Eric seemed to have a lot more animosity toward his ex-friend than his ex-wife. If Tyler hadn\u2019t been there last time, Eric would have yelled and made his point, but she doubted he\u2019d have touched her against her will. That whole show had been for Tyler\u2019s benefit. Was bringing Tyler this time like bringing a powder keg to a roomful of sparks?</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, no.\u201d Tyler shook his head and crossed his beefy arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m going. That\u2019s final.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need that flash drive, and I suspect that you\u2019d just make a bad situation worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Tyler muttered, then raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him. If you go without me, that leaves you vulnerable. He\u2019s got a plan. There\u2019s some reason he\u2019s giving you the flash drive now. He\u2019s got a price in mind, and I\u2019m pretty sure I know what it is. No.\u201d</p><p>Del caught onto his insinuation. \u201cYou think he\u2019s going to want me to have sex with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf touching you would hurt you, I think he\u2019d be fine with that. If it will hurt me, even better. And he knows it would eat me up inside.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, Del had to admit there might be a kernel of truth there. \u201cBut if I bring you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go in, guns ready. I won\u2019t go ape shit sitting in this house or some car down the street, wondering if you\u2019re safe.\u201d Tyler paced the room. \u201cBut something about this whole situation isn\u2019t adding up. Where has the flash drive been since we asked for it? Why did he read it? He says he wants to turn it over, but what\u2019s in it for him?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered some of the same things. Eric was generally the sort of person who didn\u2019t do anything without some personal benefit, and hanging on to the flash drive for a few days so he could read it, just to give it back, didn\u2019t make a lot of sense.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s read it and thought about it, he\u2019s had it for a while.\u201d Her gut instinct was telling her that.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Maybe he had it all along. Was that break-in even real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a cover story? I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he try to cover up the fact that he had the flash drive?\u201d Tyler mused. \u201cTo get more time with it? See what you\u2019re into?\u201d</p><p>That was the logical explanation, but why? Del wondered if there was more to it. She tried to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. How would he have found out that she\u2019d kept the flash drive there? If he\u2019d had it for weeks, he wouldn\u2019t have needed to hang on to it. So he\u2019d just recently found it. What had made him go looking for it? When they\u2019d spoken on the phone before going over there, she hadn\u2019t told him what she was looking for. The only people she\u2019d told were Tyler and Lisa. Tyler would never tell anyone. Lisa . . . had probably blabbed to Carlson for thirty thousand dollars. Which meant . . .</p><p>\u201cEric is in bed with Carlson,\u201d Tyler proclaimed into her silence.</p><p>\u201cI was just coming to the same conclusion.\u201d Her voice shook. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>If her ex-husband would really sell her out to someone so ruthless, was she walking into a trap? Would he even blink when they killed her? Eric was a cop, damn it. Wouldn\u2019t he protect her? Maybe not. He\u2019d done nothing when Lisa and Lobato Loco had been viciously murdered. What did it matter to him if his ex-wife, who was in love with his former best friend, got the ax, too? And Eric hadn\u2019t told Tyler not to come. In fact, he had to know that Tyler would accompany her. What was that rat bastard hoping for, a twofer in the murder department today?</p><p>Something inside her crumbled. She\u2019d once loved that man. Hadn\u2019t the frequent cheating been enough for him? Or did he think that she and Tyler deserved to die because the sex they\u2019d shared two years ago had resulted in a beautiful little boy? Because it had meant something to them and they\u2019d fallen in love?</p><p>\u201cI think he intends for both of us to die,\u201d Del said solemnly. \u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the first person you talked to with your disposable cell, yet the only one who isn\u2019t dead. He suddenly found the flash drive . . . None of this shit adds up. We\u2019ve said that Carlson has to have dirty cops to make this work. I guess that means dirty Vice detectives, too.\u201d</p><p>Tyler would probably be furious for asking, but she had to know. \u201cAnd you knew nothing about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, no!\u201d he exploded. \u201cToward the end of our partnership, Eric acted oddly at times, and I clearly should have asked more questions. But I didn\u2019t know anything. I may have bed hopped a lot back then, but I would never have allowed that corrupt shit. And I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t line my own pockets to let criminals get away with drug dealing and murder. You know me better than that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. I thought I knew Eric, too,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Dragging a hand down his face, Tyler sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be really confused, angel. But I swear to God, I would never accept money from a slime like that. And I\u2019d never let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>Tyler took her in his arms, clutching her tightly, and Del didn\u2019t resist. She needed an anchor in this storm of lies, deceit, and intrigue. And he was perfect\u2014solid, supportive, unwavering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie and say I love it, but I understand feeling burned by people you trusted. The question is, what do we do now? If Eric is on the take from Carlson, we have to expect that he\u2019s sold us out. This is going to be dangerous. And before you say a word, you aren\u2019t going to Eric\u2019s alone.\u201d</p><p>As much as Del wanted Tyler removed from danger, she had to think of Seth. He needed parents. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of leaving her baby all alone, and the odds would more likely be in their favor if she took Tyler along.</p><p>\u201cAll right. But we\u2019re going to need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Tyler nodded. \u201cWe can\u2019t contact the police for help. They\u2019re either going to be corrupt, Eric\u2019s buddies, or both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we have no evidence to prove our suspicions yet, so . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to come up with a plan B. I\u2019ll use the computer to call back to Lafayette. Take my phone and call Xander. Get whatever resources you can. I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>With a solemn nod, she grabbed his phone and meandered toward the kitchen. She wasn\u2019t hungry, but they\u2019d both need strength for the trial to come. She tried to push aside the betrayal making her chest tighten and ache. How could the son of a bitch who had once promised to love, honor, and protect her turn her over to the man who would celebrate her murder?</p><p>Shoving the thought away, Del called Xander. He picked up right away. \u201cThis had better be good.\u201d</p><p>She winced at his growl. \u201cMy ex called. We\u2019re supposed to be at his house at ten. I think we\u2019re the lambs he\u2019s leading to slaughter. And we can\u2019t call the police. You must have bodyguards or something. Would you be willing to lend them to us for a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all suck ass. I escape them constantly, except one. Expect a knock on your door from Decker McConnell in less than an hour. Former Special Forces who went to work as a field agent for the CIA. Deep cover. Tough bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to talk to him first?\u201d She frowned.</p> <p>\u201cI pay him to be ready at a moment\u2019s notice. Sit tight. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. Please don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>Tyler strolled into the room, and Del turned, frustration shredding her composure. \u201cThe bastard hung up on me. He\u2019s sending a guy, and as soon as I tried to point out to Xander that it wasn\u2019t safe for him to come along, too, he hung up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s just as well. Jack and Deke said it might take a couple of hours to track down some of their former army buddies who live in this area. By then, this is over.\u201d</p><p>Yes. And Del hoped this meeting didn\u2019t become a bloodbath.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve also called some connections at the FBI.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cMaybe something will pop there. C\u2019mon, angel. Let\u2019s shower and get ready to do this.\u201d</p><p>Del dug in her heels. \u201cI have to talk to Seth again . . . Just in case.\u201d</p> <p>She shoved back tears and regarded Tyler with an unflinching stare.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to Eric\u2019s. I\u2019ll go alone. I\u2019ll tell him that he scared the hell out of you last time you came by and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to get my evidence back if I want a future. He wants to talk to me, and I know he\u2019s not going to hand it over until I do. Just let me talk to my son one last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur son.\u201d Tyler led her across the hall to the spacious office and the computer.</p><p>She sent him a sad smile. \u201cI\u2019m not used to that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet used to it.\u201d</p><p>As Tyler sat at the computer and initiated the online video call, she whispered, \u201cI\u2019d like to. Right now, I can\u2019t help fearing this is the last time Seth will see me and that he won\u2019t remember me if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence. You are not going to die, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Del pressed her lips together. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that for certain. Eric might be leading us right into a trap. We can only do the right things and hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Luc said casually into the computer. \u201cAll okay there?\u201d</p><p>She exchanged a glance with Tyler, who said, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she corrected. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Seth.\u201d</p><p>Luc went on alert. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tyler cursed under his breath, then sighed. \u201cJack\u2019s got the details. I think this thing is coming to a head this morning.\u201d</p><p>Del watched as understanding, then quiet acceptance, dawned across Luc\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Seth. Earlier this morning, he saw Caleb take a stuffed animal from Chloe. When she started crying, Seth grabbed it away, handed it back to her, then pushed Caleb on his ass.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like her little boy. A moment later, his smiling baby face filled the screen. She tried not to cry, but she was so proud of him, already exhibiting such strong qualities\u2014intelligence, a sense of fairness, a willingness to defend those weaker than him. She only hoped that if things didn\u2019t go well today he eventually understood her decisions.</p><p>\u201cHi, little man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa ma ma.\u201d He lunged forward and reached out for the screen.</p><p>A pang of love welled up, filled her, mixed with longing and pain. A sob racked her body, and Tyler\u2019s arm went around her immediately. She sucked the tears back. Being strong for Seth now was imperative.</p><p>\u201cHi, Seth,\u201d Tyler said into the webcam. \u201cHow\u2019s our big boy today?\u201d</p><p>He gurgled and reached for the screen again. Luc held him back with a big hand across his little belly.</p><p>\u201cThis kid is strong,\u201d Luc commented. \u201cHe likes spinach, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sweet potatoes.\u201d</p><p>Luc grinned. \u201cDid you know he loves Cheetos? He ate nearly a whole bag of Chloe\u2019s little munchies when he was supposed to be napping. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he crawled out of the playpen and remembered where we\u2019d stored the stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tyler smiled like he was proud. \u201cSounds like something I would have done at his age.\u201d</p><p>It did. Del grabbed his hand. Then she realized there wasn\u2019t much left to say. \u201cKiss him for me, please.\u201d</p><p>Luc nodded. He looked like he wanted to tell her that everything was going to be okay, but no one could assure her of that. He simply nodded and placed a soft kiss in Seth\u2019s pale hair, patting his little shoulder. \u201cHe knows that you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I love him, too,\u201d Tyler asked, then swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to update everyone when I can. If you haven\u2019t heard from us by four o\u2019clock your time . . .\u201d</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t finish that sentence. He didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>With a nod, Luc wrapped protective arms around Seth. \u201cAnything else I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray.\u201d Del\u2019s voice trembled.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Then Luc looked at Tyler. \u201cTake care of you and yours.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Luc was gone. After the screen went blank, Del desperately wanted to collapse into Tyler\u2019s arms. But now wasn\u2019t the time. They had barely over an hour to get ready, plan, and cross town.</p><p>Stiffly, she rose and made her way across the hall, into the bathroom. When she started the shower and pulled off her clothes, shivering, Tyler eased into the bathroom behind her and pulled her against the solid warmth of his body. He was naked, too, and every inch of his hard frame blanketed her back.</p><p>Threading his arm around her waist, he kissed the top of her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this together, angel.\u201d</p><p>Having him close was such a comfort. Funny how a few short days ago she was certain that Tyler would be another drive-by in her life. She\u2019d drop Seth off, solve all this herself, then pop back in and pick up her son, no muss, no fuss\u2014and above all, no emotions. Now, she couldn\u2019t imagine facing this danger without him. By herself, she wasn\u2019t sure she had any chance to survive. Tyler would move heaven and earth to keep her safe.</p><p>Delaney more than loved Tyler Murphy; she\u2019d wrapped her heart, soul, and life around his so quickly. Even with this black cloud hanging over them, she relished the feeling of connection to the one man she\u2019d never forgotten.</p><p>She opened the shower door and eased in. Tyler climbed in right behind her. Wordlessly, they embraced under the spray, a long moment filled with warm water, beating hearts, and utter stillness. They were saying good-bye to one another, just in case the worst happened. No words necessary. They both knew. They both felt the solemn moment and didn\u2019t spoil it with chatter.</p><p>A moment later, Del backed against the cold tile wall and held out her arms to Tyler. He came to her silently. Maybe the look in her eyes told him what she needed. He just nodded and lifted her, holding her thighs over his arms and bracing her against the wall. With steam rising from the hot spray and their deep breaths filling the space, Tyler probed her pussy with the blunt tip of his cock. The moment he found her open and slick, he pushed her down, surging up into her tight walls.</p><p>One thrust became another, then a dozen, then she lost count. The only thing she knew was Tyler\u2019s deep penetration, the burn of his flesh against her already sore sex, but she welcomed the sensation. It reminded her that she was alive, could hurt and need. It reminded her that she could feel.</p><p>Del wrapped her legs around his hips and used whatever leverage she could to wriggle and bounce. Her nails dug into his shoulders. Her mouth found his, slanting over that hard slash to invade and silently tell him that she\u2019d never wanted anything or anyone more than she wanted him.</p><p>His thick fingers dug into her hips, and the sensations spiraled. A heavy ache settled behind her clit, mixing with the pleasure-pain of his possession, scraping up her swollen channel and the friction of his flesh rubbing her little bundle of nerves repeatedly. It was too much\u2014the pleasure, the love, the need to experience this moment to the fullest. Del crested over the edge, careening into a dizzying ecstasy that made her cry his name, into a significant love that utterly reshaped her.</p><p>With a long, low groan in her ear, he followed her into pleasure, and she felt the warm spray of his semen jet deep inside of her. Del closed her eyes. She hoped she lived long enough to find out if all the unprotected sex they\u2019d had in the last twenty-four hours brought them another bundle of joy. It had only taken once before, and suddenly she wanted to have Tyler\u2019s child again, experience everything from morning sickness to college graduation with him.</p><p>Slowly, Tyler disentangled himself from her and placed a reverent kiss on her shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s clean you up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but every time she reached for the soap or loofah, he slapped her hands out of the way and washed her himself. Long, soft sweeps of his palms over her abdomen, lingering low where he felt the few stretch marks she\u2019d gotten from carrying Seth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you were so pretty pregnant. I wish I\u2019d seen it.\u201d</p><p>Del wished he had, too. She wished she could have both shared the experience with him and had someone to lean on. But rather than dwell on what she couldn\u2019t change, she tried to lighten the mood. \u201cOnly if you like a beached whale.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was so green and intent, it almost hurt, especially when that look admonished her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, no matter what. To me, you always have been.\u201d</p><p>Probably not 100 percent accurate, but Del smiled at his kindness. Then he set her under the spray. With the utmost care, he proceeded to wash her hair, his strong fingers rubbing her scalp, easing away last night\u2019s grime and a bit of this morning\u2019s tension. Del melted against him.</p><p>\u201cHave you always been like this with lovers?\u201d Because that wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d heard it.</p><p>He paused. \u201cI didn\u2019t act like I cared about any of the other women because I didn\u2019t. It took me doing without you for two years to realize how much I loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been numb for two years. I feel like I\u2019m finally alive again because of you. Even if today doesn\u2019t end well, I want you to know how much that means to me.\u201d</p><p>Finally, they couldn\u2019t stall anymore and left the shower, drying slowly, both lost in thought. Tyler pulled his clothes on first, just as someone pounded on the front door.</p><p>\u201cShowtime,\u201d he sighed. Then he pressed a kiss to her forehead, grabbed one of the guns Xander had given him the night before, and headed to the front of the house.</p><p>Del put on the rest of her clothes with trembling fingers. By tonight, she\u2019d either be a free woman or dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>TYLER wrenched open the estate\u2019s heavy front door. Xander stood wearing something clearly GQ and designer, looking perfectly unconcerned and unruffled. Behind him, a big motherfucker straight out of a Rambo-esque movie stood as still as a statue, black hair military cut, blue eyes scanning his surroundings, on the lookout for any sign of trouble.</p><p>Xander looked Tyler over with a critical eye. \u201cNice. You\u2019re going to a major sting wearing a T-shirt that says \u2018Cops have bigger guns.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m probably going to end the day killing someone if I\u2019m not killed myself. So I don\u2019t really give a shit if I meet with your fashion approval.\u201d Tyler stepped back.</p><p>Xander and the stranger entered the house, the former looking around for Del, the latter just looking for threats.</p> <p>\u201cDel okay?\u201d Xander asked, staring down the hall.</p><p>\u201cAlmost ready. She\u2019s nervous.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Xander strolled into the living room. \u201cUnderstandable. How\u2019s she going to hold up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll come through. Del is tough.\u201d Tyler would bank on that.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Xander turned to the big guy behind him. \u201cThis is Decker McConnell. I told Del about him on the phone. I\u2019d give you a full list of his credentials, but then I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler stared at the soldier. He looked like he\u2019d seen his fair share of action. \u201cYou packing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen combat or been in a firefight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, on four continents.\u201d McConnell had a voice that sounded more like a deep rattle of gravel. Under that neck-to-toe black and Kevlar, he likely had more than a few nasty scars.</p><p>\u201cHand-to-hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack belt in three martial arts, former military boxing and wrestling champion.\u201d</p> <p>Impressive. \u201cNervous? You seem jumpy.\u201d</p><p>McConnell cut cold eyes over to him. \u201cAnxious to stop the fucking pillow talk and get on with the action.\u201d</p><p>Tyler heard that. He looked back at Xander. \u201cYeah, he works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the vote of confidence,\u201d McConnell said like he didn\u2019t give a shit. \u201cYou got a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go in with Del. We need to have some sort of recorder. Plan A is that Eric gives us the flash drive and we go away. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. I believe Eric is dirty as hell, and I\u2019m expecting company. I want to catch anything he might say on audio or video and see if we can use it to build a case against Carlson. If you can sneak into the house and watch our backs, our chances of survival go up immensely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you\u2019d say something like that,\u201d Xander drawled. \u201cHi, Del.\u201d</p><p>Tyler turned to see her coming down the hall. She wore jeans and her gray tank top, a pair of sneakers, almost no makeup. She still managed to look stunning. He turned back to the other men. Xander wore a comforting smile, one Tyler hadn\u2019t believed the bastard had in him. McConnell looked at her with a seemingly flat stare, but Tyler sensed the guy\u2019s interest. It didn\u2019t set well with him.</p><p>It was probably high school of him, but he brought Del close and threw his arm around her waist. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated, then nodded. \u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>Damn, she looked nervous. Tyler swore he\u2019d do whatever it took to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something that might help you, Del.\u201d Xander turned and looked expectantly at McConnell, who shrugged a black backpack off his meaty shoulders and foraged inside until he withdrew a gorgeous buttery leather Coach bag.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Del\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI saw that bag in a catalog. It was ridiculously expensive. You can\u2019t keep giving me gifts.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance curled through Tyler\u2019s gut. \u201cShe\u2019s taken, shithead.\u201d</p><p>Xander rolled his eyes. \u201cSuch a caveman.\u201d He faced Del and explained, \u201cIt\u2019s special. I bought it and had it outfitted with the tiniest surveillance camera the technology division of S.I. Industries, my corporation, makes. It\u2019s installed in one of the grommets. See?\u201d</p><p>When he pointed to one of the purse\u2019s studs, Del leaned down and stared. Tyler did the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything.\u201d Del sounded confused.</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d Xander beamed like a kid who\u2019d put one over on his teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s got a tiny wireless transmitter sewn into the lining. It\u2019s almost a real-time feed of whatever you\u2019re filming to my laptop. If Eric or anyone else says anything incriminating, it\u2019s going to be captured on film instantly.\u201d</p><p>Del reached out and took the satchel-style bag in her grasp. \u201cWhich way do I need to point it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you keep this side pointed away from your body, you\u2019re good.\u201d Xander pointed to the purse\u2019s side with the Coach insignia mounted.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t like any of this, but as much as he hated to admit it, Xander had a good idea.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d the billionaire asked.</p><p>Del looked Tyler\u2019s way, and he would have given anything to take that look of fear from her face. Instead, she just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou take the Audi in the garage,\u201d Xander instructed. \u201cI\u2019ll ride with McConnell in the black SUV we brought.\u201d</p><p>Another good call. \u201cThat way if Eric is watching, he doesn\u2019t see uninvited people in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They all hopped in their respective cars, and Tyler tried to ignore the silence, so thick with tension. Instead, he held her hand and ran the plan through his head over and over, looking for any way in which this day didn\u2019t end without him killing Eric or Eric killing him. So far, he hadn\u2019t been able to find one.</p><p>A few minutes before ten, they entered Eric\u2019s kitschy little neighborhood. Del grew visibly more nervous, and Tyler squeezed her hand. \u201cAngel, you\u2019re going to have to calm down. Eric will take one look at you and know that something is up.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a deep breath and shook her head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Tyler parked the car just past Eric\u2019s house, where no one could watch them through the windows. \u201cAll you have to do is keep your wits about you and that purse pointed toward Eric. Ask him a few leading questions. I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s not alone?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Tyler suspected they could be walking into a den of killers, bent on shooting them right between the eyes in the first thirty seconds. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got an idea. You let me worry about that, okay?\u201d</p><p>Del nodded. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>Finally, it was ten o\u2019clock on the nose. Tyler opened the car door and emerged into the sunny Southern California morning. On the passenger\u2019s side, Del did the same. They crossed the street, and Del rang the doorbell.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>ERIC cracked the door a few seconds later, and Tyler, standing in the shadowed corner of the porch, watched, his gut tightening. His former friend looked Del up and down, but there was something in his eyes. Eric was tense. Tyler frowned. If he only wanted to return Del\u2019s flash drive, why would he be nervous?</p><p>Unless, as he and Del had feared, Eric wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s blood began to run cold. He reached for the Glock tucked into his waistband and stepped forward. Eric sent him a nearly imperceptible shake of his head, then peeled his right hand away from the doorframe and brushed his fingers across his ear.</p><p>The gesture had been one they\u2019d worked out long ago, when they\u2019d first become partners. It was their silent signal for \u201cget backup!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, Del.\u201d Eric grabbed her arm and began to draw her inside.</p><p>No fucking way was the asshole who\u2019d cheated on her and nearly raped her going to take her inside the house alone with danger afoot. Tyler was ready to throw down to keep Del outside, where she might have a chance of surviving. Once she went in and that door shut behind her, Tyler didn\u2019t know how much he\u2019d be able to help her.</p><p>Eric sent him a pleading stare, his face so tense, body rigid.</p><p>Del turned back to him, and Tyler felt her hand on his chest. The gesture silently asked him to stay away, begged him to keep silent so he didn\u2019t alert whoever waited in the house to his presence.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s mind raced. If he went in with her, they\u2019d train guns on him and strip him of his weapons. He had to get his emotions under control. As much as he hated it, if he stayed outside, he had a better chance of helping Del. He and McConnell could take the stealth approach and blindside these motherfuckers.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens to her, you\u2019re a dead man,\u201d Tyler murmured.</p><p>Eric nodded just enough for Tyler to see the acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cHi, Eric,\u201d Del said almost too brightly. \u201cYou have my flash drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, come in.\u201d Eric opened the door for Del to enter, then shut it in his face.</p><p>Tyler waited to hear him engage the dead bolt. Eric never did.</p><p>Hmm. The paranoid bastard had never failed to lock doors and windows. Ever.</p><p>With his heart pounding furiously, Tyler slinked along the shadows of the porch and overhang, until he reached a row of hedges that separated Eric\u2019s driveway from the neighbor\u2019s. He crawled through them, then emerged to sprint over to the black SUV parked across and down the street. As he approached, Xander lowered the window.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Tyler looked at McConnell, not bothering with pleasantries. \u201cEric took her in the house. He\u2019s got company. The front door is unlocked, but knowing Eric, his \u2018company\u2019 is hanging out in that part of the house. There\u2019s a back door and a bedroom window we may be able to crawl through. Since he tipped me off, I\u2019m hoping he was smart enough to unlock them. We\u2019ll have to sneak our way in and eliminate whoever\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealth and killing, my favorite kind of mission.\u201d McConnell let himself out of the SUV, now carrying an M4 carbine assault rifle. Tyler could almost bet the big guy was loaded to the gills with other weaponry. But Tyler was prepared, too\u2014a couple of Glocks, a wicked knife, a grenade, if necessary. If Carlson had the balls to show up to this meeting, it could only mean that he wanted Del dead. If that was the case, no way was the fucker getting out of this alive.</p><p>Together, he and McConnell made their way across the street, avoiding the view from Eric\u2019s windows, just in case. They crawled along the far side of the house, then leapt the cinder-block fence. Almost soundlessly, they landed in the side yard, where there was nothing except an air-conditioning unit already chugging away against the day\u2019s promised heat.</p><p>Without a sound, Tyler pointed toward the back of the house. They ducked under the windows to avoid being seen by anyone who might happen to be in the bathroom or back bedroom. Plastered against the back wall, he directed McConnell to the French doors on their left. Then he pointed to himself and the bedroom window back to the right.</p><p>With a terse nod, McConnell began to prowl away. Tyler grabbed his arm. \u201cNo matter what, you save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But get your dick out of your pants or this rescue will be a fucktastic disaster,\u201d he growled, pulled free, and edged toward the patio doors.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Tyler crept toward the window and began easing it open. Eric had definitely prepared in advance for company and unlocked it. Did that automatically mean Eric was on his side? Or just that he was anticipating another way to trap his ex-partner. After all, if someone was as dirty as Eric, what was a little murder among enemies?</p><p>A quick glance down the little flagstone patio proved that McConnell had already made his way inside without incident. Tyler crawled inside the sloppy but unoccupied bedroom. The door was ajar, but he didn\u2019t see anyone lying in wait for him in the hallway, either. What the fuck was Eric up to?</p><p>Prowling through the house, Tyler focused on disposing of any bad guys and watching for treachery. He had to hope they weren\u2019t too late to save Del.</p><p>ERIC led her inside, through the foyer, then into the living room. Immediately, she saw a gangbanger with a big gun\u2014and her blood turned to ice. Eric had set her up to come here and discouraged Tyler from entering with her. To remove her protection or give Tyler time to mount a stealth attack? Del didn\u2019t know. That terrified her. So did trusting her ex-husband.</p><p>The thug promptly patted her down, lingering a little too long over her breasts. He wasn\u2019t big, but the gang tattoos and AK-47 made her take him really seriously. She saw two more similar goons at the back of the living room, one leaning against the wall separating the living room from the kitchen. The other lingered at the entrance to the hallway. She recognized him from photos as Double T, the leader of the 18th Street gang.</p><p>And on the sofa, just as comfortable as if he was at home, sat Carlson in a charcoal gray suit with a pristine white shirt. His salt-and-pepper hair looked perfect. He wore a cat-who-ate-the-canary smile. Fresh terror gripped her belly.</p><p>She whipped a furious glare up at Eric.</p><p>He didn\u2019t flinch, and she wondered if trusting him would turn out to be her fatal mistake. For a second, she closed her eyes and said a prayer for Tyler. She was at peace with the fact that, if she wasn\u2019t here to be a mother to Seth, he would see to their son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHello, Ms. Catalano. Or do you prefer your maiden name now that you and the good detective here are divorced?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d retained her married name for her byline, since her readers knew that. For legal purposes, she\u2019d gone back to her maiden name so she would match Seth. She doubted, however, that Carlson really wanted that scoop. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he agreed amicably.</p><p>\u201cPeople know exactly where I am, so if anything happens to me, there will be questions and folks all up your ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I have the good detective on my side. He can make so many things go away and, over the years, has proven remarkably apt.\u201d</p><p>Eric had been dirty. For years? Del turned to Eric, betrayal bleeding through her all over again. He refused to meet her gaze.</p><p>Over the last two years, he\u2019d shocked her. Rejecting her, cheating on her, dismissing her when she discovered that she was pregnant. She\u2019d never imagined that he was the sort of cop who\u2019d not only turn the other cheek at crime but facilitate it. His new betrayal kicked her in the gut.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, what possessed you to go on this witch hunt for me?\u201d Carlson drawled, like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world. \u201cI\u2019m just a public servant doing my job.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYeah, unless it interferes with you taking bribes on the side. The public shouldn\u2019t be made to accept more gang and drug crime just because you want a fatter wallet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t prove any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I think I can,\u201d she bluffed. \u201cI talked to Lobato Loco in depth before you had him killed. He told me everything.\u201d</p><p>Carlson exchanged a quick glance with the thug leaning against the kitchen wall, then recovered his smile. \u201cIt\u2019s the word of a dead criminal against mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had audio recordings of some incriminating phone calls,\u201d Del lied. She had to because she couldn\u2019t think of another way to get him to talk enough about the incident to incriminate himself. If he did, Xander\u2019s purse camera would record everything.</p><p>The ADA\u2019s face changed instantly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about your deal. You lay off the 18th Street gang, and they give you kickbacks from their drug trade. Lobato Loco gave me some recordings outlining the details before you had his head chopped off. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? If that\u2019s true, why haven\u2019t you written the story yet? Why are you here, desperate to retrieve your flash drive?\u201d he smiled smugly.</p><p>\u201cWho says I haven\u2019t written the story?\u201d She raised a brow. \u201cMaybe it simply hasn\u2019t run yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re bluffing. I don\u2019t think you can prove anything.\u201d</p><p>Del shrugged, feigning a confidence she didn\u2019t feel. \u201cEven the hint of this kind of scandal would be really bad for someone on the fast track to becoming DA. There could be a lot of questions asked, maybe an investigation . . .\u201d</p><p>Carlson hesitated, clearly stifling his anger. He tapped the toe of his expensive Italian leather loafers against Eric\u2019s hardwood floor. \u201cThis is all nonsense. I\u2019m sure we can work something out.\u201d</p><p>Del wanted to spit in his face and tell him that she\u2019d never compromise with a skeevy bastard like him. But with three armed goons watching her every move, that wasn\u2019t her wisest course of action. Besides, she not only wanted to prove Carlson\u2019s guilt, she wanted to walk out of this house alive. Pretending to cooperate would help.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop this ridiculous witch hunt, and I\u2019ll make it worth your while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d she drawled. \u201cHow will you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll surprise you.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou already did. You blew up my car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not aware of that.\u201d But his too-innocent expression said otherwise.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Drop the act.\u201d</p><p>Del bit the rest of the angry words on her tongue. Trying to bully him into confessing wasn\u2019t going to get her anywhere. She was going to have to call his bluff. Her heart pounded. She might be shaving time off her life with this tactic, but as soon as she\u2019d seen the goons with the guns, she\u2019d known this wasn\u2019t going to go down pretty.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re an angel,\u201d she conceded, then turned to Eric. \u201cCan I have my flash drive?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened at her, his expression asking her if she\u2019d lost her mind. Probably so.</p><p>\u201cThe flash drive is no longer in one piece. Such a pity,\u201d Carlson cut in. \u201cBut it contained so much aimless speculation about my associations and finances. I wouldn\u2019t want that misconstrued.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI was invited here to recover my flash drive, and in the ensuing two hours, it\u2019s been destroyed? Eric wouldn\u2019t have done that, so I have to assume that you mangled my critical information so that I wouldn\u2019t leak it to the public. If you have nothing to hide, why go to all this trouble? Why are you here at all?\u201d Into his silence, she rolled her eyes. \u201cWhatever. If my flash drive is no more, I have no reason to stay. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that would force his hand.</p><p>Del turned toward the door, angling her purse toward the ADA. Carlson was off the sofa and had a harsh hand wrapped around her elbow in an instant.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy . . . associates want to have a private conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>When he nodded in Double T\u2019s direction, Del got a quick picture. The gunman would take her into the bedroom, shoot her, then Carlson would spin it so he came out smelling like a rose. He had the connections to make that happen, including Eric.</p><p>She had two choices now: fight, or keep talking and hope that her death wouldn\u2019t be in vain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve outsmarted me. I\u2019ve got to hand it to you. Somehow, you\u2019ve anticipated my every move. Before Double T and I have that private chat, will you at least tell me, if the information I had on you was all just speculation, why are you having me killed? Why did you have my friend Lisa murdered and Lobato Loco beheaded?\u201d</p><p>Carlson waved a hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. Level with me. If I\u2019m going to be dead in the next five minutes, why does it matter if you tell me the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything,\u201d Carlson told her coolly.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I admire your genius.\u201d She stroked his ego\u2014and nearly gagged on the words. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve fooled and eluded everyone for years now. That\u2019s a real feat. And I\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve had to keep it mostly to yourself. Since I\u2019m disposable, what harm is there in telling me? I mean, if curiosity is going to kill the reporter, at least assuage mine.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t working; she could tell from his mulish expression. She\u2019d try to prick his vanity instead.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cOh, or did I misread the situation? Was this someone else\u2019s idea and you\u2019re just reaping the benefits of their genius?\u201d</p><p>Carlson paused, a muscle twitching in his jaw. Then he looked at the gangbanger who\u2019d patted her down. \u201cDid you check her thoroughly?\u201d</p><p>The goon nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>The asshole\u2019s gaze fell on her purse and narrowed. Del gripped it, doing her best to breathe through the fear and act like nothing troubled her. Quickly, he grabbed it, rummaged through it, shoving her stuff this way and that. Satisfied, he threw it on the ground at her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou want a story, honey. I\u2019ll give you your story since you\u2019re going to be dead in the next five minutes. After I\u2019m done talking, I\u2019ll let Double T take you back to your ex-husband\u2019s bedroom and put a bullet in your brain.\u201d</p><p>Del glanced at a smiling Double T and tried not to panic. She had to stay calm if she wanted to bring Carlson down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think for a minute that this was someone else\u2019s idea,\u201d Carlson growled. \u201cNo one knows exactly how to manipulate the system like I do. No one is better at it than me, you stupid whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had someone plant the bomb in my car.\u201d She didn\u2019t ask; she knew.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You were becoming tiresome, digging into my affairs and my finances. The intent was to end you quietly.\u201d He sent a look of displeasure to the thug against the kitchen wall. \u201cSomeone didn\u2019t get the memo.\u201d</p><p>Euphoria swept through Del. She might die for this, but Carlson had already said enough to incriminate himself. Still, she didn\u2019t just want to nail him for conspiracy to commit murder or accessory to murder, she wanted him to go down for fraud, money laundering, racketeering, bribery . . . the whole nine yards. She glanced at Eric, wondering if he\u2019d go down, too. He looked shell-shocked.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know, he mouthed. About the car bomb, she supposed. Would it have made a difference if Carlson had told him? Maybe. Del could see the panic and anger on his face. He might be a douche, but he didn\u2019t want her dead.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t linger on that now. She had to get Carlson to admit as much as possible on tape.</p><p>\u201cIt took me a long time to piece together your system of funneling drug money from the 18th Street gang to your dummy company, Communications Redirect. You sometimes used your wife\u2019s interior design business or your brother\u2019s car dealership, which kept me guessing. You were clever, spreading it around like that. What was the cut you took from the 18th Street crew, five percent?\u201d</p><p>Carlson scoffed. \u201cAs if I\u2019d settle for such a paltry amount or go to that much trouble for mere pennies. I take fifteen percent, and I earned every bit of it. Besides, I used a portion of that to pay others, like your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Her disappointment must have been all over her face. Eric sighed, his shoulders drooping. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m . . . sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cheated on me, accepted bribes from scum. How far would you have gone the other day if I hadn\u2019t kicked you in the balls?\u201d He didn\u2019t respond, and Del\u2019s anger grew. \u201cWhat is wrong with you? You are not the man I married. You\u2019re not the man I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m kind of discovering that, too. When we were married, I just wanted . . . more than I had. Carlson made me an offer. I took it. I liked the girls and the cash. The more I had, the more I craved. I\u2019d finally gotten kind of happy right before the shooting. Then one fucking bullet changed everything. All my anger was magnified. I . . . don\u2019t even know what the fuck happened to me after that.\u201d He sounded miserable, his voice full of self-loathing. \u201cMaybe I just went bad.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t always been, and she felt sad for him. But he\u2019d made his bed. And this wasn\u2019t about her baggage with her ex. She had to get the dirty ADA to keep incriminating himself.</p><p>\u201cHow much money have you made in this scheme, Carlson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last three years? Millions. Every year just gets more lucrative.\u201d</p><p>God, the whole thing disgusted her, but she\u2019d gotten her story. Xander should have all that footage captured. Now, she had to hope that Tyler could help her or find some way to escape.</p><p>Del struggled for something to ask, anything to live a few minutes longer and try to find a way out of this. Maybe Tyler and McConnell had a plan. Tyler wouldn\u2019t let her die without giving his all to rescue her. No matter what, he would have her back. She had to buy him more time.</p><p>\u201cDoes your wife know?\u201d she asked Carlson.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Marbella is beautiful and likes everything lovely. She leaves all the finances up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>Carlson nodded. \u201cWe often used his shipments of new cars to make deliveries. His reputation as a very legitimate businessman is invaluable. No one suspects a thing.\u201d</p><p>Del turned to Eric. \u201cAnd how much did you make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, don\u2019t do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your babe. After everything you did to screw up our marriage and my life, and you owe me the courtesy of one answer. How much money did you make?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cA couple hundred thousand dollars. I used the money from Carlson to buy you out of your half of the house.\u201d</p><p>So she\u2019d unwittingly taken drug money. Damn it, that pissed her off even more. \u201cBastard! And now you\u2019re just going to let me die?\u201d</p><p>Eric turned pensive but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAfter I\u2019m dead, I hope the fact that you\u2019ve left a little boy motherless keeps you up at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching,\u201d Carlson sneered. \u201cI think we\u2019re done here. I\u2019ll be leaving the house shortly and calling the office so there will be witnesses to the fact that I had nothing to do with your murder. In ten minutes, I\u2019ll be long gone, and Double T can end your miserable life. Detective Catalano, you will call nine-one-one and say that you\u2019ve just arrived home to find your ex-wife dead in your bedroom. It will look like a tragic suicide, because she pined for you terribly and no longer wanted to live without you. I\u2019ll have Detective Hines in Homicide smooth it over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Del sucked in a breath. Carlson laid out the details of her death like a man would talk about the weather. Little inflection, no importance. Just follow a career criminal to her death and have her legacy be that of a troubled woman unable to move past her divorce.</p><p>That just couldn\u2019t happen. Where was Tyler? What if he\u2019d been captured or injured or couldn\u2019t get into the house? Fear tore through her belly. If that was the case, it was up to her to save herself and make sure he was all right.</p><p>Across the room, Double T impatiently gestured for her to join him at the entrance of the hallway. Del opened her mouth to argue, but it went dry. And arguing hadn\u2019t freed her yet. She had to keep her eyes peeled and look for an opportunity. If she was alone with one man instead of four, she stood a better chance, despite his AK-47.</p><p>On wooden feet, Del took a step forward. Inside, she felt numb, almost dead already. But her heart pounded, her blood roared, her thoughts raced\u2014all screaming that she was very much alive. She watched Double T, waiting . . .</p> <p>The goon leaning against the kitchen wall smirked as she passed, then he called to Double T, \u201cDon\u2019t have all the fun with la chavalona without me, vato.\u201d</p><p>Double T laughed and grabbed her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t take too long, or I\u2019ll already have wasted her.\u201d</p><p>PRESSING his back against a wall farther down the hall, Tyler had to count to ten to restrain the urge to kill the motherfuckers. He was going to tear the bastards limb from fucking limb, and that included Eric. His former friend had given him the means to save Del, but hadn\u2019t done anything else to contribute to the effort. It hurt like hell to realize that if he\u2019d paid more attention to Eric\u2019s behavior before the shooting, this entire shit storm might have been avoided.</p><p>Of course, that would mean giving up Del and Seth, but he\u2019d do it gladly if it kept them alive.</p><p>Footsteps resounded down the hall\u2019s hardwood floor, one set sure and impatient, the other a frantic scramble without rhythm, accompanied by feminine moans of pain, and then the sounds of someone being dragged.</p> <p>Definitely, Tyler would kill the sons of bitches. But for this to work, McConnell would have to be at the top of his game.</p><p>As the thug carrying Del stomped passed him, Tyler jumped out from around a corner and gouged the fucker in the back of the neck with the blade. He dug it into his spine, severing the cord and killing him instantly. Del backed away with a gasp as Double T began crumbling to the floor. Tyler shot her a warning glance as he caught the gang thug before the sound of his fall echoed through the house.</p><p>He pointed to the bathroom door, hoping that Del understood. She did and opened the door quickly to avoid the telltale creak. Moments later, Tyler deposited the homey in the big claw-foot bathtub. Slowly, soundlessly, he drew the shower curtain shut, concealing Double T\u2019s body.</p><p>Shooing Del out, Tyler nudged her into the master bedroom. \u201cCrawl out the window and around the side of the house. Don\u2019t go out the back gate. It makes noise. You\u2019ll have to climb the fence, but Xander is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here alone.\u201d</p><p>She looked gorgeous and stubborn, and Tyler wanted to argue, but they didn\u2019t have time. He should have known she wouldn\u2019t bow out. Instead, he handed her one of his Glocks and his phone with a sigh. \u201cYou know what to do. McConnell should be watching my back. Text Xander. Tell him to make sure Carlson doesn\u2019t escape out the front.\u201d</p> <p>Then Tyler turned to creep down the hall and finish this.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u201cThere are two more of Carlson\u2019s goons out there, one against the wall between the living room and the kitchen, the other near the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, angel.\u201d He cupped her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what Eric will do. Please come back to me in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEric can either get on board or take a bullet between his eyes. His choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She clutched his arm tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come back and love you in return.\u201d He pressed a hard kiss against her lips, then he prowled toward Eric, Carlson, and the gangbangers.</p><p>With his back hugging the wall between the hall and the living room, he angled his head to look into the kitchen. McConnell had wedged himself into a shadowed corner. Tyler nodded, and Xander\u2019s bodyguard sprang into action, making his way to the back door and rattling the handle.</p> <p>It could easily sound like someone trying to escape.</p><p>Carlson barked, \u201cCheck that out. Manny, back door. And Huero, master bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Tyler heard two sets of footsteps pounding across the living room floor, drawing closer. He waited, breath held for Huero to hit the hallway. Once the homey rounded the corner, out of Carlson\u2019s view, Tyler slit his throat clean. With little more than a gurgle, the punk went down. It was sad; this kid looked barely over eighteen. But he\u2019d been willing to help kill Del, and that\u2019s all Tyler needed to know.</p><p>He dragged the dead gangster to the tub, tossed him on top of Double T, and left the bathroom. Fuck, there was blood all over the floor and all over his shirt, but he\u2019d worry about that later.</p><p>\u201cManny, what the hell is going on?\u201d Carlson barked. When he didn\u2019t receive an answer, he called out again. \u201cHuero?\u201d</p><p>Dead silence. Literally.</p><p>After a quick prowl to the end of the hall, Tyler peeked into the kitchen. Sure enough, McConnell had taken out the last gun-wielding asshole without losing his breath. In fact, Xander\u2019s bodyguard looked relaxed enough to prop up his feet and have a beer while he waited for the next confrontation.</p><p>Tyler smiled. McConnell was as advertised. Holy shit, this might work.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, answer me!\u201d Carlson demanded.</p><p>Not gonna happen. Tyler smiled.</p><p>The ADA growled, a deep sound of frustration. \u201cThey\u2019re probably too busy getting some pussy and not thinking about the fact that Hines having to cover up a rape will make burying all this more difficult. You have a gun, Catalano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Eric walked across the room, and a moment later, Tyler heard the sounds of a cartridge being loaded into a pistol.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Carlson said with approval. \u201cGo kill the bitch. Didn\u2019t she cheat on you? That should make this fun.\u201d</p><p>Tensing, Tyler waited, breath held, to see what Eric would do. A moment later, he heard the cocking of the gun. \u201cI\u2019ve done enough to Del. I won\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Tyler froze. Had Eric finally decided to grow a set and do the right thing?</p><p>Carlson just started laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t point that at me. I own you. If you cross me, I could kill you outright, but that would be too easy. I think I\u2019d rather see you in prison. How long do you think you\u2019d last before the members of 18 and other Sure\u00f1os find out you double-crossed them? What do you think they\u2019ll do then?\u201d</p><p>Low fucking threat, but a real one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of your dirty work for the last two plus years,\u201d Eric said. \u201cThe way I look at this, my life is toast no matter what I do. I fucked it up, and that\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but mine. Del was only trying to do the right thing, and I\u2019m not going to kill her for it. I loved her once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoo-hoo.\u201d Carlson mocked. \u201cListen to your stupid bullshit. The \u2018right\u2019 thing is whatever I tell you to do. Don\u2019t grow a fucking conscience now.\u201d He sighed impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Huero out of the bitch\u2019s pussy and kill her myself.\u201d</p><p>Heavy footsteps stomped across the hardwood floors, toward the hall. Tyler tensed.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Eric demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re not touching her.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Tyler heard a tumble and a crash, then the clank of metal. He peeked around the corner and saw Eric wrestling with the suited-up Carlson, pinning him to the ground. The ADA grunted and struggled, but Eric held him down with his hands around the fucker\u2019s neck. Glass from a broken lamp littered the floor. Eric\u2019s gun had skittered a few feet away.</p><p>With a gesture to McConnell telling him to stay put, Tyler charged out of the hall, into the living room, his footsteps never making a sound. He\u2019d kick Carlson\u2019s ass, pray Eric didn\u2019t double-cross him, and leave McConnell in place. If Carlson headed up the hall, McConnell would ensure the fucker didn\u2019t get far. Either way, no one was going near Del.</p><p>As Tyler darted into the living room, Carlson managed to roll Eric to his back and punch him viciously in the jaw. Eric wasn\u2019t frozen for more than a second, but it was long enough for Carlson to lunge for Eric\u2019s gun.</p><p>\u201cPut it down!\u201d Tyler shouted, pointing his Glock at Carlson.</p><p>The bastard whipped his head around, eyes narrowed as he rose to his feet. \u201cThe bitch\u2019s lover. I should have realized that she wouldn\u2019t come alone.\u201d</p><p>Unblinking, Eric stood, looking relieved.</p><p>\u201cYou should have,\u201d Tyler drawled. \u201cI\u2019m ten steps ahead of you, asshole. Everything you said to Del earlier? Recorded and transmitted. Already being distributed to the FBI and every news outlet in the state as we speak. I expect the feds soon. I think they have a few questions for you. It\u2019s over. Put it down.\u201d</p><p>Anger contorted Carlson\u2019s face.</p><p>The fucker was planning, and Tyler wasn\u2019t having any of it. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to count to three before I put a bullet in your skull.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh of defeat, Carlson began to lower the gun. A moment later, he leapt behind Eric, using him as a human shield, and pointed the gun against Eric\u2019s spine. \u201cI can make sure I damage his spine for good this time if you don\u2019t let me walk out of here. Or you can try to kill me, but you\u2019ll have to kill him first.\u201d</p><p>Motherfucker. Tyler thought furiously, knowing he had seconds at most to save Eric and stop this from becoming a clusterfuck. But Eric came to the rescue, elbowing Carlson and ducking, giving Tyler an open shot.</p><p>Carlson fired and hit the middle of Eric\u2019s back\u2014just as Tyler fired, and his bullet connected with the bull\u2019s-eye between Carlson\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Eric collapsed to the ground, groaning and cursing as Carlson fell, already dead.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>A WEEK later, Tyler found himself on his back patio, kicking back with a beer, surrounded by his buddies\u2019 wives\u2014just like the night Del had stormed back into his life.</p><p>Today, she was glaringly absent. The only reminders he had of her now were his son and his memories.</p><p>After Carlson\u2019s death, the LAPD Internal Affairs and the FBI had escorted Del away, presumably to answer a million questions about the ADA\u2019s scheme, examine her evidence, and launch a full-scale investigation. No doubt they wanted to see how deep the scheme went and who else they could indict. Tyler had done everything in his power to stay by her side. She\u2019d only kissed him softly and told him that she was okay and would call soon.</p><p>Tyler had let her go reluctantly, thinking they\u2019d be separated for a day or two at most. He\u2019d gone with the LAPD, as had McConnell, to give their statements. The camera Xander had placed in the Coach bag he\u2019d given Del had captured virtually everything and made the case remarkably simple.</p><p>The following morning, Tyler had received a text from Del asking him to go back to Lafayette and take care of Seth. She swore she\u2019d be out to talk soon. He\u2019d tried to call her back minutes later, only to receive a recording that her phone was out of service. That quickly, dread had settled into his gut. Was she okay? Was the FBI being hard on her for some reason? Or, was Del backing away from him?</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t want to believe that all her avowals of love had been fleeting, but after seven days without a word from her, fear had turned to anguish. Being heartbroken the first time hadn\u2019t been a cakewalk. This time . . . it was fucking tearing gaping holes in his chest that he didn\u2019t think would ever heal.</p><p>\u201cDel writes a hell of a story.\u201d Tara slapped his copy of the L.A. Times on the wrought-iron table. \u201cShe\u2019ll win awards for this article.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the women agreed, and Alyssa picked the paper up to scan it again, cuddling Chloe.</p><p>Yeah. Tyler had already read it four times that morning. Del had used her words to paint a vivid picture of Carlson, his crimes and deceptions, along with the cost in taxpayer dollars and lives. No doubt her boss would ask her to stay and make her a featured reporter\u2014everything she\u2019d always dreamed of. He feared that she\u2019d try to sweep back into his life long enough to take Seth back to Los Angeles and leave forever.</p><p>The thought that she\u2019d want him to do without her and their son was absolutely agonizing.</p><p>Seth bounced on his lap, and Tyler sent the boy a smile. The one bright spot these dark days had been his son. He\u2019d really bonded with Seth over the past week and wholeheartedly admitted that he loved the boy with every bit of his heart. Yesterday, he\u2019d even worked up the nerve to track down his mom. She\u2019d remarried a great guy and lived in Phoenix now. She\u2019d been really thrilled to hear that she had a grandson and asked to meet him. She\u2019d wished him all the happiness in the world, like all that bitter crap she used to spout at him under the influence of Boone\u2019s Farm hadn\u2019t existed. He\u2019d told her that he\u2019d call back and see what they could work out. But for Seth\u2019s sake\u2014and his own\u2014he figured it would be good for his mother to meet his son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taking Tyler\u2019s smile as encouragement, Seth slapped his open palms on Tyler\u2019s chest and squealed. Tyler looked down to find little greenish handprints on his favorite shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t want to know what that is.\u201d Kimber winced.</p><p>He silently agreed. The shirt would wash, and it was a small price to pay for having this precious time with the boy, given how many of Seth\u2019s other days Tyler had missed out on\u2014and how many more he might miss in the future if Del decided to sweep in and return to L.A.</p><p>Through his bittersweet sadness, Tyler grinned and shook his head at the toddler\u2019s chubby impish little face, then scooped him up, heading for the kitchen. After a quick wash of the boy\u2019s hands, Tyler headed back out to the patio.</p> <p>\u201cAvocado,\u201d he drawled. \u201cSeth climbed up to the counter and grabbed it. I\u2019ll bet he had a ball squishing it between his fingers and painting my kitchen cabinets.\u201d</p><p>Kimber tried not to laugh. \u201cCaleb does stuff like that all the time. You really can\u2019t turn your back for a minute.\u201d</p><p>Tyler hadn\u2019t had much experience with parenting or kids until now, but he was quickly figuring out how right Kimber was.</p><p>May had become June, and the weather bordered on sultry now. Dusk approached and the cicadas chimed in, vying with the sounds of the croaking frogs.</p><p>Alyssa set the paper down, then turned to Tara. \u201cSo Xander is in your guest room and driving you crazy because he\u2019s trying to avoid the press in L.A.?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded emphatically. \u201cSince the article spelled out how helpful he was in bringing Carlson down, he\u2019s been bombarded. Apparently, he doesn\u2019t like being called the James Bond of billionaires.\u201d She giggled. \u201cAnd because he\u2019s Xander, he\u2019s driving me crazy. I know when he pokes fun at me that he\u2019s just teasing, and I can mostly take it. But the groupies . . . His phone never stops ringing. He disappeared four times yesterday, each time with a different girl. I didn\u2019t know he even knew anyone in Lafayette, much less had met enough girls to get laid multiple times a day, every day.\u201d She sighed. \u201cRemind me to clobber Logan next time I see him. I\u2019d beat Xander silly, but besides servicing his apparent harem, he\u2019s clearly going through a tough spot with Javier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearning that your wife is dead at the hands of the lover you didn\u2019t know she had can\u2019t be easy on Xander\u2019s brother,\u201d Tyler pointed out.</p><p>Five days ago, the police had found Francesca\u2019s strangled, bloated body. Xander wanted to be with his brother. He\u2019d said as much. But the press was swarming around him now. No way would Javier get any time alone to grieve if Xander went back to L.A. So he waited here, chomping at the bit, taking out all his frustration with a constant barrage of mindless sex. Tyler understood. The situation would be kind of funny if it weren\u2019t so sad.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the prick who killed her just dumped her body in the ocean,\u201d Morgan chimed in, stroking her growing belly. She and Jack were anticipating a September baby. \u201cHave they found him yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tara answered quietly. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge investigation going on, but until they learn the identity of the man she was with . . .\u201d</p><p>Nothing so far. Tyler figured it was only a matter of time before the authorities learned the identity of Francesca\u2019s murdering lover, but the fucker was clever and had a monthlong head start.</p> <p>Kissing her daughter\u2019s downy head, Alyssa looked Tyler\u2019s way. \u201cWhat about Eric?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky. The bullet missed his lungs by a millimeter. He\u2019s going to be fine physically. He\u2019s trying to cut a deal with the DA now. I think they\u2019re offering him immunity in exchange for the names of everyone else he knows that Carlson roped into his scam.\u201d</p><p>Before leaving town, Tyler had visited Eric in the hospital. They were never going to be friends again, and Eric had a lot to work through. They\u2019d talked. Eric had apologized. After seeing the damage he\u2019d nearly wrought on Del by touching her against her will, he\u2019d started taking a hard look at himself\u2014and Carlson. It hadn\u2019t taken long to figure out that the dirty ADA had been trying to kill her. He\u2019d snatched the flash drive out of Del\u2019s hiding place when he\u2019d figured out that Carlson wanted it bad enough to trash the house, but instead of giving it over, he\u2019d read it and realized that Del was living on borrowed time. So he\u2019d set up the meeting between her and Carlson, then done everything possible to ensure that Del lived. The visit had been enlightening. Eric seemed to finally understand that he was truly responsible for his actions. That was a start. He\u2019d also agreed to stay the hell away.</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d Alyssa slated him another stare, this one really direct. \u201cHear from Del again?\u201d</p><p>Other than one text in which she\u2019d told him that she\u2019d come soon? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t fucking want to talk about it. They\u2019d only try to find some bullshit words to console him, some \u201cif you love her, set her free\u201d crap that made his teeth grind.</p><p>He loved her and he wasn\u2019t ready to let her go, not unless she looked him in the eye and told him that she didn\u2019t love him. He had feelers out to track her down now, and the second she slipped onto his radar, it was goddamn for sure that he was going to run her to ground. They would have a long talk about the future. He wouldn\u2019t let her leave until he was absolutely convinced that she didn\u2019t want to be with him.</p><p>Because he wanted to be with her for the rest of his life.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Alyssa murmured. \u201cGiven any thought to coming back to work at Sexy Sirens? All the girls really miss Cockzilla.\u201d</p><p>Tyler had to repress a grimace. He hadn\u2019t gone more than a handful of days without sex in years. In the past, a seven-day drought would have had him climbing the walls. Today? Sure, he wanted sex, but only if the kisses were Del\u2019s. Only if the body he pushed into was hers. Only if the nails in his back and the cries of passion in his ears belonged to her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll hang with Jack. You can find a bouncer anywhere. My skill set is better suited to his line of work.\u201d</p><p>Alyssa cocked her head, studying him. Tyler felt like a bug pinned to a board.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou are head-over-heels, one-hundred-percent completely in love with this woman. I\u2019ll have to tell Jessi and Skylar that you\u2019re off the market. I think they might actually cry,\u201d Alyssa drawled.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d he groused, then remembered his son was still sitting in his lap and winced. Seth was young at fifteen months, but would probably start repeating everything he heard soon. Tyler knew he was going to have to watch his mouth.</p><p>Morgan looked at her watch, then across the table at him. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re in love with her. You\u2019re too good to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell that to Delaney.\u201d Tyler sighed. The waiting was getting tougher every day.</p><p>Just then his back door opened, and Jack Cole appeared. \u201cTell her yourself.\u201d</p><p>When the other man shifted out of his way to cross the room to his pregnant wife, Delaney came into view. She stood, staring, wearing a pair of rumpled capri pants and a brown T-shirt that made her eyes shine incredibly blue. She looked pale and tired. And above all, she looked uncertain.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She waved, biting her lip. She glanced at the others, then clenched her hands in front of her as she stepped onto the patio.</p><p>\u201cMa ma ma!\u201d Seth darted off of his lap and toddled across the floor to Del.</p><p>She met him halfway, arms open, and engulfed him in a big hug. \u201cMy little man! Oh, Mommy has missed you. Sweet boy . . .\u201d</p><p>As Del pressed kisses to his little face, she looked ready to cry with the joy of holding her son again. Tyler was conscious that she\u2019d barely greeted him, had almost been unable to look at him. Even now, he could feel Alyssa, Kata, Kimber, and Tara\u2019s gaze on him, assessing, probably pitying him. Fuck.</p><p>Jack approached him a second later, startling Tyler.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Del yesterday. She only wanted to know two things: how you and Seth were, and if I\u2019d pick her up from the airport today. She asked me to keep it a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMission accomplished,\u201d he muttered. He couldn\u2019t be more stunned by Del\u2019s presence here if he tried.</p><p>Seth placed a sloppy kiss on Del\u2019s chin, and she laughed. Tyler scrubbed a hand down his face as he watched the love flow between them. Yeah, he knew he couldn\u2019t force her to stay with him, make a family with him, if she didn\u2019t love him anymore. But damn it, he\u2019d thought she\u2019d at least try.</p><p>He shut his eyes. They stung. No, they fucking hurt, like someone was taking tiny pickaxes to them. Damn it, he would not cry.</p><p>Forcing the tears back, he fixed his gaze on Del again, trying to decide what to do next.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep staring at her like that, you\u2019re going to scare the hell out of her,\u201d Jack pointed out.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you can\u2019t decide if you want to tear into her for not contacting you again over the past few days, or just fuck her into next week.\u201d</p><p>Tyler grunted. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Jack shrugged. \u201cJust . . . remember to listen before you pounce\u2014either way.\u201d</p><p>Probably good advice. Jack had been married for a few years now, so he probably knew something. For all of Morgan\u2019s submissive tendencies, Tyler knew she\u2019d beat the hell out of Jack if he behaved like an asshole.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, cher.\u201d Jack helped Morgan from her chair, making sure she had her center of balance under her before wrapping an arm around her waist and leading her to the door.</p><p>At the threshold, Jack turned back to Tyler with a sly smile. \u201cOh, you can thank me later.\u201d</p><p>With that, they were gone. Kata and Tara scrambled to their feet and departed, as well.</p><p>After greeting Del and a few quick hugs for Seth, Kimber looked between him and Del. \u201cYou two look like you could use some time to talk. Why don\u2019t I take Seth with me so he can play with Caleb?\u201d</p><p>Del didn\u2019t object, and after Tyler and Del both placed a soft kiss on their boy\u2019s cheeks, Kimber picked Seth up and left, too.</p><p>Alyssa lingered. She rose to her feet slowly, staring at Del like a protective parent might stare at her daughter\u2019s slimy boyfriend. Del lifted her chin and stared back.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not here to hurt him,\u201d Alyssa said to Del. \u201cHe\u2019s been through enough.\u201d</p><p>Tyler cringed at her words. Yes, he\u2019d been pining, but Alyssa had basically announced it. Shit.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for Del\u2019s answer, just walked out, leaving them alone. Tyler stared, his gaze fused on Del, petrified that if he blinked, she\u2019d be gone again. But he had no clue what to say. If he opened his mouth, he had a bad feeling that he\u2019d unload all his worry, frustration, and pain out on her. Jack had advised him to listen, so he figured he\u2019d better at least try.</p><p>Del swallowed nervously and sat in Alyssa\u2019s vacated chair. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m fucking terrified. But he simply nodded. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to deal with Seth all by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s been . . . the best part of this week. I\u2019ve loved getting to know him, seeing him every day. I\u2014\u201d He choked. \u201cI need that.\u201d</p><p>Del bit her lip again and hesitated, as if trying to decide what to say. \u201cSo this week was hard because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cWhat do you want from me? An admission that I\u2019ve been miserable without you? Okay, you\u2019ve got it. I missed you. I love you. I\u2019m not letting you or Seth go without a fight. If you\u2019re going back to L.A., I\u2019ll go, too. I\u2019m pretty sure the department would hire me again, and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to prove that\u2014\u201d</p><p>She threw herself into his arms with such force, it almost knocked the wind out of him. Tyler wrapped her tightly in his embrace, burying his face in Del\u2019s neck. God, she smelled good as she clung to him in return for a long, sweet moment. Then she backed away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I spent the last week dealing with the downfall of Carlson\u2019s scheme and writing my story. Preston loved it and asked me to stay on as a featured reporter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d Tyler stiffened, fidgeted. He wanted to be happy for her, but inside he felt himself dying, becoming hollow and numb. She hadn\u2019t mentioned him coming back to California with her.</p><p>\u201cIt is what I\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d She nodded. \u201cWhich made turning it down bittersweet, but still an easy decision. I know you love your family of friends, and clearly they care about Seth. I\u2019m ready for a fresh start, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turned it down?\u201d Tyler snapped, his mind racing. She was ready for a fresh start. What did that mean? He winced. He hadn\u2019t let her finish her sentence so he could really listen to her. Jack had given him good advice; he just hadn\u2019t said how difficult it would be to follow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. Too many memories in Los Angeles. Seth needs a good place to grow up. Chasing the journalistic fast track isn\u2019t what I want anymore. You are.\u201d Her face dissolved, and tears welled in her so-blue eyes. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>That was all Tyler needed to hear. The last week of worry and anguish melted, and he dragged Del against him, fitting every inch of his body against hers. \u201cI love you. I thought this would be like last time, that you wanted to leave me and . . . I was going insane.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a hard, quick kiss to his lips. \u201cNo. I needed time to wrap up with all the authorities. They took my phone into evidence, so it was harder to call you. Either way, I knew we needed to settle this in person. I didn\u2019t want to do it from across the country, over the phone. So I took that time to quit my job, put my condo up for sale, pack up my stuff, and ship it here. Then I bought a plane ticket and called Jack.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cActually, he tracked me down. Less than a minute after I bought my plane ticket, he called my house to ask me what the hell I was doing. I filled him in, and he offered to pick me up so I could surprise you and . . . here we are.\u201d</p><p>With every word out of her mouth, Tyler\u2019s joy increased. His heart pounded, and euphoria filled every corner of his body. \u201cSo you\u2019re definitely moving here?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and fresh tears fell. \u201cI . . . got a job with the paper here and I\u2019ve come to be with you. If you\u2019ll have us.\u201d</p><p>Tyler kissed away her tears, feeling a few himself. She trusted him and believed in their future enough to give up everything, including her dream job. She was choosing to spend her tomorrows with him here in Lafayette. He wanted nothing more.</p><p>\u201cAngel, I want you and Seth with me here for the rest of our lives. Come with me. I\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and dragged her into the house, his long steps making it difficult for her to keep up. He knew he should slow down, but he couldn\u2019t yet.</p><p>Once he reached his bedroom, he pulled Del inside and picked her up, tossing her onto the bed. He grabbed what he needed from the nightstand, then covered her body with his, pinning her down. She was going to hear every word of this; he would make sure of it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only woman I want, Del. My mother was dead wrong about me. My father didn\u2019t love her, so leaving was easy for him. But I could barely bring myself to walk away from you the first time. It would kill me to do it again\u2014for any reason. It\u2019s different\u2014I\u2019m different\u2014because I love you. We belong together. I want to be a good father to Seth and a good husband to you. Please don\u2019t leave me, angel. Stay.\u201d He settled the precious metal and stone into her hand. \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her palm and saw the diamond engagement ring he\u2019d picked out for her the day he\u2019d returned from L.A. Her eyes grew saucer wide, and she blinked up at him with more tears. But if the smile on her face was any indication, these were tears of joy.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she squealed, then lifted up to cover his lips with her own.</p><p>Tyler put the ring on her finger, his heart bursting with relief and joy as he drowned in her familiar flavor and sweet kiss.</p><p>Within seconds, she began tugging at his shirt and yanking on his shorts. Rising up just enough to pull his shirt over his head, he shoved her T-shirt off, ripped into her capri pants, and jerked them down before opening his fly with trembling fingers. Fuck, he had to get inside her, claim her again, this time once and for all.</p><p>She kicked away her panties, then spread her legs for him. Tyler didn\u2019t hesitate, just slipped inside her, letting her warmth and need envelop him. Home. He closed his eyes to savor the feeling. Then reality intruded.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he cursed. \u201cShould I get a condom?\u201d</p><p>She sent him a sheepish smile. \u201cIf the pregnancy test I took this morning is right, I think it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>His heart soared, and his cock grew even harder. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d She nodded. \u201cIs that . . . okay? Are you going to be ready to be a dad again so soon? I know we didn\u2019t plan it this way, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off with a kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Easing out of her body, he slid back in slowly, thrilled when she cried out and arched and threw her arms around his neck, looking utterly lost to passion. She was wonderful, and she was finally his. Fuck, he couldn\u2019t be happier.</p><p>\u201cGuess that means we need to get married soon,\u201d he drawled, tormenting her with another slow glide of his dick inside her silky-wet sex.</p><p>\u201cYou sound pretty happy about that,\u201d she managed to eke out in between gasps of pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. You make me happy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled up at him, something so beautiful, his heart nearly stopped. \u201cI fell hard for you the first time you touched me. I think I always knew, deep down, we were meant to be together, but over the last two weeks the feelings only got stronger. This is my dream coming true.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d suspected the same thing. \u201cMine, too. I love you, angel. Always.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
