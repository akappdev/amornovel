The fund-raiser was supposed to be more pleasure than business, but business was uppermost on the minds of her competition.</p><p>Across the room, Evan Reese stood in a large group of people. He looked relaxed, seemingly in his element, an easy smile making his extraordinarily handsome face even more gorgeous.</p> <p>It should be a crime for a man to be that good-looking. Tall, rugged, he looked every inch the kind of man who\u2019d be at home in the athletic wear his company designed and sold. There was an aura of confidence and power around him, and above all, Celia loved a man who was sure of himself.</p><p>Given the long, searching glances they\u2019d exchanged over the last few weeks, she\u2019d be a fool not to entertain the idea of seeing where things could lead.</p><p>If he wasn\u2019t a prospective client.</p><p>A client she wanted to land very much.</p><p>She wanted the account\u2014her boss and the agency was counting on her\u2014but she drew the line at sleeping with a man to get what she wanted.</p> <p>Celia turned away from the sight of Evan Reese before she became too enthralled in just watching him.</p><p>They\u2019d performed a delicate dance around each other ever since he\u2019d fired his last advertising agency.</p><p>He knew she wanted him\u2014in the professional sense of course. Hell, he probably knew she wanted him naked and in bed too, but she wasn\u2019t going to dwell on that. Maybe later tonight when she could afford to indulge in a little fantasy.</p><p>The problem was, anytime a big company like Reese Enterprises fired an agency, it became open season. The other agencies circled like sharks. It was a dog-eat-dog world, and in reality, she should be over there, shoving herself down his throat like the rest of her competition, but she couldn\u2019t help but believe Evan Reese was secretly amused by the attention. He took a different hand. She was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cCelia, glad you made it. Have you spoken to Reese yet?\u201d</p><p>Celia turned to see her boss, Brock Maddox, standing a foot away. He wasn\u2019t drinking. He didn\u2019t even look particularly thrilled to be here.</p> <p>Her eyebrow rose. \u201cA tux. Why, Brock, you look positively decadent. However are you keeping the ladies at bay?\u201d</p><p>He grunted in response, his lips curling in distaste. \u201cCut it out, Celia. I brought Elle along.\u201d</p><p>Celia looked beyond his shoulder to see his pretty assistant standing a few feet away. When Elle looked her way, Celia smiled and waved.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Celia mouthed.</p><p>Elle smiled and ducked her head self-consciously but not before Celia saw the faint blush that colored her cheeks.</p><p>Brock gestured impatiently toward Evan. \u201cWhy are you standing over here while Evan Reese is over there?\u201d Brock scanned the room and his expression hardened. \u201cI should have known the old bastard would be here.\u201d</p><p>Celia followed his gaze to see Athos Koteas holding court within hearing distance of Evan. Though she wouldn\u2019t admit it to Brock, it made her extremely nervous to see their business rival hammering so relentlessly on Evan Reese. Koteas owned Golden Gate Promotions, and not only had Koteas lured away a few of Maddox\u2019s top clients in recent months, he\u2019d also launched a PR campaign against Maddox. It was dirty pool, but it in no way surprised Celia. Koteas was ruthless, and he\u2019d do anything to win.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Celia murmured. \u201cHis ad execs are busy working Evan over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny reason you aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She laid her hand on his forearm. She knew how important this account was to Brock\u2014to everyone at Maddox Communications. \u201cI need you to trust me, Brock. I\u2019ve studied Evan Reese extensively. He knows I\u2019m interested. He\u2019ll come to me eventually. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fifty million dollars sure, Celia? Maddox is small, and this kind of deal means our employees keep their jobs whereas if we continue to lose clients and accounts, I can\u2019t make any guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m asking a lot,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cBut I can\u2019t walk over there and pull out the seductive wiles.\u201d She gestured toward the women standing around Evan. They weren\u2019t making any bones as to how far they\u2019d go to sign him. \u201cIt\u2019s what he expects, and you of all people know I can\u2019t do it. I can land this account on theideas , Brock. I\u2019ve spent every waking minute putting this pitch together. There\u2019s no way he won\u2019t go for it.\u201d</p><p>Brock studied her for a long moment, his eyes gleaming with what looked like respect. She loved working for him. He was hard. He was demanding. And he was the only person she\u2019d presented her side of what had happened in New York in her last advertising job.</p><p>\u201cI never expected you to land the account on anything less than your brilliance, Celia,\u201d Brock said softly.</p><p>\u201cI hope I never gave you any other impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I appreciate your confidence more than you know. I won\u2019t let you down. I won\u2019t let Maddox Communications down.\u201d</p><p>Brock ran a hand through his hair and glanced once more across the room. He looked tired. It was true he worked hard. The agency was everything to him. But in the last few months new lines had appeared around his eyes. More than anything Celia wanted to be able to hand this account to him. He had believed in her when everyone else was willing to think the worst.</p><p>She glanced up to see Evan threading his way through the throng of people. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but he\u2019s headed our way. Maybe you should take Elle and go dance or something.\u201d</p><p>As quickly as he\u2019d approached, Brock turned and melted back into the crowd.</p><p>Celia sipped at her wine and practiced nonchalance as she literally felt Evan close in. It was impossible to miss him. Her body always seemed to heat up about five degrees whenever he was anywhere near.</p><p>And his smell. Even amid the hustle and bustle of the crowded room, the mix of so many feminine perfumes, she could pick out his unique scent. Rough. Masculine and mouthwateringly sexy. It made no sense to her, but she was attuned to his every nuance, and that had nothing to do with all the studying up she\u2019d done on him and his company.</p><p>\u201cCelia,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She turned with a welcoming smile. \u201cHello, Evan. Enjoying the evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She raised one eyebrow and stared at him over the rim of her glass. \u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>Evan snagged a flute from a passing waiter and turned his attention fully on her. It was all she could do not to gasp under his heated scrutiny. It was as if he undressed her right then and there in front of a roomful of people. Her blood simmered and pooled low in her belly. He had beautiful eyes, and they were currently devouring her, delving beneath the modest evening gown she\u2019d chosen. He made it seem like she wore the most scanty, revealing dress imaginable. She felt nude and vulnerable under his searing gaze.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Celia. Why aren\u2019t you over with the rest of the piranhas convincing me that your ad agency will take Reese Enterprises straight to the top?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved upward into a smile. \u201cBecause you already are at the top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a tease.\u201d</p><p>At that her smile faded. He was right. She was flirting, and it was the last thing she wanted to do.</p><p>She glanced across the room to where the other ad execs stood staring holes through her and Evan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not desperate, Evan. I know I\u2019m good. I know my ideas for your ad campaign are spectacular.</p><p>Does that make me arrogant? Maybe. But I don\u2019t need to sell you on a load of malarkey. All I need is the time to show you what Maddox Communications can do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatyou can do for me, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise at the blatant innuendo. And then he went on to correct the errant assumption she\u2019d just made.</p><p>\u201cIf the ideas are yours and are as brilliant as you say, I\u2019d hardly be taking on Maddox and what the agency could do for me. I\u2019d be hiring you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and hated that she suddenly felt at a disadvantage. Her fingers curled a little tighter around the glass, and she prayed they wouldn\u2019t shake and betray her unease.</p><p>He studied her curiously, having obviously picked up on her discomfort.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a proposition, Celia. Believe me, you\u2019d know the difference.\u201d</p><p>In a daring move, he reached a finger out and traced a line down the bare skin of her arm. She was unable to call back the shiver, or the sprinkling of chill bumps that danced over her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI only meant that if you wow me with a pitch and I sign on with Maddox, you won\u2019t pawn me off to some junior executive. I\u2019d expect you to oversee the campaign at every level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you anticipate signing with Maddox Communications?\u201d she asked huskily.</p><p>There was a gleam of amusement in his green eyes. He took a measured sip of his wine and then regarded her lazily. \u201cIf your pitch is good enough. Golden Gate has some good ideas. I\u2019m considering them.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cOnly because you haven\u2019t seen mine yet.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again. \u201cI like confidence. I don\u2019t like false modesty. I look forward to seeing what you have in mind, Celia Taylor. I have a feeling you put every bit of that passion I see burning in your eyes into your work. Brock Maddox is a lucky man to have such a fierce employee. I wonder if he knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we moving into the appointment phase?\u201d she asked lightly. \u201cI have to admit, I\u2019ve enjoyed watching you surrounded by the piranhas as you call them.\u201d</p><p>He put his glass down on a nearby table. \u201cDance with me and we\u2019ll discuss appointment times.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>He lifted one finely constructed eyebrow into what looked like a challenge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also danced with female ad executives from Golden Gate, Primrose, San Fran Media\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cOkay, okay, I get it. You\u2019re making your selection on who\u2019s the best dance partner.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed. Several people around them turned to stare, and she had to resist the strong urge to flee the room. She hated the attention that Evan seemed to have no issue with whatsoever. How nice it must be not to have to worry what people thought about you. To have your reputation intact and not have suffered the stupidity and vindictiveness of others. But then men rarely suffered in cases like hers. It was always the woman. The vilified other woman.</p><p>Knowing no graceful way to bow out of the dance, she set down her own glass and allowed Evan to lead her onto the ballroom floor.</p><p>To her relief, he held her loosely. To anyone looking on, they could find no fault or impropriety. She and Evan didn\u2019t look like lovers, but she knew the thought was present in both their minds. She could see the desire in his eyes and knew he could probably see it in hers.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t practiced at hiding her emotions. Maybe being the only girl in an all-male household growing up was the reason. Her family was a loud, demonstrative lot, and she\u2019d always been regarded as the precious daughter and sister.</p><p>It would make her life easier to be able to hide her thoughts from this man. Then she wouldn\u2019t concern herself over whether he was giving her a shot because he thought she deserved it or whether he was thinking only of the powerful sexual pull between them and how best to capitalize on it.</p><p>Wow, Celia. Lump him in with all the other jerks you\u2019ve known, why don\u2019t you? Nothing like being tried and convicted based on your gender.</p><p>\u201cRelax. You\u2019re thinking way too much,\u201d Evan murmured close to her ear.</p><p>She forced herself to do as he\u2019d instructed and gave herself over to the beautiful music and the sheer enjoyment of dancing with a man who took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cSo how is next week? I have Friday free.\u201d</p><p>She jerked back to reality, and for a moment couldn\u2019t for the life of her figure out what he was talking</p><p>about. Some professional she was.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we could meet informally and you could go over what you have in mind. If I\u2019m interested we could do the whole shebang at your agency. Maybe that\u2019ll save us both a lot of time and hassle if I\u2019m not loving your ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I can do Friday. Friday is good.\u201d</p><p>The music ended, and he held her just a bit longer than necessary, but she was so affected by the intensity of his gaze that she couldn\u2019t formulate a single objection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my assistant call you with the time and location then.\u201d</p><p>He picked up her hand and brought it to his lips. The warm brush of his mouth over the back of her hand sent a bolt of pleasure straight down her spine.</p><p>\u201cUntil Friday.\u201d</p><p>She watched wordlessly as he strolled away. He was immediately swallowed up by a crowd of people again, but he turned and found her gaze. For a moment they simply stared at one another and then the corners of his mouth lifted into a half smile.</p><p>Oh, yes, he knew. He knew exactly what her reaction to him was. He\u2019d have to be a complete moron not to. And he was anything but. The man was smart. He was driven. And he had a reputation for being ruthless. He was the perfect client. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned to walk toward the exit. She\u2019d done what she\u2019d come for. There was no reason to stick around and be social. If there was any gossip over her dance with Evan, she certainly didn\u2019t want to hear it.</p><p>On the way, she passed Brock and Elle, who were standing somewhat awkwardly to the side. Brock didn\u2019t say anything. He just lifted an inquiring brow. Of course he would have seen her dancing with Evan. Brock probably hadn\u2019t looked at anyone but Evan all night. A shame, really, since Elle looked fabulous in her black sheath.</p><p>\u201cFriday,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI meet with him Friday. No formal pitch. He wants to hear my ideas first. If he likes them, he\u2019ll arrange a time for us to hit him with both barrels.\u201d</p><p>Brock nodded, and she saw the gleam of satisfaction light his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cGood work, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled and resumed her path to the door. She had a lot to do before next Friday.</p><p>Evan Reese loosened his tie as soon as he walked into his hotel suite. He left a trail of clothing from the door, where he threw his jacket over one of the chairs, to the bedroom where he peeled off his socks and left them on the floor.</p><p>The desk with his laptop and briefcase beckoned, but for once, the idea of work didn\u2019t appeal to him.</p><p>He was too preoccupied with thoughts of Celia Taylor.</p> <p>Beautiful, seductive, impossibly aloof Celia Taylor.</p><p>His body had been on heightened sense of alert ever since she walked into the ballroom, and though he\u2019d known the moment she left, he was still tense and painfully aware of her scent, how she felt in his arms, how her skin felt under his fingers the one time he\u2019d been bold enough to touch her.</p><p>He wanted to do a hell of a lot more than just touch. He wanted to taste her. He wanted her underneath him, making all those feminine, breathy sounds of a woman being pleasured.</p><p>He wanted to slide his hand between those gorgeous legs and spread her thighs. He would spend all night making love to her. A woman such as Celia wasn\u2019t to be rushed. No, he\u2019d get to know every inch of her body. Find out where she liked to be touched and kissed.</p><p>His fixation with her couldn\u2019t be readily explained. It wasn\u2019t as though he lived as a monk. He had sex.</p><p>He never lacked for partners. Sex was good. But he knew that sex with Celia would never be just good.</p> <p>It would be lush and delicious. The kind of experience a man would sell his soul for.</p><p>She was indeed a beautiful woman. Tall, but not too tall. She would fit perfectly against him, her head tucked just underneath his chin. She often wore her long red hair up in a loose style that told him she didn\u2019t pay a lot of attention to whether every strand was in place.</p><p>He wanted to take that damn clip out, toss it in the garbage and watch as her silken mass spilled down her back. Or better yet, let it spill over him while they made love.</p><p>He cursed under his breath when his body reacted to that image. Cold showers didn\u2019t do a thing for his hunger. He ought to know. He\u2019d taken enough of them over the last few weeks.</p><p>Perhaps her most mesmerizing feature was her eyes. An unusual shade of green. At times they looked more blue but in certain lighting they were vivid green.</p><p>The more cynical side of him wondered why a woman that beautiful hadn\u2019t tried to seduce him into hiring her agency. It wasn\u2019t like it hadn\u2019t been attempted before. In fact, he\u2019d received two such propositions tonight at the fund-raiser.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t saying he\u2019d mind. Right now he\u2019d use just about any reason to get into Celia Taylor\u2019s bed.</p><p>But there was a reserve about her that intrigued him. She was a cool customer, and he admired that. She wanted the account. She\u2019d made no bones about that. But she hadn\u2019t actively pursued him.</p> <p>No, she\u2019d waited for him to come to her, and maybe that made her damn smart since he\u2019d done just that.</p><p>The ring of his BlackBerry disturbed his fantasy and brought him sharply back to the present. He looked down in disgust at the unmistakable ridge in his trousers then reached into his pocket for his phone.</p><p>His mother. He frowned. He wasn\u2019t really in the mood for anything to do with his family, but he loved his mother dearly, and he couldn\u2019t very well ignore her.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, he punched the answer button and put the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvan! I\u2019m so glad I caught you. You\u2019re so busy these days.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the disapproval and worry in her voice.</p><p>\u201cThe business doesn\u2019t run itself,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She made a low sound of exasperation. \u201cYou sound so much like your father.\u201d</p><p>He winced. That wasn\u2019t exactly at the top of the list of things he wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to call to make sure you hadn\u2019t forgotten about this weekend. It\u2019s important to Mitchell that you be there.\u201d</p><p>There was a note of anxiety in her voice that always seemed to creep in when his brother was mentioned.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t think I\u2019d actually go to their wedding,\u201d Evan said mildly. And the only important thing to Mitchell was that Evan be there to see his triumph.</p><p>His mother made a disapproving sound. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be easy for you, Evan. But don\u2019t you think you should forgive him? It\u2019s obvious he and Bettina belong together. It would be so nice to have the whole family back together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy? It won\u2019t be easyor difficult, Mom. I don\u2019t care, and frankly they\u2019re welcome to each other. I simply don\u2019t have the time or the desire to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you do it for me?\u201d she begged. \u201cPlease. I want just one time to see my sons in the same room.\u201d</p><p>Evan sank onto the edge of the bed and pinched the bridge of his nose between two fingers. If his dad had called, he would have had no problem refusing. If Mitchell had called, Evan nearly laughed at that idea. Mitchell wouldn\u2019t be calling him for anything after Evan had told him to go to hell and take his faithless fianc\u00e9e with him.</p><p>But this was his mother, whom he harbored real affection for. His mother, who was always caught in the middle of the tension that existed between him and his father and between him and Mitchell.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mom. I\u2019ll come. But I\u2019ll be bringing someone with me. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He could practically see her beam right through the phone.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Evan, you didn\u2019t tell me you were seeing someone new! Of course you\u2019re welcome to bring her.</p><p>I\u2019ll very much look forward to meeting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you forward all the details to my assistant so she can make arrangements?\u201d</p><p>His mom sighed. \u201cHow did I know you wouldn\u2019t have kept the original e-mail?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d immediately sent it to the trash folder? Of course he wouldn\u2019t tell her that.</p><p>\u201cSend it to Vickie and I\u2019ll see you on Friday. I love you,\u201d he said after a short pause.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, son. I\u2019m so very glad you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call and stared down at his BlackBerry. Friday. Hell. Friday was when he was meeting Celia. Finally meeting Celia.</p><p>He\u2019d planned meticulously, not wanting to seem overanxious. He\u2019d flirted, exchanged long, seeking glances and had spent a lot of damn time in the shower. He was surprised he hadn\u2019t come down with hypothermia.</p><p>And now he was going to have to cancel because his mother thought that he should go see the woman he was supposed to have married instead marry his younger brother.</p><p>He needed to find a date. Preferably one who would convince his mother he wasn\u2019t secretly pining over Bettina. He wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d gotten over her the moment she\u2019d dumped him for his brother when Mitchell was appointed the CEO position in their family jewelry business.</p><p>She preferred the glitz-and-glamour facade of the jewelry world over the sweaty, athletic image of his company. It was just as well she wasn\u2019t bright enough to have done any research. If she had, she would have known that Evan\u2019s company\u2019s earnings far exceeded those of his father\u2019s jewelry business. And it had only taken him a few years to accomplish it.</p><p>His mother wouldn\u2019t believe it but Evan was grateful to his brother for being a selfish pinhead. Mitchell wanted Bettina because Evan had her. Thanks to that deep need for one-upmanship, Evan had narrowly escaped a huge mistake.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t mean he wanted to spend quality time with his controlling father and his spoiled, self-indulgent sibling. He\u2019d agreed, however, and now he needed a date.</p><p>With a shake of his head, he began scrolling through his address book in his BlackBerry. He had narrowed his options to three women, when the solution came to him.</p><p>It was brilliant, really. He was an idiot for not having thought of it immediately. It certainly solvedall his problems.</p><p>Finally he had a way of luring Celia to him. It would be business, of course, but if the setting happened to be intimate and she was for all practical purposes stranded with him on Catalina Island for three days...</p><p>A satisfied smile raised the corners of his mouth. Maybe the wedding wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing after all.</p><p>Two</p><p>When Celia pulled into her father\u2019s driveway, she was relieved to see Noah\u2019s Mercedes parked beside their father\u2019s pickup. She pulled her black BMW on the other side of the truck and grinned at how the two expensive cars flanked the beat-up old piece of family history.</p><p>As she got out, she heard the roar of another engine and turned to see Dalton pull in behind her. To her utter shock, Adam climbed out of the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d she exclaimed, and ran straight for him.</p><p>He grinned just before she launched herself into his arms. She hit his chest and as she\u2019d known he would, he caught her and whirled her around. Just like he\u2019d done when she\u2019d been five years old and every year since.</p><p>\u201cHow come I never get greetings like that?\u201d Dalton grumbled as he climbed from behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d she whispered fiercely.</p><p>His big arms surrounded her in a hug that nearly squeezed the breath out of her. Adam always gave the best hugs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too, Cece. I missed you. Took you long enough to come back home.\u201d</p><p>She slid down until her feet met the ground again, and she briefly looked away.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he chided as he nudged her chin until she looked at him again. \u201cNone of that. It\u2019s all in the past, and it\u2019s a good damn thing it is otherwise your brothers would hop the first plane to New York and beat the crap out of your former boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hello, I\u2019m here, too,\u201d Dalton said, waving a hand between them.</p><p>She held Adam\u2019s gaze for a moment longer and then smiled her thanks. Her brothers were overbearing.</p><p>They were loud, protective and they certainly had their faults. Like not believing she needed to do anything more in life than look pretty and let them support her. But God love them, they were fierce in their loyalty to her, and she adored them for it.</p><p>Finally she turned to Dalton. \u201cYou I saw two weekends ago. Adam I haven\u2019t seen in forever.\u201d She glanced back at Adam. \u201cWhy is that anyway?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cSorry. Busy time of the year.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Adam, her oldest brother, owned a successful landscaping business and spring was always a hectic time. They rarely saw him until the fall when business started to slow.</p><p>Dalton slung an arm over Celia\u2019s shoulders and planted an affectionate kiss on her cheek. \u201cI see Mr.</p><p>Baseball is here. Must have caught a break before the season starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys going to the season opener?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cI have a favor to ask then.\u201d</p><p>Both brothers looked curiously at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bringing a client and I\u2019d like to keep my relationship to Noah on the down low.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity gleamed in their eyes. She knew they wanted to ask, but when she didn\u2019t volunteer her reasons why, they didn\u2019t pursue the matter.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Not a problem,\u201d Adam finally said.</p><p>\u201cAre you three going to stand out there all day or are you coming in to eat?\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s voice boomed from the front porch, and they turned to see him leaning against the doorframe, impatience evident in his stance.</p><p>Celia grinned. \u201cWe better go in before he starts muttering threats.\u201d</p><p>Adam ruffled her hair then tucked his arm over her neck so he had her in a headlock. He started toward the house, dragging her with him.</p><p>When they got to the porch, she laughingly stumbled from Adam\u2019s hold and gave her dad a quick hug.</p><p>He squeezed her and dropped a kiss on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Noah?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere he always is. Parked in front of the big screen, watching baseball.\u201d</p><p>She slipped past her father while he greeted his sons and entered the home she\u2019d grown up in. When she got to the living room, she saw Noah sprawled in the recliner, remote in hand as he flipped through footage of past baseball games.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she called.</p><p>He looked up, his eyes warming in welcome. As he got up, he smiled broadly at her then held out his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hugged him then made a show of feeling his ribs.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t feed you in training camp?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou know damn well that all I ever do is eat. I think my tapeworms have tapeworms.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back to make sure they were still alone and then lowered her voice.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to hang around later or do you have to be somewhere?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he lost the smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to be anywhere today. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about something. I have a favor to ask, and I\u2019d rather not get into it in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>He frowned now. \u201cIs everything okay, Cece? You in some kind of trouble? Do I need to kill anyone?\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re too valuable to go to prison. You\u2019d have Dalton do it anyway.\u201d</p><p>Noah smirked. \u201cThe pretty boy would be popular in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sick puppy. And no, nothing\u2019s wrong. Promise. Just want to run something by you that could be beneficial to us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you\u2019re going to be all mysterious on me. I guess I can wait until later. You want to go back to your place for a while? I\u2019d invite you to mine but the maid quit on me last week and it\u2019s not a pretty sight.</p><p>You do have food, right?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYes, I have food, and yes, we can go back to my place. For God\u2019s sake, Noah, how hard is it to pick up after yourself? Or if you can\u2019t do that, at least pick up the phone and get another maid service?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve sort of been blackballed,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI have to find an agency where my reputation hasn\u2019t preceded me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel so sorry for the woman you marry. She\u2019ll be in ten kinds of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry because that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Okay. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>They both looked up when the others spilled into the living room. Noah gave her arm a light squeeze and mouthed \u201clater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019ll be on the table in fifteen minutes,\u201d her father announced.</p><p>Her mouth watered. She didn\u2019t even know what her dad had cooked. It didn\u2019t matter. The man was a culinary genius.</p><p>Lunch was a rambunctious affair. Her brothers bickered and joked endlessly while her father looked on indulgently. She\u2019d missed all of this during her years in New York. Though she loathed the circumstances that brought her home, she was glad to be back in the comforting circle of her family. Even if they were all just a generation from knuckles-dragging-on-the-ground cavemen.</p> <p>After the table had been cleared, the argument started over what channel the television landed on. Noah didn\u2019t know anything but ESPN or the Food Network existed, Dalton liked anything that was mindless, particularly if explosions were involved, and Adam liked to torment his brothers by forcing them to watch gardening shows.</p><p>Celia settled back to enjoy the sights and sounds of home. Her father sat on the couch next to her and shook his head over his sons\u2019 antics.</p><p>It was the truth, she\u2019d fled the hovering overprotectiveness of her family. She\u2019d been determined to make her mark on the world while they wanted her to stay home, where they could support her and look out for her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a vain woman, but she knew men found her attractive. She was probably considered beautiful by most, but her looks had been the cause of a lot of problems in her life.</p><p>Because of her delicate looks, her brothers and even her father thought her job was just to look pretty and let them provide for her. She hadn\u2019t been encouraged to go to college\u2014she\u2019d done all of that on her own\u2014and they certainly hadn\u2019t wanted her to have a career in something as demanding as advertising.</p><p>She\u2019d ignored their objections. She\u2019d gotten her degree and after graduation, she\u2019d taken a job in New York City. After a couple of years, she\u2019d taken a position with a large, prestigious firm. She was on her way up. A promotion had just cemented her triumph. And then it had all come crashing down like a bridge in an earthquake.</p><p>Adam rising from his chair shook her from her angry thoughts. She forced her fingers to relax and winced at the marks she\u2019d left on her palms.</p><p>\u201cLeaving already?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Adam pulled her up into a bear hug. \u201cYeah. I need to check on a job. I\u2019ll see you at the season opener, though.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his cheek and patted his shoulder affectionately. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Dalton. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll be going, too, since you brought him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I have a date I\u2019ve got to get ready for anyway.\u201d</p><p>No one seemed surprised by that announcement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you guys out. I need to run, too. I have a pitch to prepare for.\u201d</p><p>Her father grimaced, and she steeled herself for another gruff lecture about how she worked too hard.</p><p>An interesting statement since Adam worked harder than all of them, and no one ever lectured him.</p><p>To her surprise, he remained silent. She regarded him with a raised eyebrow and wondered if he\u2019d burst at the seams, but his lips remained in a firm line. He rose from the couch to hug her and then gruffly reminded her to be sure and get enough rest.</p><p>They all walked out together, and her father reminded them all of lunch next Sunday. Celia waved to Adam and Dalton before climbing into her car. Noah stood, saying his goodbyes to their father, and she drove down the driveway. Noah would be along shortly and she needed to make sure her pantry would survive the assault.</p><p>Celia had just done a cursory examination of her stock of food\u2014cursing the fact she hadn\u2019t been to the market in far too long\u2014when the door buzzer sounded.</p><p>She strode across to the call box and mashed the button. \u201cThat you, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, buzz me in?\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, Noah walked in, and she smiled her welcome.</p><p>\u201cI know that smile,\u201d he said suspiciously. \u201cThat\u2019s a smile that says you lured me here under false pretenses. You don\u2019t have any food, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeeell, no. But I did just order pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, but I refuse to have a reasonable discussion until it gets here.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and punched him on the arm when he flopped on the sofa next to her. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t need a favor from you, I\u2019d make you pay for it.\u201d</p><p>His expression grew serious. \u201cSo what is this favor, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not asking you for anything until you have a full stomach. Again, since you ate not even three hours ago.\u201d</p><p>He grunted but didn\u2019t offer any argument. His stomach was too important.</p><p>He reached for the remote and flipped on the TV. A few seconds later, the sports recap was on, and he settled back against the couch.</p><p>The pizza didn\u2019t take long\u2014thanks to the bistro right around the corner offering delivery service. Soon the decadent smells of a completely loaded pizza filled her apartment. Despite all she\u2019d eaten at lunch, her stomach growled in anticipation. She eyed the gooey dripping cheese and grimaced. It might taste good, but it would go straight to her hips. Then again, that\u2019s what the treadmill was for.</p><p>She dropped the box on the coffee table in front of Noah, not bothering with plates. He eyed the mountain of toppings with something akin to bliss.</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d grabbed the first piece before she carefully took a slice and nibbled on the end. It was, in a word, sheer heaven. She leaned back and waited for Noah to down the first slice. When he was on his second, he turned and said around a mouthful of pizza, \u201cSo what\u2019s this favor you need?\u201d</p><p>She sat forward, putting half the slice down on a napkin.</p><p>\u201cI have this client...well he\u2019s a client I want to land. Evan Reese.\u201d</p><p>Noah stopped chewing. \u201cThe guy who sells athletic wear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah. He fired his last agency and has yet to sign with a new one. I want him. Maddox Communications wants him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So where do I fit into the picture?\u201d</p><p>For a moment her nerve deserted her, and then she mentally slapped herself upside the head. In her profession there was no room for the spineless. She hadn\u2019t worked her way into the confidence of Brock Maddox acting like a jellyfish.</p><p>\u201cI want you to agree to front his new line of athletic wear.\u201d</p><p>Noah blinked then he frowned, and finally he put down his half-eaten slice. For a moment he was quiet.</p><p>She waited, fully expecting him to say no or to launch into all the reasons why he didn\u2019t take endorsement</p><p>deals. She knew them all. But he did none of those things. Instead he studied her carefully, his gaze sliding over her features as though he was reaching right into her head and pulling out her every thought.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t ask why him. He was a huge name in baseball, and he was more sought after than any other professional athlete mainly because of his refusal to take endorsement deals. Instead of deterring companies, it made them all the more determined to be the first to lure Noah Hart to their brand.</p><p>She could beg. She could hurry through a prepared explanation as to why she needed him, but she wasn\u2019t going to wheedle and cajole.</p><p>Noah was still frowning as he studied her. \u201cThis is important to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cEvan is a big client. My boss is trusting me to land the account. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ll get him with or without you, but you\u2019d be the nail in his coffin. Plus it would be huge for you. Reese will pay a lot to have you be the spokesman for his sportswear.\u201d</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cI wish you\u2019d just quit this job. You don\u2019t have to work, and you know it. You don\u2019t have to prove yourself to anyone, Cece. Certainly not to your family. Adam, Dalton and I make more than enough money to support you. It would make Dad happy if you didn\u2019t have such a stressful job. He\u2019s convinced you\u2019ll have an ulcer before you\u2019re thirty.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly. \u201cI am thirty.\u201d</p><p>He shot her an impatient look.</p><p>\u201cLook, Noah, would you quit baseball just because your brothers make enough money to support you?</p><p>They do, you know.\u201d</p><p>A derisive, strangling sound rose from his throat. He licked his lips as if to rid himself of a really bad taste.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. You\u2019re a man, and I\u2019m a woman.\u201d Her lips curled in disgust. \u201cNoah, I love you dearly.</p><p>You\u2019re the best brother a girl could ask for. But you\u2019re a chauvinist to your toes.\u201d</p><p>He huffed but didn\u2019t dispute her accusation. Then his expression grew thoughtful again. \u201cI assume you\u2019ve done your research on this man and his company.\u201d</p><p>Celia nodded before he\u2019d even finished. On the surface, Noah looked and acted laissez-faire. He had all the appearances of a golden-boy jock whose only concern might be fast cars and faster women. But beneath that illusion lay a man who had a deep social conscience.</p><p>His refusal of endorsement deals had gained him a reputation of eccentricity from some. Others regarded him incredulously as a fool to pass on the opportunity to make millions by doing nothing more than lend his name to countless companies willing to part with their dollars for his endorsement. But the simple fact was that Noah did meticulous research on all the corporations that approached him, and so far none had passed muster with him.</p><p>\u201cE-mail it all to me. I\u2019ll take a look. If it checks out, I\u2019m willing to listen to his offer.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and kissed his cheek. \u201cThanks, Noah. You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll be so grateful that you\u2019ll volunteer to clean my apartment?\u201d</p><p>She snorted and picked up her slice of pizza again. \u201cPut it this way. I\u2019d rather quit my job and let you and Adam support me than clean your place.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cWell, damn. No need to be so mean about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. Oh, hey, I need one more favor.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he glared at her. \u201cYou just turn down my request for you to play cleaning lady and you insult me in the process and then have the cheek to want another favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I find you a replacement cleaning service? Then both of us are happy.\u201d</p><p>He got a hopeful puppy dog look that would probably make mush of most women. Thankfully she was his sister and completely immune to any adorableness on his part.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you find me someone to clear a path in my apartment and whatever this other favor of yours is I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow\u2014and you don\u2019t even know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould tell you how desperate I am,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She laughed and punched him in the arm. \u201cAll I need are two very cushy seats behind home plate for the season opener. I\u2019ll be taking Evan. Hopefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you how expensive you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, wait a second. A minute ago, you were trying to convince me to quit my job so you could support me.\u201d</p><p>His expression went from teasing to serious with one blink. \u201cI just worry about you, Cece. That\u2019s all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What happened in New York would have never occurred if\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and held her hand, halting him in mid-sentence. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about New York.\u201d</p><p>Regret flashed in his eyes. \u201cSorry. Consider it dropped.\u201d</p><p>She waited for her pulse to settle and then she forced a smile. \u201cSo you\u2019ll take a look at the research I\u2019ve compiled? You\u2019ll like Reese. He\u2019s a veritable Boy Scout. His employees love him. He has a cracking health-insurance plan. He\u2019s had no layoffs since his business started and he\u2019s not shipping jobs or production overseas. Let\u2019s see. What else? He\u2019s a regular contributor to a half dozen pet charities\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Noah held up his hands in surrender. \u201cOkay, okay, he\u2019s a saint. I get it. How do other men ever measure up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the sarcasm.\u201d</p><p>He checked his watch and let out a sigh. \u201cSorry to break this up so early, especially since I haven\u2019t finished the pizza.Somebody talked too much. Very distracting. E-mail me the stuff. I\u2019ll take a look. And the tickets will be waiting for you at the box office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were my favorite sibling,\u201d she said affectionately.</p><p>He dropped a kiss on top of her head then stood and stretched lazily.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call when I\u2019m through reading everything.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Evan walked into the suite of offices he leased for the times he was in San Francisco. It wasn\u2019t home, and though Union Square was a sumptuous neighborhood that catered to upscale businesses, he preferred the funky modern feel of Seattle.</p><p>He nodded a good morning to his receptionist but halted when she came out of her seat, a concerned expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go in there,\u201d Tanya said in a hushed whisper.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow when he realized she was gesturing toward his office.</p> <p>\u201cWhy the devil not?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She put one hand up to shield her mouth and then she tapped her finger against her palm\u2014in the direction of his office.</p><p>\u201cBecauseshe\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>Evan turned to stare down the hall toward his office, but the door was closed. Damn, but he didn\u2019t have time for this. He looked back at Tanya and tried to stifle his growing impatience. The girl was highly efficient if a little eccentric. But he liked unconventional, and while she\u2019d probably fit in better with his Seattle staff with her colored hair, multiple piercings and vintage 1930s clothing, he found she brought a sort of vibrancy to an otherwise stuffy office here.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Tanya. First of all, who the hell is \u2018she\u2019 and where is Vickie?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Vickie not to meet him as he got off the elevator. His longtime assistant traveled with him everywhere. She had an apartment here and in Seattle. She had an uncanny knack for knowing precisely when he\u2019d show up, and as a result she was always there, ready to pelt him with the day\u2019s obligations.</p><p>Tanya\u2019s face fell. \u201cOh, sir, did you not get your message? I left you two. Vickie\u2019s granddaughter was rushed to the hospital early this morning. They suspect appendicitis. She\u2019s in surgery now.\u201d</p><p>Evan frowned. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t get any such message. Keep me updated. I want to know the minute she\u2019s out of surgery. Send flowers and make sure Vickie has everything she might need. On second thought, send over food for the family. Hospital food is terrible. And arrange for a hospitality suite. If there is a</p> <p>hotel close to the hospital, have a block of rooms set aside for any of the family members.\u201d</p><p>Tanya blinked then hurriedly picked up a notepad and began scribbling.</p><p>Evan waited a moment then sighed. \u201cTanya?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, blinking, as if surprised to still see him standing there.</p><p>\u201cWho is the \u2018she\u2019 waiting in my office?\u201d</p><p>Tanya\u2019s nose curled in distaste. \u201cIt\u2019s Miss Hammond, sir. I couldn\u2019t stop her. She was quite imperious.</p><p>Told me she\u2019d wait for you.\u201d</p><p>It was all Evan could do not to look heavenward and ask \u201cwhy me?\u201d He glanced down the hall and briefly considered leaving. He had no patience for Bettina today, and after his mother had extracted his promise to attend this weekend\u2019s debacle, he couldn\u2019t imagine anything Bettina could have to say to him.</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted on Vickie\u2019s granddaughter,\u201d he said as he turned to go down to his office.</p><p>He opened the door and swept in, his gaze immediately finding Bettina. She was sitting on one of the sofas lining the window that overlooked the outdoor caf\u00e9s lining the sidewalk below.</p><p>\u201cBettina,\u201d he said as he tossed his briefcase onto his desk. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>Bettina rose, her hands going down to smooth her dress. The motion directed attention to her legs\u2014her self-admitted favorite personal attribute. The dress stopped almost at mid-thigh, which meant quite a lot of those legs were on display.</p><p>Evan wouldn\u2019t lie. He\u2019d enjoyed those legs. It was just too bad they were attached to the rest of her.</p><p>Her expression creased into one of fake pain. She crossed the room, holding her hands dramatically in front of her to grasp his.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you for agreeing to come to the wedding. It means the world to Mitchell and your mom and dad. I know how painful it must be. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it was for you to agree to go after I broke your heart.\u201d</p><p>Evan just stared at her. Part of him wanted to ask her what planet she existed on, but he already knew the answer to that. It was planet Bettina, where everything revolved around her. Did she honestly believe he was still pining for her?</p><p>\u201cCut the theatrics, Bettina. Why are you really here? You don\u2019t care if I show up or not, so why pretend otherwise? In fact, I\u2019d be willing to admit you hoped I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, and for a moment he saw bitterness in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLucy said you were bringing a...date. It was clever of you, really. But you don\u2019t fool me, Evan.</p><p>Everyone knows you haven\u2019t been serious about anyone since me. Who is she? Someone you\u2019ve met socially? Do you know anything about her? Does she know she\u2019s going as an accessory? God knows that\u2019s all I ever was to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways, Bettina. Either I was serious about you or you were an accessory,\u201d he drawled. \u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>She flushed angrily. \u201cI only meant that you haven\u2019t dated any woman more than once since I broke things off with you.\u201d</p><p>He made an exaggerated expression of surprise. \u201cYou flatter me. I had no idea you were so interested in who I date. I would have thought my brother kept you too occupied to monitor my love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring your date, Evan. But you know and I know she isn\u2019t me. She\u2019ll never be me. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll take anything away from my wedding day.\u201d</p><p>With that she stalked out of his office, leaving Evan to shake his head. He really ought to call his brother and thank him profusely.</p><p>He sank into his chair and opened his day planner. Vickie kept meticulous records of all appointments for just such rare occasions that she was out of pocket. He frowned when he saw his calendar was full.</p><p>Except for one forty-five-minute window for lunch.</p><p>His mind immediately went to Celia. Celia, whose office was just two blocks from his. He\u2019d planned to call her, but a proposition such as he had in mind was really better delivered in person. He wouldn\u2019t have a lot of time, and he doubted she had much free time, either, but he knew without arrogance that if he asked her to lunch, she wouldn\u2019t refuse. She wanted his business too badly.</p><p>He hit the button to call Vickie then quickly remembered she wasn\u2019t there. He connected to Tanya instead.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanya, I need Celia Taylor of Maddox Communications on the phone.\u201d</p><p>Celia stepped out of the elevator and was met with a cheerful hello from Shelby, the receptionist for Maddox Communications. Shelby was young and friendly. She also had superb organization skills and a memory like a steel trap. Which made her a perfect asset. But more importantly, she knew everything about everyone at Maddox. There wasn\u2019t a piece of juicy gossip floating around that Shelby didn\u2019t know, and she didn\u2019t mind sharing it. Celia found it useful to keep in the know. Never again would she be caught off guard like she\u2019d been in her last job.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Shelby,\u201d Celia returned as she paused in front of Shelby\u2019s desk. \u201cAny messages for me?\u201d</p><p>Shelby\u2019s eyes twinkled and she leaned forward to whisper conspiratorially. \u201cLatest rumors that have surfaced are about the boss man and his assistant.\u201d</p><p>Celia frowned. \u201cYou mean, him and Elle?\u201d</p><p>Elle didn\u2019t seem like the type to indulge in a torrid office affair and definitely not with her boss. Celia felt compelled to warn Elle about the potential pitfalls of even having such a rumor circulate, but it was just a rumor, and Elle might not appreciate Celia broaching the subject.</p><p>Shelby shrugged. \u201cWell, they do seem to spend a lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they do. She\u2019s his assistant,\u201d Celia pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI just repeat what others are saying.\u201d</p><p>Celia gripped her briefcase a little tighter. It wouldn\u2019t do her any good to get involved. Brock and Elle were adults. She just hoped Elle wasn\u2019t hurt by the idle gossip.</p><p>\u201cHey, Shelby,\u201d Celia began as she remembered why she\u2019d stopped to begin with. \u201cI need you to look up a cleaning service.\u201d She dug around in her briefcase then pulled out a sheet of paper that had all the names of the agencies Noah had already contacted. She handed it over the counter to Shelby. \u201cThese are the ones marked off the list of possibilities. I need you to make it clear this is a demanding client and that he\u2019s a slob through and through. Money is no object but whoever the poor soul is who takes the job will definitely earn their paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Shelby\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cNoah Hart.The Noah Hart? He needs a housekeeper? I\u2019m available. I mean, I can totally quit here, right?\u201d</p><p>Celia shot her a \u201cget real\u201d look. \u201cLet me know if you find someone. Oh, and I\u2019m expecting a call from Evan Reese\u2019s assistant. I don\u2019t care what I\u2019m doing or who I\u2019m with, make sure I get that call.\u201d</p><p>As she walked away, Shelby called out to her. \u201cHey, wait. How do you know Noah Hart? He\u2019s not a client of Maddox.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled and kept walking toward her office. Normally she\u2019d stop in on some of her coworkers, say hello, get a feel for what the day\u2019s events were, but she was already running late, thanks to a breakfast meeting going well into the brunch hour. She needed to play catch-up on phone messages and e-mails before a full afternoon of client calls and a staff meeting to close out the day.</p><p>She\u2019d made a sizeable dent in the backlog of messages when her interoffice intercom buzzed.</p><p>\u201cCelia, Mr. Reese is on line two.\u201d</p><p>Celia frowned. \u201cMr. Reese himself or Mr. Reese\u2019s assistant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Reese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut him through,\u201d she said crisply.</p><p>She wiped her hand on her skirt then shook her head. What did she have to be nervous about? As soon as the phone rang, she picked it up.</p><p>\u201cCelia Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelia, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Even his voice sent a bolt of awareness through her body. When would she stop acting like a teenage girl in the throes of her first sexual awakening? It was ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t professional.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Evan. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time. I wanted to meet for lunch today. That is, if your schedule permits?\u201d</p><p>There was a note of confidence in his voice. He knew damn well she wouldn\u2019t say no. Hastily, she checked the clock.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Panic scuttled around her stomach. Now? She wasn\u2019t prepared to meet him now. Surely he didn\u2019t want to reschedule their informal pitch session from Friday to now?</p><p>\u201cI thought we had a lunch date on Friday?\u201d</p><p>She was stalling as her brain scrambled to catch up. \u201cI want to discuss Friday today. There\u2019s been a change of plans.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sank. There was no way she could have her act together right now.</p><p>\u201cI only have forty-five minutes,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re two blocks apart. Shall we meet in the middle?</p><p>Our choices are French, Italian or good ole American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for anything,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>She propped the phone between her shoulder and her ear and began frantically digging for her notes on his account. She stuffed everything into a folder and reached for her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Shall we meet in say five minutes? I\u2019ll start out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, meet you there.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and for a moment she stood there like a moron, the phone still stuck to her ear. Then she slammed it down, took in a deep steadying breath and declared battle.</p><p>She could do this in her sleep.</p><p>Slinging the bag over her shoulder, she all but jogged out of her office and down the hallway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She passed Ash Williams, Maddox\u2019s CFO, who held up a finger and opened his mouth to say something to her.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Ash, she called as she hustled by. \u201cLate for an important lunch date.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even look to see his reaction.</p><p>She ran past Shelby and hollered back as she punched the button for the elevator.</p> <p>\u201cIf Brock asks, I\u2019m having lunch with Mr. Reese. Just tell him Friday got moved up. If anyone else asks, just tell them I\u2019ll return this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>The elevator opened and she ducked in. As she turned around, she saw Shelby\u2019s look of befuddlement just as the doors slid shut again.</p><p>When she reached the lobby, she stopped in the bathroom long enough to check her appearance. She wouldn\u2019t stop traffic for sure, but at least she didn\u2019t look as frazzled as she felt.</p><p>The heels she\u2019d chosen to complete her outfit were fabulous\u2014as long as she didn\u2019t have to actually walk in them. A trek down the block on uneven cement sidewalks wasn\u2019t what she had in mind. She kept tennis shoes in her office for just such occasions, but five minutes notice on the most important lunch date of her career didn\u2019t give her time to worry over footwear. She\u2019d just suck it up.</p><p>When she crossed the street to the next block, she realized she never had gotten where they were supposed to meet. Italian, French or American. Her gaze scanned the bright umbrellas scattered along the sidewalk caf\u00e9s, first on her side of the street and then across.</p> <p>A vacuum formed, sucking all the oxygen right out of her lungs the moment she laid eyes on him. He stood in the sunlight, one hand shoved into the pocket of his slacks, the other holding a phone to his ear.</p><p>Power. There was an aura of power that surrounded him, and it drew her like a magnet. For a moment, she just stood watching him in absolute girly delight. He was simply...delicious looking.</p><p>Then he turned slightly and found her. How, she wasn\u2019t sure given how busy the street was, but he locked onto her immediately almost as if he\u2019d sensed her perusal.</p><p>She straightened and started forward, embarrassed to have been caught staring.</p><p>She crossed the street, hugging her briefcase between her arm and her side. Evan watched her approach, lean hunger gleaming in his eyes. His features relaxed into a smile as she drew abreast of him.</p><p>\u201cRight on time.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, not wanting to betray how out of breath she was from her flight from her office.</p><p>\u201cI chose good ole American,\u201d he said as he gestured toward a nearby table. \u201cI hope that was all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He held out his arm for her to precede him to the table at the end of the row. She sat, grateful to be off her feet, and placed her briefcase beside her.</p><p>He took his seat across from her and motioned for the waiter.</p><p>\u201cWould you like wine?\u201d Evan asked Celia when the waiter approached.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re having is fine.\u201d</p><p>Evan relayed his request and then looked over at Celia. \u201cI asked you to lunch because I\u2019m afraid something has come up and we won\u2019t be able to make our lunch date on Friday.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded then reached down for her briefcase. \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I brought along the information I</p><p>wanted to present\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached over and circled her wrist with his fingers. \u201cThat isn\u2019t why I invited you to lunch.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and let go of her briefcase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still like to keep our appointment...I\u2019d just like to change the location.\u201d</p><p>She was royally confused now, and it must have shown. Amusement twinkled in his eyes and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of time today, so let me come straight to the point.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were still around her wrist, though they\u2019d loosened, and his thumb moved idly over her pulse point. She was sure her pulse was racing. It probably felt like a train under his fingers. She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Didn\u2019t even breathe. She didn\u2019t want to lose the marvelous sensation of his touch. Did he have any idea just how devastating his effect on her was?</p><p>\u201cI have a wedding this weekend.\u201d She could swear his lips curled in distaste. \u201cA family wedding. My brother is getting married on Catalina Island. I\u2019m to be there Thursday evening, hence the reason I can\u2019t make our Friday meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can reschedule at your convenience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to go with me.\u201d</p><p>Before she could call back the reaction, her eyes widened and she pulled her hand from his. She put it in her lap and cupped her other hand over it, wanting to preserve the sensation of his fingers over hers.</p><p>He put up his hand in an impatient gesture then lowered it and fiddled with the napkin on the table. He seemed almost uneasy. She cocked her head, curious now as to what he would say next.</p><p>\u201cMy schedule is quite busy. I need to move on this new campaign. I can\u2019t spare weeks searching for a new agency. If you went with me, I could listen to your ideas. I realize a wedding isn\u2019t ideal. I\u2019d rather be just about any other place myself.\u201d</p><p>Though it certainly wasn\u2019t voiced as a threat, it was certainly implied. If she went with him, he\u2019d listen to her pitch. If she didn\u2019t he might not have time for her when he returned.</p><p>Worry knotted her stomach. Tagging along to a family wedding seemed entirely too personal even if the purpose was solely business. Not to mention it was hard enough to battle her attraction for him in a business setting. But something as intimate as a wedding?</p><p>\u201cHow long would we be...away?\u201d</p><p>The question came out more as a squeak than a concise, professional query. She sounded like a scared little girl facing the big bad wolf. Oh, but Evan made such a yummy wolf.</p><p>It was all she could do not to put her head on the table and bang a few times.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d fly out Thursday evening. Rehearsal and dinner on Friday, wedding Saturday with reception to follow and since it will likely go well into the night, we\u2019d return Sunday.\u201d</p><p>It would only require one missed day of work. No one but Brock would even need to know, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t spill the beans.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she hadn\u2019t immediately agreed. She couldn\u2019t afford to say no. He had her over a barrel and he damn well knew it. Still, she hesitated\u2014if for no other reason than to let him know he didn\u2019t call all the shots.</p><p>Okay, so maybe he did, but it didn\u2019t hurt him to think otherwise. For two seconds.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said in as level a voice as she could manage.</p><p>Did he expect her to attend the festivities? It certainly sounded as though he did by the way he outlined the events. She supposed it would be rude to tag along and lurk in the shadows waiting for her appointed time. Or maybe he envisioned having her follow him around everywhere so he could fit in snatches of conversation when possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to purchase any items you may need for the trip,\u201d he said.</p><p>Startled, she glanced up. \u201cNo, I mean...no. Of course not. I can manage just fine. You\u2019ll need to tell me the appropriate dress code of course.\u201d</p><p>He managed a wry smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure anything to do with Bettina will be formal. Quite formal with lots of glitter and fanfare.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slid sensuously over her features and then lower until her neck heated with a blush.</p><p>\u201cI think anything you wear will be stunning. The dress you wore the other night was perfection on you.\u201d</p><p>The blush climbed higher and she prayed her cheeks didn\u2019t look like twin torches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can find something glitzy and glamorous,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cWe girls do like the opportunity to play dress up.\u201d</p><p>Interest sparked in his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>The waiter returned with the wine, and Celia latched gratefully onto the glass. Her hands shook. She was sure if she stood, she\u2019d go down like a brick. She\u2019d break an ankle trying to stay up on these ridiculous heels.</p><p>Note to self: Don\u2019t pack gorgeous, sexy shoes for the weekend. Around him, she\u2019d be a disaster on stilts. He\u2019d spend his entire time picking her up off the floor, that is if she didn\u2019t end up in the hospital in traction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later in the week with the flight arrangements. We\u2019ll be taking my private jet.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and nodded, then realizing he\u2019d need her number\u2014her cell number and not her office number\u2014she reached down into her briefcase to retrieve a business card.</p><p>She frowned, fumbled some more then pulled the bag into her lap. With a groan she realized her business-card holder must have fallen out. Impatiently she tore a piece of paper off a notepad and took</p><p>out her pen.</p><p>Dropping the bag again, she put the paper on the table and hastily scribbled her home and cell number then passed it across the table to Evan.</p><p>He took it, studied it a moment then carefully folded it and tucked it away in the breast pocket of his jacket. The waiter approached with menus and Evan looked to her for her order.</p><p>\u201cJust the lunch salad,\u201d she said. What she really wanted was a really greasy burger with onion rings, but she didn\u2019t want to appall Evan. Her brothers gave her all sorts of hell for her indelicate tastes, but then they were to blame for them.</p><p>Evan ordered a steak, medium, and after the waiter was gone, Evan stared over at her, his gaze inquisitive.</p><p>She cocked her head, prepared for him to ask her a question, but he didn\u2019t say anything. He just seemed to study her as if he wanted to uncover all her deep, dark secrets.</p><p>Finally he sat back with a satisfied smile. His eyes glinted with triumph.</p><p>\u201cI think this wedding is going to turn out to be enjoyable after all.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Celia stepped off the elevator and walked by Shelby, who held her hand up to get Celia\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cLater, Shelby,\u201d she called as she headed for Brock\u2019s office.</p><p>When she got to his door, she was nearly run over as Ash came out. He sidestepped her and kept on walking, his forehead wrinkled as if he were lost in thought. She wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d seen her.</p><p>She stuck her head in Brock\u2019s door and breathed a sigh of relief when she found him alone. He glanced up and motioned her in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with him?\u201d she asked, jerking her head over her shoulder in Ash\u2019s direction. \u201cHe\u2019s been weird lately.\u201d</p><p>Brock gave her one of those puzzled male looks that suggested he didn\u2019t have a clue what she was talking about. She rolled her eyes. Ash had been walking around in a fog, which wasn\u2019t typical. He was usually on top of everything and everyone. Celia had overheard Shelby talking about a falling out with a girlfriend, but then she hadn\u2019t even known Ash had been seeing anyone. Not that he would have confided in her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother sitting. She had too much to do, and this wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cI have to go out of town Thursday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Brock stared back at her for a moment and then his brows drew together. He frowned and dropped the</p><p>pen he\u2019d been fiddling with.</p><p>\u201cIs this some kind of emergency? You\u2019re supposed to meet with Evan Reese on Friday.\u201d</p><p>His tone suggested someone better be dying. He opened his mouth to say more but before he got off on the tangent she knew was coming, she held up her hand.</p><p>\u201cI just had lunch with Evan. There\u2019s been a change in plans. He has to be at some family wedding this weekend in Catalina so he couldn\u2019t make it on Friday. He said he wants to move on this campaign and he doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to spend in the selection process.\u201d</p><p>Brock swore, his face going red. He picked the pen back up and flung it across his desk. \u201cDammit, is he even going to listen to our pitch?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cHe wants me to go to Catalina with him. We\u2019d leave Thursday afternoon. It\u2019s the only time he can spare me and he\u2019s promised to listen to my ideas while we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>Brock\u2019s brow furrowed further and he studied her intently. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Forgetting about all she needed to do and that she didn\u2019t want to be stuck here in Brock\u2019s office forever, she sank down into one of the chairs and stared glumly at her boss.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d go. I didn\u2019t see that I had a choice. While he didn\u2019t come out and say it, he implied that if I didn\u2019t, he was prepared to go with another agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree you should go. Does that make me an ass?\u201d</p><p>Celia laughed, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make you an ass. I guess I just worry about the fallout. It\u2019s stupid. I shouldn\u2019t care. I never would have before, but I know what will be said if it gets out and how things will be twisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my support, Celia, and you have the support of the agency. Don\u2019t ever doubt that.\u201d</p><p>She rose and smiled gratefully at him. \u201cThank you, Brock.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cGet me the damn account. That\u2019s all the thanks I need.\u201d</p><p>She stopped on her way out, put her hand on the door frame and looked back. \u201cI\u2019ll need someone to cover for me on Friday. I have two client appointments, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJason will cover for you.

You\u2019d be amazed how</p><p>dangerous a pair of dirty underwear can be.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWould you at least try not to send the maid screaming from your house on her first day? That\u2019s just gross.\u201d</p><p>He made a derisive sound. \u201cSo I read through the info you sent. I also had my agent do some checking.</p> <p>I might add that my agent is orgasmic that I\u2019m considering this endorsement deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I expect a nice Christmas gift as thank you,\u201d Celia said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. He doesn\u2019t even give his mother presents.\u201d</p><p>Usually she wouldn\u2019t mind chatting mindlessly with her siblings, but she had a hundred things to do before Thursday, including figure out how she was going to survive a weekend on an island with a man who made mincemeat of her willpower.</p><p>\u201cSo does this mean you\u2019ll consider it?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and she found herself holding her breath.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He checks out. He seems as solid as you said he was. I\u2019ll talk to him if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She did a double-fist pump and dropped her bag on the floor by her desk.</p><p>\u201cHave his people call my people,\u201d Noah said airily.</p><p>Celia laughed. \u201cI am his people. Or at least I will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you going to be at Dad\u2019s this weekend?\u201d</p><p>She winced when she remembered that she\u2019d told their father she would indeed be there for Sunday dinner again.</p><p>\u201cAfraid not. Something\u2019s come up.\u201d</p><p>Noah made a disapproving sound. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever take off? It\u2019s Sunday, for Pete\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s work?\u201d she defended. \u201cMaybe I have a hot date.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cWhen was the last time you went on a hot date? It\u2019s always work with you.\u201d</p><p>Knowing they were about to get into lecture territory again, Celia cut him off before he got carried away.</p><p>\u201cHey, I have to run, Noah. Have a meeting in five minutes. I\u2019ll call you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Before he could call her a liar, she hung up and plopped into her chair. She blew out a long sigh of relief and closed her eyes.</p><p>It was all coming together. Not without a few potholes, but it was within reach. All she had to do was hold it together and get through the weekend and the account would be hers.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock.\u201d</p><p>Celia opened her eyes to see Jason Reagart standing in her doorway.</p><p>\u201cBrock told me I needed to cover for you on Friday, so I stopped by so you could get me up to speed on what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, have a seat. Give me a minute. Been running all morning. I\u2019ll dig out my notes.\u201d</p><p>Jason eased into a chair, his long legs eating up most of the space between it and her desk. Celia picked up her beleaguered briefcase and opened it on her desk.</p><p>\u201cSo how is Lauren?\u201d</p><p>She hated idle conversation, but the silence was more awkward and she hadn\u2019t planned on having to turn over the two meetings to anyone, so her notes were haphazard at best.</p><p>\u201cPregnant. Grumpy. You know, typical pregnant woman.\u201d</p><p>Celia scowled at him over the top of her briefcase. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t be if you had to deal with water retention, hormones and arrogant men?\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cHey, I spoil her rotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should. Ah, here we go.\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a folder and tossed it to Jason.</p><p>\u201cEverything you need to know for the morning meeting is on pages one through three. This isn\u2019t a big deal. They just need a little hand holding and a little ego stroking. Bowl them over with how Maddox is going to make them look good while increasing their exposure by three hundred percent and they\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Jason flipped through the pages, his brow creased in concentration. She felt comfortable leaving her clients in his very capable hands. He took his job very seriously and moreover, he was damn good at what he did. Maddox had landed a huge account thanks to him, and if Celia had her way, she was going to top that by landing Evan Reese.</p><p>\u201cAnd the afternoon meeting?\u201d Jason asked.</p><p>\u201cHopefully you can read my notes. I have the PowerPoint presentation ready to go. They need to view it and sign off or suggest any changes so we can move it into the production stage. Impress upon them that this is their last chance to see it before it goes nationwide so make sure they\u2019re happy with it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and straightened the papers before closing the folder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of it.</p><p>Brock said you were going to be out of town. Hope everything is all right.\u201d</p><p>There was a subtle question there, and she knew he hoped she\u2019d expound on her reasons for not being there on Friday. She was just grateful Brock hadn\u2019t told him where she was going and why.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine, and thank you again for stepping in on such short notice. I owe you one.</p><p>Send Lauren my love. I\u2019ll have to remember to buy her a gift certificate from my favorite spa. I can\u2019t think of a pregnant woman alive who wouldn\u2019t appreciate a massage.\u201d</p><p>Jason sent her a disgruntled look. \u201cI don\u2019t want some beefcake putting his hands on my wife.\u201d</p><p>Celia rolled her eyes. \u201cThe poor woman can\u2019t see her feet and is probably miserable, and you\u2019re going to be picky about who gives her some relief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I am!\u201d</p><p>Celia made a shooing motion with her hands. \u201cOut. I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>And she made a mental note to call her salon and make an appointment for Lauren. She\u2019d ask for the hunkiest massage therapist they had.</p><p>Five</p><p>The car that Evan had sent to collect Celia pulled up to the plane parked on the paved landing area that led to the single runway and stopped just a few feet from where the door to the jet lay open.</p><p>Celia looked out the window to see Evan standing a short distance away. He was waiting for her.</p><p>The driver opened her door, and she stepped into the afternoon sun. She blinked a few times then pulled her shades from her head over her eyes. Maybe then it wouldn\u2019t be so obvious how she ate Evan up with her gaze.</p><p>He was dressed casually. Jeans, polo shirt and loafers. She\u2019d only ever seen him in suits, and she hadn\u2019t imagined he could look better. She was wrong. So, so wrong.</p><p>The jeans cupped him in all the right places. They clung to his thighs, rounded his butt and molded to his groin. They weren\u2019t new, starchy-looking jeans, either. They were faded and worn, just like a good pair of jeans should be.</p><p>\u201cCelia,\u201d he said with a nod as she approached. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready, we can be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to get my luggage...\u201d</p><p>She turned to see that the driver was handing her luggage to a uniformed man.</p><p>\u201cOkay then, I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>He smiled and motioned for her to precede him onto the plane. She mounted the steps and ducked inside.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the luxurious interior. It was simple and understated, but she recognized it for what it was. Very expensive comfort. She shoved her shades up so she could get a better look.</p><p>There was nothing gaudy about any of the furnishings. It looked very masculine. It even smelled</p><p>masculine. Leather and suede. Earth tones.</p><p>Beyond the three rows of seats, there was a small sitting area with a couch and one chair with a coffee table and a television. To her left between the seats and the cockpit was a small galley area complete with a steward.</p><p>The older man smiled at her and welcomed her on board.</p><p>As she and Evan took their seats, the steward introduced himself as William and asked her if she wanted a drink.</p><p>She glanced at Evan then back at William. \u201cDo you have wine?\u201d</p><p>William smiled. \u201cBut of course. Mr. Reese keeps the airplane stocked with all the necessities.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d agree that wine was very necessary.</p><p>A few moments later, William returned with two glasses of wine.</p><p>\u201cThe pilot wished me to tell you he is ready for takeoff at your convenience.\u201d</p><p>Evan took the glasses and offered one to Celia.</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir. I\u2019ll close the doors and we\u2019ll take off shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComfortable?\u201d Evan asked Celia.</p><p>She settled back into her seat and sipped at her wine. \u201cMmm, very. Nice jet.\u201d</p><p>She should have sat across the aisle from him, but that would be rude since he\u2019d chosen the seat next to her. His nearness was killing her, though. His scent drifted enticingly across her nostrils and she couldfeel his heat. When he moved, his arm brushed against hers, and short of shifting in her seat\u2014which would be terribly obvious\u2014there was no escaping him. Furthermore, she didn\u2019t really want to.</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to suggest they use the time on the flight to go over her ideas, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to have business intrude.</p><p>She mentally shook herself. Intrude on what? This wasn\u2019t some romantic getaway. Itwas business. Only business and nothing else.</p><p>It was unfair that she should be attracted to someone who was a solid no in her rule book. She\u2019d never broken that unspoken rule. She had never been tempted to get involved with someone she worked with, or worse\u2014a client. It didn\u2019t matter, though, because she\u2019d carry the stigma of someone who advanced her career by bestowing sexual favors.</p><p>The memory sent rage curdling through her veins. She had to work at keeping her fingers relaxed. She\u2019d worked damn hard to go beyond her family\u2019s expectations. And to have it all taken away by someone in a position of power over her made her head explode.</p><p>The advertising community was small, and gossip was rampant. She was under no illusion that fleeing New York made it possible for her to leave what happened behind. It hadn\u2019t been private. It had been very, very public.</p><p>She knew speculation ran wide. She knew people talked. Knew her coworkers probably whispered behind her back and pondered the possibility that she\u2019d slept with Brock or Flynn Maddox to secure her position in the agency and to be granted the opportunity to land Evan Reese\u2019s account. They probably thought she\u2019d do whatever it took to persuade Evan.</p><p>The only person she\u2019d bothered to defend herself to was Brock, and she figured she owed him that much if he was going to hire her. Only he knew the truth about what really happened at her former agency. And when he\u2019d assured her that she\u2019d suffer no such situation here, she\u2019d believed him. It might make her unbelievably naive after her last run-in with her boss, but Brock struck her as a deeply honorable man, and more importantly, someone who kept his word.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s softly spoken question jarred her from her thoughts. His hand had gone to hers, and he carefully uncurled her fingers that were wound so tightly that the tips were white.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a fear of flying?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSorry. I was thinking about something else.\u201d</p><p>He studied her intently, his gaze stroking her cheeks and then her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSeems a shame to waste time on such unpleasant thoughts.\u201d</p><p>The urge to deny that her thoughts had been unpleasant lasted all of about two seconds. She wrinkled her nose and grinned ruefully.</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI like an honest woman.\u201d</p><p>It was then she realized that they were already in the air. Wow, she really must have been intensely lost in thought to have missed the takeoff.</p><p>\u201cRelax. There\u2019ll be plenty of time to discuss business during our stay. Let\u2019s begin the trip by enjoying the short flight.\u201d</p><p>Either she was exceedingly transparent or he\u2019d just anticipated her jumping into things right away. Either way, she was perfectly willing to delay their discussion until she felt a little more on equal footing. Sitting here in such close proximity on his jet, drinking his wine...it was more than a little overwhelming.</p><p>His hand remained on hers, his thumb sliding idly over her knuckles in a soothing pattern. She liked it.</p><p>She liked it too much.</p><p>Survive, Celia. Survive this weekend. Be a professional. After this weekend you\u2019ll only have to see him in a business environment.</p><p>She swallowed and let calm descend. There was no way she\u2019d screw this opportunity up just because she couldn\u2019t get all her girly hormones in check.</p><p>The flight went quickly, and oddly, after the first awkward moments, Celia sat back and enjoyed the casual conversation with Evan. William had kept a steady presence to refill their wineglasses and offer a variety of finger foods. By the time they landed at the Airport in the Sky, Celia was limber and completely relaxed. Probably due to the wine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were met by a hotel representative and were quickly whisked into a waiting shuttle. It only took a few minutes to arrive at the gorgeous beachfront resort. It was so beautiful, it took her breath away.</p><p>The sunset over the water gave the place a decidedly romantic feel, but then they were here for a wedding, so Celia supposed it was only appropriate that romance positively danced on the air.</p><p>Evan escorted Celia through the glass doors into the lobby. A bellhop followed behind with a rolling cart that held their luggage.</p><p>\u201cWait right here,\u201d Evan murmured. \u201cTake a seat if you like. I\u2019ll get our room keys so we can go up.\u201d</p> <p>Before he could go, a feminine voice rent the air.</p><p>\u201cEvan! Oh, Evan, you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>Evan stiffened against Celia. He went positively rigid, and Celia could swear she heard him curse under his breath. Celia turned in the direction of the call and saw a regally dressed older woman hurrying across the lobby, her heels tapping delicately on the polished floor.</p><p>Behind her, a grim faced older gentleman flanked by a younger woman and a man who looked slightly younger than Evan, walked slower but with no less purpose in Evan\u2019s direction.</p><p>To her surprise, Evan took her left hand in his and held it close to his side. He fumbled with her fingers even as he looked up with a welcoming smile. It looked completely forced to Celia, but the woman didn\u2019t seem put off.</p> <p>The woman threw her arms around Evan, and still, he didn\u2019t let go of Celia\u2019s hand. He returned her embrace with his free arm and said, \u201cHello, Mom. I told you I was coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but after Bettina told me she\u2019d been to see you and when she told me that...\u201d</p><p>She broke off and looked curiously at Celia, whose hand was still securely held in Evan\u2019s.</p><p>Then his mom looked back at Bettina, confusion clear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut my dear, you told me that Evan wasn\u2019t seeing anyone, that he just told me that to ease my concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d Evan asked in an even tone. He pinned Bettina with a stare that would have had Celia fidgeting.</p> <p>His mom nudged him impatiently. \u201cWell, introduce us, Evan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, do introduce us,\u201d Bettina said in a chilly voice.</p><p>About the time she felt Evan\u2019s grip on her hand tighten and the cool metal slide over her finger, Celia regretted having agreed to come. She tried to look down, wondering what Evan had done to her finger, but he kept his hand over hers. Awkward didn\u2019t begin to cover it. She felt as if she\u2019d just entered a minefield.</p><p>\u201cMom. Dad. Bettina. Mitchell.\u201d His lips curled when he said the last and Celia zeroed in on the man in question. He had to be Evan\u2019s brother. The similarity was striking. \u201cI\u2019d like you to meet\u2014\u201d His entire body tensed and he gripped her hand almost painfully. It was like he was sending her a silent message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to meet my fianc\u00e9e, Celia Taylor.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>Celia froze. There was a horrible buzz in her ears, and she stared in horror at Evan. She hadn\u2019t heard him right. What kind of idiotic thing had he just done?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure who was more stunned. Her or his family. Bettina looked as if she just swallowed a lemon. Mitchell looked annoyed, while Evan\u2019s father simply frowned. His mom was the only person who actually seemed happy about the bomb.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Evan, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Celia found herself in the older woman\u2019s arms and was hugged so tight that she was in danger of passing out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to meet you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>She held Celia out at arm\u2019s length and beamed at her. Then she proceeded to kiss her on both cheeks and if that wasn\u2019t enough, she yanked her into another long hug.</p><p>This was insane. Evan was insane. His entire family was nuts. She opened her mouth to blast Evan with both barrels and ask him what the hell kind of stunt he was trying to pull when Evan\u2019s father put his hand on Evan\u2019s shoulder to steer him away from the women.</p><p>\u201cCome with me and we\u2019ll get you checked in and get your keys. Then you can take Celia up to the room.\u201d</p><p>Evan looked a little reluctant to leave her. She could well imagine why.</p><p>It was then that she remembered her finger. He\u2019d put something on her finger.</p><p>She looked down. Holy cow! He\u2019d slipped a huge diamond engagement ring on her finger while he\u2019d held her hand. Fury simmered in her veins. She mentally counted to ten just so she didn\u2019t explode on the spot. The bastard had planned this all along. No one carried around a rock like this for the hell of it.</p><p>\u201cYou two go on ahead and be seated. Order our drinks. Marshall and I will be along in just a moment. I want the chance to speak to Celia for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Celia regarded Evan\u2019s mom warily as she shooed Mitchell and Bettina on toward the hotel restaurant.</p><p>When they\u2019d disappeared, only after Bettina had glared enough holes in Celia to rival a hunk of Swiss cheese, Evan\u2019s mom seized Celia\u2019s hands and squeezed affectionately.</p><p>\u201cOh, my dear, I\u2019m so thrilled to meet you. I can\u2019t tell you how fantastic your news is. I was so worried about Evan. He didn\u2019t take Bettina\u2019s defection very well, but look at you! Even more gorgeous than Bettina. I can see why Evan was so taken with you.\u201d</p><p>Celia opened her mouth and halted. What on earth could she say? With every word that poured out of the other woman\u2019s mouth, the more furious Celia became and the more sickened she was by Evan\u2019s deception.</p><p>This was some huge soap opera. Things like this didn\u2019t happen in real life. Even in really wealthy people\u2019s lives, surely.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t think I introduced myself...well, other than as Evan\u2019s mother. I\u2019m Lucy. Please do call me Lucy. Mrs. Reese just sounds so formal and we\u2019re going to be family after all.\u201d</p><p>Celia\u2019s heart sank. Lucy obviously was a really wonderful lady and super kindhearted, which only made her angrier that Evan had just lied to her. What the hell had he been thinking?</p><p>But then Lucy\u2019s other statement came back to her. The part about Bettina\u2019s defection, and suddenly it all made sense.</p><p>\u201cBettina and Evan were involved?\u201d Celia asked.</p><p>Lucy colored slightly and looked abashed. \u201cOh, heavens, I\u2019ve said too much. I always do have a problem with just prattling on. Do forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Truly. It is one of those things women like to know. Men are so thick when it comes to these things, but if any awkwardness can be avoided, I would like to know.\u201d</p><p>And she could go straight to hell for lying, too. She\u2019d just make sure Evan got there first for his role in this debacle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the past. Rest assured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Celia said drily.</p><p>\u201cEvan and Bettina were engaged. It was a long engagement. The truth of the matter is, I\u2019m just not sure how much of Evan\u2019s affections were engaged. Bettina and Mitchell fell in love, and well, it\u2019s obvious to anyone that those two were meant for each other. Evan didn\u2019t take it well, though, and if I hadn\u2019t begged him to come to the wedding, I have no doubt he wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled and reached out to touch Celia\u2019s arm. \u201cBettina led me to believe that Evan was just going on about being involved because he wasn\u2019t over her yet and didn\u2019t want to worry me, but I can see that isn\u2019t the case. You\u2019re even more beautiful than Bettina. I can tell by the way he looks at you that he\u2019s</p><p>besotted. He never looked at Bettina that way.\u201d</p><p>You are such a sucker, Celia. There should be a law about being so stupid when it came to men. But then she\u2019d spend a lot of time behind bars if that were the case.</p><p>She felt Evan\u2019s approach. It was hard to miss all that tension. Celia glanced up and met his gaze, and she didn\u2019t at all try to disguise her fury. Let him stew. He was damn lucky she liked his mom so much or she would have denounced him in front of the entire hotel lobby.</p><p>The poor woman didn\u2019t deserve to be humiliated just because her son was a first-rate ass.</p><p>Evan regarded her warily even as he turned to his mom. \u201cWe\u2019ll catch up tomorrow, Mom, okay? Celia and I have had a long day and we\u2019d like to go up and have dinner in the room.\u201d</p><p>Lucy patted Evan on the cheek and then leaned up on tiptoe to kiss him. \u201cOf course, dear. I\u2019ll see you both tomorrow for rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>She reached back and squeezed Celia\u2019s hand. \u201cIt was so nice meeting you, Celia.\u201d</p><p>She walked toward Evan\u2019s father and the two went in the direction of the restaurant, leaving Celia and Evan standing in the middle of the lobby.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the top level,\u201d Evan said evenly. He gestured toward the elevator and Celia strode in that direction.</p><p>They rode up in silence, the tension so thick Celia felt like the entire elevator would explode before it stopped. It was all she could not to tap her foot in agitation as she waited for the doors to open.</p><p>When they finally did, Celia stepped out, glanced down the hall and then back at Evan.</p><p>\u201cMy key,\u201d she said pointedly. \u201cWhat room am I in?\u201d</p><p>Evan sighed and pointed at the end. \u201cWe\u2019re in the two-bedroom suite on the end.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. She reached forward and snatched the key card from his grasp. Then she spun on her heel and stalked down the hall. The hell she\u2019d share a room with him. He could go find other accommodations or he could bunk with his brother. They\u2019d probably have a lot to talk about. Maybe they could compare notes on Bettina.</p><p>She jammed the card into the lock, listened for the snick and then shoved it open. She stepped inside and slammed the door in Evan\u2019s face.</p><p>Her feet were killing her, she was angry as hell and she was hungry. And she needed to figure out how to get off this damn island.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes and then sat on the edge of the couch next to the table with the hotel directory and a telephone. Surely the front desk could make arrangements for her departure.</p><p>The sound of the door opening had her on her feet again, and she glared indignantly as Evan walked in and shut the door behind him. He held up another key card in explanation.</p><p>He looked tired and resigned.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>She held up a hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare patronize me. You have no idea how furious I am. Angry doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it.\u201d</p><p>He blew out his breath and ran a hand through his hair. He tossed his suit coat onto the arm of the couch.</p><p>She pointed to the door with a shaking finger. \u201cOut. I won\u2019t share a suite with you. I don\u2019t care how many bedrooms it has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d Evan muttered.</p><p>The man wouldn\u2019t even fight with her, and by God she wanted a fight.</p><p>\u201cYou never had any intention of listening to my ideas, did you?\u201d</p><p>He stopped on his way over to the liquor cabinet and turned back around to stare at her. He had the audacity to look puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been such an idiot. I can\u2019t believe I fell for this crap. How this was the only time you could fit me in. Blah, blah, blah. How naive does that make me? How stupid does it make me?\u201d</p><p>He held up a hand and took a step in her direction. \u201cCelia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t Celia me,\u201d she whispered furiously. It galled her that she could feel the prick of tears. He would not make her cry. She was through letting men make her cry.</p><p>She needed to pull it together and be professional. A really nasty, vivid curse word, one that she\u2019d learned from her brothers burst into her mind. It was certainly appropriate under the circumstances.</p><p>Screw professional.</p><p>\u201cI have had it with men who manipulate me because of my looks. Here\u2019s a clue. I can\u2019t help the way I look and it doesn\u2019t give you the license to use me or make assumptions about my character. And it damn sure doesn\u2019t give you the right to use me to lie to your mother because your fianc\u00e9e humiliated you by dumping you for your brother. Here\u2019s another clue. Crap happens. It happens all the time. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s hands closed over her shoulders. She tried to flinch away, but he held tight. There was honest regret in his eyes, but there was also determination. Stubborn determination.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Celia,\u201d he ordered in a low voice.</p><p>She gaped at him.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>It was the please that did it. Or maybe it was how tired and resigned he sounded. Or maybe it was the bleak light that entered his eyes. Or maybe she was just a flaming idiot who deserved everything she got</p><p>for being sucked into this in the first place.</p><p>She sank onto the sofa, her entire body trembling as he took a seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to believe I didn\u2019t do this maliciously or to hurt you. I swear, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She cast a sideways glance at him.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cSomeone really did a number on you, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She turned away, refusing to give him confirmation.</p><p>\u201cCelia, look at me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He waited, and she stared ahead.

I expected to have time to discuss this with you before we ran into my family.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to control her temper. He obviously wanted a reasonable discussion when she was feeling anything but reasonable. What she really wanted was to crack his skull on the coffee table and leave, but then she\u2019d be without a room, and if anyone was sleeping in the hallway, it wasn\u2019t going to be her.</p><p>\u201cFirst, this has nothing\u2014and I mean nothing\u2014to do with you landing my account. You\u2019re going to have to do that on your business and advertising savvy. I\u2019m not putting my entire company in the hands of a woman based on her looks or anything else. Can we at least be clear on that?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it looks to me, Evan. It looks to me like I got played for the fool and that you led me here on the premise of listening to my pitch when you never had any intention of this being about business. Tell me this much, have you already signed with Golden Gate? You owe me that much honesty at least.\u201d</p><p>Evan gripped a handful of his hair and closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed. I get it. You have every right to be, but will you please listen to my explanation. If afterward you want me to take a flying leap, I\u2019ll be more than happy to accommodate you. You\u2019ll never hear from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know I don\u2019t have any other choice,\u201d she said helplessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to make this as short and as concise as possible.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have any intention of coming to this damn wedding. I couldn\u2019t care less if they live happily ever after and I have even less interest in being here to wish them well along that path to happily ever after.</p><p>\u201cThen my mother called and she begged me to come. She was worried that I wasn\u2019t over Bettina and that\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t come. The woman has a heart of gold, but she obviously knows nothing about me or she\u2019d realize that Bettina was nothing to me the moment she left me for what she perceived to be the better catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh,\u201d Celia murmured.</p><p>\u201cIs it? I\u2019m only speaking the truth. Bettina was calculating. She hedged her bets and went with Mitchell as soon as he was named my father\u2019s successor in the family jewelry business. To her it seemed a more glamorous life. I\u2019d like to be a fly on the wall when she realizes how wrong she is.\u201d</p><p>Celia\u2019s lips curled in amusement. \u201cNot feeling a wee bit vindictive, are you?\u201d</p><p>He gave a short laugh. \u201cI may not harbor any love for the woman, and I may not be a bit sorry that she\u2019s out of my life, but she is a manipulative cat, and I won\u2019t be sorry to see her suffer for the choice she made.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo your mom doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re over Bettina. That has what to do with me and this hoax you\u2019re perpetuating? Which I really resent by the way because your mom is nice. I feel like pond scum for deceiving her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there. Just bear with me. When I got off the phone with Mom, I was angry because I let her talk me into going and I said as a last-minute thing that I was bringing someone. I fully intended to look up someone I\u2019d seen casually in the past. Then I remembered that Friday I was supposed to be meeting you and that this meeting was extremely important to me. It seemed logical to combine the two and bring you out with me. I didn\u2019t lie about needing to move on this fast. I\u2019ve wasted weeks listening to pitches.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still seeing abut here,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe but occurred when Bettina herself came to see me. She was steamed that I had the audacity to bring someone to her wedding. She felt like it was a poke in the eye at her, and if you can believe, she honestly thinks I\u2019m still pining over her. She basically accused me of being a fraud and of trying to upstage her at her own wedding.\u201d</p><p>Celia burst out laughing. God, he didn\u2019t even see it. How typical a clueless male was he.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe accused you of doing exactly what you\u2019re doing! The audacity. You crack me up.\u201d</p> <p>He blinked and then looked a little sheepish. \u201cOkay, I get it. I\u2019m an immature, egotistical man. The male ego is obviously a fragile creature. I think we can agree on that. Yes, it occurred to me to get a little of mine back on her by showing up with a gorgeous, stunning woman. Sue me. I even hatched the whole engagement scheme complete with the ring because I figured it was the best way to get them all off my back.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shook and she closed her eyes. The man was nothing if not honest. She had to give him that much.</p><p>\u201cCelia, look at me, please.\u201d</p><p>His entreating tone had her turning once more to stare into those intense green eyes. He looked earnest, and he looked...worried.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do any of this to hurt you, I swear. I thought if I just came out and asked you to do me this</p><p>favor, you\u2019d have never agreed to come with me, even with the promise of listening to your pitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lured me here and ambushed me instead,\u201d she said drily.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t go exactly as I\u2019d planned. I\u2019d hoped to have a nice dinner together in our suite and I was going to ask you to do me a personal favor then. I was going to outline the entire charade and ask you to play along. Just for the time we\u2019re here. But that all went to hell when we immediately ran into my parents.\u201d</p><p>His hand crept over hers, and she didn\u2019t pull away. She should. She should already be on her way back to San Francisco, and she should be calling Brock to tell him that there was no way in hell she was delivering Evan Reese on a platter to Maddox Communications.</p><p>She pressed her lips together and tried to collect her scattered thoughts. \u201cSo you want me to pretend to be your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d She lifted her hand to angle the huge diamond in the light. \u201cComplete with a really gorgeous ring. What happens after the wedding?\u201d</p><p>Evan shrugged. \u201cWe break up quietly later. They\u2019ll never know the difference. We don\u2019t see each other that often. One day Mom will call and I\u2019ll say \u2018oh, by the way, Celia and I broke things off.\u2019 And that will be that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAll of this because you couldn\u2019t stand the thought of your fianc\u00e9e thinking you weren\u2019t over her?\u201d</p><p>Evan scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. There are other factors. Besides, we\u2019ve already established the fact that I\u2019m an egotistical, immature male. We don\u2019t have to go back into that territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d She patted his arm and then laughed at his disgruntled look. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m even considering this.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glinted predatorily. \u201cBut you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dammit, I am. I\u2019m a sucker for immature, egotistical males. But we need to establish a few ground rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cMy reputation is everything to me, Evan,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI won\u2019t have any notion of impropriety attached to this account. I won\u2019t have it bandied around that I got the account because I slept with you.\u201d</p><p>Something that looked an awful lot like lust gleamed in his eyes a second before he blinked and adopted a more serious expression.</p><p>\u201cThis favor is separate. If I don\u2019t like your ideas, you\u2019ll go home without my business. It\u2019s that simple.</p><p>Agreeing to be my fake fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t buy you anything but my gratitude. It won\u2019t land you Reese Enterprises. Are we clear on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrystal,\u201d she said. \u201cTell me something, Evan. If I refuse to play the part of your lover, are you still going to hear my pitch? Are you even going to consider Maddox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do have a fragile ego, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be serious?\u201d</p><p>A grin worked at the corners of her mouth. She should be mad as hell at this man, not entertained by his self-effacing wit. And she definitely shouldn\u2019t be attracted to his boyish charm or his straightforward handling of this entire ridiculous affair.</p><p>\u201cI tell you what, Celia. The plan was always to have a quiet dinner in tonight where I could explain my plan and beg you to go along. Then tomorrow morning we were going to have our business meeting, again, in the privacy of our hotel suite. Afterward we would perpetuate my silly hoax on my brother and his grasping, manipulative bride-to-be. See? Completely separate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are completely irreverent, and I\u2019m disgusted that I like it so much.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and his eyes twinkled with amusement. \u201cYou\u2019re as diabolical as I am, face it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have used some of your evilness in the past. That\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m a little envious of how you don\u2019t mind poking your finger in the eyes of those who have screwed you over. I need to learn how to do that.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhat happened to you, Celia?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Definitely in the past and that\u2019s where I want it to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Fair enough. But I hope one day you\u2019ll tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have that kind of relationship,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe don\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifted but his expression didn\u2019t betray his thoughts. She swallowed the knot in her throat and hoped she wasn\u2019t making a huge, huge mistake. So much could go wrong with this.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so worried about the position I\u2019ve placed you in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the truth is, if I don\u2019t like your ideas tomorrow morning, what\u2019s to say that you don\u2019t leave me to face the festivities on my own? I\u2019d say that gives you all the power and none to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could just say you like my ideas to keep me on the line long enough to get through the wedding,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cNothing to say that you don\u2019t dump me the minute we get back to San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cTrue. All of it is true. Looks like we both have some trusting to do.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her hand that was still underneath his. His thumb pressed into her palm, and his fingers lay still over hers, but the warmth of his touch spread up her entire arm and into her chest.</p><p>She liked this man. Genuinely liked him, stupid ambush aside. He hadn\u2019t sugarcoated any of it. And above all else, she liked honesty. He hadn\u2019t shied away from how the entire situation made him look. It certainly didn\u2019t make him appear very noble, but she couldn\u2019t get beyond thinking he was just that.</p><p>Noble and honest.</p><p>The ring on her finger sparkled and glinted in the light. For just one moment, she allowed herself to</p><p>imagine what it would be like if it were all real. Two seconds later she mentally slapped herself silly and told herself to get over her foolishness.</p><p>She had a job to do. She had to impress this man with her brains and her creativity, her drive and her determination. She could do all that. And if it meant she had to go beyond the call of duty to do a personal favor for him, then she needed to suck it up and just get the job done. Too many people were counting on her.</p><p>It was silly. She felt like an idiot and she was sure Evan didn\u2019t feel any better, but it wasn\u2019t up to her to question his motives. For whatever reason, he didn\u2019t want his brother and his fianc\u00e9e to see him bleed.</p><p>She could understand that. She would have died rather than let her old boss and his scheming wife know how much they\u2019d destroyed her.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Evan. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Triumph mixed with relief flared to life in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you for not bashing my skull in and leaving, but more than that, thank you for not reacting in front of my family. It was more than I deserved given how I sprang it on you. I swear, that was not the way I wanted to approach you with my proposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re done with all that, can we eat? I\u2019m starving. You can tell me all I need to know about your family and also tell me how it was we met and when you proposed, but not until I get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, caught her jaw in his hand and turned her toward him. Their lips were so close that his breath blew warm over her mouth. She swallowed nervously, wondering if he would kiss her. And then she wondered if she\u2019d let him. Or if she would kiss him instead.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Slowly, he withdrew, and to her chagrin, disappointment washed over her.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Evan watched as Celia sat sideways on the couch, her back against the arm and her knees doubled in front of her. She looked comfortable and completely relaxed, which was more than he could have hoped for given how stupidly he\u2019d sprung the whole engagement thing on her.</p><p>After her initial fury, though, she\u2019d calmed down and had taken it well. Damn, but he liked this woman.</p><p>Oh, he was definitely attracted to her sexually, but beyond that, he genuinely liked spending time with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If he was smart, he\u2019d take that as a huge warning sign to stay away and not become involved, but he\u2019d never claimed brilliance.</p><p>She\u2019d changed into nothing more glamorous than a pair of sweatpants and a San Francisco Tide jersey.</p><p>Odd, but she hadn\u2019t struck him as a baseball fan.</p><p>Her shoes had long since been shed, and her toenails, painted a delicate shade of pink, teased him. Hell,</p> <p>he was even attracted to her feet. Small and dainty.</p><p>He was officially losing his mind. Never before had he lusted after a woman\u2019s feet.</p><p>She forked another bite into her mouth then sighed and made a low sound of agony before putting her plate down on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThat was fabulous. I\u2019ve eaten so much that I won\u2019t fit into that sparkly dress I brought for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>That statement brought a whole host of splendid ideas to mind. Namely that they could both skip the wedding and stay in bed where clothing was entirely optional.</p> <p>He shifted in his seat and wondered for the sixth time why he was so bent on torturing himself.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me something, Evan,\u201d she said as she leaned farther into the sofa cushions. Her eyelids lowered and she tucked those pink toes underneath a throw pillow. \u201cWhat made you walk away from your family\u2019s business and start your own in a field that was so different from the jewelry trade?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise him that she knew so much about his background. She would have researched him tirelessly. Still, he debated how much to tell her.</p><p>Their gazes locked, and he saw only simple curiosity. No ulterior motive, just interest.</p><p>\u201cThere were several reasons,\u201d he finally said. \u201cEmotion has no place in business and yet I find myself making emotional decisions.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019d admit that. Doesn\u2019t jive with your big, bad, ruthless businessman persona.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled ruefully. \u201cOkay, so part of it was emotion based. I didn\u2019t agree with my father\u2019s style of management. The fact is his company is in trouble. I saw it coming years ago and he was in flat denial. He saw no reason to change the way he ran things since it had worked for decades before.</p><p>\u201cThe other reason was I don\u2019t exactly get along that well with him and Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t say,\u201d she said drily.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYeah, I know, hard to believe. Mitchell...there are lots of more appropriate words for him, but I\u2019ll go with the fact that he\u2019s a lazy, unmotivated brown noser. All his life, because he was the baby, he\u2019s never had to actually work for anything. He\u2019s been handed everything since he was a child.</p><p>As a result, his sense of entitlement is huge. I would work for something and he would want what I had worked for. Dad would give it to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I think I\u2019m beginning to understand the fianc\u00e9e thing more now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, I don\u2019t harbor any illusion that Mitchell and Bettina are some great love match. I had Bettina, so Mitchell decided he wanted her. Bettina saw Mitchell\u2019s appointment to CEO as her ride into a life of glamour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd were you and Bettina? A love match, I mean?\u201d she asked gently.</p> <p>He pursed his lips and blew out a long breath. \u201cThis is where I look like the jerk.\u201d</p><p>Celia chuckled. \u201cJerk? You? Surely you jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, don\u2019t rub it in,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve admitted my shortcomings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo continue. I\u2019m dying to hear all about what a toad you are.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes sparkled with mischief and amusement. He\u2019d never wanted to kiss her more than he did right now. Instead he found himself telling her stuff he\u2019d never tell a woman he planned to take to bed.</p><p>\u201cBettina didn\u2019t pose a challenge. That sounds bad but when I met her, I was devoting all my time to making my business a success. It was exciting and exhilarating. I exceeded even my wildest expectations.</p><p>Everything was falling into place at the speed of light. All that was missing in my mind to complete the image of perfection I had built up was a wife and a family. Perfect house in the suburbs. I\u2019d come home after a hectic day and she\u2019d have dinner waiting. The kids would all be bathed and well behaved. Even the dog would be the epitome of good behavior. I wanted\u2014still want\u2014a woman who\u2019ll put me first.\u201d</p><p>Celia snorted, covered her mouth and then dissolved into hoots of laughter.</p><p>He regarded her dubiously. \u201cI do believe you\u2019re mocking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMocking you?\u201d She wheezed between words and tears gathered in the corners of her eyes. \u201cOh my, Evan. You do dream big, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was a good fantasy while it lasted,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cI looked around and there was Bettina. I didn\u2019t have time to figure out what my ideal woman was. I wanted my perfect life then and I didn\u2019t want to wait. So I asked her to marry me, she said yes, I gave her a ring and that was that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you are. With me. The fake fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>He scowled ferociously at her only for her to dissolve into laughter again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what happened? Other than Mitchell stepping in and being an overindulged twit.\u201d</p><p>He liked this woman. She was good for his ego even when she was tearing it down.</p><p>\u201cBettina wanted to set an immediate date. She had a grand wedding planned. Even had the honeymoon destination picked out. She littered my office with brochures. Hell, she even had our children\u2019s names picked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have thought given your fantasy that you would have eaten that up with a spoon,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so did I. Only I found myself backing off. I kept making excuses to extend the engagement. I was busy. This deal had to take priority. That deal needed immediate attention. Before I knew it, we had been engaged a year with a wedding scheduled another year beyond that. And moreover I was content with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you never love her?\u201d Celia asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I didn\u2019t. Which is why I can\u2019t really blame her for wanting out. Our marriage would have been a disaster just as soon as I figured out the reality didn\u2019t live up to the fantasy I\u2019d created in my mind. I just didn\u2019t think she\u2019d dump me for Mitchell or that Mitchell would have been poaching on my territory.\u201d</p><p>Celia winced. \u201cYeah, I can understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found them in bed, you know. How clich\u00e9d is that? The sad thing is, when I found them together in my bed, I just laughed, because to me it was just the next step in an already farcical relationship. I tossed them out of my apartment and washed my hands of them both.\u201d</p><p>Celia\u2019s expression grew thoughtful. \u201cHmm, so you don\u2019t necessarily object to the fact that she found someone else. Or that she cheated on you. Just who she indulged herself with.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded and rubbed the back of his neck to ease some of the tension and fatigue. Just talking about it raised his ire all over again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s stupid I know. I mean, she could have cheated on me with my business partner, or my vice president or, hell, even my driver. I wouldn\u2019t have cared. I might have even given the man a raise. But my brother. My spoiled, overindulged brother. No, that was the one thing I couldn\u2019t forgive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if their relationship is based on all you say, then I\u2019d imagine they\u2019ll suffer enough in the long run without you wishing them ill.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her for a long moment. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to lecture me about harboring childish grudges?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and those gorgeous green eyes cut right through him. She took his breath away until he was helpless to do anything but stare back.</p><p>\u201cNope. Not a word. Considering I have my own grudges and I don\u2019t plan on forgetting them in this lifetime, I could hardly chastise you for the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do tell. You sound so...vicious. I like it,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Her expression grew serious. Pain flickered in her eyes, and she turned away, her mouth drawn into a tight line. He was immediately sorry that the light mood had dissolved. As much as he wanted to know her secrets, he wanted to see her laughing and smiling even more.</p><p>To cover the sudden heaviness in the air, he got up to pour a glass of wine. Without a word, he offered one to her, and she took it, gratitude easing some of the tightness around her eyes.</p><p>He wanted to touch her so badly. Wanted to ease the strain and the unhappy tilt to her lips. He wanted to kiss her plump mouth until he owned her very breath.</p><p>He forced himself to return to his chair. The remains of their dinner was scattered across the coffee table. Some had fallen to the floor, but he wasn\u2019t inclined to clean it up. They sat there sipping their wine as evening fell all around them.</p><p>Finally he could remain silent no more.</p><p>He leaned forward to set his glass on the table. For a moment he looked down at his hands and</p><p>imagined her flesh beneath his fingertips. Then he glanced back up to see her studying him with the same keen interest flashing in her eyes. She wasn\u2019t immune. He wasn\u2019t the only one who felt the magnetic pull between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do, Celia?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He saw her swallow nervously. She hadn\u2019t misunderstood, but neither did she respond.</p><p>\u201cI want you so damn much I hurt. I\u2019ve hurt for weeks. Every time I look at you, I get so many knots that I can\u2019t function. I\u2019ve thought of all the ways I can explain to you that our business relationship has nothing to do with the desire I feel for you. But the simple truth is I don\u2019t give a damn. I want you in my bed, and I don\u2019t care what has to be done to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide and frightened. He hated that. He didn\u2019t want her to be afraid of him.</p><p>\u201cYou feel it, too. Don\u2019t deny me that much.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she nodded. Her fingers went to her forehead and she dug them into her hair. Still, he could see them shaking, and she swallowed again, her slim neck working with the effort.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Evan. It\u2019s the one thing I can\u2019t do. Don\u2019t ask it of me. If you want me to admit it, fine. I want you. More than I\u2019ve ever wanted another man.\u201d</p><p>Savage satisfaction gripped him. Didn\u2019t just grip him but lunged for him and wrapped a hand around his throat and his groin. His entire body reacted to that simple statement. She wanted him more than she\u2019d ever wanted anyone else.</p><p>She turned on the couch until she faced forward and her feet met the floor. She looked in turns miserable and scared. Her eyes closed in what looked to him like self-condemnation. He swore, startling her with the force of his curses.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re thinking, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI have no idea what the hell kind of blame you\u2019re placing on yourself, but I can guarantee that you didn\u2019t use your feminine wiles to seduce me into signing with your agency. I wanted you from the first moment I saw you. Want to know when that was, Celia? Go ahead, ask me.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her in blatant challenge, waiting, wanting her to take it up.</p><p>Her eyes went wide with shock, and her face was pale and drawn. \u201cW-when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Sutherland\u2019s reception. You were there with one of your clients. Copeland, if I remember correctly. The grocery-store giant.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cBut you were still with Rencom.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPrecisely. I looked across the room, and you took my breath away. Want to know another of my sins, Celia? I was still engaged to Bettina. It was a week before I found her in bed with Mitchell. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted you so much. Now tell me how big of a bastard that makes me. Try to tell me this has anything to do with your pitch.\u201d</p><p>In the course of their conversation, he\u2019d moved to the couch. He moved closer still, stalking her like</p><p>prey. Her scent lured him, and he inhaled the delicate, feminine smell that he\u2019d come to associate with only her.</p><p>Her eyes were flush with awareness and caution. There was confusion in her deep green pools, but something else, too. Desire. Matching desire. She wanted him. Maybe as much as he wanted her. It didn\u2019t matter because he would have her.</p><p>\u201cWant to know something else?\u201d he murmured. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t consider Maddox for the account. Want to know why? Because I didn\u2019t want it to interfere with my pursuit of you.\u201d</p><p>He was close now. So close he could feel every little puff of breath that came from her lips. He could see the tiny little nervous swallows that worked her throat up and down. And her mouth. Her luscious, sweet mouth. He wanted to taste it, devour it like candy.</p><p>\u201cW-what changed your mind?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of separating business from pleasure,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>\u201cEvan, we can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his chest. Big mistake. A current of electricity singed him. They both jumped, but before she could withdraw, he caught her fingers and trapped her hand between his and his chest.</p><p>\u201cJust one kiss, Celia. Just one. I have to kiss you. It\u2019s all I\u2019ll demand for now. I can wait for more until we have this account settled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without waiting her consent, he swept his mouth over hers. Finally. Her sweetness exploded onto his tongue the moment he licked over her lips. Her mouth parted in a gasp, and he took full advantage, delving deep into her moist heat.</p><p>She made the sweetest sounds. He swallowed them up as he devoured every inch of her mouth. He was transfixed by her full bottom lip. He nipped lightly at it, teasing it to fullness and then he sucked it between his teeth.</p><p>Her tongue stroked tentatively over his, just light brushes with the tip and then she grew bolder, taking a more active part in the kiss.</p><p>His hands delved into her hair. He loved her hair. Long and glorious, the color like a russet sunset over the desert. The temptation was too great. He\u2019d fantasized about it for too long.</p> <p>He fumbled with the clip and released its hold on her hair. It tumbled down her back, over his hands like a wave. He gathered the strands between his fingers, mesmerized by their silky smoothness.</p><p>He drank deeply, not wanting the moment to end. He could spend hours kissing her, but he wanted more. He wanted to work his mouth down the curve of her jaw to her neck. He wanted to peel every layer of clothing from her body and then run his tongue over her soft skin.</p><p>He wondered what her breasts would feel like in his hands and what her nipples would taste like, how they\u2019d feel as he sucked them into his mouth.</p><p>Oh, yes, he\u2019d spent a lot of time wondering about her breasts. She never wore clothing that could be</p><p>deemed too provocative. She was fashionable, yes, but he secretly wished she\u2019d wear something a little more revealing. It was killing him not to get a hint of her full, ripe breasts.</p> <p>Soon. Soon, he\u2019d unwrap all of her. He\u2019d possess her. She\u2019d be his.</p><p>He needed air and he broke away only long enough to pull oxygen into his starving lungs. She gasped along with him, and then he started at the corner of her mouth and licked and kissed his way across to the other corner.</p><p>Her small hands slid up his chest. It was like a heating element sliding over his skin. She left a blazing trail of fierce need in her wake. His entire body came alive, and all she\u2019d done was touch him. Innocently.</p><p>They wound up around his neck and then her fingertips just delved into the hair at his nape. He shuddered, and it was all he could do to retain his tight hold on his control.</p><p>His body screamed at him to haul her over his shoulder and drag her caveman-style to the bedroom.</p><p>He\u2019d rip off her clothes and spend the night taking her over and over until they both succumbed to exhaustion.</p> <p>His mind yelled at him to be careful. To take it slow. Not to push her so far away that she never returned.</p><p>It was that fear of driving her away permanently that finally pulled him back from the brink of insanity.</p><p>With great reluctance, he pulled back. His hands were still tangled up in her hair, and he carefully extricated them from the heavy coil that lay over her shoulders.</p><p>Her eyes were cloudy, a gorgeous mix of confusion and desire that had him wanting to throw caution to the wind and continue his seduction.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he whispered, \u201cis what I\u2019ve been wanting to do ever since I saw you across a crowded room six months ago. Now you tell me this has anything to do with Maddox Communications and Reese Enterprises.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fluttered to her mouth and she stared at him with shocked awareness.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Evan. What are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>He smiled gently and slowly pulled her hand away from her swollen lips.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re going to do is get your pitch out of the way tomorrow morning. Whatever happens afterward, we take it as it comes.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>There was no need for Celia to set her alarm. She never went to sleep. She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, her senses completely shattered by something as simple as a kiss.</p><p>No. That kiss could never ever be called simple.</p><p>She\u2019d thought to go over her pitch. Mentally replay everything she wanted to say until it flowed seamlessly through her mind. But all she\u2019d been able to do was lay there and wonder how she was going to manage to keep things with Evan on a strictly professional level.</p><p>He kissed like a dream.</p><p>He\u2019d make love like a dream.</p><p>And the sick thing was she\u2019d never find out.</p><p>She rolled over and buried her face in her pillow.</p><p>Celia, Celia.</p><p>The admonishment burned like acid on her tongue. She was walking a very tight, very dangerous line. It was bad enough that she was here with Evan. Sharing a suite with Evan. Her groan was swallowed up by the pillow.</p><p>The least she could have done was insisted on a separate room, but that wouldn\u2019t have gone far in convincing his family that they were happily engaged.</p><p>Friendship. Okay, she could handle a friendship with Evan. She liked him. He asked her to consider this a personal favor. As a friend. And she\u2019d forget the kiss. Forget that he had made his intention to make love to her abundantly clear.</p><p>All she had to do was get through her presentation, go to a rehearsal dinner, wedding and reception with Evan\u2014as his fianc\u00e9e\u2014and then she could go home and put him firmly back in his neat, tidy little corner.</p><p>She struggled out of bed, knowing it would take her the better part of an hour to erase the look of someone who hadn\u2019t slept. Evan had ordered room service to be brought up at eight, and she wanted plenty of time to go over her notes again.</p><p>She purposely toned down her looks, choosing subtle makeup. She did nothing to highlight her eyes, which were her best feature. And she pulled her hair back into a tight knot and used hairspray to keep the wispy tendrils from escaping. She wanted no distractions. No sizzling looks. No temptation to do something utterly stupid.</p><p>To her immense relief, when she walked out of her bedroom, Evan was in total business mode. He didn\u2019t stare at her like he was set to devour her. He gave her a cursory glance and motioned for her to sit across from him at the dining table where breakfast had already been served.</p><p>\u201cWe can eat and talk, or we can eat and then talk. Strictly up to you,\u201d he said when she took her seat.</p><p>\u201cWe can eat and talk,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not using props or anything, and I planned it to be more conversational than a formal presentation.\u201d</p><p>He nodded approvingly. \u201cGreat. Let\u2019s dig in and get started then.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of transition where they ate in silence before Celia shut off everything but the task</p><p>at hand. This was her career and she knew she was damn good at it. She hadn\u2019t gotten to where she was and survived the pitfalls without the ability to put her game face on in the face of adversity.</p><p>\u201cI studied your last ad campaign, and I believe you\u2019re missing a huge segment of your target audience.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, set his fork down and stared across at her. \u201cOkay, you have my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should put it another way. I think you\u2019re not targeting the right audience. You\u2019re missing a huge opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She paused for effect and then segued into her spiel.</p><p>\u201cRight now you appeal to the sports crowd. The guy who jogs. The woman who goes to the gym. The person who cares about staying in shape. You\u2019re all about functionality. The kids who play sports. The guys who play racquetball at the club. The casual basketball game on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen there are the people, like me, who are allergic to physical activity.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and sent an appraising look over her body.</p><p>She ignored him and continued on.</p><p>\u201cThese are the people who watch sports. They\u2019re tuned in to every game. The players. The teams. They run the gambit from the fanatic to the casual observer. They\u2019re the people who will buy your sportswear not because they\u2019re going to worry over the functionality. They don\u2019t care. They want to look cool. They want to immerse themselves in the aura of the sports world. You\u2019re a brand, a label. It\u2019s a status symbol.\u201d</p><p>Her excitement mounted with every word. He was listening intently. She had him.</p><p>\u201cSo you do dual marketing. You go after the die-hard fitness enthusiast with the sweaty workout commercials. The driven athlete who\u2019s going to be the best and wearing your brand the entire time.\u201d</p><p>Again she paused to gauge his reaction, and he was leaning forward, his brow creased in concentration.</p><p>\u201cThen you go after the men and the women and the kids who want your clothing and your shoes because they look good. Because they make them feel athletic without ever lifting a finger. You show them someone looking cool and sophisticated in your clothing. You show them it\u2019s hip to have Reese Wear. They can be average, everyday Joes and still know what it feels like to be a star.\u201d</p><p>Then she went for the kill shot. Her excitement mounted because she knew he was interested. This had nothing to do with personal attraction. He was all business right now and his eyes gleamed with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cAnd the person you show to both of these groups, the man you have doing the sweaty, driven shoots and the cool, suave commercials is Noah Hart.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s eyes widened a fraction, and then he sat back in his seat. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><p>She waited, trying valiantly to hide her smug grin. This would be the fun part.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you can get me Noah Hart?\u201d He didn\u2019t even wait for her to reply. \u201cCompanies have been after Noah Hart ever since he entered the major leagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d she said airily. \u201cThey wanted him out of college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. The point is, the man has never agreed to an endorsement deal. What makes you think you can change his mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I told you he\u2019s willing to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Evan breathed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll cost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, it would be worth it!\u201d His eyes narrowed again. \u201cHe\u2019ll talk to me. You\u2019ve already been in contact with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have mentioned the possibility of you doing a new ad campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s interested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll talk to you. I provided him research, which means you passed the first round of scrutiny with him.</p><p>He\u2019s a hard guy. You land him and it\u2019ll be huge. Not only will you have a kick-ass ad campaign, but you\u2019ll also be the guy who signed Noah Hart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d want exclusivity,\u201d Evan said quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to be prepared to pay for that privilege,\u201d Celia pointed out. She wasn\u2019t about to tell Evan that exclusivity or not, the chances of Noah agreeing to do another deal with someone else was slim to none. The man simply wasn\u2019t motivated by money.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s forget Noah Hart for the moment. I like your ideas, Celia. I mean, the average Joe has never escaped my notice, but you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve never gone after him in marketing. My commercials are always about the drive to succeed. I talk to the athlete in all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\u2019ve just pointed out doesn\u2019t exist in everyone,\u201d she said drily.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Completely. The junior-high kid trying to look cool. Huge market there that I\u2019ve yet to tap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of my ideas are about how to structure television commercials, Internet advertising and print media to target all segments of the population from the die-hard sports and fitness enthusiast to Suzy Homemaker who just wants a comfortable pair of tennis shoes. We\u2019d speak separately to teens, young adults all the way up to the retired folks.\u201d</p><p>Evan nodded. \u201cI\u2019m interested. Definitely interested. When can you have a presentation put together for me? As I said before, I\u2019m ready to move on this. I don\u2019t mind taking a little extra time if I can be guaranteed better results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me when you can meet with us at Maddox and I\u2019ll arrange it,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>\u201cAnd Noah Hart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll arrange it as soon as we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d say you\u2019ve got your pitch appointment, Celia. I\u2019m very impressed with what you\u2019ve had to say. If your presentation delivers on the promise of your ideas, it\u2019s something my company will be very excited about.\u201d</p><p>Though she had every confidence in her ability to win him over, his enthusiasm gave her a wicked thrill.</p><p>She was forced to play it cool and smile politely as she thanked him, but on the inside she was doing an insane victory dance.</p><p>She had phone calls to make. Brock would need to know so they could start preparing. They\u2019d want to do mock-ups of the advertising and have it prominently displayed on the television monitors in the Maddox reception area. On the day she\u2019d give Evan her presentation, Maddox Communications would be all about Reese Enterprises. No one else would exist in the timeframe Evan was present in their offices.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me how you managed to get Noah Hart to agree to talk to me,\u201d Evan said as he pushed his plate aside.</p><p>A small smile flirted at the edges of her mouth and she suppressed the urge to grin broadly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t reveal all my secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pull this off and you\u2019ll be legendary,\u201d Evan said. \u201cThe man has never so much as been tempted to take a deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Okay, now she felt a little like a fraud. Legendary indeed. While she did love having an ace up her sleeve, she felt a little squeamish over Evan\u2019s praise. Noah Hart was her big brother, and the truth was, there wasn\u2019t much he wouldn\u2019t do for his little sister. Never mind that she\u2019d never asked him for any such favor before. She was this time, and it was the only reason Noah was contemplating breaking his long-held policy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fawn yet,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHe might prove to be too expensive for you.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s eyes glinted with a predatory gleam. He had the look of a man sure of himself and all things.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not found many things in life that proved to be too expensive. I may not always want to pay the price, but rarely have I found them out of my range.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cI sensed that about you, which is why I thought you might be the one Noah would come to terms with. I think the two of you are probably a lot alike.\u201d</p><p>Evan cocked his head to the side. \u201cJust how well do you know him?\u201d</p><p>Her lips lifted again, but she didn\u2019t answer. Evan\u2019s BlackBerry rang and provided much needed distraction. She wasn\u2019t ready to tell Evan about her relationship with Noah. Not yet.</p><p>She tuned into Evan\u2019s conversation when he said her name. He was obviously talking to his mom.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there this afternoon. Four o\u2019clock. Yes, I know. I won\u2019t miss it. Dinner afterward. Celia and I are having lunch together down by the marina. We\u2019ll meet you back at the hotel in time for rehearsal.</p> <p>You have my word.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and let out a sigh as he tucked the phone back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cThe woman is convinced I\u2019ll flake on the wedding. I wonder how on earth she got that idea?\u201d</p><p>It was said so innocently that Celia burst into laughter. Evan joined her and business was effectively put back out of the way once more.</p><p>Nine</p><p>The nice lunch by the harbor never happened. As Evan and Celia were leaving the hotel, they ran into Evan\u2019s parents and Mitchell and Bettina.</p> <p>Lucy was thrilled, since they were on their way to lunch, as well, and she suggested they eat together before they gathered on the terrace for the very informal rehearsal.</p><p>It amused Celia that there would even be an actual rehearsal of the ceremony since it wasn\u2019t a big affair and the bride and groom only had two attendants each. Still, it was evidently important to keep up appearances because they were going all out with a full-blown rehearsal and a dinner and party afterward.</p><p>Bettina acted less than thrilled that Celia and Evan would be joining them for lunch. Mitchell was visibly uncomfortable. When they were seated, as luck would have it, Evan and Celia were placed across the table from Bettina and Mitchell while Lucy and Marshall sat on the ends.</p><p>As a result, Celia was treated to Bettina\u2019s malevolent stare. The woman wasn\u2019t even subtle about it. She picked Celia apart like a bug under a microscope.</p><p>Evan reached for her hand under the table and gave her a squeeze. She couldn\u2019t figure out if it was a gesture of support, sympathy or a thank-you.</p><p>She turned and gave him a smile. For a long moment their gazes locked and he smiled back.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Celia, what is it that you do? Evan tells me you live in San Francisco. Will you be moving once you and Evan are married?\u201d</p><p>Celia turned to Lucy in surprise. The questions were natural for a mother to ask, but Celia hadn\u2019t been prepared for them. Who was she kidding? She hadn\u2019t been prepared for any of this.</p> <p>\u201cCelia is a crack advertising executive,\u201d Evan smoothly inserted. \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed where we\u2019ll live after we\u2019re married. Her career is very important to her. I\u2019d never expect her to give it up.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the man was good. If she was getting married, she\u2019d want the guy she was marrying to say exactly</p><p>what Evan had said, and she\u2019d want him to mean every word.</p><p>Bettina sniffed. \u201cBut don\u2019t you feel a woman\u2019s place is at home with the children? You do plan on having children don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Celia frowned as she stared at the other woman. Was she for real? Granted she was young. Celia guessed she was in her early twenties. What the hell had Evan been thinking when he\u2019d hooked up with her in the first place? She was practically an infant and Evan had to be pushing forty.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see that it\u2019s any of your concern whether I want children or not and as for where my place is, it\u2019s wherever I\u2019m the happiest,\u201d Celia said. \u201cI fail to see how I could possibly be the best wife and mother by staying at home and being miserable.\u201d</p><p>Bettina looked genuinely confused. \u201cI feel it\u2019s important for a woman not to overshadow her husband. A husband\u2019s job is to provide for his family. I\u2019d never take that away from him.\u201d</p><p>Celia snorted. \u201cYou keep telling yourself that, honey. Call me up when your provider husband has decided he no longer wants that job and is going to leave you and the children to go find himself. Then tell me how important it was for you to depend solely on him for your support, and then tell me how easy it is to go find a job making enough money to support yourself and your children when the sole job experience on your resume is changing diapers and cooking dinner.\u201d</p><p>Evan choked on his laughter while Lucy\u2019s eyes widened in shock. Mitchell looked a little green while Bettina\u2019s mouth hung open. Marshall cleared his throat and actually looked at Celia with something akin to respect.</p><p>\u201cWell said, young lady. A woman should never put the welfare of herself and her children solely in her husband\u2019s hands no matter how solid the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarshall!\u201d</p><p>Lucy sounded positively scandalized.</p><p>Evan sat back and looked at his dad. \u201cYou see why I\u2019m so determined to marry her. If my company ever goes bankrupt, I can stay at home and let her support me.\u201d</p><p>The two men burst into laughter and Evan squeezed her hand harder.</p><p>\u201cHave you two set a date yet?\u201d Mitchell asked, entering the conversation for the first time.</p><p>He\u2019d been strangely silent, and he\u2019d studied her and Evan until Celia squirmed under his scrutiny.</p><p>Not wanting Evan to do all the talking, even if this was his charade and not hers, she smiled and looked back at Mitchell.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only just convinced me to marry him. I did make him wait, and he had to ask me several times.\u201d</p><p>Evan squeezed again only this time it was a definite retaliation squeeze. She grinned and plunged ahead.</p><p>\u201cI finally put him out of his misery and said yes. He wants a short engagement.\u201d Some little evil imp made her poke Bettina a little with that statement since Evan had kept prolonging their engagement. \u201cHe</p><p>wanted to elope to Las Vegas, but I want to take our time and really get to know each other before we tie the knot.\u201d</p><p>Evan made a strangled noise and promptly took a long drink of his wine. Celia kept a perfectly straight face as she took in the reactions of Evan\u2019s family.</p><p>Lucy looked wary. Bettina looked murderous. Mitchell had a strange look that could only be interpreted as a cross between regret and sadness while Marshall nodded approvingly. He reached over to slap his son on the back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a winner here, son. I heartily approve. This one will keep you on your toes well into your old age. I like her.\u201d</p><p>Greaaat. She had the approval of her fake father-in-law to be. She looked over at Evan as guilt swamped her. She\u2019d gotten carried away and hadn\u2019t been able to resist the opportunity to needle Evan a bit. Though he deserved it, she still felt bad about carrying things so far.</p><p>To her surprise, he was staring thoughtfully at her, his eyes warm with something she was afraid to analyze.</p><p>\u201cI absolutely agree,\u201d Evan murmured. \u201cI\u2019m a very lucky man.\u201d</p><p>Evan kept a possessive arm wrapped around Celia\u2019s waist as they navigated the small field of people in the ballroom where everyone had gathered after the rehearsal dinner.</p><p>A band played, and already several couples were dancing, his mom and dad included.</p><p>He knew the closeness between him and Celia was all for show, but the primitive part of him recognized his desire to publicly brand her as his woman. She\u2019d probably knee him right in the groin if she had any inkling what his thoughts were. The image made him wince and chuckle all at the same time.</p><p>Every time he looked at Bettina, he was gripped by such gratitude and relief that it staggered him. How close he\u2019d come to an unmitigated disaster.</p><p>All the things he had thought he wanted were ludicrous in hindsight. A woman like Bettina would never hold his attention for long. She didn\u2019t challenge him.</p><p>He wanted someone intelligent, as driven as he was, someone he could consider a partner.</p><p>Someone like Celia.</p><p>His lips tightened. Thanks to his decision to go with Maddox\u2014he hadn\u2019t told Celia yet\u2014a relationship between them was impossible. Not that he\u2019d give a rat\u2019s ass that she worked for him indirectly, but Celia would never agree.</p><p>\u201cIf you hold me any tighter, someone\u2019s going to call the police on us,\u201d Celia murmured.</p><p>He loosened his hold on her waist and uttered a low apology.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d she suggested. \u201cYou\u2019re way too tense. No one\u2019s ever going to believe we\u2019re newly engaged and head over heels in loooove with you scowling like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry. Got distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to take that personally,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He relaxed immediately and let her pull him onto the dance floor. The music was slow and seductive and gave him the perfect opportunity to do what he\u2019d been wanting to do all damn day. Hold her flush against his body so he could feel every one of her soft, delectable curves.</p><p>They fit perfectly and he tucked her as close as she would go. His cheek rested against her temple as he slowly whirled her around the floor. Her hips swayed, brushing her belly across his groin. He let one hand trail down her spine and over the curve of one hip.</p><p>She tensed a moment, and he wondered if she\u2019d tell him to back off but then she relaxed with a sigh and melted into his arms once more.</p><p>\u201cYou were fantastic at lunch today,\u201d he said against her ear. \u201cI never thought my father would become such a fan. He\u2019s typically a stodgy, conservative chauvinist.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shook with laughter. \u201cHe\u2019d fit in quite well with my family then. My father and brothers think my sole ambition in life should be to look pretty and let them take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to admit something,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>She turned her face up, her eyes sparkling with amusement. \u201cOh, do tell. Is this where you divulge your deepest, darkest secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could try to express an appropriate amount of appreciation for my confiding in you,\u201d he huffed.</p><p>\u201cVery well. Let me just bat my eyelashes in adoration, but be quick or I\u2019ll mess up my mascara.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as helpless laughter escaped. \u201cWhat I was going to admit was that while I truly appreciate and agree with everything you had to say, there is a caveman lurking underneath my civilized exterior. I can see why your family wants to protect and take care of you. I think if you were mine, I\u2019d feel much the same way.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, and she stared at him with the oddest expression. There was no anger or condemnation.</p><p>Interest and something else gleamed in her emerald eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes I think if you were mine, I just might let you,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>His entire body tightened. His hand raced up her spine and he curled his fingers gently at her nape. Their eyes were locked together and all he had to do was lean down. Just a bit. He could taste her already.</p><p>His head lowered. Her eyes narrowed to slits and she let out a breathy, feminine sigh of anticipation.</p><p>\u201cEvan, you\u2019ve monopolized her long enough.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s voice boomed in his ears and Evan jumped, sending Celia away from him for a brief</p><p>moment.</p><p>Marshall stood there expectantly. \u201cGoing to let me cut in?\u201d</p><p>Evan slipped Celia\u2019s hand into his father\u2019s. \u201cOf course. Just don\u2019t keep her for long.\u201d</p><p>Marshall chuckled as he spirited Celia away. \u201cOne dance won\u2019t kill you, son.\u201d</p><p>Evan watched his dad whirl Celia across the floor. In a word, she was magnificent. She laughed at something he said and her smile lit up the entire room. She sparkled.</p><p>\u201cQuite a woman,\u201d Mitchell drawled.</p><p>Evan stiffened and turned to see his brother standing there, drink in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the bride-to-be?\u201d Evan asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t figure she\u2019d let you out of her sight until the vows are spoken.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s over with Mom, talking about the honeymoon arrangements.\u201d He looked again at Celia and their father. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying her for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there some reason I shouldn\u2019t?\u201d Evan asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem your type.\u201d</p><p>Evan regarded his brother with curiosity. \u201cAnd what is my type?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomeone like Bettina. You seemed pretty hung up on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m not hung up on Bettina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why you\u2019re attracted to her,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Evan demanded sharply.</p> <p>\u201cCelia.\u201d</p><p>Both men stared across the room to where Celia danced with Marshall.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful woman. I bet she\u2019s awesome in bed.\u201d</p><p>Evan rounded furiously on his brother. \u201cYou shut the hell up. Don\u2019t even breathe her name again. You got it?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell smiled and backed away, holding his hands up in surrender. \u201cOkay, okay, I get it. You\u2019re awfully touchy about her. Funny, you weren\u2019t that pissed when you found out about Bettina.\u201d</p> <p>Mitchell sauntered off and Evan turned away, angry that he\u2019d let his brother goad him.</p><p>\u201cEvan, there you are.\u201d</p><p>He sighed when his mom latched on to his arm and dragged him over to introduce him to people he had zero interest in and would never see again in his life. After several minutes of pleasantries, Evan grew restless. The song ended, and he turned in search of Celia.</p><p>His father was making his way through the crowd toward Evan and Lucy, but Celia was nowhere to be seen. Frowning, Evan scanned the room until finally he found her.</p><p>She was dancing with Mitchell. She didn\u2019t look altogether thrilled, but Mitchell was smiling as he held Celia close.</p><p>Irrational anger exploded over Evan. All he could see was that it was Bettina all over again, only this time it mattered. This was Celia. His Celia.</p> <p>His brother was a slimy predator. Never mind that Celia was perfectly capable of fending off any advances. He didn\u2019t even imagine she\u2019d ever be receptive to an overture on Mitchell\u2019s part. But the fact that his brother would behave this way at his own wedding celebration enraged Evan.</p><p>His woman. He let Bettina go because she was never his. Celia was his even if she hadn\u2019t recognized that little fact.</p><p>Not stopping to think how it would look to others, he cut a path through the crowd that had people exclaiming on either side of him. When he got to Mitchell and Celia, he reached for his brother\u2019s arm and spun him around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Mitchell began.</p><p>His eyes narrowed angrily, but Evan stopped him with a look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll excuse us, Mitchell. I find I\u2019ve spent entirely too much time away from my fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Celia stared at both brothers in shock but didn\u2019t utter a single protest when Evan all but dragged her out of the ballroom and into the hallway.</p><p>The predator had been unleashed. No way he\u2019d stand by and watch his brother move in on what he considered his.</p> <p>He stalked toward the elevator, his only thought to get Celia as far away from everyone else as possible.</p><p>He punched the button and hauled her inside. As soon as the door closed, he slammed her against the back wall and angled his mouth over hers.</p><p>It was like a fuse igniting. Desire sizzled down his spine, frying every nerve ending in its path. He wasn\u2019t gentle. He wasn\u2019t sure he had it in him. He devoured her. Claimed her.</p><p>She gasped for breath, and he stole it as soon as she could gain it back.</p><p>\u201cEvan, what on earth...\u201d</p><p>The question ended on a moan as his mouth slid down her jaw to her neck. He sucked hungrily at the soft skin just below her ear.</p><p>Behind him the doors opened and without taking his mouth from her skin, he maneuvered them down the</p><p>hall toward their suite.</p><p>He was on fire. He had no rational thought. His only instinct was to take her. To make her understand she belonged to him. Only to him.</p><p>Her eyes were dazed when he leaned her against the wall next to the door. His hands shook as he rummaged in his pocket for the key. It took two times before he inserted it correctly and as soon as the lock released, he threw open the door, held it with his foot and reached for her again.</p><p>This time she did her share of grabbing. Amid the turmoil of his jumbled, raging lust, relief hit him hard.</p><p>She was with him. She wanted him every bit as much as he wanted her.</p><p>He tore at her clothing. Then he tore at his. Shoes and shirts hit the floor, leaving a trail across the floor to his bedroom.</p><p>By the time the backs of her knees hit the edge of his bed, she was down to just her bra and panties.</p><p>Not just underwear. Pink, delicate, frothy confections that accentuated every curve and swell. Her breasts bulged and plumped upward over the cups. He could see a hint of her aureole and it was driving him crazy.</p><p>His fingers fumbled with his pants. Her hands tangled with his as they both shoved downward.</p><p>\u201cGod, Celia.\u201d He couldn\u2019t catch his breath long enough to say what he wanted. \u201cI always swore when I made love to you I\u2019d savor you for hours. I told myself I\u2019d take my time touching and kissing every inch of your body. But I swear, if I don\u2019t get inside you soon, I\u2019m going to explode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFast is good,\u201d she panted. \u201cWe can do slow later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>He fell forward, taking her with him. They both hit the bed, and she absorbed the shock of his body melding to hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll savor you next time,\u201d he promised between kisses.</p><p>\u201cSavor is good. We can definitely savor. But, God, Evan, make love to me now. Please.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and captured her mouth with his. \u201cSweet. So sweet. I\u2019m going to take you, Celia. I\u2019m going to take everything you have to offer. If you don\u2019t want this, tell me now. I\u2019ll stop. It\u2019ll kill me, but I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and stared up at him with glowing, brilliant eyes. Her hands traced a line from his temples over his face and to his jaw.</p><p>\u201cTake me then,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Celia lay underneath Evan\u2019s big body. Every part of her was covered by him. His heat penetrated her, seeped into her flesh and whispered seductively through her veins.</p><p>She wanted him. God, she wanted this man. Her need for him frightened and exhilarated her in equal parts. She knew she shouldn\u2019t\u2014that she mustn\u2019t\u2014and yet she also knew she wouldn\u2019t tell him no.</p><p>There would be no recriminations later. There would be no regret. She knew the potential pitfalls of making love with Evan, and she would face them with full acceptance.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She raised her gaze to meet his. He was propped on his arms, his body still flush with hers and their noses were mere inches apart.</p><p>His eyes were warm with desire, liquid with want, and her heart fluttered in response.</p><p>His voice was so tender and understanding. He stared down at her like she was the only woman he\u2019d ever made love to. A mixture of awe and wonder that humbled her.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we shouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cBut? There\u2019s definitely a but in that sentence.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so hopeful that she smiled and once again traced the lean lines of his face with a fingertip.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t care. I should care. I should be on my way back to San Francisco. I should have never agreed to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he murmured again, his voice husky and so very predatory.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m here, in your arms, and I want you so much that I\u2019m willing to take the biggest risk of my life. I won\u2019t lie, I don\u2019t like that about myself. I don\u2019t like that I\u2019m allowing infatuation and sexual desire to mess with my head. It\u2019s stupid and irresponsible and...\u201d</p><p>He shushed her with one finger and then followed it down with his lips. He nibbled playfully at the corner of her mouth and then licked the spot where he nipped.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Celia.\u201d</p><p>She went completely still and stared up at him, the intensity that burned so bright in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cTrust me to take care of you. I won\u2019t let this hurt you. We can make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it slow. Well, after we go really fast this time.\u201d He grinned crookedly and shifted so she could feel his straining erection against her groin. \u201cWe can do this, Celia. We\u2019re adults in charge of our own destiny. There\u2019s no problem we can\u2019t solve together. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Peace descended, enveloping her in its sweet, soothing grasp. In response, she wrapped her arms around his neck and tugged him down into a long, passionate kiss.</p><p>Trust him.</p><p>He made it sound so simple, and maybe it was.</p><p>She slid her mouth up his jaw to his ear. As she nibbled on it, she said softly, \u201cMake love to me, Evan.\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he rolled until their positions were reversed and she was sprawled atop him. His fingers fumbled with the clasp of her bra and a second later, it flew across the room, hitting the drawn curtains over the window.</p><p>She felt his sudden inhalation. He stilled and then his hand skimmed up her back and around to her breasts. His fingertips brushed over the swells and to her nipples.</p><p>Each stroke, each touch no matter how light, ignited a fire deep inside that threatened to overtake her.</p><p>Her urgency matched his own. Her impatience was his.</p><p>And then he leaned up and took one sensitive nipple in his mouth and she was lost. Her head fell back.</p><p>Her eyes closed as sweet, sharp pleasure radiated in waves through her body.</p><p>Despite his impatience, his lips and tongue were exquisitely tender as he suckled first one breast and then the other.</p><p>His hands spanned her waist and then moved lower until his fingers caught in the band of her panties. He yanked, and she heard them rip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you more,\u201d he rasped as he rolled again, putting her underneath him once more.</p><p>\u201cBuy me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPanties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHighly overrated,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He laughed against her mouth. \u201cI totally agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of...underwear. You\u2019re still wearing yours.\u201d</p><p>He reared up between her knees, yanked his briefs off, and she stared shamelessly at his distended length. He followed her gaze down then looked back up at her, a cocky grin making him adorable.</p><p>\u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>She reached for him, enfolding him in her hands. \u201cOh, yes, I like.\u201d</p><p>He clamped a hand over her arm and squeezed. \u201cCelia, you can\u2019t. I\u2019m too close. This will never work. I have to get inside you or it\u2019s going to be over way too soon.\u201d</p><p>She rose up, curling one hand around his neck even as she slid her fingers suggestively up and down his erection.</p><p>\u201cSavor later. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>She let him go long enough for him to fumble through his discarded pants. Seconds later, he started to roll the latex on, but she reached for it, snagging it from his grasp.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She lay back and he straddled her hips. He loomed over her, big and strong. She felt entirely too small, too at his mercy, but as her hands slid over his manhood, he closed his eyes and a shudder rippled through his massive body, and the power shifted significantly in her direction.</p><p>Then he fell forward, planting his hands on either side of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavor later,\u201d she reminded.</p><p>His smile was brilliant. He leaned down to kiss her just as he reached down to part her thighs. With one hand, he pulled one leg away from the other. His mouth never left hers. His weight was supported by his left arm. He angled to the side as he gently explored her swollen, feminine folds.</p><p>\u201cEvan, please,\u201d she begged. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me here. If you don\u2019t hurry, I\u2019m so leaving you behind.\u201d</p><p>He eased one finger inside and evidently satisfied that she was ready for him, he shifted over her and settled between her thighs. His erection prodded carefully at first, then he found her heat and thrust hard and deep.</p><p>She arched, bowing her back off the mattress. She grasped desperately at his shoulders, her fingers curling into his skin until she was sure she drew blood.</p><p>It was too much. It was absolutely magnificent. He filled her. She\u2019d never felt so alive, so splendid, so tuned in to her own pleasure.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he ordered in a thick, hazy voice.</p><p>It was a needless command. She couldn\u2019t do anything but hold him as he drove into her over and over.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she gasped. \u201cEvan, please, I need...\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even know what she was asking for, only that she\u2019d die if she didn\u2019t get it. Her body was near to breaking point. All she needed was...</p><p>He reached down and his fingers slid between them.</p><p>\u201cThat. Oh my God, that.\u201d</p><p>Her cry echoed sharply over the room. It was the single most exquisite pleasure and pain all in one she\u2019d experienced in her life. The tension was so sharp, so unbearable and then finally she exploded.</p><p>The room darkened around her. She blinked but everything was fuzzy. All she was aware of was Evan stroking into her and the wonderful melting sensation as she went liquid around him.</p><p>He growled her name and then he gathered her in his arms, holding her so tight she couldn\u2019t breathe. His hips jerked against her before finally he collapsed onto her, his chest heaving with exertion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her hands relaxed on his shoulders and went from punishing grip to soothing caresses. His skin was damp, and all that could be heard were his harsh breaths against her neck.</p><p>She held him as tight as he held her, determined to offer him all of herself. No barriers. No defenses. Just two people connecting in a way that overwhelmed her senses.</p><p>\u201cYou undo me, Celia,\u201d he said, his voice muffled against her neck.</p><p>She smiled and continued to stroke his back, enjoying the feel of his flesh beneath her fingers.</p> <p>He finally rolled away to discard the condom and then came back and pulled her into his arms so they faced each other.</p><p>\u201cThat was...amazing.\u201d</p><p>She touched his lips, still fascinated with the feel of him, the rougher textures and the softness of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI felt pretty savored.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and kissed her, just one light smooch that sent a giddy little thrill down her back.</p> <p>\u201cI have this fantasy. It\u2019s pretty vivid, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis I gotta hear.\u201d</p><p>He smacked her lightly on her behind. \u201cListen up, woman. Pay attention when your man bears his soul.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he continued.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t quite go according to plan because I was supposed to savor you first. I planned to take a couple of hours and make love to you until you were mindless. Then I was going to take you hard and fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrewed that one up.\u201d</p> <p>He smacked her again and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cSo now I have this fantasy where we have fast and furious sex. Then I savor you for...okay maybe an hour. And then we have fast, furious sex again. Then you get on top and have your wicked way with me.</p><p>And then you get on your hands and knees...\u201d</p><p>Celia put her hand over his mouth and burst out laughing. \u201cOkay, okay, I get the picture. You\u2019re an insatiable, horny male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly for you,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cYou seem to regularly star in my most-vivid fantasies. I could probably be arrested for some of them. They might not be legal in all states.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you, California is so progressive,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Her heart fluttered helplessly. His words...God, his words. How could she even respond to what he\u2019d said? He sounded so...sincere. How had they gotten to this point? It scared the living hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cSo what about you? Have any interesting fantasies about me?\u201d</p> <p>He sounded so hopeful that she had to laugh again. She leaned forward and brushed her mouth against the muscled wall of his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m liking the savor part a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he murmured as he reached down to tug her chin high enough that he could kiss her again.</p><p>He was a man of his word. He spent every bit of the next hour driving her mindless with his hands and his mouth. His tongue. Have mercy, his tongue.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t an inch of her he left untouched. He put his stamp on her. She felt branded. Possessed.</p><p>His tongue circled her most sensitive point nestled among the soft folds of her femininity. He worked her to the very brink of orgasm, until she quivered uncontrollably. She shivered when he pulled away and then finally he slid into her, long and slow. Hot and so tender. So very tender.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut but then he pressed gentle kisses to her lids until she opened them again. He stared down at her with such intensity she forgot to breathe. His eyes burned a fiery trail over her face, stroking and caressing her cheeks and her mouth.</p><p>He was dangerous. Oh, yes, so dangerous. She had no protection from him, and worse, she didn\u2019t want any. He could easily find his way into her heart.</p><p>Maybe he already had.</p><p>That should scare her to death, but instead, a warm, comfortable feeling settled over her. Contentment.</p><p>She stared into his eyes and saw herself. Saw them. Together.</p><p>He rocked over her, taking his time as he stoked the fire inside her higher and higher.</p><p>The strain was evident on his face. He held himself in check as he drove her relentlessly toward release.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let go of his own until she reached hers.</p><p>She twined her body tightly with his, loving the sensation of being so connected, so intrinsically linked.</p><p>\u201cEvan,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>He kissed her. Hard. \u201cGive it to me. Let go.\u201d</p><p>The breathless words unlocked something deep inside her. She arched into him, giving herself</p><p>unreservedly. Wave after wave of the most beautiful pleasure rolled through her, fanning out and rippling.</p><p>He groaned and followed until she wasn\u2019t sure whose pleasure was whose and where hers began and ended.</p><p>He eased down, and she welcomed him into her arms. She pillowed his head on her chest, his mouth a breath away from her nipple. He kissed the plump swell of her breast but didn\u2019t move. Their hearts thudded against each other and neither did anything to break the silence.</p><p>What could be said? She knew she didn\u2019t have words. She didn\u2019t want to dissect the moment. Words would only ruin the euphoric aftermath of an experience she was at a loss to describe anyway.</p><p>She ran her hand idly through his mussed hair. At his nape the crisp hairs were slightly damp with sweat.</p><p>She inhaled, savoring the uniquely masculine smell of sex and sweat. It was intoxicating and erotic.</p><p>\u201cDoes it make me a bastard that I\u2019m already fantasizing about the part where you climb on top of me and have your wicked way?\u201d he mumbled against her chest.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAs soon as I regain the feeling in my legs, I\u2019ll see what I can do about that particular fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Waking in bed with Evan didn\u2019t bring about the immediate what-the-hell-have-I-done feeling she would have thought. No, when her eyes opened, she registered a fantastic male body wrapped around hers, and instead of shoving him over and wailing on about how dumb she was, she snuggled deeper into his embrace and soaked up every minute of the lazy morning.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Evan murmured against her temple.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled softly and rolled away for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like that damn,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cBad things are going to happen after that word.\u201d</p><p>He sighed in regret. \u201cSorry. Yeah, we have to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes popped open and she scrambled up to look over his body at the clock.</p><p>\u201cNoon? I\u2019ve never slept until noon in my life!\u201d</p><p>He grinned and tugged her down onto his chest. \u201cGlad I could contribute to your downfall then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cNow let me go, otherwise I\u2019ll look like a bag lady for your brother\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like bag ladies.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cLadies carrying Hermes Berkin bags maybe.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look that suggested he didn\u2019t have a clue what she was talking about. She rolled her eyes and then pried herself out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cCome on, get up,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cThe sooner we get it over with, the sooner you can see your brother and his new wife on their way, and we can go home.\u201d</p><p>He threw off the covers, and she nearly squeaked as he got up from the bed, stark naked. Then she realized that she wasn\u2019t any more clothed, and she fled for the bathroom, his laughter ringing in her ears.</p><p>Two hours later, dressed appropriately, they made their way to the terrace where the lovebirds would exchange their vows. As they reached the door leading out, Evan slipped an arm around her waist and pulled her close to his side.</p><p>Warmth spread through her cheeks until she remembered that this was all for show. She\u2019d been stupid to forget that even for a moment.</p><p>When navigating the chairs and the people mingling became too difficult, he loosened his hold on her waist and tucked her hand in his instead. His fingers laced with hers and his thumb rubbed her palm as he smiled and said his hellos.</p><p>The preceremony was a bit of a madhouse and was without structure. Everyone just gathered on the terrace overlooking the cozy inlet, talking and visiting until finally Evan\u2019s father stood close to the floral arch and raised his hands for attention.</p><p>\u201cIf everyone will take their seats, I believe we\u2019re ready to begin.\u201d</p><p>Evan led Celia to the front row where they sat beside Lucy and Marshall. Evan kept a firm hold on her hand until Bettina made her appearance.</p><p>Despite his seeming indifference, Evan\u2019s demeanor changed as soon as the ceremony began. His fingers loosened from hers until she drew her hand away to rest in her own lap. He made no move to prevent the action.</p><p>His gaze was locked on Bettina and his brother, and he wasn\u2019t smiling as the rest of the attendees were.</p><p>He looked like a stone pillar. No emotion.</p><p>What made it worse was when Lucy started sending sidelong glances at Evan. She\u2019d obviously picked up on his coldness.</p><p>It begged the question as to whether Evan was as unaffected as he\u2019d reported. Did he still love Bettina?</p><p>If he was to be believed, he never had, but then did a man like Evan fall in love?</p><p>His association with Bettina could hardly be deemed romantic. He\u2019d formed a shopping list for a</p><p>prospective bride and he hadn\u2019t looked far. The first suitable candidate he\u2019d found he put a ring on her finger and that was that.</p><p>Celia glanced down at the diamond gleaming on her third finger and winced.</p><p>Oh, Celia, tell me you haven\u2019t gotten caught up in this nonsense. You\u2019re too practical.</p><p>She almost snorted. When it came to Evan, practicality didn\u2019t crop up first. Or second or even third.</p><p>She\u2019d lusted after forbidden fruit from the moment she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>A tiny, unwelcome thought niggled at her consciousness. Would she have begged so hard to be the one to pitch to Evan if she hadn\u2019t been so fascinated with him? Another derisive sound had to be stifled.</p><p>Fascination was a very tame word to describe her fixation with Evan. Attracted. That wasn\u2019t a very descriptive word, either. It seemed no matter the word, it didn\u2019t do justice to the overwhelming barrage of sensations she experienced in his presence.</p><p>Thank God the weekend was almost over and she could hopefully gain some objectivity again. This ruse of theirs was a dangerous fantasy for her. If she didn\u2019t remove herself from it immediately, she was going to fall complete victim to it.</p><p>She could just see trying to explain that to her boss. The boss who had put his company\u2019s fate in her hands.</p><p>And then the ceremony was over and suddenly Evan was smiling down at her once more. She promptly forgot all about her worries and reservations.</p><p>Once again he was attentive. He touched her frequently as if he couldn\u2019t keep his hands off her. It made her nuts the way her body leaped to life under his attention, but she couldn\u2019t control it.</p><p>As they waited behind the line of people going back inside, Evan leaned down and nuzzled her ear.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go have some fun at the reception,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou, me, a little dirty dancing...\u201d</p><p>She laughed as the tightness left her chest. It was hard to remember all the reasons she shouldn\u2019t become involved with this man when he charmed her to her toes.</p><p>She tucked her hand willingly in his, and this time she curled her fingers around his as he led her into the hotel. No, logically she shouldn\u2019t immerse herself in this charade. But then attraction was anything but logical. She had only a few more hours before she would be jolted back to reality. She planned to enjoy every single one of them.</p><p>They danced. Slow, sensual songs and even the more upbeat tunes. Evan was astonishingly adept as he spun her around the room. Somehow she hadn\u2019t seen him as the type to do more than a staid waltz or just a slow cuddle type dance in the middle of the floor.</p><p>She should have known. The man was a study in athletic grace.</p><p>They took a quick break and Evan left Celia to go get drinks for them both. Celia turned to see Lucy approaching through the crowd, her face lit up like a Christmas tree.</p><p>\u201cCelia! I\u2019m so glad I got over to you before Evan spirits you away again.\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled warmly back at Evan\u2019s mother.</p><p>Lucy reached out to squeeze Celia\u2019s hand. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for coming. It\u2019s so obvious that the two or you are in love.\u201d</p><p>It took everything Celia had not to react to that statement. Obvious? How could it be? In lust, yes, but love? Evan would be horrified that his farce had worked a little too well. Nothing like a rumor of being in love to scare off the opposite sex. A man like Evan probably had more women than he could shake a stick at.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t take any of them to the wedding. He\u2019d taken her.</p><p>Business, Celia reminded herself. It was convenient and business had been at the forefront of his mind.</p><p>\u201cThe two of you make such a lovely couple,\u201d Lucy said wistfully. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ll agree to a wedding date soon. Don\u2019t make him wait, even though I\u2019m sure he deserves it. I want him to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the both of us will come up with a mutually satisfactory date,\u201d Celia said diplomatically.</p><p>Lucy squeezed again and then suddenly Celia found herself enveloped in the older woman\u2019s arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a joy to have you here, Celia. I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Lucy drew away, beaming at Celia the entire time, and Celia felt like the lowest form of pond scum for her part in deceiving this woman.</p><p>\u201cOh, look, there\u2019s Evan with your drink. I\u2019ll disappear now and let you two get back to your fun.\u201d</p><p>Lucy blew a kiss in Evan\u2019s direction and melted back into the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Evan asked as he approached.</p><p>He handed her a wineglass and stepped in close, their bodies touching.</p><p>Celia grimaced. \u201cShe was telling me how wonderful she thought it was that we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well, that would explain the look of torture in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He slid his arm around her waist and pulled her close. He stared down into her eyes, and then he simply kissed her.</p> <p>Stunned that he would be so public, even when perpetuating a hoax, she stood there in the circle of his arms while he kissed her senseless.</p><p>Desire unfurled and spread rapid fire through her belly. All he had to do was kiss her and she was helpless to do anything more than respond.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we have late check-out,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cVery late check-out. My jet can leave at my ready. What do you say we go back to the room?\u201d</p><p>No. They needed to return home. She needed the weekend to be over so she could recover her sanity.</p><p>But instead of no, she opened her mouth and whispered, \u201cyes.\u201d</p><p>The predatory gleam was back in his eyes. He put both their glasses down on a nearby table and then he took her hand and all but dragged her from the reception. They ran down the hallway to the elevator like two hormonally imbalanced teenagers.</p> <p>When they reached the room, he threw open the door, swung her into his arms and carried her straight to the bedroom. He plopped her down on the bed and stood back as he tore out of his clothes.</p><p>She leaned up on one elbow to stare appreciatively at his physique.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said coyly. \u201cThere is one of your fantasies we haven\u2019t played out yet.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows shot up and then he crawled onto the bed until he loomed menacingly over her.</p><p>\u201cOh, really. Which one?\u201d</p><p>She circled her arms around his neck and pulled him down into a kiss. Then she slid her mouth to his ear to whisper in shocking detail exactly which fantasy she was talking about.</p><p>Evan\u2019s plane landed in San Francisco close to midnight. He helped her down the steps onto the tarmac and stood next to her as they waited for his car to pull forward.</p><p>He touched her cheek, pushing aside a stray strand of hair. In truth, she looked and felt disheveled from head to toe. What had started as a quick interlude had turned into an afternoon of wanton, hedonistic pleasure. They\u2019d made love more times than she could count.</p> <p>They\u2019d stumbled out of the hotel looking like a pair of illicit lovers hurrying back to their spouses after a hot weekend affair.</p><p>She shook her head to clear that notion. There was nothing dishonorable about her liaison with Evan. It was separate from business, she asserted firmly. Separate.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t let me escort you home?\u201d Evan asked.</p><p>He glanced between her and the car that was now parked a few feet away, and his lips were drawn into a fine line.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you still have to fly back to Seattle, and it\u2019s already past midnight. I\u2019ll be fine.</p><p>Your driver will take good care of me.\u201d</p><p>He looked as if he was going to press the point when she raised her hand. The diamond caught the glare from the headlights. Slowly she removed the thin band from her finger and pressed the ring into Evan\u2019s palm.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be needing this anymore,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>He frowned as he stared down at the delicate piece of jewelry lying in his hand.</p><p>It was ridiculous that this felt like a real break-up. Her heart seized and she had the absurd urge to snatch the ring back out of his hand and put it back on her finger.</p><p>She leaned up on tiptoe and brushed her lips across his cheek. \u201cGoodbye, Evan. Have a safe trip home.\u201d</p><p>She turned and allowed the driver to usher her into the backseat. As they pulled away, she saw Evan standing in the same place she\u2019d left him, his hand closed around the ring. They stared at each other through the window until the car got too far away for her to see him any longer.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Evan tucked his hand into his pocket to touch the diamond engagement ring Celia had given back to him the night before. His finger ran over the edges, took it out and let it lay in his palm to catch the light.</p><p>For a long while, he stared down at it before closing his hand over it. As his driver pulled to the curb in front of Maddox Communications, he shoved the ring back into his pocket.</p><p>Celia wouldn\u2019t be expecting him. Hell, he wasn\u2019t expecting him. To be here, that is. He was supposed to have flown back to Seattle. He had any number of issues to deal with including talking to his team about Noah Hart. They needed to come big with an offer, and they needed to make sure any offer they made was tied up neatly with a big bow.</p><p>Yet, here he was, getting out at Celia\u2019s building because he wanted to see her again. And business had nothing to do with it.</p><p>He instructed his driver to find suitable parking and to swing back around when he phoned to say he was ready. Then he headed into the stately building to take the elevator up to the sixth floor.</p><p>When he stepped off, he was immediately impressed with the very modern, \u201cin touch\u201d feel of Maddox Communications. There was a lot of attention given to comfort, and it worked, because he felt relaxed.</p><p>Two large-screen plasma televisions were positioned on either side of the large reception desk, and Maddox\u2019s latest ad campaigns were predominately displayed in a series of commercials.</p><p>Behind the desk, a cheerful looking younger woman smiled a warm welcome as he approached.</p><p>\u201cGood morning and welcome to Maddox Communications.\u201d</p><p>He returned her smile. \u201cCan you tell Celia Taylor that Evan Reese is here to see her?\u201d</p><p>The sudden awareness in the receptionist\u2019s eyes told him she knew well who he was. She recovered quickly, though. With brisk efficiency, she rounded the corner of her desk and gestured toward the set of couches in the waiting area.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll have a seat, I\u2019ll get her at once. Would you care for some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to stride down the hallway, leaving Evan standing there. He walked to the window to look down on the street instead of sitting. If he had his way, he wouldn\u2019t be here for long anyway.</p><p>A few moments later, he heard the tap tap of heels and turned to see Celia approaching, a confused, wary look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cEvan,\u201d she greeted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to see you. I thought you were going back to Seattle. Is anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d put her impersonal business face on the moment he looked up. It annoyed him that she was pushing him away, already distancing herself from the weekend they\u2019d shared. It should be him doing the pushing. He should have gotten her out of his system after making love to her more times than he could count.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t, which was why he found himself standing here, trying to come up with an excuse to see her again.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. My plans changed. I thought we could have lunch. If you\u2019re free, that is.\u201d</p><p>She checked her watch, a quick, nervous motion that told him she was merely stalling\u2014and trying to think of an excuse why she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI would very much like to have lunch with you, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkled in indecision. She nibbled at her bottom lip. He took advantage of that moment to move closer until he crowded her. Before she could take a step back, he grasped her arm.</p><p>Alarm flared in her eyes, and she broke the contact, stepping hastily away as she stared wildly in all directions.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Evan, not here,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Her hand trembled as she raised one to smooth her hair. Instead of repairing the knot, she only managed to work more strands free. They fell down her neck, calling attention to the slim column. He was reminded of all the time he\u2019d spent nibbling at that sweet flesh.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her vehemence but kept his distance.</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let me get my purse. I\u2019ll meet you downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Her dismissal rankled him. He was used to calling the shots when it came to women and relationships.</p><p>Hell, now he was thinking of her in terms of a relationship? The only thing he should be thinking was how quickly he could get her back into bed so that hopefully this time he\u2019d get rid of the burning ache he felt when she crossed his mind.</p><p>Crossed. What a funny word, one that denoted an occasional, unintentional meeting. She lived in his</p><p>mind. He didn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t particularly care for the implication, but he was powerless to rid himself of her assault on his senses.</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment, and only because he was convinced she was ready to bolt, did he acquiesce.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll call my driver around. Oh, and Celia. I don\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\u201d</p><p>Celia spun around before she exploded. She wished she could blame it all on her anger and his arrogance, but she\u2019d been flabbergasted when Shelby had rushed into her office to tell her Evan Reese was here and he wanted to see her.</p><p>The giddy thrill that sizzled down her spine annoyed her. And then his arrogant presumption that she\u2019d drop everything to have lunch with him. He didn\u2019t like to be kept waiting. Who did he think he was?</p><p>She sighed as she collected her purse. Where to even begin? He was an important client. The most important client of her career. And then there was the fact she\u2019d acted as his fake fianc\u00e9e, and oh yeah, she\u2019d slept with him. Repeatedly.</p><p>A hot blush shot up her neck and nearly burned her cheeks off as she remembered just how often they\u2019d had sex. They\u2019d re-enacted all his fantasies and some of hers, too.</p><p>They\u2019d been insatiable.</p><p>Hell and damnation but she\u2019d expected several days to recover from the weekend before she had to see him again. In her utter befuddlement and not to mention being blown over by the sex, she hadn\u2019t even mentioned the season opener to Evan.</p><p>It was as good an excuse as any to accompany him to lunch. At least then she could pretend it was all about business.</p><p>After a quick wave to Shelby, she rode the elevator down to the first floor. She passed the busy American cuisine restaurant with the lunch crowd lined up at the door and exited the building.</p><p>Evan was standing at the curb, one hand resting on the open door to the backseat of his car, the other shoved into his pocket. He looked positively arrogant. Like he not only belonged in the world but owned it.</p><p>He nodded as she approached and motioned her inside the car. Then he slid in beside her and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could eat at this restaurant I know across town. It\u2019s small and not so well-known, but the food is excellent and it affords privacy.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her almost like the last was a challenge.</p><p>She tilted her chin up and stared coolly at him. She hoped that she looked as unruffled as she wanted to portray.</p><p>\u201cIs this business, Evan? Why did you come to my office today?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened briefly before he relaxed and eyed her with thinly veiled amusement.</p><p>\u201cWe slept together, Celia. I don\u2019t think lunch is that scandalous given that fact.\u201d</p><p>She curled her fingers into tight fists. She wanted to close her eyes and moan her dismay. No, she doubted he\u2019d understand why it was so important to her that there be no hint of impropriety between them. He was the type who\u2019d never let what others thought rule his life. She hated that evidently she was the type. Hated it but couldn\u2019t change it.</p><p>\u201cEvan.\u201d</p><p>She stopped when her voice cracked. She felt like the worst sort of idiot. Around others she had no problem being blunt\u2014and forceful when the occasion called for it. But with Evan, she was ridiculously tongue-tied.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>He wore a curious smile, almost as if he found her and the situation amusing. It made her angry.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this. We simply can\u2019t. This weekend was a huge mistake. I don\u2019t want to be one of these women who say no, no, no, and then yes, yes, yes and then spend the next week castigating myself for my weakness. I shouldn\u2019t have slept with you. I swear, I left my brain behind when we went to Catalina.</p><p>I knew what I was getting into. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t blame you or think you manipulated me into having sex with you. I\u2019m a big girl and I knew full well what I was doing. It doesn\u2019t make me any less stupid, mind you.\u201d</p><p>Evan simply hauled her into his arms and stifled her tirade with a kiss. Not just any kiss. He devoured her whole. She melted\u2014positively melted\u2014in his arms. She went limp against him.</p><p>Yep, she was one of those silly women at the mercy of her hormones.</p><p>She placed both hands on his chest and shoved until they sat apart, both breathing raggedly. She probably looked demented sitting there, hair askew, chest heaving up and down as if she\u2019d run a marathon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop kissing me!\u201d</p><p>He smiled again, a lazy, sensual smile of a lion standing over its prey. She was lunch apparently.</p><p>\u201cBut I like kissing you and I try never to deny myself life\u2019s little pleasures.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes then caught herself before she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, Evan. Be serious for one minute. I mean it. Stop kissing me and stop touching me.\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up in surrender. \u201cOkay, okay. I won\u2019t touch you.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms protectively over her chest and moved as far over in the seat as she could. Why had she agreed to lunch with him? Why?</p><p>Because you\u2019re a masochist and you can\u2019t resist him.</p><p>There was that.</p> <p>She\u2019s always thought it was a myth. The out-of-control hormones that made an otherwise intelligent woman make waste of her brain cells every time she came into contact with the one.</p><p>She was certainly proving the waste of brain cells to be true.</p><p>The rest of the journey was spent in brooding silence. Evan was silent and Celia brooded. When they finally pulled up to a restaurant that boasted the best seafood on the west coast, she raised a skeptical eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cTry it first and then tell me if you disagree,\u201d Evan said in amusement.</p><p>He was becoming way too adept at reading her and it annoyed her to no end, especially since she had no idea what went on in his head. She was afraid to find out.</p><p>When she stepped out and glanced around, she had to hand it to him. For a man who didn\u2019t seemingly care if they were seen together or not and certainly didn\u2019t have the objections she had, he\u2019d chosen a restaurant where they weren\u2019t likely to be seen by anyone who knew them.</p> <p>Evan guided her in to the rustic cedar building with its quasi-southern charm mixed with California d\u00e9cor.</p><p>It was an odd blend that, to her surprise, worked well.</p><p>The two sat in the far corner where the lighting so was so dim a small kerosene lantern sat in the middle of the table to offer ambience.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on a first date,\u201d she said ruefully after Evan had ordered the wine.</p><p>He smiled and waggled his eyebrows suggestively. \u201cWould it make me less of a jerk to be up front about the fact I plan to have you in my bed tonight?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath until she felt curiously lightheaded. She suspected of course, but to hear him say it outright was way sexier than it should have been.</p><p>\u201cI have to go back to work,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t intend to spirit you away for an afternoon tryst, though the idea has merit. I wonder if your coworkers would call the police?\u201d</p> <p>She glared at him\u2014determined not to laugh. But even her scowl twitched. Irreverent bastard.</p><p>The waiter appeared with food, and she blinked because she hadn\u2019t remembered ordering. She glanced at the half-empty wineglass and couldn\u2019t for the life of her remember drinking so much as a sip. Evan was bad, bad for her brain. He was as bad as some wasting disease. She wouldn\u2019t survive, either.</p><p>\u201cEvan,\u201d she began again, and promptly shut up when it came out more as a plaintive wail than a protest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a car for you, Celia. No one needs to see you getting into a vehicle with me. I\u2019ll have my driver pick you up from work, or if you prefer, you can drive your car to your apartment and I\u2019ll have him pick you up there. And I\u2019ll have him take you home in time for you to prepare for work.\u201d</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she immediately shutting him down? Instead of telling him that in no uncertain terms would she agree to such a thing, she found herself contemplating how decadent it would be to dash off to an elicit rendezvous with her lover.</p><p>She shivered at the wordlover . Evan was a superb specimen of a man. He was fantastic in bed and insatiable to boot. He knew how to pleasure a woman and was as unselfish a lover as she\u2019d ever had.</p><p>The mere idea of spending the night with him had her tied in so many knots it would take a team of massage therapists to work them out.</p><p>She chewed absently at the food, not registering the taste or even what she ate. Her throat was as dry as the desert and her tongue was swollen and clumsy.</p><p>\u201cYou act as though it\u2019s a crime for us to make love,\u201d he said in an oddly tender voice.</p><p>If it had been coaxing or wheedling, she could have been cold to him. But she could swear he was reassuring her and attempting to allay her fears.</p><p>She licked her lips and raised her gaze to meet his. Awareness hit her square in the chest. In his eyes she saw undulating bodies. Hers and his. In perfect rhythm. So beautiful and so pleasurable that she closed her eyes to further immerse herself in the memory.</p><p>\u201cSay yes.\u201d</p><p>His voice stroked her as surely as his fingers had done. A prickle of goose bumps spread rapidly over her shoulders and down her chest until her nipples tightened into two painful knots.</p><p>\u201cCelia,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>Finally she opened her eyes and fixed him with her unfocused gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Celia entered her office with a heightened sense of anticipation. She already knew she\u2019d be clock watching until it was quitting time and then she\u2019d race home so she could change and look her best for her naughty escape to Evan\u2019s.</p><p>Her mouth curved into a naughty smile to match the naughtiness of her and Evan\u2019s plan. It was wicked, forbidden, and she was so turned on that she was ready to fidget right out of her shoes.</p><p>With a sigh, she sank into her chair behind her desk, kicked off her shoes and logged on to catch up on e-mail. She hadn\u2019t planned to go out for lunch at all and had, in fact, brought food from home, planning to eat at her desk. After missing Friday, she\u2019d spent the morning getting a report from Jason on her client meetings he covered and then she\u2019d gone through messages.</p><p>She groaned as her in-box stacked up with e-mail after e-mail. She started at the bottom and worked</p><p>up, deleting several after cursory glances. Those requiring a lengthy response she flagged to respond to later and the ones she could just do a one-line response to she typed furiously and sent on their way.</p><p>She was nearly to the end when her gaze flickered over the name Lucy Reese. She did a double take.</p><p>Evan\u2019s mom? Why would she e-mail and how had she gotten Celia\u2019s address?</p><p>Her stomach fluttered a bit, and guilt crept over her all over again. Lucy was nice and Celia hated lying to her. She hated lying as a rule for any reason but especially not for such a frivolous endeavor.</p><p>She braced herself and clicked on the message. It began as cheerfully as Lucy herself was in person.</p><p>She said again how thrilled she was that Celia and Evan had found each other.</p><p>Talk about another shot to the gut.</p><p>She expressed her desire to see Celia again and hoped Evan would bring her to Seattle for a visit.</p><p>Could this get any worse?</p><p>Her message ended with a short note that she\u2019d attached some pictures from the wedding that she thought Celia would enjoy.</p><p>Celia opened the attached JPEGS and couldn\u2019t help but smile. The pictures were of her and Evan at the wedding reception. They looked happy and...in love.</p><p>There was one of them dancing, another of Evan looking down with a tender expression and the last was when Evan had kissed her. Celia\u2019s hand rested on his chest and the glitter of the ring contrasted with the black of Evan\u2019s tuxedo. Their mouths were fused together, and it was obvious to anyone looking at the picture that they were in danger of combusting right there in the middle of a crowded reception.</p><p>For several minutes, she debated whether or not to reply to Lucy\u2019s e-mail. It seemed rude not to, but it was also a terrible thing to prolong the charade.</p><p>Finally, she settled for a brief thank you and that she\u2019d enjoyed meeting Lucy, as well. It was true and didn\u2019t delve into any part of her nonexistent relationship with Evan.</p><p>Stealing over to the man\u2019s hotel room after work hours certainly couldn\u2019t be considered a relationship.</p><p>Her intercom beeped, startling her from her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cCelia, I have a cleaning service willing to take over Noah Hart\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave,\u201d Celia muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Do you have details on when they\u2019ll start? Can you e-mail me that and the agency name and contact info so I can forward it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>There was a distinct pause and then Shelby\u2019s hesitant voice filtered through the intercom.</p><p>\u201cSooo, are you going to give me the dirt on Noah Hart? Like how you know him and why you\u2019re arranging his maid service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Celia said shortly.</p><p>She punched the button to end the conversation and hoped Shelby would get the hint. True, Shelby liked to gossip but she wasn\u2019t overtly intrusive. She backed off when people wanted her to.</p><p>She checked her e-mail and then forwarded the information to Noah. After closing her e-mail program, she stared at her phone and sighed. Noah was a disaster when it came to e-mails. The man just didn\u2019t care about advanced methods of communication. If it couldn\u2019t be said on the phone or person, he wasn\u2019t much interested. It drove his agent nuts. Simon Blackstone much preferred the impersonal methods of e-mail and text messages to actual conversations, but if he wanted to talk to Noah, he had to pick up the phone. Celia was convinced Noah did it just to torque his agent\u2019s jaw.</p><p>At any rate, she\u2019d better call and leave a message on Noah\u2019s cell or God knows what the cleaning lady would come across when she went to his house.</p><p>She\u2019d hit the end button after leaving him a nagging, sisterly message when it hit her square in the face that she had neglected to mention the game to Evan.</p><p>How could she be so stupid? With everything else that had gone on in the weekend, the game had slipped her mind. Even when she\u2019d done the pitch and specifically dangled the Noah carrot in front of Evan\u2019s nose, she\u2019d flaked on the season opener.</p><p>He was probably already booked solid, if he was even going to be in town. The game was the night before her scheduled pitch session and he\u2019d probably just fly in on the morning of their meeting.</p><p>\u201cStupid, stupid, stupid,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Would it be crass to mention it tonight? During their little sex getaway? If she wanted to get him in front of Noah in a casual setting, then she was going to have to move fast and hope he hadn\u2019t locked up his week already with other obligations.</p><p>She looked up when a knock sounded at her door. Brock stood against the door frame, a smile easing the newly developed lines at his eyes and mouth.</p><p>\u201cHey, we wanted to get together at Rosa after work today. You\u2019re the star and we want to toast with copious amounts of alcohol. It will be a good pep rally for the presentation on Friday.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach rolled into a tight ball. The last thing she wanted was a raucous night at Rosa with the work gang. Usually she\u2019d be all over it. The Maddox employees regularly hung out at the upscale martini bar just a block away. It\u2019s where they met to celebrate, commiserate or just take a break from a hellish workday.</p><p>The last celebration they\u2019d staged there had been for Jason after he\u2019d landed the Prentice account. Now Brock was lining up the chorus for her.</p><p>Her cheeks tightened in pleasure even as her heart sank at the idea of ditching Evan after agreeing to meet him. He\u2019d think her the worst sort of coward even if it was the smart thing to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, Brock, but I already have plans for the evening. Important plans,\u201d she added after a pause.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019d rather not jinx myself before going into the presentation. It\u2019s not in the bag\u2014yet\u2014but I certainly plan to perform a slam dunk on Friday.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, I understand. We\u2019ll go and just call it a pre-planning session. It\u2019s as good an excuse as any to throw back a few. But if you land this, just be prepared for a victory celebration to end all victory celebrations.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cOh, you know it. I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019ll totally hold you to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, take care and see you tomorrow.\u201d He turned to go but stopped and turned back once more.</p><p>\u201cOh, and, Celia, if I haven\u2019t already said it, thank you. You did a magnificent job. I doubted your approach at first, but you came through in spades.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sped up and she curled her fingers until her nails dug into her palms. It was all she could do not to stand up and throw her arms in the air complete with an obnoxious yell.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your trust,\u201d she said as calmly as possible.</p><p>With a short salute, he disappeared down the hallway, leaving Celia grinning like a loon.</p><p>Promptly at a quarter to five, Celia headed down the elevator\u2014fifteen minutes before quitting time so she\u2019d miss the majority of her coworkers. She didn\u2019t want to explain why she wasn\u2019t joining them at Rosa.</p><p>Her apartment wasn\u2019t far, and usually she\u2019d enjoy driving her Beamer with the top down\u2014it really was a sassy, smooth handling dream machine\u2014but today she was just impatient to be home, and the traffic was driving her mad.</p><p>When she reached her apartment, she recognized the car out front and the driver standing on the curb beside it. With a groan, she slowed to a stop on the street and rolled down her window. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be a moment,\u201d she called.</p><p>The driver smiled, tipped his hat and said, \u201cNo hurry, Miss Taylor. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>She maneuvered into her parking spot and dashed inside, ready to do battle. She hadn\u2019t missed Evan\u2019s reaction to her sexy, feminine lingerie. It was her one indulgence or what she deemed a silly indulgence since her sex life was so staid in the last few years that no one but her had a prayer of ever seeing what her underwear looked like.</p><p>Hopping on one foot as she stepped out of her clothing, she went over to her drawer to find the most sinful set of lingerie she owned. She settled on pink. What was more feminine or soft looking than pink?</p> <p>Even growing up with a hoard of boys hadn\u2019t erased the girly from her. And since she was a redhead, wearing pink clothing wasn\u2019t an option. But pink underwear she could do.</p><p>Unsure of whether she\u2019d return to her apartment before going to work the next day\u2014and she did like to be prepared for anything\u2014she threw an outfit into an overnight bag along with her toiletries and a</p><p>lavender bra and panties.</p><p>She did a quick check of her messages and then did something she never did. She turned off her BlackBerry and tucked it into her overnight bag. Tonight was hers. She needed no reminders from the business world. If she was going to indulge in fantasy, she was going whole hog.</p><p>She locked up and hurried out her door to the street where the driver waited. He ushered her into the backseat and they drove away into traffic.</p> <p>It amused her how exciting she found the whole experience. She could be a mistress at the beck and call of her \u00fcber-wealthy benefactor, discreetly bundled into a private car and rushed to meet him at an undisclosed location.</p><p>\u201cGet it together, Celia,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Lord, but she did lose all her brain cells when it came to this man. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she\u2019d throw away all her independence and start greeting him at the door every evening, wearing a kitchen apron with oven mitts and a piping-hot casserole dish.</p><p>Oddly but the image wasn\u2019t all that distasteful. For the first few seconds anyway. She laughed outright and it had the effect of someone popping her thought bubble with a sharp pin.</p><p>The driver looked up in the rearview mirror, and she valiantly tried to look back with a straight face. If he only knew the absurd thoughts she was processing.</p><p>If she was truly the naughty girl of her fantasies, she would have ridden over with only a trench coat covering her sexy lingerie. Then when she walked into Evan\u2019s room, she could discard the coat and watch his reaction.</p> <p>The idea certainly had merit, and if she ever received another invitation such as tonight, she\u2019d give it serious consideration.</p><p>A few minutes later, the driver pulled up to the sumptuous hotel Evan resided in when he was in town, bypassed the main entrance and stopped at the second pull in where her door was immediately opened by one of the hotel staff.</p><p>Maybe Evan had his own entrance. The thought amused her, but then he had so much money, it wouldn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>She was immediately met by concierge and was handed a keycard.</p><p>\u201cMr. Reese wishes for you to go right up,\u201d the older man said.</p><p>She blushed from head to toe. She knew well what it looked like. Like she was some hooker or mistress\u2014precisely what she\u2019d imagined on her way over\u2014all set to have a clandestine meeting.</p><p>She took the key card, murmured her thanks, and shot past the doorman and into the small hallway leading directly to the elevators. Thankfully she bypassed the lobby entirely. It seemed like everyone in the world knew what she was here for.</p><p>In the elevator, she inserted her key and punched the button for the top floor. She was whisked to the</p> <p>top in no time at all and stepped into the eerily quiet hallway. There were only a few doors. The rooms must be huge because she only counted four doors total. Evan\u2019s was on the very end, and she took a deep breath before inserting the key into the slot.</p><p>When she opened the door and stepped inside, she immediately saw Evan standing across the room, drink in hand, his eyes fixed on her. He\u2019d been waiting. She could sense his impatience and see the triumph in his expression when she closed the door behind her.</p><p>She stood there, unmoving, as he put his drink aside and crossed the room in just a few, long strides.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He swept her into his arms and kissed her. He wasn\u2019t gentle or even particularly careful. Their bodies came together in a clash she felt all the way to her bones.</p><p>\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t?\u201d she asked when she was finally able to draw a breath.</p><p>His eyes glittered, and his throat worked up and down as if he was trying to hold on to his control.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t, I was prepared to go and drag you out of your apartment.\u201d</p><p>All her concerns fell away. Nothing else mattered but the intense need they felt for each other.</p><p>\u201cNext time I won\u2019t come. I have my own set of caveman fantasies wherein the Neanderthal drags me off to his cave.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat and before she could react, he had her in his arms and was striding toward the bedroom.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>They made it as far as the dresser. Evan slid her onto the polished surface of the wood and leaned in until she straddled his hips.</p><p>\u201cI swore this time I\u2019d savor first,\u201d he said against her mouth. \u201cDammit, but when I see you, all reason flies out the door.\u201d</p><p>She hooked her legs around his back and pulled him into the V of her groin.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you talk too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever a woman,\u201d he murmured as he swept hungrily over her mouth.</p><p>Her excitement mounted as Evan ripped at her shirt. He shoved it down over her shoulders, trapping her arms to her sides. His hands smoothed up her bare skin to her shoulders. He gripped her so hard, she knew she\u2019d wear his prints.</p><p>His breath blew hot over her chin and then her jaw. He kissed a line to her ear then sucked the lobe</p><p>between his teeth.</p><p>Shivers overtook her. Delicate little goose bumps dotted her flesh until she trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>He stepped back, his hands falling to the waistband of her pants. His fingers hung in the snap and he stood there staring at her heaving chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He raised one finger to hook in the strap of her bra. He ran it up then down, and he grazed the tip over the swell of her breast.</p><p>\u201cI love the lingerie.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back on the dresser, resting her palms on the top to give him a better glimpse of her cleavage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely merciless, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She smiled and arched invitingly until the barest hint of her nipples peeked at him over the lace cups of her bra.</p><p>He wrapped both arms around her waist and lowered his mouth to the valley between her breasts. He kissed and nibbled at the plump swells until she gasped and struggled for each breath.</p><p>The straps had loosened and tumbled down her shoulders. He slid his palms up her body, hooked his thumbs in the straps and dragged them back down.</p><p>He tugged until finally one cup slipped down and freed her breast. He licked the nipple until it puckered and strained outward. Then he closed his mouth ever so gently around the tip.</p><p>\u201cEvan,\u201d she whispered as her hands tangled in his hair.</p><p>He sucked softly and then with more pressure until her entire focus was the streaks of pleasure radiating from her nipple.</p><p>Clumsily, he yanked and fumbled with the clasp of her bra until it fell completely free. He shoved it aside and focused on unbuttoning her pants, his mouth never leaving her breast.</p><p>He lifted her hips. She hoisted herself up, giving him room to pull her pants down. They fell to the floor and he took a step back and ran his gaze up and down her body.</p><p>She felt beautiful and desirable. Even irresistible. He ate her with his eyes. Appreciation didn\u2019t adequately describe what she saw in his gaze. This was a man who saw only her. There were no other women.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I ever fantasized about having sex with a woman on top of a dresser, but I\u2019m re-evaluating. I can see the appeal.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled a little closer to him so that she was perched on the edge. Right now she wanted him so much, even the short distance to the bed seemed too much.</p><p>He tucked his finger underneath the lace of her panties and ran it along the edge until he delved into her hot, liquid heat. She leaned back, closed her eyes and moaned as he grew bolder with his exploration.</p><p>The sensation of his hands rasping lightly over her behind as he cupped her and began to slide her underwear off was enough to drive her beyond endurance. She had to have him. Her nerve endings were fried.</p><p>And then she was naked under his seeking gaze and inquisitive fingers. He stroked and caressed until she was a mass of gasping, breathless anticipation.</p><p>\u201cNo fair,\u201d she panted. \u201cYou still have clothes on.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a faint smile before quickly shedding his clothing. Then he dropped to his knees in front of the dresser. His hands slid sensuously up her legs, setting fire with the barest of touches.</p><p>Her breath caught and held when he parted her thighs and pressed his mouth to her most intimate flesh.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d</p><p>It was all she could manage. Everything went fuzzy around her. Swimming. She was swimming in the most exquisite, mind-numbing waters she\u2019d ever navigated.</p><p>The man was talented. He was generous. Even when he was pushed to his limits, he brought her to the brink of ecstasy before satisfying his own needs.</p><p>\u201cEvan, please!\u201d</p><p>He rose up, gripped her knees and yanked her forward until she perched precariously on the edge of the dresser again. There was savage menace in his expression, the look of a man pushed too far too fast and struggling to hold on with everything he had.</p><p>He paused only long enough to roll on a condom and then he found her center and plunged deep.</p><p>His hands slid under her bottom, gripped tight and pulled her to meet his thrusts. He was deep and she felt him in every part of her soul. She ended, he began. He was a part of her, taking, giving and sharing.</p><p>He leaned forward to bury his face in her neck as he rocked against her. Lightning sizzled down her spine as he nuzzled her sensitive skin and suckled the column of her neck.</p><p>She wrapped her arms and legs around him until there wasn\u2019t an inch of space between them. Still buried tightly inside her, he lifted her up and backed toward the bed. He fell, her on top, and they landed with a jolt.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d he said in a strained voice.</p><p>His pupils dilated and his brow constricted. Tight lines were etched into his forehead, and his hands gripped her hips so tightly that she could do nothing more than squeeze her inner muscles around his erection.</p><p>\u201cSweat heaven,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to last, and she was helpless to do anything about it. She needed to move. She had to move.</p><p>Placing her palms flat on his chest, she wiggled free of his grasp and began to move up and down, taking him, releasing him, then taking him again.</p><p>Sweat beaded his brow. His eyes were narrow slits, and he never took his gaze from hers. He urged her closer so he could cup her breasts. They filled both palms and he rubbed the pad of his thumb over the painfully erect nubs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hold on,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go together,\u201d he urged.</p><p>His hands left her breasts and he gripped her hips, lifting her and pulling her down in time with his upward thrusts. The burn spread. Tension mounted. She wound tighter and tighter until it was all she could do to hang on.</p><p>She threw her head back, her mouth open in an endless cry of agony. The sweetest, most breathtaking agony of her life.</p><p>His hands left her hips to tangle in her hair. He rose up, pulling her harshly to meet his kiss. Frantically, his hands moved up and down her back, into her hair, through her hair, over her face as if he couldn\u2019t get enough and wanted to memorize every feature.</p><p>And then it was as if the world went silent. The wave rolled, crashed and then broke into a million tiny ripples, each feeding the other.</p><p>She was no longer cognizant of holding on to him. She was riding high and fast.</p><p>She had no idea how long she lay sprawled over Evan, her heart beating so frantically that she literally felt each thud. His arms were wrapped around her, and their legs were all tangled up. He was still buried inside her, and she could feel the remnants of his orgasm. Each little pulse sent a tiny shock of aftermath flooding through her body.</p><p>Slowly she became aware that he was stroking her back and her hair. He murmured little sweet words in her ear but nothing seemed to make sense. She was completely befuddled by this man, by her reaction to him.</p><p>\u201cI think I blew it again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and snuggled a little closer, tucking her head under his chin and nuzzling his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou blew, all right. But I think I blew first.\u201d</p><p>His chest heaved as he chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a naughty girl.\u201d</p><p>Summoning energy she sorely lacked, she raised her head and propped up on his chest so she could stare down into his eyes. What she saw sent a pang of longing straight through her heart.</p><p>He looked content. Sated, but not just in a sexual way. He looked at home, like they\u2019d been together forever. Oh, she had an overactive imagination. She was sure of that. But when he looked at her like that, with the world in his eyes, a world where only she existed, it was hard not to get caught up in the fantasy they\u2019d created between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran a gentle finger over her mouth. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain a man should never ask a woman what she\u2019s thinking right after sex,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain all women like to talk after sex. Well, talk and cuddle, or some girly thing like that.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and leaned down to kiss him. \u201cI like the cuddle part.\u201d</p> <p>He gathered her in his arms and rolled until they lay on their sides. \u201cNot a talker, huh?\u201d</p><p>She reached down and carefully rolled the condom off him. He put his hand down to stop her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do that. You don\u2019t have to mess with it.\u201d</p><p>But she already had it off. She kissed him again then scooted off the bed to discard it. When she looked back, he was propped on one hand, watching her intently.</p><p>His naked body was a gorgeous sight. Even in a relaxed state, his proportions were generous to say the least.</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep looking at me like that, it\u2019s not going to stay down,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou only have one condom?\u201d she asked in mock horror.</p><p>He reached over, grabbed her arm and yanked her back down beside him. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I had a case delivered.\u201d</p><p>She snorted with laughter. \u201cA case? Are you planning an orgy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have exaggerated...slightly. But only slightly,\u201d he said with a sly grin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I\u2019d hate to think I was under that kind of pressure.\u201d</p> <p>He tweaked her nose then followed up with a kiss. \u201cSomehow I think you could hold up quite well.\u201d</p><p>She cuddled deeper into his embrace. She hadn\u2019t lied about the cuddling part or the talking part. Well, maybe about the talking part. In truth, she\u2019d love to bare her soul, learn all his secrets, tell him all hers.</p><p>Tell him how much she loved...</p><p>She froze. For a moment she simply couldn\u2019t breathe. It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d just fallen in love with the man. No, it had probably been coming for a while now. But she hadn\u2019t admitted it. Hadn\u2019t even thought it much less said it aloud.</p><p>Yeah, it was there in the background just waiting for the time when she let it slip in. She\u2019d been so good\u2014or so she thought\u2014about keeping her emotional distance.</p><p>She loved this man. Her heart seized. It was a painful admission. Wasn\u2019t figuring out you were in love supposed to be accompanied by fireworks, a fanfare, a giddy thrill? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be the most wonderful thing in the world?</p><p>Why then did she have the sudden urge to run to the bathroom and throw up?</p><p>\u201cWe have options,\u201d Evan said.</p> <p>She blinked and focused her attention back on the here and now and the fact she was in bed after hot, sweaty sex with the man she...loved.</p><p>It was all she could do not to groan.</p><p>\u201cWhat options?\u201d she asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cI can feed you. I can make mad, passionate love to you again. Or we can take a short nap and then do either option one or two. Or both. See? I\u2019m easy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and squeezed him. She did love him. It scared her to death just how much she loved him, and now that she\u2019d admitted it, she was flooded by so much emotion. It was all she could do not to blurt it out like some teenage girl with her first crush.</p><p>\u201cAm I staying over?\u201d she asked. She hadn\u2019t wanted to assume, but she needed to know before she started choosing options.</p><p>He leaned up and cradled her so he looked down at her. \u201cOf course. That is, if you want to. If you didn\u2019t bring clothes to go to work in, I can have my driver take you home.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI did bring clothes. But if he takes me to work, I\u2019m without a car. It would probably be best if he did take me home early enough for me to get my car. I can dress here.\u201d</p><p>He looked for a moment like he\u2019d say something but then evidently he thought better of it and didn\u2019t push. She wondered what he\u2019d wanted to say, but like him, she didn\u2019t push.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll make sure we get an early enough wake-up call for you to shower and get ready here before he takes you home to get your car.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, she kissed him. It wasn\u2019t a playful little peck this time, but a warm, deep kiss that showed without words the depth of her feelings.</p><p>When she finally drew away, his eyes were glazed with passion, but there was also contentment that she didn\u2019t want to speculate about.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I vote we go with eat, mad passionate love and then sleep,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cSold.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, they sat cross-legged on the bed, devouring the room service Evan had ordered. She was swallowed up by one of his robes, and he was wearing a pair of boxer shorts.</p><p>She ate indelicately, with her fingers, foregoing the utensils. It was finger food anyway, and it was too</p><p>scrumptious to be all highbrow about eating it.</p><p>They were nearly done when it hit her that she still hadn\u2019t broached the subject of the baseball game.</p><p>Where before she\u2019d felt a little awkward about bringing it up during what was obviously an illicit rendezvous, here with Evan, she was completely at ease.</p><p>\u201cTell me your plans for the rest of the week. Are you returning to Seattle until our presentation on Friday?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head and studied her intently. \u201cThat depends, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether I have a reason to stay.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed. His meaning couldn\u2019t have been more clear. Her mouth suddenly went dry and she gulped a mouthful of water.</p><p>\u201cI meant to invite you to the Tide season opener. I have tickets. Good tickets. Are you interested?\u201d</p><p>He looked a little surprised, and for a moment she wondered if she\u2019d overstepped her boundries. But then he smiled. A genuine, warm smile that told her he was pleased with her invitation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to go. It\u2019s Thursday night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI could pick you up and drive us over.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed, and for a moment she could swear he looked victorious. Over what, she hadn\u2019t a clue.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what time, and I\u2019ll be waiting with bells on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt starts at seven, so I\u2019ll be here around five-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it already.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed. Things were shaping up perfectly. She\u2019d take him to the game and introduce him to Noah afterward. Then she\u2019d wow him the next morning with a kick-ass presentation. The deal was hers. In the bag. She couldn\u2019t contemplate any other outcome.</p><p>Golden Gate and Athos Koteas might be coming on strong, but they didn\u2019t have Noah Hart, and they damn sure didn\u2019t have her ideas. Ideas she knew were perfect for Evan and his company.</p><p>This was hers.</p><p>Evan reached out to wipe a smudge from the corner of her mouth. She glanced down to see his food gone and most of hers, as well. And the way he was looking at her, she had a good idea what was for dessert.</p><p>\u201cGive me two seconds to clear this away and roll the cart out into the hall and we\u2019ll get on with option two, although I\u2019m thinking that option three should be significantly delayed.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow and her heart started tripping double time.</p><p>\u201cOh? How delayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery delayed,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cI\u2019m thinking option two could be divided into options three, four, five...\u201d</p><p>In response, she untied her robe and tugged it away until she sat naked on the bed.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Celia pulled into one of the reserved parking spaces at the stadium and cut the engine. She glanced over at Evan. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He looked out the windshield at the proximity of their space and the stadium entrance and whistled in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cThese must be some tickets you have.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI told you they\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>They got out and Celia led the way. Normally she would have gone in through the players\u2019 entrance, but she didn\u2019t want to tip her hand just yet, so they headed through the main gate just as everyone else did.</p><p>Evan waited for her while she went through security and had her bag screened and then they had their tickets scanned and walked in the direction of the field.</p><p>Since she\u2019d handled the tickets, she knew he hadn\u2019t seen them and she couldn\u2019t wait to get his reaction to the behind the home plate VIP tickets she\u2019d scored from Noah.</p><p>Several minutes later, and after navigating two entrances, they entered the field above the home plate.</p><p>She flashed her tickets and an usher led them down the steps to a box of seats directly behind the batter\u2019s box.</p><p>He motioned them into the row and Celia settled in the seat four rows up from the bottom.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ethan said as he took his seat beside her. \u201cI mean, wow. How the hell did you get these tickets? They must have cost a fortune. Not to mention they\u2019ve been sold out. I know because I\u2019ve tried to get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know people,\u201d she said smugly.</p><p>He eyed her curiously. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to get the impression you do.\u201d</p><p>They caught the tail end of batting practice and then settled back as the field was watered and prepared for the start of the game.</p><p>Evan relaxed in his seat and knocked his shades down over his eyes. It was exceptionally sunny today and there was absolutely no cloud or fog cover. It was a perfect day for baseball.</p><p>In typical business-geek style, his gaze roved over the fans, looking for those who wore Reese designs.</p><p>If Celia had her way, a lot more normal, everyday people would want to wear his line of sportswear.</p><p>He turned when he heard Celia talking to a hot dog vendor. She twisted to look at Evan. \u201cYou want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re having,\u201d he replied.</p><p>He dug into his wallet to pay the vendor, but the older man smiled and waved him off.</p><p>\u201cOur Cece is taken care of. No charge for her.\u201d</p><p>Evan watched the banter between Celia and the vendor in utter bemusement. They chattered about batting averages, who to watch in the coming season and the travesty that had occurred the previous season when the Tide had finished one game back from the division leader.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll win the pennant this year,\u201d Celia consoled. \u201cNoah is in top form. He was only warming up his bat last year.\u201d</p><p>The vendor nodded enthusiastically. \u201cI believe you\u2019re right, Miss Cece. He got hot and the season ended.\u201d</p><p>Celia turned and made an expression like she\u2019d forgotten something.</p><p>\u201cOh, my manners are horrible. Please forgive me. Evan, this is Henry Dockett. He\u2019s worked here since the stadium was built thirty years ago. He knows everything there is to know about everything around here. Henry, this is Evan Reese.\u201d</p><p>Evan extended his hand to shake the older man\u2019s and Henry\u2019s face lit up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Evan Reese from Reese Enterprises?\u201d</p><p>Evan smiled. \u201cOne and the same.\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded approvingly. \u201cGood place for you to be then. Miss Cece will show you a good time.\u201d</p><p>Someone else signaled for Henry and he nodded at Evan and Celia. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later on to check on you, Miss Cece.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and patted Henry on the arm and thanked him for the hot dogs.</p><p>When she turned back in her seat, Evan leaned over to take his hot dog from her lap.</p><p>\u201cDo you have everyone eating out of your hand,Miss Cece? \u201d</p><p>She actually blushed and ducked her head.</p><p>\u201cHenry is an old friend.\u201d</p><p>Evan chuckled, delighted at the rosy bloom of her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any other surprises in store for me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she mumbled around a bite of hot dog.</p><p>The Tide took the field, and the very first batter walked. Celia groaned her dismay along with the rest of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cOur pitching has been what\u2019s let us down in the past,\u201d she whispered to Evan.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that not only did he know, but he could quote the stats for every one of the Tide\u2019s pitching roster.</p><p>\u201cThis year should be better,\u201d Evan consoled.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSoren is our best. He usually starts cold, though. If we can get out of the first inning, he\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>Again Evan grinned and sat back to watch. Celia bolted from her seat when the second batter grounded to second and Noah scooped, tossed to the shortstop who turned the double play to first.</p><p>Evan could swear that Noah looked straight at Celia and winked. He looked between the two and finally shook off the absurd notion.</p><p>Soren struck out the next batter and the Tide was up to bat. Celia clutched her hands like an anxious mother. Todd Cameron, the lead off, looked up at Celia as he headed to the plate, grinned and waved.</p><p>Celia waved and blew him a kiss.</p><p>Evan stared but didn\u2019t say anything. Things just got stranger and stranger. He was willing to put the first off as a fluke, but when the third batter came up and gave Celia a thumbs-up, he wondered what the hell he was missing.</p><p>After the batter flied out to center field, advancing the two runners on a sacrifice, Evan leaned over, intending to ask Celia exactly what he was missing out on, but she put her hand on his arm and squeezed hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust a minute. Noah\u2019s up!\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dug into his arm like little daggers, but he didn\u2019t pry her away. He was too interested to see what would happen when Hart came up. And, too, he was interested to get a close up glimpse of what he hoped would be his company\u2019s golden PR boy.</p><p>Noah\u2019s face was drawn in concentration as he began the walk to the plate. He swung the bat a few times then stopped, two inches out of the box. He turned and glanced first to the right of Evan and Celia and dipped his head in acknowledgment. Then he turned and scanned behind home plate until his gaze lighted on Celia.</p><p>He lost the look of intense concentration, and his face relaxed into a smile. He gave her an exaggerated wink and then held up his fist.</p> <p>Evan\u2019s mouth fell open as he glanced between the two. Celia\u2019s hand tightened further on his arm when Noah took the first strike.</p><p>\u201cCome on, come on,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The next two were balls. Then he swung at the second strike. If he didn\u2019t hit soon, Evan was going to lose the feeling in his arm.</p><p>The next pitch, Noah fouled back. The next was a ball, making it a full count.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t watch,\u201d Celia whispered.</p> <p>The pitcher wound up, threw a fastball and Noah swung. The bat connected with a sweet crack that to anyone listening signaled a smash hit. The ball sailed over the center-field wall into the upper deck.</p><p>Three-run homer to start the game.</p><p>Celia lunged to her feet and screamed at the top of her lungs. \u201cDid you see?\u201d she yelled at Evan. \u201cDid you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw, I saw!\u201d</p><p>He laughed as she continued to bounce up and down. Noah rounded the bases, taking high fives from the first- and third-base coaches. He met his teammates at the plate, where the group jumped up and down and pounded on Noah.</p><p>Noah looked up at Celia and pointed. She leaped to her feet again and pointed back, her smile so wide Evan was sure she\u2019d hurt something.</p> <p>Then she glanced over in the direction that Noah had first looked when he\u2019d come up to the plate and then back down at Evan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, okay? I\u2019ll just be a second.\u201d</p><p>She hurried up the row of seats and then cut over to the section that adjoined the home-plate area. Evan watched as she hugged two younger looking men and an older guy. They glanced over in Evan\u2019s direction once but then didn\u2019t look back as they chatted with Celia.</p><p>A few minutes later, she returned and took her seat beside Evan again. He was beginning to think he\u2019d been dropped in an alternate reality. Was there anyone here she didn\u2019t know?</p><p>When she\u2019d offered Noah to him on a virtual silver platter, he\u2019d only assumed that she\u2019d contacted him through his agent and offered him a deal he couldn\u2019t refuse. He hadn\u2019t considered that she had such a connection to his team. And what connection that was had Evan insanely curious.</p><p>He leaned over so she\u2019d hear over the still insanely celebrating crowd. \u201cWhat am I missing here?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Just enjoy the game.\u201d</p><p>Mysterious little wench. He\u2019d make her pay later when he had her alone.</p> <p>The rest of the game followed a similar pattern. Celia seemed to know every damn person on the team.</p><p>He began to have uncomfortable thoughts, like whether or not Celia was involved with Noah Hart. It would certainly explain how she\u2019d been able to get him to agree to the endorsement deal.</p><p>But it also brought up a lot of questions. Like whether she was using Evan to further her career. He glanced sideways at her. No way. It would take someone pretty diabolical to have a man like Noah Hart on the line and then sleep with Evan to secure his business. Why would she even need it if she was involved with Hart? The man made a lot of money, even without the million-dollar endorsement deals. He was one of the highest-paid baseball players in the league.</p><p>Before he could get carried away with thoughts that would only enrage him, he made himself back down and quit speculating. He\u2019d find out before the end of the day. One way or another. And then he\u2019d decide what to do about Celia. And his account.</p><p>When the game ended after the visiting team failed to score the necessary runs to overtake the Tide in the ninth inning, Celia stood, her cheeks flush with excitement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have an awesome season. I just know it!\u201d</p><p>He stood beside her unsure of what would happen now. Nothing had gone the way he\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Sure enough, she grabbed his hand and began pulling him toward the exit. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t leave the stadium. Instead they went down to a restricted area, where Celia flashed a pass he hadn\u2019t seen up to this point. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised. But when they stopped outside the players\u2019 locker room, he was.</p><p>They waited a good while. Several members of the press came and went. Finally one of the players stuck his head out the door, looked up and down and then his eyes brightened when he saw Celia. Evan was a little starstruck. It was the Tide\u2019s catcher, Chris Davies. He was a veritable legend in baseball, and it was rumored this would be his last year before he retired.</p><p>\u201cCece! You should have just come on in. Noah got held up by an interview, but he wanted you to come on back.\u201d</p><p>Celia walked over and gave the catcher a big hug and a kiss on the cheek. \u201cGood game, Chris. You\u2019re looking as awesome as ever.\u201d</p><p>The big man actually blushed. He glanced up at Evan, and Evan was convinced the guy scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Chris, this is Evan Reese. Evan, this is Chris Davies, the Tide\u2019s star catcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m well aware,\u201d Evan said. \u201cGreat game. I\u2019ve watched you a lot of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Evan Reese who makes the sportswear?\u201d Chris asked.</p><p>Evan nodded.</p><p>\u201cCool. You two come on back. Noah should be done by now.\u201d</p><p>Despite his wealth and position, Evan couldn\u2019t control the incredible rush of walking into the Tide\u2019s</p><p>locker room. It was every little boy\u2019s dream. It was why he\u2019d gone into the business he had. He loved sports, and he was as in awe of the big dream as any other kid out there who loved sports.</p><p>Several players stopped Celia for a quick hug and a kiss. Some ruffled her hair and she gave them affectionate pats in return.</p><p>\u201cCece! There you are.\u201d</p><p>Evan looked up to see Noah barreling his way through a crowd of people. The next thing he knew, he had Celia in a giant bear hug, swinging her around in a circle.</p><p>Evan watched, his irritation growing more with each passing second.</p><p>Finally Noah put her down.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you see? Fantastic hit, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Celia smiled broadly at the other man and her affection for him was obvious. A fact that made Evan even grumpier. Endorsement or not, he was ready to deck the star right in the jaw.</p><p>\u201cI saw, of course. You were awesome as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I need to get a quick shower. You two can wait for me over there,\u201d he said, gesturing toward a sitting area that was removed from the chaos of the open locker room. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Celia kissed his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>Noah ruffled her hair affectionately and loped off toward the showers.</p><p>Evan opened his mouth to ask but then shook his head. He\u2019d wait. This had to be worth the price of admission.</p><p>Celia led him into the adjoining room and sat on one of the leather couches.</p><p>\u201cThis is usually reserved for coaches and their families,\u201d she said when he sat down in one of the chairs across from her. \u201cNone of the press or players will come in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I have a hundred questions,Cece ,\u201d he said drily.</p><p>She flushed a little guiltily. \u201cOkay, so maybe I\u2019m guilty of wanting to watch you experience everything firsthand. I mean I could have warned you but that wouldn\u2019t have been any fun.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cThe only question I want answered right now is whether you\u2019re involved with Noah Hart.\u201d</p><p>He watched her eyes go wide in shock. Her mouth fell open, and he knew in that moment, whatever he might have assumed\u2014even with good reason\u2014he was dead wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt was a sensible assumption,\u201d he defended before she could speak.</p><p>\u201cEvan, Noah is my\u2014\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted when the three men Celia had gone to visit in the stands came through the door.</p><p>\u201cCece, love,\u201d the older man said when his gaze lighted on her. He smiled big and held out his arms. Celia went into his embrace and endured a painful-looking bear hug.</p><p>The other two men regarded Evan with what could only be considered as suspicion.</p><p>\u201cGoing to introduce us, Cece?\u201d the bigger man asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said as she curled her arm around the older man\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cEvan, I want you to meet my family. This is my father, Carl, and these two are my brothers, Adam and Dalton. Guys, this is Evan Reese. He owns Reese Enterprises. I brought him back to talk to Noah.\u201d</p><p>Evan could swear she said the last pointedly. He relaxed and shook the hands of each man and endured a painful grip from each. Typical measuring stick of a man. See if you could make the other wince. He squeezed back with as much force and endured grudging looks of respect from her family.</p><p>Interesting that they were all back in the players area and that they\u2019d sat in different areas for the game, although Celia had said she\u2019d gotten the tickets particularly for him.</p><p>\u201cVery glad to meet you, sir,\u201d he directed at Celia\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cAre you the man responsible for my Cece working so many long hours?\u201d</p><p>Evan lifted one eyebrow then glanced between Celia and her father. Celia closed her eyes in despair and shook her head helplessly at Evan. He remembered her saying that according to her father and brothers, her only requirement was to look pretty and let them support her. Apparently they weren\u2019t on board with her having a career.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir. I wish I could say it was something I regret, but Celia is one of the brightest minds I\u2019ve encountered. She\u2019s going to single handedly turn my advertising efforts around. I think in a year or two, Reese Enterprises won\u2019t simply be one of the leaders in athletic apparel, but theundisputed leader when it comes to sportswear.</p><p>Her two brothers eyed Celia with renewed interested while Celia stared at Evan, her eyes wide with shock. He could almost swear she looked a little teary. He smiled at her and reached for her hand. To his surprise she accepted without complaint and curled her fingers tight around his.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re meeting Noah about business, we\u2019ll just scoot on out,\u201d her father said. \u201cYou going to make Sunday dinner this time or will you be busy again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll make it,\u201d she said as she leaned up on tiptoe to kiss his cheek. \u201cSorry about last weekend.</p><p>Something came up.\u201d</p><p>Evan realized that he was what came up when he\u2019d finessed Celia away for the weekend. While he was sorry she\u2019d missed what was evidently an important family gathering, he couldn\u2019t summon any regret for the way their weekend in Catalina had come together.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you all,\u201d Evan said sincerely.</p><p>The other men nodded and shook his hand again before departing the room.</p><p>\u201cInteresting family,\u201d he said when they\u2019d gone.</p><p>Celia sighed. \u201cI love them dearly, but they\u2019re pretty insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious they love you a lot.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYeah, and I love them to pieces, too. Warts and all.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Noah Hart ambled into the room and once again gave Celia a bone-crushing hug. Then he turned to Evan and looked back at Celia.</p><p>\u201cSo, is this the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re the man if you agree to front my new line of athletic wear,\u201d Evan said, taking charge of the meeting.</p><p>\u201cEvan, I\u2019d like to you to meet my brother. Noah Hart,\u201d Celia said as she stepped forward. \u201cNoah, this is Evan Reese, owner of Reese Enterprises.\u201d</p><p>Evan eyed them skeptically. Her brother? Everything made a hell of lot more sense with that revelation.</p><p>And what was with the different last name? To his knowledge, Celia hadn\u2019t married, or was this one more thing she\u2019d kept him in the dark over?</p><p>His question must have been obvious even to Noah, because he grinned and slung an arm over Celia\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCece had a different father\u2014well, different mother, too. Kind of a long story but my father married Celia\u2019s mother when Cece was just a baby. We helped raise her, especially when her mom died when Cece was so young. Hence the reason her last name is Taylor.\u201d</p><p>Evan cleared his throat. Here he\u2019d been granted a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and he was more concerned with finding out Celia\u2019s secrets than securing a deal with Noah Hart.</p><p>\u201cI thought it might be best if you and Evan went to dinner and talked about the deal Evan is offering,\u201d</p><p>Celia inserted.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Evan asked sharply. He hadn\u2019t counted on Celia leaving him and Noah. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d be meeting Noah so soon. Suddenly his plans for a night of making love to Celia didn\u2019t seem so realistic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have other plans,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cBesides, I really have nothing to do with this part. You and Noah need to discuss the possibilities. I\u2019d just be in the way.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged then looked at Evan. \u201cYou like barbeque?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I know this great place just a few blocks from here. We can grab dinner and talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI drove him here, Noah, so you\u2019ll need to give him a ride back to his place. That okay?\u201d Celia asked.</p><p>She turned to Evan. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning. Nine o\u2019clock at the Maddox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have my driver meet me,\u201d Evan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d He glared at Celia as he said it. The woman was ditching him. What he\u2019d thought was finally an effort to see him outside of a business setting had, in fact, just been a business meeting in disguise. He\u2019d deal with her later, though. Right now he had a sports superstar to woo, and he\u2019d be damned if he let his irritation with Celia interfere.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Celia paced the Maddox conference room. Her nerves were wound tight, and she\u2019d meticulously gone over every little detail of her presentation. The televisions out front had mock-ups created by the media folks. An endless stream of Reese Enterprise promotion ran on the video monitors and the art department had framed several print-ad options and displayed them in the conference room.</p> <p>With fifteen minutes to go time, the other members of her team had assembled. Tension was high but so was excitement. Ash had congratulated her on landing the biggest client for Maddox thus far, but he\u2019d acted distracted and distant. Celia wondered if he was indeed having issues with the rumored girlfriend.</p><p>The others had all been quick to add their congratulations. No contract had been signed, but they all seemed convinced that after this morning, Reese Enterprises would be in the bag. She hoped they were right.</p><p>Noah had called last night after an extended dinner with Evan. Apparently after barbeque the two had gone for beers and spent the evening like old college buddies.</p><p>Evan had extended an extremely cushy offer, one that had surprised even a very jaded Noah. The two were meeting later with their respective lawyers to iron out the details, but Noah said he\u2019d agreed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ve got five minutes,\u201d Celia said. \u201cLet\u2019s take our places and get ready to knock his socks off.\u201d</p><p>They took their seats along the conference table. Brock smiled at Celia and gave her a thumbs-up before taking a seat next to Elle. Jason took the seat next to Ash, who frowned and reached into his pocket for his phone.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me for a minute,\u201d he said as he rose from his seat. He crossed the room out of earshot to take a phone call.</p><p>The intercom buzzed and Shelby announced that Evan had arrived. \u201cShall I show him back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Celia took a deep breath, looked at her coworkers lining the conference table all ready to do their part, and said, \u201cShow him back, Shelby.\u201d</p><p>As Celia ended the conversation, Ash returned to the table.</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I have to go,\u201d he announced. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll be back. Hopefully no more than a</p><p>few days. I\u2019ll let you know when I have more details.\u201d</p><p>He turned and strode out of the room, leaving Celia and the others to stare after him in astonishment.</p><p>Celia glanced over at Brock and raised an eyebrow. Brock shrugged and gestured for her to continue on. Whatever was up with Ash would have to wait. This meeting was too important to all of them.</p> <p>Seconds after Ash\u2019s abrupt departure, Evan entered behind Shelby. Celia crossed the room and extended a hand to Evan. Instead of shaking it as she\u2019d intended, he slid his fingers over her palm and held it far too long for her liking. She snatched it away and turned to introduce him down the row.</p><p>Her presentation went off without a hitch. Each part of her team executed their part flawlessly, and through it all, Brock sat back with a very satisfied expression on his face.</p><p>By the time she was done, she was as convinced as everyone else that Evan would sign with Maddox.</p><p>He\u2019d be a fool not to.</p><p>The lights went back up after her last video clip.</p><p>\u201cThis concludes our presentation,\u201d she said to Evan. \u201cI hope we\u2019ve convinced you of our commitment to you and your company.\u201d</p><p>He took his time responding. For a moment he studied her, his hands in a V in front of him. Then he simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very impressed. My question is, how soon can we move on this?\u201d</p><p>Rosa was packed with the after-work crowd, but the entire back room was filled with Maddox employees, all celebrating their biggest coup to date\u2014Reese Enterprises.</p><p>Celia was high on her achievement, but she couldn\u2019t shake the anxiety over her relationship with Evan.</p><p>She\u2019d avoided him last night when she\u2019d all but dumped him on Noah. She\u2019d avoided him after her presentation when he\u2019d wanted to take her to lunch to celebrate.</p><p>Brock passed out champagne to every one then called for a toast. He saluted Celia with his glass and the room erupted into cheers.</p><p>She smiled her pleasure, but all she could think was that she\u2019d rather be with Evan. And that was a very big problem.</p><p>\u201cFor a girl who\u2019s the toast of Madcom, you don\u2019t look very happy.\u201d</p><p>Celia turned to see Elle standing beside her, drink in hand. She tried to smile but then gave up with a sigh. \u201cAm I that obvious?\u201d</p><p>Elle shrugged. \u201cProbably not. I doubt others are paying too much attention to you. You looked...distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a mess, Elle,\u201d Celia admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Elle wrapped a comforting arm around her. \u201cSurely it can\u2019t be that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m involved with Evan Reese. Intimately.\u201d</p><p>Elle stiffened. \u201cOh. Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Celia couldn\u2019t help but notice the way Elle\u2019s gaze drifted to Brock, who stood across the room talking with Jason Reagart. Brock turned and caught Elle\u2019s gaze, and what Celia saw there made her pause.</p><p>Possession.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend for it to happen,\u201d Celia said. \u201cI know better. Me of all people should know better. I\u2019ve kept it secret, and it\u2019s driving me insane. I worry over who\u2019ll see us together and whether they\u2019ll draw the wrong conclusion. I\u2019m so tired of sneaking around. The worst part is I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Elle made a sound of sympathy and pulled Celia away from the others until they stood in a dark corner.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be honest and open about this, Celia. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019ll tear you apart,\u201d Elle said earnestly.</p><p>Elle was so sincere and her words were so heartfelt that Celia wondered if she was speaking from personal experience. Was it possible that Elle was having a secret fling with Brock? If the looks between the two were any clue, there was some serious chemistry there.</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to ask, but she didn\u2019t want to hurt Elle, especially if she didn\u2019t want anyone to know.</p><p>Instead she squeezed Elle\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, Elle. I know you\u2019re right. I just have to figure out how to handle this. It\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst thing you should do is enjoy your moment in the sun,\u201d Elle returned. \u201cThis is your night to shine.</p><p>You worked hard for this, Celia. Go have some fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, Mom,\u201d Celia teased. \u201cI\u2019m up for another drink if you are.\u201d</p><p>Elle smiled and the two women headed for the bar for another round. Celia endured another series of toasts, backslaps and loudly yelled congratulations. Elle was right. This was her night. It was the culmination of weeks of hard work and long hours. Damn if she wouldn\u2019t enjoy every minute of it.</p><p>Celia\u2019s cab pulled up to her apartment, and she pulled out several bills to pay the driver. While she was far from toasted, she hadn\u2019t wanted to chance driving home, so she\u2019d left her Beamer at work and taken a cab from Rosa.</p><p>It was late, but not ungodly so, and she was still riding high from the celebration.</p><p>The cab pulled away and across the street she saw Evan leaning against his car, watching her. He started forward, and she stood there like a statue, watching him approach.</p><p>\u201cOut celebrating?\u201d Evan asked with a slight smile.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAfter-work thing. Took a cab back so I didn\u2019t have to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have called me. I would have had my driver take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that would have looked good if the man whose account I just landed sent a car to take me home after my celebration party.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her with no expression. Then he asked, \u201cGoing to invite me in?\u201d</p><p>As if she\u2019d tell him no.</p><p>He fell into step beside her as they walked to her door. He waited while she unlocked the door and then followed her inside. As soon she as she locked up behind them, he had her in his arms.</p><p>Not again. She couldn\u2019t lose all control of her senses the moment he touched her. It wasn\u2019t normal.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how turned on I was watching you take control of that presentation this morning?\u201d he said between kisses. \u201cYou were glowing and you were such a hardass. I wanted so bad to drag you into a closet and have wild, crazy sex.\u201d</p><p>He always knew exactly what to say to melt any resistance on her part. He was a seducer with words.</p><p>He had her clothes off before they got to her bedroom. How he knew where it was, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Maybe all men had a natural instinct for where to find the nearest bed.</p><p>They went hard and fast. No matter what their intentions, that first time was always desperate, like it was their last. She gripped him, he cradled her, she kissed him, he thrust into her.</p><p>It was crazy, irrational, it was the most erotic, bone-melting sex of her life.</p><p>And she loved him beyond all reason and sanity.</p><p>She lay under him, holding him close as he panted against her neck. She was positively weak, and thank God they were on the bed, because she wasn\u2019t moving. It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>Finally Evan rolled away and threw his arm across the bed with a groan.</p><p>\u201cEvery time, I swear, I\u2019m going to take it slow, make love to you with all the finesse I\u2019m capable of.</p><p>Then I see you and the teenage hormones start revving out of control, and I become some seventeen-year-old on steroids.\u201d</p><p>Celia died laughing and then moaned when she moved too much. \u201cI would have liked a seventeen-year-old on steroids with your sexual know-how when I was seventeen. All the boys I knew thought a kiss and quick grope was all the foreplay necessary before penetration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say what morons they are if I hadn\u2019t just practically done the same thing to you,\u201d he said in a pained voice.</p><p>She rolled into the crook of his arm and laid her head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hear me complaining, do you? I haven\u2019t thrown you out for being an inconsiderate toad.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cAnd for that I\u2019m extremely grateful.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled into his arms. \u201cAre you going back to Seattle for the weekend?\u201d</p><p>He went still and then tightened his arm around her. His hand lay possessively on her hip.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t go public with our relationship now, Celia. It\u2019s all over. You have the account.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath.</p><p>\u201cBut, yes, I do need to go back to Seattle and tie up some things. I plan to spend a lot more time in San Francisco over the next few months and I need to make arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sped up. Did he mean he was staying in San Francisco to be near her? She hated guessing, but she hated assuming even more.</p><p>She was still uneasy about the timing of them seeing each other. It was too close to when he\u2019d signed on with Maddox.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back Monday afternoon. I want to spend the evening with you. Dinner. Dancing. You can stay over at the hotel and my driver will take you into work on Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>She loved it when he got all demanding. She was a sucker for someone who planned in detail, and he\u2019d certainly planned their evening down to her staying over for what would undeniably be amazing sex.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up on her elbow so she could look him in the face. \u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He rolled her into his arms and under him again. \u201cI can sleep on the short flight home.\u201d</p><p>She made a show of checking her nonexistent watch. \u201cYou have six hours left. What do you plan to do with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to show you just how good I am at time management,\u201d he murmured as he swept down and hungrily devoured her lips.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>After a Sunday of fielding curious questions from her brothers about Evan, Celia was relieved to go into work on Monday. She wasn\u2019t ready to admit to even her family that she and Evan were anything more than business associates. They knew what had happened in New York and that it was complete nonsense. She loved them for their undying loyalty and their absolute faith in her. Which was why she was reluctant to confess to a relationship with Evan. It would only muddy the waters even though she and Evan both knew the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was late, thanks to a traffic snarl that lasted an entire hour and an already late start from her apartment. By the time she made it off the elevator, it was closing in on noon, and her mood was in the toilet.</p><p>When she saw Shelby, she knew something was wrong. The usually cheerful receptionist eyed Celia with something that looked suspiciously like pity, and she refused to hold Celia\u2019s gaze for long.</p><p>Not even wanting to know what that was all about, Celia bypassed her usual meet and greet with Shelby and headed for the sanctuary of her office. To her surprise, Elle was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Elle,\u201d Celia said as she came in and tossed her briefcase onto her desk.</p> <p>Elle\u2019s face was drawn, and she looked like she was dreading talking to Celia. In her hands was a folded newspaper or magazine. Celia couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cCelia, there\u2019s something you need to see. Everyone else has already read it. I tried to call you but couldn\u2019t reach you at home or on your cell.\u201d</p><p>Celia\u2019s stomach sank. She didn\u2019t like the look on Elle\u2019s face or the way she was coming at her with that paper.</p><p>Elle plopped the newspaper on Celia\u2019s desk and it was then that Celia saw it was a gossip rag. Her nose wrinkled in disgust.</p><p>\u201cElle, what are you doing reading that crap?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook at it, Celia.\u201d</p><p>Elle jabbed her finger at the photo spread and the headline. Celia looked down and all the blood drained from her face. She had to grip the edge of the desk to keep her knees from giving way.</p><p>There were pictures of her and Evan at Mitchell\u2019s wedding. The same pictures she\u2019d received via e-mail from Evan\u2019s mother. One was of them dancing and her laughing up at him. The other was of Evan kissing her. Her hand was splayed over his chest and there was no mistaking the huge rock on her third finger.</p><p>The headline blurred in front of her, but she got the gist. It was all about Evan and his new fianc\u00e9e and was it coincidence that Evan had allegedly signed a contract with Maddox Communications, the agency where his fianc\u00e9e worked.</p><p>She scanned the article, but she was too furious to continue past the insinuation that Celia had spent the last several weeks doing whatever was necessary to land Evan\u2019s business.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d Elle said grimly.</p> <p>She walked around Celia\u2019s desk and jostled the mouse so that her screen came up. She typed in a URL</p><p>and navigated to an advertising community site that hosted a blog and a message board, mostly used by advertising professionals. There in the latest blog post was the picture of Evan kissing her along with the announcement of Evan going with Maddox Communications. The subtitle was short and to the point, and made no bones about the way they thought Celia landed the account.</p><p>Celia sank into her chair, stunned. Absolutely and completely stunned by what she\u2019d read.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Elle, what do I do?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Elle squeezed her shoulder in sympathy, but her eyes told Celia she was at as big a loss as Celia was as to how to handle it.</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone in the office know?\u201d Celia asked painfully. \u201cHave they all seen it? And what do they think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ash hasn\u2019t been back in, so I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s seen it. I know Brock and Jason saw it because I was in Brock\u2019s office with both of them. Jason didn\u2019t have much to say but Brock was pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt me?\u201d</p> <p>Elle shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, to be honest. I doubt it. He\u2019s not the type to get angry before he hears your side. Besides, you got the account. It shouldn\u2019t matter to him how you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, I guess. It only matters tome .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Celia. Really sorry.\u201d</p><p>Celia put her hands over her face. \u201cI was stupid, Elle. I was stupid, and now I have to pay the price.\u201d</p><p>The sound of someone clearing their throat had Celia looking up toward the door. Brock stood there, an indecipherable expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cElle,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you leave me and Celia for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Elle murmured as she hurried away.</p><p>Tears burned Celia\u2019s eyes. She was holding on by a sheer thread.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk?\u201d Brock asked.</p><p>It was that question that did it for Celia. If he\u2019d been angry or if he\u2019d been indifferent, she could have handled it, but the simply worded request broke her down.</p><p>Her shoulders shook, and she lowered her head as a sob welled from her throat. It appalled her that she\u2019d cry in front of her boss. But there was no holding back the release of the crushing pressure that had been building over the course of the last few weeks.</p><p>Brock didn\u2019t say or do anything. He just stood there while she gathered herself together again. When she looked up, he sat in one of the chairs in front of her desk and waited for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not how it looks,\u201d she said as she wiped tears from her cheeks.</p><p>He glanced at the spread out paper on her desk. \u201cWell, it looks like you were wearing his ring, but you\u2019re not now.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she explained the whole sorry tale about her trip to Catalina with Evan and how she hadn\u2019t</p><p>felt like she could refuse when he was short on time and ready to move on his campaign.</p><p>She left out the mushy details she\u2019d shared with Elle. Brock was, after all, A. her boss and B. a man. He didn\u2019t need to know that she\u2019d stupidly fallen in love with a man she\u2019d be working with for a long time to come. It made things entirely too messy. What if they broke up? Would Evan feel weird about continuing the relationship with Maddox or would he take his business elsewhere?</p><p>There were a million reasons why she should have never ever gotten involved with Evan, and yet, she hadn\u2019t heeded any of the warning signs.</p><p>\u201cI overheard what Elle said about how it shouldn\u2019t matter to me how you got the account. I won\u2019t lie. It doesn\u2019t. Furthermore, it\u2019s none of my business unless you broke the law or did something to damage the reputation of Maddox. I don\u2019t think this qualifies. My concern is for you. I know how devastated you were by what happened in New York.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said when I told you that you had my support. That hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019ll make sure to put an end to any speculation going on in the office, but I can\u2019t control what people think or say outside the work area. I don\u2019t imagine this is going to be easy for you to deal with in the next little while, but Maddox Communications stands behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Brock,\u201d she said in a shaky voice. \u201cThat means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea who would have done this?\u201d Brock asked.</p><p>She frowned and stared down at the pictures. Then she looked back up at Brock.</p><p>\u201cThese pictures were on my company computer. Evan\u2019s mom sent them here. They\u2019ve only been here. I don\u2019t imagine Evan\u2019s ex has any love for me, but she and Mitchell left immediately on their honeymoon.</p><p>They haven\u2019t even seen the photos yet. So other than me, and maybe Evan if his mom showed them to him, the only other person who\u2019s seen them is his mom. These weren\u2019t taken by the professional photographer. Evan\u2019s mom shot these with her digital camera, and I don\u2019t believe for a minute she\u2019d go to these lengths to discredit me. She was too damn excited over our supposed engagement.\u201d</p><p>Brock swore long and hard. \u201cAre you sure this is the only place you had them?\u201d</p><p>Celia stared back at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t think...surely not. No one here would do something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>He rose and stalked to the door. Then he paused and turned back for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t let this get you down, Celia. I have a feeling that whoever did this intended just that. You did a damn good job on this account. No one can take that away from you unless you let them.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone, leaving Celia sitting there like a deflated balloon.</p><p>She was supposed to meet Evan in just a few hours. Their evening was already planned, complete with the sleepover at his hotel and his driver taking her to work in the morning. She\u2019d already had reservations about it all, but now the idea made the knot in her stomach grow even larger.</p><p>Who the hell had released those pictures? It made her furious. Why would anyone even care or go to such lengths to discredit her?</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t put it past Athos Koteas. He\u2019d made it a point to tar Maddox Communications any way possible, but how would he have gotten his hands on those pictures?</p><p>The idea that one of her coworkers was responsible made her want to puke. She couldn\u2019t believe it and work here another minute. She had to push that possibility out of her mind or go insane.</p><p>How sick was it that she didn\u2019t even want to venture out of her office now? She couldn\u2019t face everyone knowing that they\u2019d seen that damn article.</p><p>She laid her head on her desk and tried to ignore the painful ache that had developed around her temples.</p><p>She knew what she had to do, and it hurt far more than those damn pictures. But she hadn\u2019t worked this hard to rebuild her reputation and her career to have it go down the toilet over one torrid affair.</p><p>The rest of the day was spent sequestered in her office. She only spoke to Shelby to tell her she wasn\u2019t accepting any calls and the rest of the time she spent in brooding silence.</p><p>At five, she stared out the window, watching as her coworkers left the building. She purposely waited until everyone else had left before she locked up her office for the night.</p><p>Though it was well past seven, she dragged herself down six flights of stairs just on the off chance any stragglers were in the elevator. She was pathetic and spineless but she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d face them all when she had some semblance of control over her emotions.</p><p>She drove to her apartment with her fingers curled tightly around the wheel. She battled bouts of fury and the impulse to break down into tears. By the time she reached home, she was mentally exhausted.</p><p>To make matters worse, Evan was waiting for her by the door. He wore a deep frown, and his brow was creased with concern.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d he demanded. \u201cI was worried. We were supposed to meet here an hour and a half ago.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even meet his gaze as she jammed her key into the lock. She shoved the door open, and went inside, allowing the dark to swallow her up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Celia, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He flipped on the light, and she winced. He was in front of her immediately. He grasped her arm and tilted her chin up with his other hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Have you been crying?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to pull away, but he held tight.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t see each other for a while,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cOkay? We need to cool it. Things are crazy.</p><p>My life is crazy.\u201d</p><p>Her words did what she hadn\u2019t been able to do. He let go of her arm and took a step back.</p><p>\u201cWant to run that by me again? In a way that I understand?\u201d</p><p>There was a wary look in his eye that warned her this wouldn\u2019t be easy. But then he didn\u2019t give a damn about what people thought. He wasn\u2019t ruled by the opinions of others. As she had so many times before, she wished she could be like him.</p><p>Instead of answering him, she rummaged in her bag for the stupid gossip rag and then she thrust it at him as if it was self-explanatory. And it was in a way.</p><p>He glanced over the paper and then looked back up at her. \u201cSo? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>She knew he\u2019d react that way. Positively knew it, and it drove her crazy. She wanted to scream and rail at him, but she\u2019d come across as some hysterical banshee, and then he\u2019d never take her concerns seriously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d she said stiffly. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the Internet. An advertising community site has it on their blog along with some snotty little line about how I got the account after the announcement of you signing with Maddox.\u201d</p><p>He looked blankly at her. \u201cI fail to see what the big deal is, and I damn sure don\u2019t see why it\u2019s any cause for us not to see each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cYou fail to see. Well, I don\u2019t, Evan. This is my career we\u2019re talking about. My reputation. Which I might add is in shreds now. Everyone in my office saw that. Everyone in the advertising community saw it. Everyone knows, or thinks they know, just how I got you to sign with Maddox. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s true. It\u2019s what everyone thinks. Our announcement of our agreement will be posted inAdvertising Media . Right on the heels of those pictures. Do you know how that looks?\u201d</p><p>She stopped and swallowed back the damning sob that welled up in her throat.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to go out on my next client call? What if the client is male and what if he expects the same favors I granted you? Or maybe he\u2019ll agree to sign with Maddox if I sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick his ass,\u201d Evan growled.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be there to kick everyone\u2019s ass, Evan. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you. The best thing you can do for me is to back off until the smoke clears.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He blinked and then his eyes went cold and hard. \u201cIs that what you want, Celia? What you really want?\u201d</p><p>She was afraid to answer, afraid to confirm after that terrible look that had come over him. But she wouldn\u2019t lie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His lip curled in derision. \u201cI won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s dirty little secret, Celia. I\u2019m tired of running around like two people having an affair behind their spouses\u2019 backs. I made the mistake of settling once. I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvan, please, it\u2019s not like that. I just need some time,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cIt is like that, Celia. It\u2019s very much like that. It\u2019s apparent to me that I\u2019m definitely not first on your list of priorities. Or even second or third. There\u2019s a hell of a lot of things that rank higher than me. I don\u2019t give a damn who knows that we\u2019re sleeping together. And I damn sure won\u2019t continue to sleep with someone who does.\u201d</p><p>He turned and stalked toward the door. He flung it open and caught it with one hand, turning as he stepped out.</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind, don\u2019t bother to come crawling back. I think you\u2019ve made it abundantly clear what I\u2019m good for.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed, and Celia\u2019s heart shattered into tiny little pieces. She stared numbly, hoping, expecting that he\u2019d come back and tell her they could work things out, that he\u2019d wait.</p> <p>Minutes passed, and the sickening realization hit her that he wasn\u2019t coming back. Not only had she lost her reputation, and possibly her career, but she\u2019d lost the one man she loved enough to have risked it all in the first place.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Tuesday morning, Celia took the coward\u2019s way out and called Brock to schedule vacation time for the rest of the week. He didn\u2019t like that she was hiding. It was no way to face the issue, but after hearing how horrible she sounded, he didn\u2019t argue the matter further.</p><p>The rest of the day she spent moping around her apartment, alternating between anger and fits of upset.</p><p>Wednesday, she packed a bag and headed for the one place she knew she could lick her wounds in safety. Her dad\u2019s house.</p><p>He took one look at her and held out his arms for a giant bear hug. She needed it. Never had the comfort of home felt so good to her than now.</p> <p>He sat her down and cooked her a huge breakfast, because in his book, there wasn\u2019t anything that couldn\u2019t be cured by a big, home-cooked breakfast.</p><p>All the time she ate, he sat beside her, eating his own food in silence. He didn\u2019t pry or demand answers.</p><p>It was what she loved most about him. He never intruded into his children\u2019s lives. No, he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>He just waited for them to come to him, and then he\u2019d move heaven and earth to make everything right again.</p><p>Only this time he couldn\u2019t fix it.</p><p>She spent the afternoon on the couch, watching television with him. He babied her endlessly, fixing her a snack in the afternoon and even baking her favorite cookies. Chocolate chip with no nuts.</p><p>By the time evening rolled around, it was obvious her father had spent the afternoon on the phone with her brothers. They arrived, one at a time, and made it a point to shower her with lots of hugs and endless pampering. Or at least Adam and Dalton did.</p><p>When Noah showed up, he took one look at her and demanded to know what the hell had happened.</p> <p>She burst into tears which prompted Adam, Dalton and her dad to threaten to dismember him for upsetting her.</p><p>\u201cWell hell, Dad, I didn\u2019t upset her. It\u2019s obvious that someone did, but it sure as hell wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Noah protested. \u201cHasn\u2019t anyone asked her what\u2019s wrong yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were waiting,\u201d her father said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for what?\u201d Noah asked in exasperation. \u201cFor her to cry?\u201d</p><p>Celia wiped at her eyes and tried to stop the sniffling. She knew her brothers hated it when she cried.</p><p>Especially Noah.</p><p>Noah turned to her, his eyes softening at the signs of her distress. Then he sat down on the couch next to her.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Evan Reese, does it?\u201d</p><p>Despite her vow to cease and desist, his question spurred another round of tears.</p><p>\u201cGood going, bonehead,\u201d Adam growled.</p><p>\u201cAnyone ever tell you that your skill with the opposite sex sucks?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>Noah put an arm around her and squeezed comfortingly. \u201cWhat happened, Cece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, Noah, it was awful. The paper printed these horrible pictures and this blog said horrible things. My career is shot to hell. My reputation is in shambles and Evan doesn\u2019t want to see me anymore because I asked him to back off until the smoke cleared. He thinks I think he\u2019s my dirty little secret, and he hates it. And me.\u201d</p><p>She dug her palms into her eyes and rubbed until it felt like she was scraping her eyelids across sandpaper every time she blinked.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Adam said. \u201cDid any of that make sense to the rest of you?\u201d</p><p>Dalton and her father exchanged helpless looks.</p><p>Noah sighed. \u201cMaybe you should back up and start with what the newspaper printed and what the blog said and why your career and reputation have been dragged through the mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got all night,\u201d Dalton offered.</p><p>She sighed and once again poured out the whole story from start to finish, not leaving a single detail out.</p><p>Except for the sex. Her brothers had a hard time seeing their baby sister as anything other than their baby sister, and telling them about her sex life would only make them turn a sick shade of green. And then they\u2019d probably go after Evan with one of Noah\u2019s baseball bats.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Adam huffed.</p><p>Dalton nodded his agreement. Noah, who was a lot more tuned in to just what bad press could do to a career and reputation, was a lot more subdued. Concern flared in his eyes when she got to the explanation of the article and blog.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Celia nodded. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where does this Evan person fit in?\u201d her dad asked. \u201cI mean, there seems to be a big piece missing here. You were pretending to be his fianc\u00e9e and this paper prints stuff about you, and you said he\u2019s angry because he thinks you think he\u2019s your dirty little secret. Am I missing something?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m in love with him, Dad. And now he hates me.\u201d</p><p>All four men\u2019s mouths rounded into Os.</p><p>There was marked silence, and she regretted having blurted out that fact. Love was girly stuff, and none of the men looked like they had a clue what to say or do next.</p><p>\u201cLook, I appreciate you guys. I love you all to pieces. I don\u2019t know what I would do without you. I don\u2019t expect you to fix this for me. I\u2019m thirty years old. Not a little girl anymore. The days of me coming to you with my scrapes and boo-boos should be well behind me. I\u2019ll figure out something. I just needed a place to lick my wounds and regroup.\u201d</p><p>Adam frowned. \u201cNow, you wait just one damn minute. You\u2019re family, Cece. I don\u2019t care how old you are.\u201d</p><p>Even Dalton scowled and nodded his agreement. Noah merely squeezed her hand and told her bluntly to shut up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my little girl and their little sister,\u201d her dad said in his soft, gravelly voice. \u201cThat don\u2019t change because you go away to college, get a fancy degree and get a job that beats you down every chance it gets.\u201d</p><p>She winced at the direction this was heading.</p><p>\u201cWe love you and we\u2019ll always be here for you to come running to. You got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow come here and give your old man a hug. Sounds like you\u2019ve had one hell of a week.\u201d</p><p>She scrambled up from the couch and threw herself into his beefy embrace. She squeezed for all she was worth and inhaled his scent.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Dad,\u201d she muffled out against his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Cece. Don\u2019t you forget it, either. Now back up and tell me more about this Evan fellow and if I need to round up your brothers to go beat him up.\u201d</p><p>Evan\u2019s office staff was avoiding him. Not that he could blame them. He\u2019d arrived back on Tuesday, acting like a bear with a sore paw. He\u2019d briefly touched base with his assistant, long enough to tell her not to hurry back in to work and to remain with her granddaughter as long as she was needed.</p><p>He\u2019d gone over his last conversation with Celia until it rolled like video footage through his head. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t get it to turn off.</p><p>It was his own fault for pursuing Celia so relentlessly. She\u2019d been hesitant from the start, and he\u2019d ignored all the warning signs. He\u2019d never become serious about a woman who didn\u2019t put him first. And he damn sure wouldn\u2019t be involved with a woman who put more importance on what the world around her thought about her than on her relationship with him.</p><p>He scowled when a knock sounded at his door. One of the secretaries poked her head in and held up an envelope like a shield.</p><p>\u201cThis just came for you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring it over,\u201d he said, waving her in.</p><p>She hurried over and all but threw the envelope at him before beating a hasty retreat out of his office. He shook his head. He hadn\u2019t been that bad since he\u2019d returned two days ago.</p><p>Okay maybe he had.</p><p>With a sigh, he glanced at the envelope. It was an overnight package with the name of some corporation from San Francisco he\u2019d never heard of before. It was marked extremely urgent.</p><p>He opened it and to his surprise it only held a folded newspaper. Nothing else. No letter, no explanation.</p><p>He pulled it out and it fell open on his desk. It was turned to a specific page, and when he looked down, he saw Celia\u2019s picture, only it wasn\u2019t one he was familiar with. She looked different. Maybe younger?</p><p>And she looked terrified in the picture. She had one hand up like she was trying to avoid the camera.</p><p>Frowning, he scanned the article. He was so pissed by the time he got to the end that he had to go back and read it more carefully.</p><p>The photo was indeed of a younger Celia when she lived and worked in New York. She\u2019d landed a position with a prestigious advertising firm one year out of college. She\u2019d done impressive work and then she\u2019d been promoted to senior executive\u2014above several other junior executives who\u2019d been there longer.</p><p>A relationship with the CEO had been quickly revealed, and Celia had been named in the divorce proceedings between the CEO and his wife. Celia had fled New York in disgrace to return home to San Francisco, where she took a job with the smaller, on-the-rise Maddox Communications.</p><p>Only last week, intimate photographs of Celia Taylor with billionaire Evan Reese had appeared in another article the day after Reese had reportedly signed a multimillion-dollar advertising contract with Maddox.</p><p>Blah, blah, it went on and on, vilifying Celia and along with her, Maddox Communications. His stomach churned, and he felt the urge to go vomit.</p><p>His gaze caught the latest issue ofAdvertising Media . Fresh off the press and delivered just this morning.</p><p>It was just as Celia had said. The announcement was there for the world to see, but it was tainted by those photos.</p><p>He picked up the paper and stared at it again. There was no way. No way in hell she\u2019d done what they accused her of. He hadn\u2019t known Celia for long, but he damn well knew she wouldn\u2019t have done something like this. If she did have a relationship with this bastard, it wasn\u2019t so she\u2019d get a promotion.</p><p>He wanted to go kill someone. Preferably whoever had started this smear campaign. No one messed with the woman he loved and got away with it.</p><p>All the air left his lungs in a painful jolt.</p><p>Loved?</p><p>He liked Celia. Liked her a damn lot. She was beautiful, vibrant, sexy as hell. She was a great lover and partner. He had fun with her. He loved her company. But did he love her?</p><p>The knot in his stomach grew. How could he be so stupid about his own personal life? Surely it would have occurred to him before now if he was in love with someone.</p><p>He stopped and let his thoughts catch up with the breathless, panicky feeling in his chest.</p><p>How had he gone thirty-eight years with never having fallen in love? He\u2019d never even contemplated the idea until now. He wasn\u2019t at all sure he liked it, either.</p><p>Love was such a messy emotion. It was bound to be inconvenient. You sure couldn\u2019t put it on a schedule and love never played by the rules. He liked rules. And schedules.</p><p>Ah, hell, he was absolutely in love with her.</p><p>It was why he was sitting here in such a terrible mood that his usually easygoing office staff wouldn\u2019t come near him for fear of being decapitated.</p><p>He looked again at the article, and his chest utterly caved in. Celia. God, he\u2019d been such an idiot. A complete and utter, madly-in-love moron.</p><p>He\u2019d reacted just like a petulant child, furious that his favorite toy was being taken away. In this case, Celia had wanted to put their relationship on hold and all he could see was that she was pushing him away. He\u2019d panicked. He\u2019d been a total ass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She needed him. Needed his support. And he\u2019d told her to take a hike. Worse, he\u2019d arrogantly told her not to bother changing her mind and come crawling back.</p><p>He winced. Holy hell in a bucket but he\u2019d said some horrible things. If there was any crawling to do, it would be him doing it. In the mud. Over broken glass.</p><p>Her tear-stained face came painfully to mind. The hell she must have endured. Her coworkers had seen the photos. Everyone in her profession had likely seen them. They\u2019d all probably come to some very inaccurate conclusions.</p><p>He\u2019d been selfish and demanding from the start. He hadn\u2019t given one moment\u2019s consideration to how their relationship would reflect on her. It had all been about him. His wants and needs. He didn\u2019t care if anyone knew about them, but she had. And with good reason.</p> <p>He should have been standing with her. He should have supported her. Now it looked as if the world had turned on her, and where was he? Off licking his wounds while she faced the world alone.</p><p>To hell with that.</p><p>He had a woman to win back.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Celia sipped her hot chocolate and stared over her dad\u2019s backyard to the ocean in the distance. She\u2019d always loved the view here. His house was perched on a cliff, though it was situated a good distance from the drop-off.</p> <p>As a child, after reading about mudslides, she\u2019d been convinced that they\u2019d fall into the ocean. Her brothers had told her it was far more likely they\u2019d fall off in an earthquake. She shook her head at the memory of how they liked to torment her.</p><p>It was peaceful here, and not for the first time, she wondered why she\u2019d been so anxious to move away.</p><p>True, her family could be overbearing at times, but they loved her. They were loyal and they\u2019d do anything in the world for her. That wasn\u2019t something to run away from. It was something to hold on to and never let go.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t leave again. She was through discovering the world. Her world was here. Home.</p><p>Where her family lived.</p><p>The sliding-glass doors opened and Noah stepped out. She turned all the way around in her chair to greet him, but stopped when she saw the expression on his face.</p> <p>\u201cI was about to say good morning,\u201d she said as he came over and plopped down beside her.</p><p>He sighed and held out another newspaper. \u201cI thought about not showing you this, but I knew if something was being said about me, I\u2019d want to know about it so I wouldn\u2019t be blindsided.\u201d</p><p>Dread began low in her stomach. She stared fearfully at the extended paper. Then her disgust overcame her apprehension and she plucked it from his hand.</p><p>There in black and white for the entire Bay area to see was a detailed account of all that had happened</p><p>in New York. Oh, it was ablatant smear campaign. It was written in the guise of an article announcing the deal brokered between Reese Enterprises and Maddox Communications.</p><p>It detailed her job history, colorful as it was, to the present and hinted broadly about there being a relationship between her and Evan.</p><p>Nothing was left to the imagination. Everything she\u2019d worked so hard to overcome had been splashed in excruciating detail.</p><p>She should be angry. Furious even. But what she felt was...resignation.</p> <p>She looked up into the worried eyes of her brother as the realization hit her.</p><p>It would always be something. Evan was right to be angry that she\u2019d placed more importance on what others thought of her than she did whathe thought of her.</p><p>As long as the people she loved knew the truth, it shouldn\u2019t matter what some stranger thought. Brock believed in her and her abilities. She had the backing of her agency. Her family loved her unconditionally.</p><p>Evan evidently didn\u2019t care who knew they were involved, so why should she?</p><p>For the first time in a long while, she looked at her life with a sense of deep gratitude. For so long she\u2019d been shaped by external forces. Her desire to shed the protective grasp of her family. Her need to escape from the scandal in New York and prove herself to everyone around her.</p><p>The only person she\u2019d been proving anything to was herself. Everyone else had known all along what kind of person she was.</p><p>\u201cOh, Noah, I\u2019ve been so stupid,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He cocked his head in confusion. She responded by throwing her arms around his neck and hugging him fiercely. Then she drew away and kissed him on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He still looked supremely puzzled. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor opening my eyes. I\u2019ve been so very blind to what was in front of me all along.\u201d</p><p>He grinned crookedly. \u201cWell, okay. Do me a favor and the next time Adam and Dalton start riding my ass, you remind them that I opened your eyes. Whatever that means.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cWhat it means is that I\u2019m through trying to please others. I\u2019m through caring what they think about me. The only people in this world who matter to me already believe the best of me.</p><p>What more do I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let these bastards get you down, Cece. You\u2019re right. We love you to pieces and nothing anyone ever insinuates is going to change that. Furthermore, I know good and damn well that the girl I helped raise isn\u2019t a manipulative, calculating bitch who doesn\u2019t care who she hurts on her way up the corporate ladder.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him again. \u201cThank you, Noah. You have no idea what that means to me.\u201d</p><p>He leaned away, still holding her arms. \u201cSo what about Evan?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together. \u201cHe told me not to bother crawling back if I changed my mind. Well, too bad. I made a mistake. It\u2019s not the end of the world. We all make them. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s made his share.</p><p>He was angry and I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean half of what he said. I\u2019m going to make him listen to me. Then I\u2019m going to take the leap and tell him I love him and hope like hell that doesn\u2019t make him run for cover.\u201d</p><p>Noah touched her cheek in a tender gesture. \u201cIf he does, he\u2019s a fool who doesn\u2019t deserve you.</p><p>Remember that, okay?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at her rumpled appearance. She shuddered to think what her hair looked like. She\u2019s spent the last three days moping.</p><p>\u201cI need to go jump in the shower and then I have some apologizing to do in person.\u201d</p><p>Noah got up, leaned over and kissed her on the forehead. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>He held his hand out to help her up. She hurried inside, determined not to waste another minute without telling Evan she was sorry and that she loved him.</p><p>She took a while in the shower mainly because she was working out just what she wanted to say to Evan. Simple vanity also made her want to look her absolute best. I mean, who went and groveled when they looked like a hag with a hangover?</p><p>She pulled on a robe and twisted a towel around her hair. Then she walked through her bedroom and into the hall on her way to the kitchen. She needed something to eat, and she needed to tell her dad she\u2019d be leaving in the next hour.</p><p>When she rounded the corner into the living room, she looked up and nearly fell over in shock. There, sitting on her father\u2019s couch, was Evan. Noah and her father were nowhere to be found.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d This wasn\u2019t supposed to be the way she confronted him.</p><p>She turned, intending to make a mad dash for her bedroom and shut the door until she could make herself presentable. He caught her before she\u2019d gone three steps.</p><p>He grabbed her arm and pulled her into his arms. \u201cNo, Celia, don\u2019t go. Please.\u201d</p><p>She moaned in frustration. \u201cDammit, Evan. You\u2019ve ruined everything. I was going to look nice when I came to apologize. Now I\u2019m in my bathrobe and my hair is all wet and in a towel. I don\u2019t even have any makeup on.\u201d</p><p>Then it hit her. What was he doing here? At her dad\u2019s? How had he even known where to find her and, moreover, why would he care?</p><p>He chuckled and pulled her even closer. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what you look like. I need to talk to you.</p><p>Personally I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever looked better to me.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Evan? How did you know where to find me?</p><p>I was about to leave to go find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s good we found each other,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He tugged her back into the living room. \u201cCome sit with me, Celia. Please. There\u2019s so much I need to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She let him pull her down beside him on the couch, even if she was still horrified by the fact she was wearing a robe, with nothing on underneath, and she was wearing a wet towel on her head, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>But when she looked at him, she promptly forgot all that. All she knew was that she loved this man, and she\u2019d do anything to make things right between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a low, shaky voice.</p><p>He pressed a finger to her lips. \u201cShh. I don\u2019t want to hear that word cross your lips. It\u2019s me who is sorry. I was an ass. I said despicable things to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she felt the ridiculous urge to cry again, as if she hadn\u2019t done enough of that in the last few days.</p><p>\u201cFirst, I want to talk about this,\u201d he said as he drew out the dreaded newspaper clipping from his pocket.</p><p>She froze, her stomach seizing with dread.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look like that. I don\u2019t believe a word of it. But it\u2019s obviously an important part of your past. It hurt you and it\u2019s affected a good portion of our relationship. I want you to tell me what really happened.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled and she twisted her hands nervously in her lap. \u201cI got out of college, intending to rule the world. I moved to New York. I loved it there. Such a big, busy city, and I was away from home, away from my family. At the time that was important to me. I was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all go through the desperate need to get away from our family,\u201d Evan said.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSo there I was, out to take on the world. I landed a job with a prestigious agency and I worked my butt off to advance as rapidly as possible. I was good and I knew it. So when I got promoted, it wasn\u2019t a surprise to me. There were people who\u2019d been there longer who were pissed, but I knew I deserved it. I felt like I deserved it.</p><p>\u201cAnd then one day my boss called me in his office to congratulate me, and he let me know at the same time what he expected in return for the favor he\u2019d granted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Evan growled.</p><p>\u201cI was horrified. And a bit naive because I honestly hadn\u2019t seen it coming. I didn\u2019t even know what to do at first, other than turn him down flat. I was stupid enough to think that would be the end of it.\u201d</p><p>Evan scowled and reached over to take her hand.</p><p>\u201cI buried myself in work, convinced that if I worked harder, landed more accounts, that he\u2019d just go away. One night I was working late and he dropped in to see how I was doing.\u201d</p><p>She made a derisive sound deep in her throat. The memory strangled her. She hated that helpless feeling.</p><p>\u201cHe came onto me hard and didn\u2019t intend to take no for an answer. He probably would have raped me if his wife hadn\u2019t burst in. I think she knew what was going on, but she didn\u2019t care. She had her way out of the marriage and a way to make him pay for everything he\u2019d ever done wrong to her in their marriage.</p><p>\u201cI was named the other woman. Everyone knew what happened. I had no defense. Suddenly I was a woman who\u2019d slept her way to the top and then destroyed my boss\u2019s marriage. Believe me when I say no one was lining up to do business with me. So I quit and came home. Brock gave me a shot with his agency and the rest, as they say, is history.\u201d</p><p>Evan closed his eyes and let out a sound of disgust. \u201cI was so unfair to you, Celia. You tried to tell me so many times how our relationship might affect you and your career, but I wouldn\u2019t listen. I was selfish and egotistical. I was determined that I should be enough for you. What a jerk I was. I wasn\u2019t even here when all hell broke loose. I should have been beside you, shouting to the world that you were my woman and I was damned proud of it. Instead I slunk off like a sulking two-year-old when I didn\u2019t get my way, and I can only imagine how it looked.\u201d</p><p>He gathered both her hands in his and brought one to his lips. He kissed each finger. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I hope you\u2019ll let me make it up to you. I wish you would have told me all this sooner. Maybe I would have understood you better. But I also know I gave you no reason to trust me. That\u2019s going to change. I want you in my life. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make that happen.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in utter bewilderment. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I love you. That I\u2019m sorry. That I want another chance and that it\u2019s me who\u2019s crawling back on hands and knees, begging for your forgiveness. You\u2019ll never lack for my support again, Celia. You\u2019ll always have me to lean on. And I\u2019ll personally throttle anyone who so much as whispers an ill word about you.\u201d</p><p>Her throat closed in. Her mouth went dry. The world tilted a little crazily around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I was going to you to apologize,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI was wrong, Evan. I did put too much importance on what others thought. As long as I have the support of those who love and respect me, it doesn\u2019t matter what the rest of the world thinks. I should have to crawl back. I washorrible to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, my love,\u201d he said as he hugged her tighter to him. \u201cNever crawl.Never . Forget I said it, please. You weren\u2019t horrible. You were upset. Your world had been upended, and I should have been the one person you could come to and who would support you and understand. I didn\u2019t even try to understand. I got angry and stormed away. I love you. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Evan, I love you, too. So much. I do forgive you as long as you\u2019ll forgive me, too.\u201d</p><p>His entire face lit up. He looked almost boyish as he stared at her in wonder. \u201cYou love me? You\u2019re not just saying it?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and put every ounce of her love into her kiss. He lifted her up until their mouths were even and their noses bumped.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Evan sobered and he let her slide back down until her feet touched the floor. He cast her a sheepish look. \u201cI might have stormed into Maddox Communications, threatening death and destruction if someone didn\u2019t tell me where the hell you were. I\u2019d already tried your apartment, your cell phone. I even called Noah\u2019s agent because I couldn\u2019t reach Noah, either.\u201d</p><p>Celia giggled. \u201cDeath and destruction? Noah\u2019s agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not death and destruction but I did threaten to pull my contract if I didn\u2019t get some answers. Let\u2019s just say that the entire Maddox team developed a sudden interest in your whereabouts.</p> <p>Someone found Adam\u2019s business number, had him paged and then waited an eternity for him to call back. He told us you were here and I came right over.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but her grin was so big she couldn\u2019t hide it.</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cDo you love me? Enough to put up with my ogre ways and my demanding personality? Enough to marry me?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath as tears flooded her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think I can tolerate you,\u201d she said teasingly. \u201cIf you can tolerate the fact that I can\u2019t cook worth a darn. I\u2019ll probably never meet you at the door wearing an apron, and the thought of having children scares the bejesus out of me.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin spread across his face. \u201cI think I can handle all that. So will you? Marry me? Put me out of my misery?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind me keeping my job? I\u2019ve fought too hard and have spent too long coming to grips with my issues regarding public opinion. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d want to quit now.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin and smoothed a thumb over her cheek. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit. You\u2019re handling all my advertising. I\u2019d be broke inside of a year without you. Besides, I\u2019m way too damned proud of you to ever want to clip your wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cAnd, yes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head to hers and kissed her long and sweet. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He reached down into his pocket and pulled out the same ring he\u2019d given her before. He grasped her hand in his and slid it back on her finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept this in my pocket ever since you gave it back. I can\u2019t tell you how wrong it felt when you handed it back to me that night. Promise me you\u2019ll never take it off again.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the glittery diamond, tears blurring her vision. Then she glanced back up at the man staring at her with so much love in his eyes that her knees threatened to buckle.</p><p>\u201cNever. This time our engagement is for real.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
