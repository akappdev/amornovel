The clouds above were coated in an ugly hue of grey, and the streaks of lightning that flashed across the sky every few seconds were no longer marvels; they were predictable.</p><p>Holding up my umbrella, I walked to a newspaper stand and picked up The New York Times\u2014bracing myself for what lay between its pages.</p><p>\u201cHow many women do you think a man could possibly screw in his lifetime?\u201d The vendor handed me my change.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped counting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStopped counting, eh? What did you do, get to ten and decide that was enough before settling down?\u201d He pointed to the gold band on my left hand.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I settled down first, then I started f**king.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrow\u2014looking stunned, and then he turned around to organize his cigar display.</p><p>A couple of months ago, I would\u2019ve entertained his attempt to make conversation, would\u2019ve answered his question with a lighthearted laugh and a \u201cMore than we\u2019ll ever admit to,\u201d but I didn\u2019t have the ability to laugh anymore.</p><p>My life was now a depressing reel of repeated frames\u2014hotel nights, cold sweats, marred memories, and rain.</p><p>Goddamn rain.</p><p>I tucked the newspaper underneath my arm and turned away, glancing at the ring on my hand.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t worn it in a long time, and I had no idea what possessed me to put it on today. Twisting it off my finger, I looked at it one last time\u2014shaking my head at its uselessness.</p><p>For a split second, I considered keeping it, maybe locking it away as a reminder of the man I used to be. But that version of me was pathetic\u2014gullible, and I wanted to forget him as fast as I could.</p><p>I crossed the street as the light turned green, and as I stepped onto the sidewalk, I tossed the band where I should\u2019ve thrown it months ago.</p><p>Down the drain.</p><p>Exculpatory Evidence (n.):</p><p>Evidence indicating that a defendant did not commit the crime.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>Present Day</p> <p>The hot coffee that was currently seeping through my pants and stinging my skin was the exact reason why I never f**ked the same woman twice.</p><p>Wincing, I took a deep breath. \u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king married.\u201d</p><p>I ignored her comment and leaned back in my chair. \u201cIn the interest of your future short-lived and mediocre law career \u0327 I\u2019m going to do two huge favors for you: One, I\u2019m going to apologize for f**king you a second time and let you know that it will never happen again. Two, I\u2019m going to pretend like you didn\u2019t just assault me with some goddamn coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She threw my coffee mug onto the floor, shattering it to pieces. \u201cI definitely did, and I\u2019m tempted to do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Everhart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at me, adding, \u201cI hope your dick falls off,\u201d as she stormed out of my office.</p><p>\u201cJessica!\u201d I quickly stood up and grabbed a roll of paper towels. \u201cJessica?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I picked up my phone to call her desk, but she suddenly stepped into my office. \u201cYes, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Luxury Dry Cleaning and have them to deliver one of my suits to the office. I also need a new cup of coffee, Miss Everhart\u2019s file from HR, and you need to tell Mr. Bach that I\u2019ll be late to that four o\u2019 clock meeting today.\u201d</p><p>I waited to hear her usual \u201cRight away, sir\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m on it, Mr. Hamilton,\u201d but she said nothing. She was silent\u2014blushing, and her eyes were glued to the crotch of my pants.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need some help cleaning that up?\u201d Her lips curved into a smile. \u201cI have a really thick towel in my desk drawer. It\u2019s very soft...and gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is huge, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Her eyes finally met mine. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t tell a soul. It would be our little secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy f**king dry cleaning, a new cup of coffee, Miss Everhart\u2019s file, and a message to Mr. Bach about me being late. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really love the way you resist...\u201d She stole another glance of my wet pants before leaving the room.</p><p>I sighed and started to soak up as much of the coffee as I could. I should\u2019ve known that Aubrey was the emotional type, should\u2019ve known that she was unstable and incapable of behaving normally the second I realized she\u2019d made up a fake identity just for LawyerChat.</p><p>I regretted ever telling her that I wanted to own her pu**y, and I was cursing myself for driving to her apartment yesterday.</p><p>Never again...</p><p>Just as I was tearing off a new paper towel, a familiar voice cleared the air.</p><p>\u201cWhy, hello...It\u2019s good to see you again,\u201d she said.</p><p>I lifted my head up, hoping that this was a hallucination\u2014that the woman at my door wasn\u2019t really standing there smiling. That she wasn\u2019t stepping forward with her hand outstretched as if she wasn\u2019t the very reason that my life was heartlessly altered six years ago.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to shake my hand, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d She raised her eyebrow. \u201cThat is the name you\u2019re going by these days, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I stared at her long and hard\u2014noticing that her once silky black hair was now cut short into a bob. Her light green eyes were still as soft and alluring as I remembered them, but they weren\u2019t having the same effect.</p><p>All the memories I\u2019d tried to suppress over the past few years were suddenly playing right in front of me, and the blood under my skin was starting to boil.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>I picked up my phone. \u201cSecurity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you f**king kidding me?\u201d She slammed the phone down. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to ask why I\u2019m here? Why I came to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing so would imply that I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that when most people get sentenced to prison, they get care packages, money orders, even a phone call on their first day?\u201d She clenched her jaw. \u201cI got divorce papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you\u2019d stay. You told me you forgave me, you said that we could start over when I got out, that you would be right there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou f**king ruined me, Ava.\u201d I glared at her. \u201cRuined me, and the only reason I said those dumb ass things to you was because my lawyer told me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t answer rhetorical questions,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a geography expert, but I know damn well that North Carolina is outside of New York and a direct violation of your parole. What do you think will happen when they find out you\u2019re here? Do you think they\u2019ll make you serve out the sentence that you more than f**king deserve?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou would snitch on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would run my car over you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to say something else, but my door opened and the security team walked in.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d The lead guard, Paul cleared his throat. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need you to vacate the premises now.\u201d</p><p>Ava scowled at me, shaking her head. \u201cReally? You\u2019re really going to let them haul me off like I\u2019m some kind of animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce again, rhetorical.\u201d I sat down in my chair, signaling for Paul to get rid of her.</p><p>She said something else, but I tuned it out. She didn\u2019t mean shit to me, and I needed to find someone online tonight so I could f**k her random and unwanted appearance out of my mind.</p><p>Evasion (n.):</p><p>A subtle device to set aside the truth, or escape the punishment of the law.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>Andrew was the epitome of what it meant to be an ass**le, a shining example of what that word stood for, but no matter how pissed I was, I hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about him.</p><p>In the six months that we\u2019d spoken, he\u2019d never mentioned a wife. And the one time I\u2019d asked if he\u2019d ever done anything more than \u201cOne dinner. One night. No repeats.\u201d \u2013he\u2019d said \u201cOnce,\u201d and quickly changed the subject.</p><p>I\u2019d been replaying that conversation in my mind all night, telling myself to accept that he was a liar, and that I needed to move on.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen of La Monte Art Gallery...\u201d My ballet instructor suddenly spoke into a mic, cutting through my thoughts. \u201cMay I have your attention please?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked out into the full audience. Tonight was supposed to be one of the highlights of my dance career. It was an exhibition for the city\u2019s college dancers. All of the leading performers for spring productions were supposed to dance a two minute solo in honor of their school, in celebration of what was to come months later.</p><p>\u201cThis next performer you\u2019re about to see is Miss Aubrey Everhart.\u201d There was pride in his voice. \u201cShe is playing the role of Odette/Odile in Duke\u2019s production of Swan Lake, and when I tell you that she is one of the most talented dancers I\u2019ve ever seen...\u201d He paused as the crowd\u2019s chatter dissolved into silence. \u201cI need you to take my word for it.\u201d</p><p>One of the photographers in the front row snapped a picture of me, temporarily rendering me blind by the flash.</p><p>\u201cAs most of you know,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the best of the best, spent countless years in Russia studying underneath the greats, and after a long and illustrious career with the New York Ballet Company, I\u2019ve retired to teach those with untapped potential.\u201d</p><p>There was a loud applause. Everyone in the room knew who Paul Petrova was, and even though most in the field were confused as to why he would ever want to teach in Durham, no one dared to question his decision.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll come out and see the first transformation of the Duke ballet program in the spring,\u201d he said as he slowly walked to the other side of the stage. \u201cBut for now, Miss Everhart will perform a short duet from Balanchine\u2019s \u2018Serenade,\u2019 with her partner Eric Lofton!\u201d</p><p>The audience clapped again, and the lights above them dimmed. A soft spotlight shone on me and Eric, and the violinists began to play.</p><p>Short, soft notes filled the room, and I stood on my toes\u2014trying to dance as delicately as the music demanded. Yet, with each step, all I could picture was Andrew kissing me, f**king me, and ultimately lying to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Aubrey. I trust you for some strange reason...\u201d</p><p>I pushed Eric away when he held out his hands, and twirled across the stage until he came after me. He held my face in his hands\u2014as if he was begging me to stay, but I spun away again, launching myself into a full set of nonstop pirouettes.</p><p>I was angry, I was hurt, and I wasn\u2019t holding anything back as I showed off just how well I could dance en pointe.</p><p>The second the violinists struck the last note, the audience let out a collective gasp and applauded the loudest they had all night.</p><p>\u201cWow...\u201d Eric whispered as he took a bow next to me. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone will talk shit about you getting the swan role after that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have been talking shit about me?\u201d I raised my eyebrow, but I already knew the answer to that. A junior landing the top role over all the seniors was unheard of.</p><p>\u201cBravo, Miss Everhart.\u201d Mr. Petrova walked over to me. \u201cShe\u2019s going to blow you all away in the spring, I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><p>Another round of applause began to build and he moved the mic away from his mouth. \u201cWhere are your parents? I\u2019d like for them to come up for a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out of town.\u201d I lied. I hadn\u2019t wasted my time even attempting to invite them to this.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s too bad!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re very proud of you. You can exit the stage now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I headed into the dressing room and changed into a short white silk dress and a grey feathered headband. As I looked myself over in the mirror, I smiled. There was no way anyone could tell that I was an emotional wreck inside.</p><p>I pulled out my phone and noticed a new voicemail from GBH. I knew it was about me missing my internship for the fourth day in a row, so I deleted it. Then something came over me and I googled \u201cAndrew Hamilton\u201d for the umpteenth time this week\u2014hoping something would pop up.</p><p>Nothing. Again.</p><p>With the exception of his perfect, poised photo on GBH\u2019s website and that less than telling bio, there was no information about him anywhere.</p> <p>I tried \u201cAndrew Hamilton: New York, lawyer,\u201d but the results were just as dismal. It was as if he hadn\u2019t come into existence until starting at GBH.</p><p>\u201cGreat performance, Aubrey...\u201d Jennifer, one of Duke\u2019s top seniors, suddenly stepped into the bathroom. \u201cIt really is an honor watching someone so young and underdeveloped get unnecessary credit.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and zipped my purse.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you honestly think you\u2019re going to last until the spring performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m going to stand here and continue this dumbass conversation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should.\u201d She smirked. \u201cBecause between you and me, four years ago\u2014back before your time...There was a certain dancer picked to be the lead in Sleeping Beauty, a double major. She was quite talented\u2014a natural really, but she caved under pressure because she couldn\u2019t devote as many hours to the craft as the dancers who only wanted to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a point to this story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took her spot and I was only a freshman.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNow I\u2019m a senior, and a certain someone is dancing in the role that belongs to me. So, just like back then, I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make sure I get what\u2019s rightfully mine.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and moved past her, ignoring the fact that she whispered \u201cstupid bitch\u201d under her breath. I was supposed to return to the gallery room and watch the other performers, but I needed a break.</p><p>I slipped past the sliding doors to the other side of the room and stepped into the gallery\u2019s bistro. It was much quieter on this side, and the people sitting at the tables seemed to be preoccupied with conversations not centered on ballet.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d A tuxedoed waiter stepped in front of me with a tray. \u201cWould you be interested in a complimentary glass of champagne?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwo please.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrow, but handed me two glasses anyway.</p><p>With no grace whatsoever, I tossed one back, then the other\u2014licking the rims to make sure I didn\u2019t miss a drop.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your bar?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOur bar? I don\u2019t think the patrons of the art gallery are permitted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me ask again.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the other side of the room where a few smokers were sitting, and I walked toward them.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get for you tonight, Miss?\u201d The bartender smiled as I approached. \u201cWould you like to try one of our house specials?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan any of those help me forget about sleeping with a married man?\u201d</p><p>The smile on his face faded and he set out three shot glasses, filling them with what I could only hope was the strongest liquor in the house.</p><p>I slid my credit card across the counter and downed the first one in seconds\u2014shutting my eyes as the burning sensation crawled down my throat. I held the next one against my lips, but I suddenly heard a familiar laugh.</p><p>It was low and gravelly, and I\u2019d heard it a million times before.</p><p>I turned around and spotted Andrew sitting at a table with a woman who was not his wife. I didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she was pretty. Very, very pretty: Auburn hair with blond highlights, deep green eyes, and perky br**sts that were too perfect to be natural.</p><p>She was rubbing him on his shoulder and giggling every ten seconds.</p><p>Andrew seemed undaunted by her affection, and as he signaled for the check, I could only assume how their night would end.</p><p>I tried to turn away\u2014to act like seeing him with someone else wasn\u2019t affecting me, but I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>His date was now leaning over the table\u2014purposely putting more of her cle**age on display, and whispering words that were hard to read. As she playfully licked her lips and stroked his chin with her fingertips, I realized I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>Subject: SERIOUSLY?!</p><p>Are you really on a date right now with someone who isn\u2019t your wife?! It\u2019s bad enough that you\u2019re a cheating and lying philanderer, but are you really that much of a sex addict?</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>His response came within seconds.</p><p>Subject: Re: SERIOUSLY?!</p><p>I\u2019m really on a date right now with someone who\u2019s not going to leave third degree burns on my dick. And I\u2019m not a sex addict, I\u2019m a pu**y addict. There\u2019s a difference.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: SERIOUSLY?!</p><p>You are a disgusting and vile ass**le, and I honestly regret ever sleeping with you.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>No response.</p><p>I watched as he looked down at his phone and raised his eyebrow. He turned around in his chair\u2014slowly scanning the room until he found me.</p><p>His eyes widened the second they met mine, and his lips slowly parted. His gaze traveled up and down my body, and I could practically feel him undressing me.</p><p>There was suddenly no one else in the room but the two of us and I could tell that he wanted me to come to him\u2014right here, right now. I felt my body responding to his stares, felt my ni**les hardening as he dragged his tongue against his lips.</p><p>I swallowed as I looked him over, realizing that I\u2019d pictured his hair entirely wrong in my dreams this week. I\u2019d finger f**ked myself for hours on end last night\u2014using his face and the memories of his voice for inspiration, and seeing him in person only made me want to feel his c**k inside of me again.</p><p>I leaned forward, wanting to go to him, but my tunnel vision started to clear and I saw that we weren\u2019t alone in this room.</p><p>Far from it.</p><p>His date\u2019s perfectly manicured hand found its way to his chin, and turned his head away.</p><p>I followed suit and asked for two more drinks. I gulped them both and when I looked over my shoulder, I saw that Andrew was staring in my direction with undeniable want in his eyes.</p><p>I forced a smile and opened my mouth very slowly, mouthing, \u201cFuck. You.\u201d before leaving. I snatched a handful of mints from a random waiter\u2019s tray and rushed back toward the gallery.</p><p>I was halfway there when I felt my phone vibrating. An email.</p><p>Subject: Meet me in the bathroom.</p><p>NOW.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>I turned off my phone and continued walking toward the gallery doors\u2014damn near running. I reached the lobby, but someone grabbed my arm and pulled me across the room.</p><p>Andrew.</p><p>I tried to jerk away, but he tightened his hold and looked back at me\u2014giving me a \u2018Don\u2019t Fuck with Me\u2019 look as the people around us whispered.</p><p>He pulled me into a bathroom and locked the door, narrowing his eyes at me. \u201cYou think I\u2019m disgusting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely.\u201d I stepped back. \u201cI\u2019ve lost what little respect I had for you and if you even try to put your hands on me, I\u2019ll scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d A trace of a smile grazed his lips, but it didn\u2019t stay. \u201cYou haven\u2019t shown up to work for four straight days. You think just because I f**ked you that I won\u2019t fire you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a f**k whether you fire me or not! Have you ever thought about why I haven\u2019t shown up to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncompetence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re f**king married! Married! How could you\u2014\u201d I shook my head as he closed the gap between us. \u201cHow could you leave that part out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for the record...I\u2019m not technically married, Aubrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not technically stupid, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making it very difficult to talk to you right now...\u201d His lips were nearly brushing against mine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not making any f**king sense.\u201d I freed myself from his grasp and headed for the door, but he grabbed me by my shoulders and slammed me against the wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contested divorce,\u201d he hissed. \u201cIf you were a real lawyer I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t have to explain what the hell that term means, but since you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019re still legally married. It means that if you die before the papers go through, that your wife\u2014which is what she is, will still be entitled to everything you ever owned. It means that you\u2019re a LIAR! A f**king liar, who is apparently exempt from his own stupid and ineffectual rules!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI filed.\u201d He gritted through his teeth. \u201cShe refused to sign, and there\u2019s a lot of complicated shit that I\u2019ll never feel like discussing, but we\u2019ve been separated and out of touch for over six years. Six. Years.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and tried to put on my best poker face, ignoring the fact that my heart was skipping every other beat as he wiped my tears away with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Aubrey,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cYou asked me before if I\u2019d ever lied to you and that answer is still the same. I don\u2019t talk about my life before Durham with anyone, but yes, I did once have a wife and she showed up to my office on her own. I didn\u2019t call her, I never will, and I haven\u2019t called her since I left New York. Our case is extremely complicated and I prefer not to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re still wrong. You still neglected to tell me about her for six months. Six. Months!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what point was I supposed to bring that shit up?\u201d His face turned red. \u201cIn between f**king you over the phone?

And I do have a room reserved across the street. I\u2019ve had the same one reserved for the past four nights with four different women, but I\u2019ve been unable to f**k any of them because I can\u2019t seem to stop thinking about my incompetent-ass-intern and how I only want to f**k her.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cDo you...\u201d I shook my head. \u201cDo you honestly think saying shit like that is a turn-on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d He trailed his fingers underneath my dress, slightly brushing his thumb against the crotch of my soaked panties. \u201cAnd apparently you do too...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe being wet just means that I can\u2019t control my body\u2019s reaction to you. It doesn\u2019t mean that I want to have sex with you. I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that you don\u2019t.\u201d He slipped his hand around my waist and pulled me close\u2014making my breathing slow.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it more convincingly and I will.\u201d He waited for my request, raising his eyebrow, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say those words.</p><p>We stood staring at each other for several minutes, letting that raw, palpable tension build between us before I finally broke the silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think you should get back to your date...\u201d My voice was a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019ve said all you had to say so...What more could you possibly want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn this moment?\u201d He trailed his finger against my collarbone.</p><p>\u201cIn general...\u201d I turned my cheek before he could kiss me. \u201cI\u2019m never sleeping with you again, I\u2019ll be formally resigning by the end of the week, and I think we need to end our so-called friendship for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d he whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I mean that.\u201d I ignored the feel of his hand squeezing my ass. \u201cI want to be friends with someone who\u2019s interested in more than my pu**y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in your mouth, too.\u201d</p><p>I had no response for that, and he must\u2019ve sensed it because he tightened his grip on my waist.</p><p>\u201cI know how hard it is for you to tell the truth,\u201d he said softly, \u201cso I need you to be completely honest when I ask you these next few questions. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, breathlessly, and he leaned closer to my lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t enjoy f**king me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the answer.

Hard.</p><p>\u201cYou just what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be reassigned to another lawyer, and I don\u2019t want to see you any more than I have to...\u201d</p><p>He stared into my eyes for a long time, not saying a word as he finally let me go. \u201cThat\u2019s how you truly feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing as I\u2019m the only one between us who actually feels anything, yes. Yes, that is how I really feel about you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Then he suddenly pulled me back into his arms and crushed his lips onto mine.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you such a f**king liar, Aubrey?\u201d He hissed. Pushing me against the vanity, he bit down on my bottom lip and snatched the feathered headband out of my hair.</p><p>Keeping his lips on mine, he pushed my dress up my waist\u2014ripping off my panties with one pull.</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d I tried to catch my breath as he picked me up and set me on the sink. \u201cAndrew, wait...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He grabbed my hand and placed it over his belt, telling me to unbuckle it.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t answer him. I slipped my fingers underneath the metal clip and unclasped it as he pressed his mouth against my neck.</p><p>Trailing his tongue against my skin, he whispered, \u201cYou haven\u2019t missed me f**king you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only twice.\u201d I sucked in a breath as his hands caressed my thighs. \u201cNot enough to miss anything...\u201d</p><p>He bit me harshly and leaned back, glaring at me.</p><p>My breath caught in my throat as he slipped two fingers inside my pu**y and teasingly moved them in and out.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like you\u2019ve missed f**king me...\u201d He pushed his fingers as deep as they could go, making me moan softly.</p><p>I arched my back as he stroked my clit with his thumb.</p><p>He suddenly pulled his fingers out of me and brought them up to his lips, slowly licking them. \u201cIt tastes like you\u2019ve missed f**king me, too.\u201d He pressed another finger against my throbbing wet clit and then he brought it up to my face\u2014placing it against my lips. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>I slowly parted my lips, and he narrowed his eyes as he slid his finger against my tongue. I felt his c**k rub against my thigh, felt him using his other hand to wrap my leg around his waist.</p><p>\u201cTell me that you don\u2019t want to f**k me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat you don\u2019t want me to bury my c**k deep inside of you right now.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my face and pressed his lips against mine, drawing my bottom lip into his mouth with his teeth.</p><p>I was sliding off the edge of the counter, about to fall, but he suddenly pressed me back against the mirror.</p><p>I kept my eyes locked on his as he unwrapped a condom, as he put it on and stared at me with that same angry expression he\u2019d been wearing all night.</p><p>He grabbed me by my ankles and pulled me forward, sliding his c**k into me as my legs gripped his waist.</p><p>My hands clawed at his neck as he pounded into me again and again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed f**king you,\u201d he rasped, threading his fingers into my hair and pulling my head back. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t thought about me at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh!\u201d I screamed as he sped up his thrusts. I squeezed my legs around him even tighter, trying my best not to give in.</p><p>I shut my eyes and heard him saying my name\u2014panting, \u201cFuck, Aubrey...Fuck...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on the counter...\u201d he commanded, but I ignored him and tightened my grip around his neck.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d He bit my shoulder again, still f**king me harder than ever. \u201cPut your hands on the counter. Now.\u201d</p><p>I slowly unclasped my hands from around him and lowered them to my sides\u2014gripping onto the cold counter. The next thing I felt was his tongue swirling around my ni**les, roughly sucking my br**sts.</p><p>I gripped the tile harder as his kisses became more ravenous\u2014more possessive, and as he f**ked me harder and harder I felt myself on the verge of losing control.</p><p>\u201cAndrew....\u201d I moaned. \u201cAndrew....\u201d</p><p>He released my nipple from his mouth and slid his hands underneath my thighs, picking me up and pinning my back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI know you love the way I f**k you, Aubrey...\u201d He looked into my eyes, forcing his c**k even deeper into my pu**y. \u201cAnd I know you\u2019ve touched yourself every night this week, wishing it was my c**k inside of you instead of your fingers.\u201d</p><p>My clit throbbed with his every word, and I was wetter than I\u2019d ever been in my life.</p><p>\u201cTell me it\u2019s true...\u201d He pressed his lips against mine and slipped his tongue into my mouth\u2014muffling my moans with an angry, unrelenting kiss. \u201cFinally tell me something that\u2019s f**king true...\u201d</p><p>Tremors traveled up and down my spine, and I was seconds away from coming, but he wouldn\u2019t let my mouth go.</p><p>He was still kissing me\u2014glaring at me, begging me to tell him the truth.</p><p>I nodded, hoping that he could read my eyes and see that I needed him to let go of me, I needed to be able to breathe.</p><p>He slammed into me one last time\u2014hitting my spot, and I managed to tear my mouth away from his.</p><p>\u201cYessssss!\u201d My head fell forward into his shoulder and I gasped for air.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d He gripped my waist until he stopped shaking.</p><p>As we both came back down, there were few random knocks at the door, a few \u201cIs anybody in there?\u201d taps, but both us remained silent and breathless.</p><p>Minutes later, when his breathing seemed to be under control, he pulled out of me\u2014staring into my eyes. He tossed the condom away in the trashcan behind him and pulled up his pants.</p><p>I watched as he fixed himself in the mirror, as he smoothed everything so well that no one would ever know that he just f**ked the shit out of me.</p><p>I slid off the sink and looked at my own face\u2014flushed cheeks, wild hair, runny mascara\u2014and pulled my bra straps back over my shoulder. Before I could pull up my dress straps, Andrew moved my hand away and pulled them up for me.</p><p>Our eyes met in the mirror as he smoothed my hair, and for a split second he turned away\u2014to pick up my headband. He gently held it over my head and slid it into place, and then he walked away.</p><p>\u201cYou know, it\u2019s rude to just leave someone after sex without saying anything,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His hand was on the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He cocked his head to the side. \u201cI\u2019m not a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it\u2019s rude to just leave after you f**k me. You could at least say something, anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do pillow talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not pillow talk.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s part of being a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and turned around. I waited to hear the door close, but his hands were suddenly on my waist and he was spinning me around to face him.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say after I f**k you, Aubrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could ask if it was good for me or not...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in asking pointless questions.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cHow long do you have to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother hour or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He was quiet. \u201cAnd while you were stalking me and my date how many shots did you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t stalking you and your date. I\u2019ve been avoiding you all week, or haven\u2019t you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home whenever you\u2019re ready and have someone deliver your car to your apartment tomorrow.\u201d He planted a kiss on my forehead before heading to the door. \u201cJust call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said as he opened it. \u201cWhat about your date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, I slipped inside of Andrew\u2019s car\u2014a sleek black Jaguar. He held the door open until I was comfortable, and waited until I put on my seatbelt before shutting it.</p><p>On his dashboard, I spotted a red folder with a New York state seal on its center. I picked it up, but Andrew immediately took it from me and locked it inside his glove box.</p><p>He looked offended that I\u2019d touched it, but he quickly turned away from me and revved up the car.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI googled you this week and nothing came up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anything come up?\u201d I looked over at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m thirty-two years old and I don\u2019t waste my time on Facebook and Twitter.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cAnd you really haven\u2019t spoken to her in six years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d He looked over at me as we approached a red light. \u201cI thought we just sorted this out in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did, but\u2014\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cYou filed for a divorce, and it couldn\u2019t go through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes two people to complete a divorce, Aubrey. Surely you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d I ignored the fact that he was clenching his jaw. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier for someone like you to make it happen? Six years is a pretty long time to stay married to someone you claim you don\u2019t love anymore, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how well some people can spin a f**king lie to get what they want,\u201d he said, his voice cold. \u201cMy past isn\u2019t up for discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver. It has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back in my seat, crossing my arms. \u201cAre you ever going to tell me the reason why you left New York and moved to Durham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have to.\u201d He steered the car into my apartment complex. \u201cBecause like I told you an hour ago, that part of my life never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell anyone. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He faced me as he stopped the car, and I could see a world of hurt in his eyes. It was the most vulnerable I\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>\u201cI lost something very special in New York six years ago.\u201d There was regret in his voice. \u201cSomething I\u2019ll never f**king get back, something I\u2019ve spent the last six years trying to forget, and if it\u2019s okay with you I\u2019d like to make it to year seven.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I opened my mouth to say sorry, but he continued talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve made this apparent over the past six months or not,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not the \u2018sit up and talk about my feelings\u2019 type. I\u2019m not interested in deep conversations and just because I\u2019ve f**ked you more than once and can\u2019t seem to get you or your mouth off my mind, that doesn\u2019t entitle you to things I haven\u2019t told anyone else.\u201d</p><p>I immediately unbuckled my seatbelt and flung my door open, but he grabbed my wrist before I could get out.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said a few months ago, Aubrey...\u201d He cupped my chin and tilted my head toward him. \u201cYou are my only friend in this city, but you have to understand that I\u2019m not used to having friends. I\u2019m not used to talking about personal shit, and I\u2019m not going to start now.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to open up to me, what incentive do I have to continue being your so-called friend?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing for a few seconds, but then he smirked. \u201cGet in my lap and let me show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I laughing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really think you can just demand for me to have sex with you whenever you want?\u201d I raised my eyebrow. \u201cEspecially since you just said you\u2019ll never be that open about your personal life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He unbuckled his seat belt. \u201cGet in my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know...\u201d I looked down, noticing his c**k slowly stiffening through his pants. \u201cI've let a few things slide the past few times we've had sex, but I have to tell you...\u201d I bit my lip as I slipped out of the car. \u201cI'm really not into the possessive caveman shit.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me as I grabbed my purse and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cI think we need to give your c**k a rest don't you think?\u201d I crossed my arms. \u201cYou have a pretty big hearing coming up next week. Don't you need to save all your energy so you can be better prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back in the damn car, Aubrey...\u201d His voice was strained.</p> <p>\u201cAre you begging me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm commanding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear what I just said?\u201d</p><p>He didn't answer. He reached out for my hand, but I shut the door.</p><p>\u201cI'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d I smiled and walked away.</p><p>Liability (n.):</p><p>Legal responsibilities for one\u2019s acts or omissions.</p><p>A week later...</p> <p>Andrew</p><p>There was only one thing in Durham that held no comparison to New York: Court. The lawyers in New York actually took their jobs seriously. They pored over their research all night, polished their defenses to perfection, and presented their cases with pride.</p><p>In Durham, \u201clawyers\u201d didn\u2019t do shit, and in a moment like this\u2014when I was listening to a young and inexperienced prosecutor embarrass herself, I almost missed those days.</p><p>Then again, I wasn\u2019t paying too much attention to the proceedings today. I was too busy thinking about Aubrey and how many times we\u2019d f**ked in my office this morning.</p><p>We\u2019d said our usual, \u201cGood morning Mr. Hamilton,\u201d \u201cHello Miss Everhart\u201d greetings and locked eyes as she set my coffee down. She\u2019d opened her seductive mouth to say something else, but the next thing I knew, my hands were in her hair and I was pulling her sexy ass against my desk.</p><p>I was ruthlessly pounding into her from behind as I massaged her clit, and when she collapsed on my carpet, I\u2019d spread her legs and devoured her pu**y.</p><p>I was completely insatiable when it came to Aubrey, and being around her for more than five seconds was enough to send me over the edge.</p><p>There\u2019s no point in even counting how many times we\u2019ve f**ked anymore...</p><p>\u201cAs you can see...\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts. \u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury, all of the evidence that I\u2019ve presented will prove\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d I\u2019d had enough of this shit. \u201cYour Honor, last time I checked, this was an evidentiary hearing, not a trial. Why is Ms. Kline being allowed to address a nonexistent jury?\u201d</p><p>The judge took off her glasses and shook her head. \u201cMs. Kline, as hesitant as I am to agree with Mr. Hamilton, he does have a point. Have you concluded with your presentation of evidence? Barring a closing statement to the jury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, Your Honor,\u201d she said, puffing out her chest as if she\u2019d just presented the case of the century.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton...\u201d The judge looked my way. \u201cDo you care to surprise me today by refuting any of the evidence presented?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d This hearing was a waste of time, and she knew it as well as I did.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d She put her glasses on again. \u201cLet the record show that while the prosecution has presented a compelling and rather large collection of evidence, it\u2019s this court\u2019s ruling that it is not enough to warrant a trial.\u201d She banged her gavel and stood up.</p><p>Ms. Kline walked over to me and held out her hand. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll file an appeal, get more evidence, and see you on this matter again soon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me or are you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour client committed the highest degree of fraud, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cSomeone has to pay for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever will if you remain on top of it, will they?\u201d I put my files in my briefcase. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for your next move. And yes, you should get more evidence since the judge clearly ruled that what you had was not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that means I should appeal? Do you think I could win this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you could go back to law school and f**king pay attention.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cEither that, or do your clients a favor and find them a better lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean someone like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one like me.\u201d I slid a pair of shades over my eyes. \u201cBut anyone would be better than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this rude to your opponents, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d She cracked a smile. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve heard stories, but you are really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntriguing.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cYou are really intriguing.\u201d</p><p>I blinked and looked her over. If I\u2019d met her on Date-Match she might\u2019ve been worthy of one night, but I never mixed business with pleasure.</p><p>At least, I didn\u2019t used to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re seeing anyone or not,\u201d she said, lowering her voice, \u201cbut I think you and I have a lot in common, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do we have in common, Miss Kline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She stepped even closer and rubbed my shoulder. \u201cWe were both staring at each other during the hearing, we both have high profile careers, and we both have a passion for the law\u2014a passion that could clearly be transferred to other things.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>I stepped back. \u201cMiss Kline, I was staring at you during the hearing because I was trying to comprehend how someone could show up to court and be so unprepared, unprofessional, and utterly annoying. We do both have high profile careers, but if you continue presenting cases like the one you presented today, I\u2019ll be interviewing you for a secretary position at my firm within the next six months.\u201d I ignored her gasp. \u201cAnd if your passion for the law is anything like the way you f**k, then you and I have absolutely nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you...\u201d She shook her head, stepping back as her face reddened. \u201cDid you really just say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really just proposition me for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was simply probing\u2014seeing if you were interested in going out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I said\u2014noticing that I wasn\u2019t even the slightest bit aroused. \u201cAm I free to leave the courtroom now or would you like to probe me for something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an ass**le!\u201d She spun around and grabbed her briefcase off the floor. \u201cYou know, for your clients\u2019 sake, I hope you\u2019re a lot nicer.\u201d She spat out as she left the room.</p><p>I wanted to tell her that I actually wasn\u2019t nicer to my clients. I didn\u2019t put up with bullshit from anyone, and since I hadn\u2019t lost a single case since moving to Durham, I didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Looking at my watch, I figured I\u2019d wait a few minutes before leaving. I didn\u2019t want to run into her in the parking lot, and since the remaining courts were adjourning for lunch, I figured I\u2019d wait a while.</p><p>I stuffed my hands into my pocket and smiled at lacy fabric that grazed my left hand. Pulling it out, I smiled at Aubrey\u2019s black thong from this morning.</p><p>I took my phone out of my briefcase to text her about it, but she\u2019d emailed me first.</p><p>Subject: Wet Panty Fetish</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve realized that I left my thong in your pocket yet, but I want you to know that I did it for your own good, and that your secret is safe with me.</p><p>Ever since you f**ked me in the bathroom at the art gallery, I\u2019ve noticed that you have a tendency to stare at my panties before taking them off.</p><p>You run your fingers across them, pull them off with your teeth, and then you stare at them again. I have no problem continuing to appease your panty fetish. I\u2019m sure you place them over your face at night, and if you ever need more feel free to let me know.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>Subject: Re: Wet Panty Fetish</p><p>I did realize that you slipped your thong into my pocket this morning. I\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve done this all week.</p><p>Contrary to your unfounded and silly assumptions, I do not have a panty fetish and I do not sleep with them over my face at night. I do, however, have a new fetish for your pu**y, and if you\u2019re interested in letting me sleep with THAT over my face at night, feel free to let me know.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>I waited for a response\u2014watched my screen for several minutes, but then I realized it was Wednesday and she wouldn\u2019t see my email until later.</p><p>I made my way outside and slipped into my car. I didn\u2019t feel like going back to the firm\u2014my case files were all up to date, and it was too early to go home.</p><p>Revving up my car, I coasted down the street in search of a decent bar. As I was turning past the law school, I noticed Duke\u2019s dance hall across the street.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what came over me, but I made a right turn and pulled into the parking lot. I followed the signs that read \u201cDance Studio\u201d and parked in front.</p><p>There was a sign on the double doors of the auditorium that read \u201cPrivate Rehearsals: Dancers Only,\u201d but I ignored it. I followed the faint sound of piano keys and violin strings and opened the door to a colossal theater.</p><p>Bright lights shone directly on the stage, and dancers dressed in all white were spinning. Before I could come to my senses and make myself leave, I spotted Aubrey in the front.</p><p>Wearing the same feathered headband she wore at the art gallery, she was smiling wider than I\u2019d ever seen her smile before\u2014dancing as if no one else was in the room. There was a gleam in her eyes that I never saw while she was at GBH, and although I didn\u2019t know shit about ballet, it was extremely clear that she was the best dancer onstage.</p><p>\u201cExtend, Miss Everhart! Extend!\u201d A grey haired man walked onto the stage, yelling. \u201cMore! More!\u201d</p><p>She continued dancing\u2014stretching her arms out further, extending her hands. \u201cNo! No! NO!\u201d The man stomped his foot. \u201cStop the music!\u201d</p><p>The pianist immediately stopped and the director stepped in front of Aubrey.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what the characteristics of the white swan are, Miss Everhart?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He looked offended.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Petrova.\u201d She stood still.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s so, why don\u2019t you enlighten us all as to what those special characteristics are...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLight, airy, elegant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElegant!\u201d He stomped his foot again. \u201cThe white swan is all about smooth, gentle movements... Her arms are well poised, graceful.\u201d He grabbed her elbow and pulled her forward. \u201cYour arms are erratic, rough, and you\u2019re dancing like a pigeon on crack!\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks reddened, but he continued.</p><p>\u201cI want a swan, Miss Everhart, and if you\u2019re not up to the part\u2014if your heart is elsewhere, like that other major you have, do me favor and let me know so I can groom someone else for the role.\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again!\u201d He stepped back. \u201cOn my count, start the song from the second stanza...\u201d</p><p>I leaned back against the wall, watching Aubrey effortlessly dance again and make everyone else look like amateurs. I watched until I couldn\u2019t watch anymore, until her old director spotted my shadow and yelled at \u201cthe goddamn intruder\u201d to leave.</p><p>Later that night, I walked into the kitchen and pulled out a bottle of bourbon,\u2014pouring myself a shot. It was two in the morning and I was beyond restless.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been able to sleep since I came home and spotted a note from Ava on my door: \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until we talk\u2014Ava.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d balled it up and thrown it into the trash, wondering which person at GBH had been stupid enough to give out my address.</p><p>As I tossed back a shot, my phone rang.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s two in the morning,\u201d I hissed, holding it up to my ear.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d There was a slight pause. \u201cMay I speak to a...A Mr. Hamilton, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is he. Did you not hear me say what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m Gloria Matter from the parole board in New York City. I\u2019m sorry to call you so late, but I didn\u2019t want to turn in until I returned your inquiry from last week,\u201d she said. \u201cThe inmate you called about is no longer an inmate. She was released recently and is now on parole.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m aware that she\u2019s on parole.\u201d I poured another drink. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m pretty sure leaving the state is a direct violation of those terms. Is New York soft on crime now? Do you let previous offenders roam the world as they please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir, but she checked in with her officer this morning. We also checked her monitor the second we received your phone call so she\u2019s still in the state...I must warn you that we don\u2019t take too kindly to false reporting, Mr. Hamilton. If this was some type of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the f**k I saw.\u201d I seethed. \u201cShe was here.\u201d I hung up. I didn\u2019t care enough to think about Ava right now.</p><p>I headed into my bedroom and lay against the sheets, hoping this second round of alcohol would work better than the first.</p><p>I lay there for an hour, watching the seconds on my clock tick by, yet no sleep came and thoughts of Aubrey began to fill my mind. I was thinking about the things she\u2019d told me when we we\u2019d first met, things she\u2019d told me about her sex life, and I had the sudden urge to hear her voice.</p><p>I rolled over and scrolled down to her name.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d She answered on the first ring. \u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you sucked a c**k before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gasped. \u201cHow about \u2018Good morning, Aubrey\u2019? Are you awake?\u2019 How about asking those things first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Aubrey.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly awake, so I\u2019ll bypass that unnecessary question. Why haven\u2019t you sucked a c**k before?\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to drive to your apartment and make you answer the question in person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really in need of this information at three in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperately,\u201d I said. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just something I never wanted to do.\u201d There were papers shuffling in the background. \u201cOne of the guys I used to date would ask me to do it to him from time to time\u2014to reciprocate, but I just...I didn\u2019t like him enough to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t had an actual phone conversation since the last time we had phone sex, right before I found out her real name was Aubrey and not Alyssa.</p><p>\u201cWere you thinking about me?\u201d she suddenly asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you thinking about me?\u201d She repeated. \u201cYou\u2019ve never called me this late before. Are you lonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m horny.\u201d</p><p>She let out a soft laugh. \u201cWould you like me to tell you what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d I put a hand behind my head. \u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday, which means you had practice until midnight, which means you went home and showered and immediately put your feet in an ice tub without putting on any pajamas.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath.</p><p>\u201cAnd from the way you\u2019re breathing right now I take it you\u2019re still naked, and the reason you picked up my call on the first ring is because you want to touch yourself to the sound of my voice.\u201d</p><p>Another gap of silence.</p><p>\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Her voice was low. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re horny right now though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I think you called me because you like me\u2014because you want to hear my voice since we haven\u2019t talked on the phone in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you because my dick is hard and I want to make you cum over the phone.\u201d</p><p>She laughed again. \u201cSo, you don\u2019t like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your pu**y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the white roses and the \u201cHe\u2019s just yelling at you because he knows you\u2019re the best/Don\u2019t let him get to you\u201d note that was on the hood of my car today weren\u2019t from you?\u201d</p><p>I hung up.</p><p>Retraction (n.):</p><p>The legal withdrawal of a promise or offer of contract.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>\u201cHow do you think we should proceed with the client, Harriet?\u201d I leaned back in my chair the next night, dreading my \u201cLet the Interns Help with One Case per Month\u201d required hours.</p><p>\u201cUm, Mr. Hamilton...\u201d She twirled a strand of hair around her finger. \u201cMy name is Hannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing,\u201d I said. \u201cHow do you think we should proceed with this case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could put his ex-wife on the stand. She could vouch for his character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were married for thirty days.\u201d I rolled my eyes and looked at the intern sitting next to her. \u201cAnd that was ten years ago. Bob, what do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...It\u2019s actually Bryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s whatever I say it is. What. Do. You. Have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was doing some research on his background and he apparently was reprimanded for breaking his university\u2019s fire wall his senior year. We could start there and build a case around his past of anarchy...\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s our client, Bryan. Why would we intentionally make him look bad?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>I turned toward the last intern in the room, a petite brunette. \u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to try to guess my name?\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI just realized that you weren\u2019t my janitor today. What do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She slid a folder across the table. \u201cIf we\u2019re trying to prove that he wasn\u2019t in breach of his company\u2019s policies when he took out his initial shares, we could use this case as a reference.\u201d</p><p>I opened the folder, reading the first line of a case that was not only over a hundred years old, but it had been overturned by the Supreme Court decades ago.</p><p>\u201cDid you all smoke the same drugs before your interviews?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019re in law school. A few years away from potentially having someone\u2019s future in your hands and this is the type of shit you come up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, Mr. Hamilton...\u201d Bryan spoke up. \u201cIs there even a right answer to this question? I mean...Is this one of those ha-ha this was just a test to see how our minds work things? Is there really an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I stood up.</p><p>\u201cReally? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s go the f**k home.\u201d I started stacking my papers. \u201cAll of you. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d I glared at them, waiting until they all left the room.</p><p>The second I was alone I let out a sigh and sat down again. I was better off letting Jessica help me out on this case. She didn\u2019t know shit about the law but I was sure that she would at least try.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton, I\u2014\u201d Aubrey stepped into the room with a cup of coffee. \u201cWhere did everyone go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d I took the cup from her, frustrated. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to formally give me my intern position back or am I forever stuck being your coffee and file organizer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also in charge of taking phone calls. That\u2019s a responsibility you shouldn\u2019t take lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious...\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cAs much as I enjoy having sex with you every morning with your coffee, I would like to go back to feeling like I actually have a purpose here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I took a sip from my cup. \u201cHave you been keeping up with my current case?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cHow do you think I should proceed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to first get ahold of the man who erased your client\u2019s identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She took a folder from her purse and set it in front of me. \u201cMy parents taught me how to research someone\u2019s background very, very well. That\u2019s the one thing I can credit them for.\u201d She flipped a few pages. \u201cYour client has school records from his childhood\u2014test scores, address changes, et cetera. There\u2019s a record of where he attended college, grad school\u2014even a record of the time he broke into his school\u2019s firewall and got suspended for an entire semester. After that, there\u2019s a short failed marriage to some woman he met in Cabo, and a few founding records for his company. But after that\u2014with the exception of these recent allegations, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the pages.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s odd?\u201d She looked at me. \u201cHow you can google someone and nothing about them pops up? How you can search several databases for information and find entire decades are missing?\u201d</p><p>I shut the folder. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlightly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Slightly. Is this all the evidence you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the evidence you need.\u201d She stared into my eyes. \u201cFind the guy who erased him, or find the guy who erased you and you might have yourself another win under your belt. If not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t just come out of nowhere, Andrew,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that, I know that, and I\u2019m pretty sure your client knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re talking about the client?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no record of Andrew Hamilton in any of state\u2019s registered lawyer databases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not facing a trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called every law school in the state and pretended to be an alumna searching for a fellow alum and there was no record of an Andrew Hamilton getting his degree from any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you that obsessed with me?\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cI did the same thing for the law schools in New York. That was a bit trickier, but the results were just the same. There was no record of you going to school during the years you would\u2019ve been in attendance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd this affects you how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou humiliated me when you found out I lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou made me cry because you told me that I was a liar for hiding the truth and pretending to be someone I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I wouldn\u2019t be the only person to classify you as a liar after what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, every day that I f**k you, every night that I talk to you on the phone, I\u2019m no closer to getting to know anything about you.\u201d There was concern in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s always me talking about me, or you talking about abstract things that make up a blurry picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I told you that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve never lied to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that, and for a moment I thought that you were always completely honest with me, but when I look back, you\u2019re only honest about what you want to talk about. Hence, the random appearance of Mrs. Hamilton, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you about that already.\u201d I grabbed her hand and pulled her close to me. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not going to waste my time rehashing shit I\u2019ve already gone over with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d I pressed my finger against her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve f**ked regularly in six years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to be proud of that?\u201d</p><p>I pulled her into my lap. \u201cYou\u2019re the only woman\u2014only person actually, that I talk to outside of my hours at this office, the only woman I\u2019ve ever f**ked over the phone, the only woman who\u2019s been in my car, and the only woman who\u2019s lied to me and still gotten me to stay...\u201d</p><p>She sighed, staring back at me.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d I said, \u201cif you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to f**k you in this chair. And when we\u2019re done I\u2019ll kindly show you how to research someone the right way, because contrary to what you think, my client does have a background.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I double checked everything and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>I pressed my lips against hers. \u201cAfter I f**k you.\u201d</p><p>Consent (n.):</p><p>A voluntary agreement to another\u2019s proposition.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>Subject: New York /Your Panties</p><p>For the record, I did go to law school in NYC. I was the valedictorian of my class.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p> <p>PS\u2014If you stash one more pair of your wet panties/\u201cFor your fetish\u201d notes in my desk drawer, I\u2019m going to assume that you do want me to sleep with your pu**y over my face. My tongue has been aching to do that since I first \u201cmet\u201d you so there\u2019s no need for unnecessary hints...</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d My mother\u2019s voice took the smile right off of my face. \u201cAubrey, were you listening to your father just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I sighed, dreading that I was still sitting at a dinner with them.</p><p>They\u2019d called me the second my rehearsal was over and demanded that I drive home so we could all ride to our \u201cfavorite\u201d restaurant together. It was where all their country club friends ate regularly, and I knew they just wanted to come here to assert our seemingly perfect family image.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening now?\u201d My father raised his eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe brought you here so we could tell you that...I\u2019m running for governor in the next election,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want my vote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, Aubrey.\u201d My mother huffed and snapped her fingers for the waiter. \u201cThis is one of the happiest moments of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it isn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those years of hard work, building our firm to be one of the most impeccable in the city,\u201d she said as she looked into my father\u2019s eyes, \u201cit\u2019s about to payoff in a huge way. We already have a few verbal commitments for the campaign\u2019s budget, and since we\u2019re going in on the same side as the incumbent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a really good chance of being governor.\u201d I cut her off. \u201cCongratulations, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He reached over the table and squeezed my hand.</p><p>My mother couldn\u2019t seem to shut up. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to take new family photos\u2014stocks, you know? Photos we can give to the press for their write-ups, so you\u2019ll have to wear your hair in something other than that ballerina thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an eyesore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMargaret...\u201d My father chided. \u201cIt\u2019s not an eyesore...It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what?\u201d I looked back and forth between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to look like a cohesive All-American unit on the campaign trail.\u201d My mother took a glass of wine from the waiter and waited for him to step away. \u201cWe may have to make some stops together as a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re running for governor, not President, and what twenty-something do you know travels with her parents during a campaign just for photo-ops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur opponent has twenty year old twins who are homeschooled,\u201d she said. \u201cThey travel to third world countries every summer to help the poor and I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re going to be at every stop on the campaign trail.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cWhy are you trying to compete with genuine people? Don\u2019t you think they\u2019re the type that deserve to win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey, this is serious.\u201d My dad looked upset. \u201cThis has been a dream of mine for a very long time and we want to make sure that nothing stands in the way.\u201d</p><p>The two of them exchanged glances and I raised my eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNothing like what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d My mother lowered her voice and looked over her shoulder before speaking. \u201cWe need to know if there any skeletons in your closet\u2014any pictures on social media that make you look like a party girl, any ex boyfriends\u2019 or sexual partners that you may have dealt with, or anything that would make us look like bad parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are bad parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, Aubrey.\u201d My father gripped my hand and squeezed it hard. \u201cThe two of us have given you everything you could\u2019ve ever wanted growing up and all we\u2019re asking for is a small sacrifice from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any skeletons in my closet.\u201d I gritted my teeth.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d My mother put on her fake smile. \u201cThen, when you pull out of school for your senior year to help us on the trail, it won\u2019t look suspicious. We\u2019ve already spoken to your department chair about online classes and they are, in fact offered. For the ones that aren\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to show up to campus to take those, but they make special considerations for students with circumstances such as yours so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I cut her off. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t up for discussion, Aubrey. This is for the benefit of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s dream, right?\u201d I tried not to lose it. \u201cBecause he\u2019s the only person in this family who has a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d my mother said through her smiling teeth. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about real dreams, Aubrey. Not no-chance-in-hell and failed ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d I stood up. \u201cYou want to talk about failed dreams when the two of you have failed more than anyone I know at the expense of your own daughter?\u201d There were tears in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAubrey, sit back down.\u201d She grabbed my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not make a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s!\u201d I snatched my hand away. \u201cLet\u2019s discuss how I\u2019m twenty f**king two and I\u2019m a junior in college when I should already be a graduate! Shall we? Can you explain why that is?\u201d</p><p>My father\u2019s face reddened and he motioned for me to sit down, but I stood my ground.</p><p>My mother clutched her pearls. \u201cAubrey...We did what was best at the time, and even though switching school systems twice in two years was unfortunate, it made you who you are today. Now, the campaign won\u2019t start until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care when the hell it starts. I\u2019m not going on a pointless campaign trail, and I\u2019m not taking any of my classes online because guess what?\u201d I could feel my blood boiling. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn f**king ballet online!\u201d</p><p>The restaurant was suddenly silent.</p><p>\u201cYou two are beyond selfish and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m voting for the other guy.\u201d I stormed off amidst gasps and whispers from the other tables\u2014slightly content that my parents\u2019 picture perfect family had been publicly scratched a bit.</p><p>\u201cYour number, Miss?\u201d The valet said to me as I stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour number?\u201d He tilted his head to the side. \u201cFor your car?\u201d</p><p>Shit... I sighed and looked over my shoulder.</p><p>Patrons were pointing in my direction and I couldn\u2019t bear to go back in there just because I didn\u2019t have a ride home.</p><p>I considered calling a cab, but I knew that was pointless. It would take forever to get here, and I could probably walk back to my apartment faster than they would arrive.</p><p>There was a bus stop a mile or so down, but I only had a credit card. I doubted Andrew would come get me, but I decided to give it a try.</p><p>Subject: A Ride.</p><p>I really need a favor...</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>Subject: Re: A Ride</p><p>Wanting to take a ride on my c**k in the middle of the day shouldn\u2019t be considered a \u201cfavor\u201d at this point.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: A Ride</p><p>I\u2019m not talking about your dick.

Just not to my apartment.\u201d I paused. \u201cI\u2019m sure my parents will stop by there after dinner and try to talk to me so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost my appetite...\u201d I said softly, then I smiled. \u201cBut if you\u2019re interested in taking me on a date right now, I\u2019m not opposed to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I take you on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you owe me one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou once said that you would take me out if we ever met in person, and you haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d</p><p>We approached a stoplight and he turned to face me.</p><p>\u201cIf I was even vaguely interested in taking you out right now\u2014which I\u2019m not, where the hell would I take you if you\u2019ve already eaten dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise me.\u201d I shrugged and leaned against the glass\u2014shutting my eyes. I could practically picture him staring at me, giving me that \u201cYou\u2019re out of your damn mind\u201d look, and as he steered the car back onto the street, I smiled\u2014hoping that this would be the start of us going out regularly.</p><p>I was dreaming of him kissing me in the gallery room again when I felt him gently shaking my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d he whispered. \u201cAubrey, wake up.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head and looked outside my window. There were lush plants and a massive glass paned building\u2014an executive condo. My heart skipped a beat because I knew he\u2019d never taken a woman to his place before, and I was happy that I would be the first. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked over at him, ready to say something, but then I saw him fiddling with a green parking pass and I looked out the front window\u2014seeing where we really were.</p><p>Outside of a Hilton hotel.</p><p>\u201cYour idea of taking me on a date is bringing me to a hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more about f**king you in the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAndrew, this is where you take all your other dates...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>My heart sank. \u201cDo you not see why bringing me here would hurt my feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer the Marriott?\u201d</p><p>I blinked.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have the same standard of room service,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if that\u2019s what you prefer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me home\u2014right now.\u201d My voice cracked and I leaned against the window, shutting my eyes again. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with my parents...\u201d</p><p>I woke up on a plush leather couch, tucked underneath a soft black blanket.</p><p>Sitting up, I saw that my shoes had been taken off and placed in a rack on the other side of the room. A tray of fresh fruit and chocolates were sitting on the small table in front of me, and there was a bottle of wine sitting next to two stemmed glasses.</p><p>The room looked as if it\u2019d been plucked from a magazine: silk white draperies, taupe walls, and portraits framed in silver. One of those portraits was of a f**king hotel, making it clear exactly where I was.</p><p>I immediately tossed the blanket off\u2014ready to find Andrew and yell at him for bringing me here against my wishes. I walked down the hallway, slowly noticing that the pictures hanging on the wall were of him.</p> <p>In one picture, he was standing on a beach, looking off into the distance. In another he was standing in front of a NYC cab, and in another he was lying against a city park bench.</p><p>He was young in all of these photos\u2014his eyes held a more boyish charm, and if I wasn\u2019t mistaken, he looked happy. Extremely happy.</p><p>In between all of the larger photos, were small wooden blocks in the shape of an entwined \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH.\u201d At first I thought that the \u201cA\u201d for Andrew\u2019s first name was simply missing, that one of the pieces would bear it, but that wasn\u2019t the case: In the last frame at the end of the hall there was a photo of a huge \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d that were solely compiled of pictures of New York.</p><p>\u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d?</p><p>I continued walking down the hallway, smiling at the more \u201cesteemed\u201d photos he\u2019d hung of himself. I stopped when I heard the sound of running water and followed it into a massive bedroom.</p><p>Everything was cloaked in black\u2014the sheets that covered the king sized bed, the long silk curtains that hung over the balcony\u2019s French doors, and the plush rug that sat atop his polished wooden floors.</p><p>I walked over to his armoire and pulled out the first drawer.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Andrew was standing right behind me.</p> <p>\u201cI was...\u201d I stalled as he wrapped an arm around my waist. \u201cI was looking through your stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for anything particular?\u201d He kissed the shell of my ear from behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for where you keep all my panties.\u201d</p><p>He let out a low laugh. \u201cThey\u2019re all next to my bed.\u201d He slid his hand underneath my skirt and stalled once his fingers reached my bare pu**y. \u201cSince you\u2019re not wearing any, do I need to give them back to you?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and he let me go.</p><p>\u201cIs this better than a hotel room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d I turned around. \u201cHow many other women have you had here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe that. \u201cIn six years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to keep my f**king life separate from my home life.\u201d He clasped my hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m the exception to the rule?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer. He simply led me across the bedroom and into an all-white en-suite where the water from the shower was still running.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you to wake up...\u201d He looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cBecause you want to watch movies together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to f**k you in the shower.\u201d He pushed my back against the wall and looked into my eyes. \u201cBecause I want to f**k you all night.\u201d</p><p>I moaned as he wedged his knee between my thighs and pulled my shirt over my head. He slipped his hand behind my back to unclasp my bra, and as it fell to the floor he trailed his tongue across my ni**les.</p><p>\u201cTake off your skirt...\u201d He backed away from me.</p><p>My hands went to my zipper, but my eyes stayed glued on him as he started to undress himself.</p><p>I\u2019d f**ked him numerous times in his office, recklessly rode his c**k time and time again, but I\u2019d never seen him completely naked.</p><p>He pulled his white V-neck shirt over his head and tossed it into the corner\u2014exposing a set of chiseled abs and a small cursive tattoo that was etched onto his chest.</p><p>I tried to read what the words said, but then he unfastened the drawstring of his black lounge pants and let them fall to the floor.</p><p>I could see that his c**k was hard through his briefs, and I waited for him to take them off, but he walked back over to me.</p><p>Grabbing my hand, he placed it against his waistline. \u201cTake them off of me.\u201d</p><p>I slipped my thumb underneath the elastic, but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cWith your mouth.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as I looked up at him, seeing the sexy smirk on his face.</p><p>I bent down slightly and trailed kisses across his waist\u2014hearing him take in a sharp breath as his hands slipped into my hair.</p><p>I gripped his thighs for balance and tugged at the hem of his briefs with my teeth. Pulling the fabric down a few inches, I used my fingers to move them further, but he pulled me back by my hair.</p><p>\u201cOnly your mouth.\u201d He warned.</p><p>I gave him a look of understanding and he let me go. I once again grabbed the briefs with my teeth and slowly slid them down his legs.</p><p>I looked up and saw that his c**k was standing at attention, rock hard and ready for my pu**y like always, and from the look in his eyes, I knew he was going to pull me up and f**k me against the wall.</p><p>Before he could get the chance, I sat up on my knees and gripped his c**k with my hand. I pressed my lips against it\u2014trailing my tongue across every thick inch. I wrapped my mouth around his tip and slowly massaged it with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d He threaded his fingers through my hair and looked down at me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d I felt my cheeks heating. \u201cI\u2019m sucking your cock.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, letting a slow smile spread across his face. \u201cYou\u2019re not sucking my cock...You\u2019re kissing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was getting to that part. I was trying to do it like...\u201d I shook my head and stood up, completely embarrassed. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were trying to do it like what?\u201d he whispered against my lips.</p><p>I shook my head again and he looked into my eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to watch anybody else to learn. I\u2019ll teach you...\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, he grabbed my hand and pulled me into the shower. He pressed his chest against mine and slipped a finger into my mouth as the water ran over us. \u201cIs this as wide as you can open for me?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to open a lot wider than that if my c**k is going to fit into your mouth...\u201d He sat down on the small wet bench behind him and motioned for me to bend low.</p><p>The water streams from above lashed against my back as I got down on my knees.</p><p>\u201cLick your lips,\u201d he commanded, and I obliged\u2014feeling completely out of my zone.</p><p>I leaned forward, assuming that I was supposed to take him into my mouth now, but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cMake it wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your mouth on my c**k and wet it.\u201d</p><p>Hesitant, I pressed my lips against his dick and slid my tongue across his shaft. I was swirling it against him slowly, but then he pulled my head up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too gentle,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to be a f**king lady right now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to be aggressive, greedy, and sloppy because I\u2019m not going to be gentle when I\u2019m devouring you.\u201d He gently pushed my head down and spread his legs a little further. \u201cMassage my balls with your hand...\u201d</p><p>I immediately cupped them, rubbing them against each other.</p><p>\u201cA little harder...\u201d His breathing slowed and I picked up the pace of my fingers.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOpen your mouth as wide as it can go, and take my c**k as deep as you can...\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth and took in the first few inches easily as he threaded a few fingers through my hair.</p><p>\u201cKeep your eyes on me.\u201d He looked somewhat impressed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take all of it right now...\u201d He used my shoulders to push me back and then forward. \u201cKeep easing it in and out of your mouth just like this...\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he stared at me with pure lust in his eyes, and then he whispered. \u201cSuck me deeper...\u201d</p><p>I followed his command and he groaned even louder. I could see the muscles in his legs tensing as my mouth covered over half of his cock. I was starting to feel a little bolder, slightly more confident, so I took in a little bit more of him.</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d He breathed.</p><p>I used my free hand to cover the part of his c**k that wasn\u2019t in my mouth, and massaged it the same way I was massaging his balls\u2014soft but aggressive.</p><p>He started to tug at my hair, begging me to take more of him into my mouth. \u201cTake all of it...\u201d</p><p>Feeling as if I was now in control, I denied his request, and sped up my rhythm\u2014bobbing my head up and down.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d His words were strained.</p><p>I took him a little deeper\u2014wrapping my lips around him a little tighter, but I didn\u2019t go all the way.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d he said again, sounding desperate.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t paying his words any attention. I was loving the way his c**k felt inside my mouth, loving the way my tongue was commanding him and making him react.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He yanked me back by my hair and glared at me. \u201cTake all of my c**k into your f**king mouth right now.\u201d</p><p>I slid my mouth over him and leaned forward all the way\u2014not stopping until it touched the back of my throat.</p><p>Andrew briefly shut his eyes and sighed. Then he opened them again and spoke firmly. \u201cI need you to let me cum in your mouth...\u201d His voice was raspy. \u201cAnd I need you to swallow every f**king drop...\u201d</p><p>I gripped his knees and sucked him faster and faster, and his c**k began to throb in my mouth. I could feel it pulsating, constricting, and as he leaned back and finally let go I felt spurts of warmness slipping down my throat.</p><p>His cum was salty and thick, and I honestly loved the taste of it. As the last drop landed into my mouth, I looked into his eyes and he looked back at me. The expression on his face was one of pure satisfaction and awe, and I was more turned on than I\u2019d ever been in my life.</p><p>He stood\u2014pulling me with him, and pressed his lips against mine. \u201cThat was f**king perfect.\u201d He turned off the water and led me out of the shower and back into his bedroom\u2014not bothering to dry me off.</p><p>He grabbed me by my waist and tossed me onto the bed. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>I let my legs fall apart and he climbed on top of me. Crashing his lips against mine, he sucked my bottom lip into his mouth.</p><p>I could feel the tip of his c**k rubbing against my pu**y and I lifted my hips\u2014encouraging him to f**k me.</p><p>After being with him in the shower, I didn\u2019t want to do much foreplay and I didn\u2019t want to talk.</p><p>I just wanted to be f**ked. Now.</p><p>His hands caressed my br**sts and I pushed them away. \u201cFuck me, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, looking as if he wanted to say something smart, but he leaned over and reached into his nightstand for a condom.</p><p>He quickly slipped it on and entered me in one full stroke, causing me to moan in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh...\u201d I reached up and grabbed his hair as his c**k pounded into me relentlessly. I was sure I\u2019d never get tired of him f**king me, each time was better than the last.</p> <p>I shut my eyes as he buried his head in my neck, as he whispered how \u201cfucking good\u201d I felt. Small tremors started building inside of me, and as much as I wanted this to last a little longer, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on.</p><p>\u201cAndrewww...\u201d I said his name as my hips started to jerk and my orgasm took over me. I screamed, falling back onto the pillows, and he collapsed on top of me seconds later.</p><p>We both lay there, entwined in each other for a long time\u2014not saying a word. When I finally found the energy to speak, I cleared my throat. \u201cAre you going to sleep inside of me all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d He pulled out of me, immediately making me miss the feel of him. He walked over to his closet, tossing the condom away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I sat up.</p> <p>\u201cGetting dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can take you home.\u201d He slipped into a pair of pants. \u201cAnd so I can go to sleep.\u201d He put on a shirt, and then he looked over at me. \u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take you to get ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to take me home.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI want to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d he looked utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cYes, here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs in overnight?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, and he stood there staring at me as if I\u2019d just asked him to do the unthinkable. The look he was giving me was one of anguish, regret, and for a second I almost felt bad about suggesting it.</p><p>\u201cAubrey, I don\u2019t...\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve never let someone spend the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me be your first...\u201d</p><p>He continued staring at me, tapping his chin, and then he walked over to his closet and grabbed a set of white pajamas.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in these...\u201d He held them out for me.</p><p>I reached out to take them but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cStand up.\u201d</p> <p>I slid off the bed and stood in front of him.</p><p>He took his time helping me into the button up shirt\u2014kissing every inch of my exposed skin until he reached the top button, and when he was finished he kissed my lips.</p><p>I expected him to hold out the pants next, but he tossed them across the room. \u201cGet in the bed.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I slipped underneath the sheets as he hit the lights.</p><p>He joined me in bed seconds later, pulling me against his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Is there anything else outside of my comfort zone that you\u2019d like me to do for you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, but you could make me breakfast in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in case you change your mind, I would like Belgian waffles, bacon, sliced strawberries, and orange juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want to eat all of those things off of my cock, it\u2019s not happening.\u201d He pinched my ass. \u201cGo to sleep, Aubrey.\u201d</p><p>In the morning, I opened my eyes and realized I was alone in Andrew\u2019s bed. I looked over at where he\u2019d been sleeping and spotted a note on GBH stationery:</p><p>Had to run to the office to meet a new client. I\u2019ll be back to take you home.</p><p>PS\u2014Feel free to take your panty collection home with you.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>I slipped out of bed, ready to explore more of his condo, but there was a sudden loud knock at the door. I rushed over and twisted the knob, expecting to see Andrew, but it was a man dressed in all black.</p><p>\u201cUm hello?\u201d I tried not to look too confused.</p><p>\u201cAre you Aubrey Everhart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He handed me a white bag. \u201cGourmet waffles, bacon, sliced strawberries, and orange juice, right?\u201d</p><p>Denial (n.):</p><p>A statement in the defendant\u2019s answer to a complaint in a lawsuit than an allegation (claim of fact) is not true.</p><p>A few days later...</p><p>Andrew</p><p>I was officially out of my damn mind.</p><p>I was in my bathtub, and Aubrey was sitting on top of me\u2014panting as she came down from another orgasm.</p><p>She was spending the night at my condo for the third time this week, and it was pointless to even pretend like I minded.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what the hell was happening, but she\u2019d definitely gotten to me. She was infiltrating my every thought, and no matter what I did to try and come back to my senses\u2014to remind myself that this could only be temporary, she slipped deeper into my life.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so quiet tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when a naked woman is in your lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was giving her a chance to relax.\u201d I slid my hands underneath her thighs. \u201cWhat unnecessary bullshit do you want to talk about today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unnecessary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they still in New York?\u201d</p><p>I prevented myself from clenching my jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She raised her eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? Are you estranged from them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I sighed. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any parents.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side. \u201cThen why do I remember you telling me a story about your mom the first month that we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe story about Central Park and ice cream.\u201d She looked into my eyes, as if she were expecting me to say something. \u201cYou said she took you to some children\u2019s fair, I think? It was something that happened every Saturday. But the one you remembered most happened when it was raining and she still took you, and you stood in line for an hour just to get a scoop of vanilla.\u201d</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>\u201cIs that story not right? Am I mixing it up with something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s right...But I haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d She looked down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d I trailed a finger across her lips. \u201cI turned out just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a few more things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a daily question quota starting today.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat do all the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d pictures in your hallway stand for?\u201d</p><p>I felt a sudden ache in my chest. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hate New York so much and you don\u2019t like talking about your past or what you lost six years ago, why do you have so many mementos hanging on your walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, forget that question. And the Latin quote across your heart? What does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie about one thing, lie about it all...\u201d I kissed her lips before she could ask me anything else. I was starting to wonder why she hadn\u2019t wanted to be a damn journalist instead of a ballerina.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou can ask me questions now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather f**k you again.\u201d I lifted her with me as I stood up and helped her out of the bath tub.</p><p>We both dried off and went into my bedroom. Just as I was pulling her against me, my doorbell rang.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cDinner\u2019s early.\u201d I slipped into a pair of lounge pants and a T-shirt and headed to the door with my credit card.</p><p>The second I opened it, I was confronted with the sight of the last person on earth I wanted to see. Ava.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare f**king slam it on me this time,\u201d she hissed. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about shit.\u201d I stepped outside and shut the door behind me. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that you\u2019re not wanted here?\u2019</p><p>\u201cAs many times as it\u2019ll take you to actually believe it, which you don\u2019t.\u201d She scoffed. \u201cAsk me why I came to Durham to see you, Mr. Hamilton. Appease me and I\u2019ll finally go the hell away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going the hell away regardless,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cI really don\u2019t give a f**k why you came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if it\u2019s to sign the divorce papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve sent that shit in the mail.\u201d I gritted my teeth. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m sure you\u2019re running out of loopholes for contesting it, I\u2019m willing to wait until all your options run out. I\u2019m sure your lawyers will drop you as soon as they find out what type of client you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is ten thousand a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ask the man who was f**king you in our bedroom while I was at work.\u201d I glared at her, livid. \u201cOr better yet, ask the judge you only \u201cfucked for a favor,\u201d or hey, if you\u2019re up to it, f**k my former best friend. Sleeping with him always seemed to make you feel better, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t Mr. Perfect either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never f**king cheated on you, and I never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cFive thousand a month,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGo f**k yourself, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I never give up,\u201d she said, her eyes widened as I stepped back inside my apartment. \u201cI always get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d I slammed the door in her face, feeling my heart palpitating, feeling the onset of ugly memories all over again.</p><p>Rain. New York. Heartbreak.</p><p>Complete and utter heartbreak.</p><p>Seeing Ava in person again\u2014hearing her manipulative voice and feeling those familiar pangs in my chest, immediately made me realize that I couldn\u2019t make the same mistake again.</p><p>Aubrey was already asking questions, trying to dig her way into my life as much as she could\u2014thinking that if she stayed around long enough that we would work out together. But I knew that would never happen, not after seeing Ava and knowing just how far she would go to ruin me all over again.</p><p>I was officially done with this monogamous game we\u2019d been playing for the past couple weeks. It was quite fun\u2014different, but since Aubrey could never be mine and I could never be hers, it was quite f**king pointless too.</p><p>I headed back into my bedroom and saw Aubrey smiling as she settled into the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the dinner?\u201d she asked, tilting her head to the side. \u201cDid you leave it at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head and started packing up her things, stuffing them all into her purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d She stood up. \u201cDid something just happen? Do you want to talk about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about anything else with you.\u201d I hissed. \u201cI just want to take you the hell home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looked confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you get all of your shit out of my bathroom. You won\u2019t be coming back here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to start f**king someone else.\u201d I picked up her headband. \u201cI think I\u2019ve spent more than enough time with you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d Her face fell. \u201cWhere is all of this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same place it was always coming from. You lied to me once, you\u2019ll lie to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were over that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe you were, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that you need to get all of your things so I can take you home, and from here on out, you are my intern and I am your boss.

This is the last time you\u2019ll ever pull this hot and cold shit on me.\u201d She stormed out of my apartment, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>I sighed and felt an immediate pang of guilt in my chest, but I knew it was the right thing to do. It was either cut this bullshit off now, or be responsible for breaking her heart later.</p><p>I stepped onto the balcony and lit a cigar\u2014looking up at the moonless sky. Even though I felt bad for ending things so abruptly, for putting her out with no explanation, I needed to get back to who the hell I was and fast before I f**ked up and put my heart on the line again...</p><p>Closing Argument (n.):</p> <p>Andrew (Well... back then, you would\u2019ve called me \u201cLiam A. Henderson\u201d)</p><p>Six years ago</p><p>New York</p><p>There\u2019s something about this city that makes me believe again. It\u2019s the hopefulness in the air, the flashing lights that shine brighter than anywhere else, and the dreamers who fill the streets day after day\u2014unwilling to give up on their failures until they finally win. There\u2019s no other city like it, and there\u2019s nothing more alluring outside these state lines\u2014nothing that will ever make me leave.</p><p>As the sun sets in the distance, I wrap my arm around my wife\u2019s waist. We\u2019re standing against the railing of the Brooklyn Bridge\u2014smiling because I just added another high profile client to my firm.</p><p>\u201cYou think one day the papers will actually tell the truth about your first case?\u201d She looked up at me with her light green eyes. \u201cOr do you think they\u2019ll keep brushing it under the rug?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrushing it under the rug.\u201d I sigh. \u201cI highly doubt the government wants people knowing a kid straight out of law school uncovered a conspiracy. It\u2019s an insult to their organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re fine being reduced to a random Jeopardy question that\u2019ll happen ten years from now? \u2018I\u2019ll take lawyers who never got credit for two hundred, Alex.\u2019 You\u2019re fine with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d I kiss her forehead. \u201cI didn\u2019t need the papers to print my name to get clients. People knew, that\u2019s how they found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be so much bigger than what you are...\u201d She shakes her head, whispering, \u201cYour name should be plastered across every billboard in the city. Fucking ass**les...\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I tighten my grip around her waist and start the walk back to our car. Out of all the people that have come in and out of my life, Ava Sanchez has been the one constant.</p><p>She\u2019s the only woman I\u2019ve ever loved, and ever since the day I made her mine at our wedding three years ago, I swore that would never change.</p><p>\u201cI was also thinking,\u201d she says as she slips into the passenger seat, \u201cthat maybe me, you, and your partner Kevin could go out to a singles\u2019 mixer next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we go to a singles mixer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more so for Kevin...He needs to get his own life. I\u2019m tired of him hanging around us all the time. It\u2019s bad enough that we all work at your firm together, but do we have to spend our every waking moment together, too?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I drove down the city streets and home to the colossal brownstone we shared. It was the first purchase I\u2019d made after winning the \u201ccase that never was,\u201d and Ava had insisted that I buy the most expensive one.</p><p>\u201cBecause you f**king deserve it,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cAnd you never treat yourself to anything nice...That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand about you, Liam. You\u2019re such a nice guy to everyone but yourself...\u201d</p><p>I park our car in front of our home and immediately step out to open her door. As usual, Ava whispers, \u201cI bet she\u2019ll scream for you first,\u201d as I walk her up the steps.</p><p>The second we walk inside, that familiar sweet voice rings out across the room.</p><p>\u201cDaddyyyyy!\u201d</p><p>I let go of Ava\u2019s hand and stoop low so my daughter\u2014Emma Henderson, can run into my arms. She\u2019s the best part of my day, the best part of my life, and seeing her always brings an unbreakable smile to my face.</p><p>I kiss her forehead as she incoherently babbles about her day with the babysitter, and I smile as her blue eyes stare into mine.</p><p>I'm unaware of it now\u2014I\u2019m too blind and happy to see it, but in the months to come, my life will unravel so rapidly and unexpectedly that I'll wish I never existed. The lies that come to the light will be so devastating and crushing that my entire life will crumble around me. But the worst part, the part that will break me, is not knowing that this present moment with my \u2018daughter\u2019 will be the last good memory of New York I'll ever have...</p><p>**End of Episode Two** </p> </body></html>"]
