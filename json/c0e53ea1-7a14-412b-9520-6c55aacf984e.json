Her body had been placed\u2014very carefully, he had no doubt of that\u2014in the middle of a large bed. White, gossamer curtains billowed around the bed, looking like thin spider webs that had been spun to shield her body.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d Sean Whelen, Jamie\u2019s first in command, muttered as he grabbed Jamie\u2019s arm. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason she\u2019s under, man. The woman is evil.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t look evil. She looked...beautiful.</p><p>Jamie shook off Sean\u2019s hold. The guy swore but stepped back as Jamie shoved away those too-thin curtains and let his gaze sweep over the prize he\u2019d sought for so long.</p><p>The woman was pale, but that was expected of her kind. It wasn\u2019t like she would have been a fan of sunbathing even before she\u2019d succumbed to the curse that had locked her body. Her hair was long and dark, lustrous and gleaming against the bedding. A silken, white dress covered her, skimming over what he could see were ample breasts and the kind of hips he\u2019d always enjoyed holding tight.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to die,\u201d Sean told him, voice definite. \u201cProbably in the next five minutes. Some horrible, painful death.\u201d</p><p>Jamie tossed him a glare. \u201cNot helping.\u201d</p> <p>Sean rocked back on his heels.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not like we have a choice,\u201d Jamie muttered. Hell. He didn\u2019t want to do this. Waking the woman known as the Blood Queen wasn\u2019t exactly something that Jamie had ever thought he\u2019d do.</p><p>But sometimes, a werewolf could sure get desperate. Especially when the lives of his remaining packmates were on the line.</p><p>So he put his hands on her body. Ice cold. Figured.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not breathing, is she?\u201d As usual, Sean kept talking.</p><p>But this time, the guy was right. \u201cNo.\u201d That was why she looked...dead. When he\u2019d first heard the story about the Blood Queen, he\u2019d just thought it was bullshit.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t staring at bullshit.</p><p>He\u2019d had to kill his way through half a dozen paranormal bastards in order to get to her. Their blood still stained his clothes. But if the woman before him could really do what he thought, then the hell he\u2019d walked through would be worth it.</p><p>His fingers skimmed down the delicate curve of her cheek. She certainly didn\u2019t look like the walking nightmare rumors whispered about in the dark. Her chin was a little pointed, her lips sensual and full\u2014and red. Long lashes cast faint shadows on her cheeks, and Jamie wondered what color her eyes would be.</p><p>Since he planned on waking her up real soon, Jamie knew he was about to find out.</p><p>He lifted his hand away from her face and claws ripped from his fingertips. \u201cGo outside,\u201d Jamie ordered Sean. \u201cGuard the door, just in case...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, in case the crazy bitch gets loose and kills you?\u201d</p><p>No. He wasn\u2019t worried about that. Jamie had this, her. \u201cIn case we\u2019ve been tracked. I don\u2019t want anyone stopping me. Not until I\u2019ve put the bond in place.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>Then Sean gave a low whistle. \u201cYou\u2019re...really going to do it?\u201d</p><p>What, did Sean think he\u2019d gone to all this trouble for the hell of it? Shits and grins?</p><p>\u201cYou know...you know what will happen to her if you do this, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Now Sean almost sounded sorry for the \u201ccrazy bitch\u201d in question. Jamie forced a shrug. \u201cAnd I know what will happen to me.\u201d He turned his head and met Sean\u2019s dark stare. \u201cI\u2019ll make my pack stronger.\u201d</p><p>The pack was all that mattered.</p><p>He\u2019d returned to the pack just one year before and found them under attack. An attack that had come from within. Men, women\u2014they\u2019d been brutally killed. The pack had dwindled down to just six\u2014six\u2014werewolves.</p><p>There would be no more deaths in the O\u2019Connell pack. But the pack...oh, yes, the pack would have its vengeance.</p><p>His gaze turned back to the woman. Hello, vengeance.</p><p>She didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>\u201cGo outside,\u201d Jamie ordered again.</p><p>This time, Sean obeyed. Jamie heard the shuffle of Sean\u2019s boots over the dusty floor and the creak of the old door as it slid closed.</p><p>Then he was alone with the prey that he\u2019d sought for the last six months. The instrument of his revenge.</p><p>He raised his right hand, and his claws slashed across his left wrist. Blood welled, dripped. Clenching his teeth, Jamie put his hand over the woman\u2019s mouth and he waited.</p><p>The seconds ticked by as his heartbeat thundered in his ears.</p><p>And nothing happened.</p><p>Jamie lifted his hand. Blood had smeared over her lips. He leaned toward her. His index finger pushed lightly inside her mouth as he searched for the fangs that should have been there.</p><p>Only they weren\u2019t. The woman had perfectly normal, human teeth. No fangs.</p><p>He pulled back. The wound he\u2019d made on his wrist throbbed with a dull ache, but he ignored it. Pain didn\u2019t matter. Never had, to him. Frowning, he put his hand on her chest. He didn\u2019t feel a heartbeat. Despite what humans believed, the hearts of vampires actually did beat.</p><p>Only her heart was ominously still.</p><p>His back teeth ground together. \u201cMaybe you are dead,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>The Blood Queen had been under a spell for the last fifteen years. A spell, a curse, same damn thing to him.</p><p>The blood of a werewolf had put her under\u2014that blood had frozen her body and locked the spell\u2019s magic in place.</p><p>And the blood of a werewolf was supposed to wake her. Only she wasn\u2019t waking up.</p><p>Hell. So much for his big, secret weapon. Jamie would just have to find another way to destroy Latham and\u2014</p><p>She had golden eyes. Dark, deep golden eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not...dead,\u201d she said, her voice a husky purr that actually seemed to roll through him, \u201cbut you...are.\u201d And her hand flashed up. The woman was strong\u2014far stronger than he\u2019d expected\u2014and she grabbed him by the shoulder and yanked him toward her.</p><p>Then her mouth, her very sharp teeth, bit into his throat.</p><p>Instead of being afraid, Jamie smiled and let the Blood Queen taste him.</p><p>Drink up, baby. It\u2019s your funeral. Because with every drop of blood that she took in these first moments, she was just locking herself to him ever more deeply. Bonding them, body to body, blood to blood, until there would be no escape. Not for either of them.</p><p>His claws dug into the sheets as he held his body perfectly still.</p><p>Revenge would sure be one bloody bitch.</p><p>Latham, get ready to die.</p><p>Don\u2019t kill him.</p><p>The whisper slid through the shattered remains of Iona\u2019s mind. His blood was in her mouth, flowing like rich bliss over her tongue. His hot, strong body was against hers, and...</p><p>Her heart was beating. Hard, pounding beats that seemed to tremble through her. She could feel and hear every single beat.</p><p>Her teeth pressed into him. She was probably hurting this man, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself. She was starving. Had been starving, for so very long.</p><p>Pull back. Don\u2019t kill.</p><p>But it was so hard to keep her control.</p><p>Her heart beat was growing faster. She could feel the power of his blood sliding through her body. Giving her strength when before there had been only weakness. There\u2019d been...nothing.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s enough.\u201d His voice was low, deep, and tinged with the faintest brush of an Irish accent.</p><p>She ignored his words. Iona hadn\u2019t enjoyed her fill of him yet and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI said...enough.\u201d His hands, big, powerful, caught her shoulders and shoved her away. Her back hit the wooden headboard of the bed, and she blinked up at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you drain me, then this little deal isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and still tasted him. Maybe it was because she\u2019d gone without blood for so long, but the man\u2014he\u2019d tasted incredible. Fresh. Wild. Spicy.</p><p>She\u2019d like more.</p><p>When Iona tried to lunge forward, his hands just tightened around her shoulders, and he kept her pinned against the bed\u2019s head-board. \u201cNot so fast, baby.\u201d</p><p>Baby? Her eyes narrowed and she actually managed to focus and look up at his face.</p><p>Hard angles. Brutal cheekbones. A sharp nose. Lips that were...sexy.</p><p>Her breath whispered out.</p><p>There were faint scars on his left cheek. Old. Little ridges that raised the flesh and gave him a tough, dangerous appearance.</p><p>She\u2019d always enjoyed danger.</p><p>Until that lust for danger sent me to hell.</p><p>His hair was dark, even darker than her own. Light drifted through the window on the far right. Light. Actual light! And with that light, she saw only pure black in his hair. His eyes\u2014a sharp, intense green\u2014were a bright contrast to that thick darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou settlin\u2019 down?\u201d he demanded and that faint Irish burr rolled beneath his words. Some might not have even noticed that slight accent.</p><p>Iona wasn\u2019t some.</p><p>She was also hardly settling down.</p><p>But...how did he hold her back so easily? She\u2019d taken a lot of blood from him during that frenzied feeding. He should be weak.</p><p>If he were human, he would be unconscious.</p><p>Just what type of creature was he?</p><p>His gaze flickered over her. Blood\u2014his\u2014had dripped onto her dress.</p><p>Her heart beat had finally dimmed. Her heart still raced just as frantically in her chest, but the thunderous booms didn\u2019t threaten to burst her ears any longer. Her heartbeat had been the first sound she\u2019d stopped hearing.</p><p>Listen, Iona...listen to these last, desperate beats.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Do you hear them? They\u2019re slowing. Soon, they\u2019ll stop.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>And you\u2019ll never hear your heart beat again.</p><p>As that memory whispered through her mind, a scream broke from her and Iona lunged upward as she battled the ghost from her past. Her nails turned into claws, and she attacked the man before her. She swiped out, catching him across the chest and then tossing him aside.</p><p>In the next instant, she was on her feet. The long dress tangled around her legs and she ripped the fabric away from her thighs as she lunged for the door and sweet, sweet freedom.</p><p>Get out. The walls wouldn\u2019t hold her prisoner any longer. She wouldn\u2019t hear the rustle of insects or the scuttle of rats or the whisper of the wind or\u2014</p><p>Iona yanked open the heavy metal door, nearly tearing it right from its hinges.</p><p>Another man whirled to face her. His handsome face tightened when he saw her and claws broke from his nails. Long, razor-sharp claws that could have passed for knives. Claws that were much bigger and shaper than the talon-like ones that she possessed.</p><p>Werewolf.</p><p>Rage filled her, blocking all other thought. The room faded in focus around her. She could only see him. The beast. The monster.</p><p>Just like the one who\u2019d imprisoned her.</p><p>\u201cDie.\u201d Her whisper. Her voice was broken. She was broken. But killing the wolf could help to make her whole. This man\u2014this werewolf\u2014he hadn\u2019t been the one to save her. Not like the other one. He hadn\u2019t brought her back. So there was no remorse in her, no phantom urge to protect him as she grabbed his head and twisted his neck to the side.</p><p>Then she felt claws circle her own throat.</p><p>\u201cHe can be an asshole sometimes, but I can\u2019t let you kill him.\u201d</p><p>The other man. Irish. And had he said asshole or arsehole? With the Irish thickening in his voice, she couldn\u2019t tell for sure. Not that it mattered. What mattered was...</p><p>Her rescuer had...claws, too. Werewolf. Two werewolves.</p><p>She freed the fool at the door even as she began to plan her next attack.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Sean,\u201d Irish said.</p><p>The one called Sean scrambled back and jerked the door closed as he left.</p><p>Her captor kept his claws at her throat and slowly forced her to turn and face him. Blood soaked his shirt and that sweet scent tempted her. Iona\u2019s fangs were out, and her body, so long starved for nourishment, shuddered with longing.</p><p>Another taste.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t kill her, she\u2019d get that taste. As weak as she was, even a mangy wolf might be able to take her out.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cI want my taste, too.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he was talking about.</p><p>His green eyes seemed to burn into hers. \u201cI bled for you, and now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>The claws at her neck slid across her skin. The pain was brief, a prick that she almost didn\u2019t even feel, but then he was pulling her closer. Wrapping his arms around her, and because the man was huge\u2014towering far over six feet\u2014he lifted her up against him so that her toes barely touched the ground.</p><p>Then he put his mouth on her throat and he...he licked her skin. Her breath shuddered out of her. Iona knew she should fight, but her legs were still weak. She ached. She...</p><p>Liked the feel of his mouth on her.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...didn\u2019t expect that,\u201d the man murmured against her skin.</p><p>Her eyes were wide open, staring behind him at the bed that had been her jail cell.</p><p>How long had she been there? So long that she\u2019d gone crazy enough to let a wolf put his paws on her.</p><p>\u201cRe...lease me...\u201d Her voice was hushed, so raspy. Her throat ached when she spoke, but the blood would heal her. Soon enough. \u201cOr...die.\u201d</p><p>His tongue slid over her skin. Did he\u2014did he press a kiss to her throat before his head lifted? It felt as if he had. \u201cEasy. I barely took a sip from you.\u201d One dark brow rose as he offered her a half-smile that flashed a dimple in his cheek. \u201cWhile you guzzled me like a frat boy with a new keg.\u201d</p><p>A frat...? Her eyes slit and she forced herself to speak again, \u201cRe...lease...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, right...\u201d He dropped his hands and moved back a step. \u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>Her teeth snapped together. Happy wasn\u2019t exactly a part of her vocabulary.</p><p>The man raised his hands. \u201cI\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a no?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are...you?\u201d Her voice was a bit stronger now. Good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the man who saved your sweet ass.\u201d Definitely sounded like arse that time.</p><p>Her gaze swept over him. \u201cNot...man.\u201d Men didn\u2019t have claws. Men didn\u2019t drink blood.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cTrue enough. I\u2019m more than just a man.\u201d A brief pause. \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you\u2019re dead...\u201d A threat because...he would be. Vampires and werewolves didn\u2019t mix. She\u2019d tried that path once upon a bloody time. Hell had been her reward.</p> <p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d That grin came again. His dimple winked. \u201cI\u2019m the hero who just rescued you.\u201d</p><p>Werewolves weren\u2019t heroes. They were the monsters in all the stories. All of her stories, anyway.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m the guy who can give you exactly what you want.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know her. How could he possibly know what she wanted? Her lips parted and she sucked in a deep breath. Then she realized what she was doing. Air. Wonderful, precious air. Her lungs had been starved, for so long. She actually felt a bit dizzy as she pulled in more of that delicious air.</p><p>His eyes were on her, watching her far too closely, and then the guy said, \u201cI can give you Latham, and I\u2019ll even help you to cut the bastard\u2019s head off.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Perhaps...maybe...this stranger did know what she wanted, after all.</p> <p>She\u2019d let him keep living a bit longer.</p><p>Latham. The name had burned itself in her memory. Latham Gentry was the wolf responsible for sending her to hell. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Iona asked again. Her speech was improving by the second. Good thing she\u2019d always been a fast healer.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Jamie O\u2019Connell.\u201d</p><p>The name meant nothing to her. It was Irish. So was he. In all her very long life, she\u2019d never met Jamie O\u2019Connell before.</p><p>Not until she\u2019d opened her eyes and tasted his blood.</p><p>Now that she knew him, Iona realized she\u2019d never forget the werewolf. His memory would stay with her long after he was dead.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a little time,\u201d Jamie said as he nodded his dark head, \u201cand I\u2019ll lead you right to Latham.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. The werewolf was trying to offer her some sort of deal. She didn\u2019t do deals. \u201cYou brought me back.\u201d He\u2019d given her the blood she needed to break whatever wretched curse Latham had used on her.</p> <p>Jamie inclined his head toward her. She figured that was an agreement.</p><p>She\u2019d once vowed to destroy the werewolves, to take them out...one by one.</p><p>But this man, this werewolf, he\u2019d given her life. Killing him then, well, it didn\u2019t exactly seem right. \u201cCount yourself lucky, wolf.\u201d She brushed by him and headed for the window. The only window in that narrow room. As she walked into the ray of light that spilled through the glass, the sunlight felt wonderfully warm on her chilled skin.</p><p>Most vampires hated the light.</p><p>Not Iona.</p><p>She\u2019d been in the darkness for so long that she was desperate for that light. She pressed her palm to the windowpane. Beyond that glass, she saw the rough edges of the cliffs that waited outside. Heard the crash of waves. Water seemed to surround her.</p><p>Figured, water would be needed for a holding spell.</p><p>The werewolf and his damn witch. She\u2019d find them both. Make them bleed and beg.</p><p>But first, she had to deal with this werewolf. \u201cGood-bye, Jamie O\u2019Connell,\u201d Iona said, without bothering to look back at him. Then she slammed her hand through the glass. The window shattered and broken glass rained down on the floor\u2014and fell outside of the window.</p><p>Jamie called out her name, but she didn\u2019t stop. In an instant, she\u2019d leapt through that window, and she was rushing for her freedom. She was an old vampire, one gifted with powers that few others could ever hope to possess.</p><p>She\u2019d been born as a vampire. Born to a father who wanted the power of the gods.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten her instead.</p><p>She leapt over the rocky terrain. Stared at the water that seemed to howl and snarl below her.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>The dark werewolf, giving chase. She paused at the edge of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He demanded as he rushed after her. \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d</p><p>She laughed then, and the sound was as brittle as her voice. Iona glanced over her shoulder at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been dead for too long.\u201d And she wanted to wash away the rot and stench of the hell that had trapped her. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to live again.\u201d</p><p>And when the Blood Queen lived, everyone else should fear.</p><p>Lifting her hands high above her, Iona turned back to the crashing waves. Then she stepped off the edge of the cliff and plummeted into the dark water below her.</p><p>Footsteps pounded behind Jamie as he peered over the edge of the cliff. Hell, that was at least a thirty foot drop. Forty?</p><p>The water roared below him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going after her?\u201d Sean asked as the younger wolf huffed to a stop beside him.</p><p>Her head had just broken through the foaming waves. While Jamie watched, the vampire called Iona began to swim through the churning tide, taking her sweet time as she moved easily through the water.</p><p>Amazing.</p><p>In-freaking-sane.</p><p>Jaw clenching, he gritted, \u201cNo.\u201d Because, unlike the vamp, he wasn\u2019t ready to risk having his body savaged by the rocks and the waves and whatever the hell else waited below.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting away,\u201d Sean said, pointing out the obvious. He had an annoying tendency to do that.</p><p>Jamie slanted the guy a hard glance. Sean should be glad the lady was swimming away. Especially considering that the vampire in question had been close to ending Sean\u2019s life just minutes before.</p><p>Then Sean gave a slow shake of his head and met Jamie\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat didn\u2019t go quite as we planned, did it?\u201d</p><p>He re-assessed his grand plan. Iona was a strong swimmer. Correction, she was just plain strong. Ten minutes after waking, and the woman was cutting through the water like an Olympic swimmer. Very interesting. Very promising. Jamie smiled and let his anger wash away. \u201cIt went even better than I\u2019d planned.\u201d The Blood Queen...Iona...she\u2019d definitely lived up to the stories that he\u2019d heard.</p><p>Iona. Her name whispered through his mind. Beautiful. Seductive. A perfect name for his vampire. Before, he hadn\u2019t been able to match that name with a face. Now he knew just what she looked like. It would be impossible to ever forget a woman like her.</p><p>He glanced down at the water once more. Then, because he knew where the vampire would go, Jamie turned away from the cliff. Iona thought she was safe. That she was still the paranormal bad-ass that others had to fear.</p><p>Once she got to town, she\u2019d see that the rules of the game had changed. She wouldn\u2019t be getting away from him.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not ever.</p><p>The bond he\u2019d forged with her could never be broken. At least, not if the vampire wanted to keep living.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>As far as hunting prospects were concerned, the small coastal town of Shade, Oregon, wasn\u2019t exactly ripe with possibilities. Two bars\u2014both rundown as all hell and faded from time\u2014blasted music into the night.</p><p>Just two.</p><p>When Iona turned up, Jamie knew she\u2019d head to one of those bars. He just had to make sure he chose the right hunting spot in order to catch her.</p><p>The music kept playing. Some young band danced across the stage while girls in low-cut tops swayed in their seats. The alcohol was pouring, laughter floated in the air, and as the darkness deepened outside, not one of the humans there seemed to realize the danger that stalked them.</p><p>Humans. They could be so oblivious. Maybe that was why they still thought vampires and werewolves existed only in movies and nightmares.</p><p>Jamie tapped the counter and the bartender slid him another beer.</p><p>Not just in movies, kids. We\u2019re right in front of you. He drained the beer in two gulps.</p><p>Now, to just find Iona...</p><p>Jamie put his back to the bar and propped his elbows on the countertop behind him. His gaze swept the crowd once more and...</p><p>She walked in.</p><p>Not still clad in her blood-stained gown, but wearing jeans that curled around her legs, high hells that clicked across the floor, and a tight, black t-shirt that pushed her breasts forward and had three men scrambling eagerly toward her.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Iona smiled, and Jamie saw that she was careful not to flash any fang. For the moment.</p><p>But then she took the hand of one of the fools who had rushed toward her, and she began to lead the guy back outside. Talk about your easy prey. Jamie was almost tempted to let the dumb kid die.</p><p>Almost. Stupidity shouldn\u2019t be a crime punishable by death.</p><p>He tossed some cash down on the bar and stalked after his Blood Queen.</p><p>Bodies jostled into him as he made his way through the bar, but he just shoved those bodies the hell out of his way. In moments, he was outside and the bar\u2019s main door slammed closed behind him. The scent of the ocean teased his nose as the wind blew lightly against him. Wind that carried not just the salt of the ocean, but the coppery odor of blood.</p><p>His claws wanted to break free. The beast inside roared, but Jamie yanked back on his wolf\u2019s chain. Holding tight to his control, Jamie followed the scent of blood, rounded the building and saw\u2014</p><p>The kid\u2014some college-aged guy with sun-streaked blond hair\u2014was pressed up against the side of the building. Iona had her hands on his chest. The jerk was moaning and her fangs were in his throat. Jamie\u2019s teeth ground together as he rushed toward them.</p><p>But before he could grab Iona, she fell away from the guy and hit the ground, hard. Her body began to shake as she wiped her hand over her mouth. \u201cPoi...son...\u201d</p><p>The blond wasn\u2019t moving. He lifted a hand to his throat and touched the faint wound on his neck. \u201cWh\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie lunged forward and grabbed the blond by the shoulder. \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s eyes widened, but, despite the fear Jamie could smell, the fellow shook his head and glanced over at Iona. \u201cShe\u2019s hurt. I-I should help...\u201d</p><p>The dumbass didn\u2019t seem to get that Iona had just tried to eat him. And now he wanted to play Galahad. Figured. Hero complexes. Jamie sure didn\u2019t suffer from them. \u201cGet out of here, or I\u2019ll just knock your ass out.\u201d Jamie lifted his fist. One punch, and Galahad wouldn\u2019t be waking up for hours.</p><p>Galahad swallowed. \u201cI-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Iona was back on her feet. \u201cYou burned me!\u201d She yelled, then she leapt at her would-be-snack.</p><p>Jamie caught her before she could do any permanent damage to Galahad. \u201cGo,\u201d he bit off to the fool. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Galahad left. Iona twisted and bucked in Jamie\u2019s arms, and he was sure that she didn\u2019t mean to turn him on. The woman seemed far too furious, but, damn, her curves were fine and when she kept rubbing that ass right over his groin...</p><p>His eyes squeezed closed. Fucking her hadn\u2019t been part of his plan. This hard lust? No, not the plan. He wasn\u2019t supposed to want her so badly. Use her to hunt his enemy? Yes, that was definitely on his agenda. Wanting to strip her and explore that silken body for hours? No, not the plan.</p><p>His plans just kept changing.</p><p>But then she stopped struggling. Iona just seemed to go limp in his arms. Her head sagged forward.</p><p>Uh, oh. He wasn\u2019t sure just what kind of damage the guy\u2019s blood might have done to her. Jamie knew that he probably should have warned her about that little, ah, issue, but she\u2019d run before he could break the news to her.</p><p>\u201cIona?\u201d He turned her in his arms, moving her so that Iona\u2019s chest pressed against his. Her eyes were closed. He bent over her, wondering what to do next.</p><p>Her eyes flew open. Too aware. Too...hungry. And rather pissed. In a flash, she\u2019d bolted up and her teeth were on his throat. No, in his throat.</p><p>His breath hissed out, but it wasn\u2019t pain that he felt. Her fangs sliced through the skin in an instant, and the only sensation he felt was a burst of pleasure so intense that his whole body shuddered. More of that. Oh, yeah. More.</p><p>She was drinking from him, and every soft move of her lips had his body tensing even more. Growing harder. His cock was swollen, fully aroused, and hot pulses of pleasure lit his blood as her mouth worked on his neck.</p><p>Keeping his hands on her hips, he maneuvered her back, then she was the one pinned against the side of the building. He tilted his head, trying to give her better access because, hell, yes, he was loving this rough ride of pleasure. And the blood that she took...</p><p>It links us more.</p><p>His fingers slid around to the front of her jeans. Found the snap and jerked it free. Her zipper hissed down.</p><p>Her tongue licked over him.</p><p>He wanted to touch her skin. Wanted to touch her everywhere so he could discover just how soft she\u2019d be.</p><p>Her body trembled against him. \u201cYou...you taste so good.\u201d Her soft words were whispered against his neck.</p><p>He was betting that she\u2019d taste like paradise.</p><p>\u201cHe tasted like acid, but you...\u201d Now her voice wasn\u2019t so whispered. It was snapping. Angry as awareness grew within her. Her fingers curled over his shoulders, and she pushed him back, just far enough that she could see up into his eyes. \u201cYou taste like dessert.\u201d</p><p>Her little pink tongue slid over her bottom lip. As if she were savoring his taste.</p><p>Dangerous. The woman was lethal in more ways than he\u2019d realized. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes\u2014he could see them perfectly in the dark, a werewolf perk\u2014narrowed on him. \u201cWhy do you taste like dessert?\u201d Iona wanted to know.</p><p>He deliberately let his eyes widen. \u201cBecause I\u2019m awesome?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes had become golden slits. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p> <p>Aw, their hot moment was about to be over. Pity. His hand was still just inside of her jeans. So close to the flesh he wanted to touch.</p><p>She seemed to realize exactly how close his fingers were to her sex because she gave a little growl and pushed him back a good five feet.</p><p>Not inside her jeans anymore.</p><p>Iona yanked up the zipper and fixed the snap in an instant. \u201cYou thought to fuck me?\u201d</p><p>Hoped, not thought, but he lifted his hands and shrugged. \u201cYou thought to drain me?\u201d Jamie tossed back.</p> <p>She growled again. Sexy. \u201cWolf,\u201d she snarled, \u201cI gave you a chance to live. You should have just stayed away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that.\u201d Time for her to realize just how much her life had changed. \u201cIf I do, you die.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at that. \u201cWhat? Are you some sort of protector?\u201d</p><p>Not hardly.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep me safe from all the other big, bad wolves out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Flat.</p> <p>She blinked at that. A faint furrow appeared between her brows.</p><p>Jamie rubbed his chin. Time for some fast facts. \u201cThe human tasted like crap to you because you can\u2019t handle his blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire,\u201d said with a long sigh, as if speaking to a clueless child, \u201cI can handle anyone\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>He risked a step toward her. His boots crunched on the gravel beneath him. \u201cNot anymore you can\u2019t.\u201d Okay, she\u2019d flip over this, but he figured it was best to just get it out there. \u201cYou see, your body\u2019s tuned now. It\u2019s only gonna want one thing. Can only accept one thing...\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted as she studied him. \u201cTuned?\u201d Her lips tightened in distaste. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re rambling about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo survive, you need blood.\u201d It was a simple fact of the undead life for a vampire. To keep existing, a vampire had to take in sustenance. Blood. And, usually, any blood would work to sustain a vamp.</p><p>But not for her. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou were put under a spell,\u201d he said this part quietly, with a hint of sympathy, because the spell had been a real bitch for her.</p> <p>Her hands fisted. \u201cI was there. I remember. You don\u2019t have to tell me, wolf.\u201d</p><p>The woman had more than a touch of arrogance. Probably because, if the stories were true, she actually had once been a queen.</p><p>\u201cAn alpha werewolf\u2019s blood put you under the spell.\u201d Here was the dicey part. But, really, what could she do to him? Without just hurting herself in return? \u201cThat meant only the blood of another alpha wolf could wake you.\u201d And break the spell.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re an alpha. I\u2019m so impressed,\u201d she murmured, sounding not even the tiniest bit like she cared. A car horn honked in the distance. The wind kept brushing over them. Near the back of the bar, a chime tossed music into the air. Iona shoved back her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t met and killed a dozen of your kind before.\u201d</p><p>Except for Latham. She hadn\u2019t killed him. If she had, then neither of them would be having these problems right then.</p><p>\u201cThere was just one little rule about breaking your spell...\u201d Jamie kept his voice flat when his own anger wanted to stir. He had helped the woman. As far as she knew, he was just being a good Samaritan. Had Iona even offered a thank you to him? He cleared his throat. \u201cThe wolf that woke you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep!\u201d</p><p>He ignored that, for now. She\u2019d sure looked asleep\u2014no, dead\u2014to him. \u201cYou\u2019d only crave the blood of the wolf that freed you from the spell.\u201d He studied her, then said, \u201c\u2018It will taste like wine to you...\u2019\u201d Now he was doing a direct quote from what a witch-in-the-know had told him during his search for the Blood Queen. Before Iona speak, he finished the last of that witch\u2019s quote, \u201c\u2018While the blood of others will never satisfy your hunger.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She grabbed him. In all of his years, he\u2019d never seen a vampire move as quickly as she did in that one instant. \u201cYou\u2019d better by lying.\u201d Her fists had clenched around his shirt. The material was in danger of ripping at any moment.</p><p>He gave her a big smile, knowing that his dimple would flash. \u201cBaby, would I lie to you? I\u2019m the wolf who saved you.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched even harder as she dug her nails into his shirt.</p><p>He kept his eyes on hers. Jamie said, \u201cI\u2019m also the man who\u2019ll keep you alive. My blood. It\u2019s what you need. What you\u2019ll always crave.\u201d He felt like he was driving nails into the vamp\u2019s coffin. In a way, he was. He was also enjoying himself. Iona was about to realize just how much she needed him. \u201cSo it\u2019s in your best interest to make sure that I live a very, very long life.\u201d</p><p>The shirt began to tear. \u201cYou\u2019ll never live as long as me.\u201d</p><p>Normally, no. But their situation wasn\u2019t exactly normal. \u201cI will live as long as you give me your own sweet blood.\u201d The beast inside had always enjoyed a taste for blood. And hers blood was the most powerful that he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>Her gaze held his. \u201cYou want my blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kinda have to get it, in order for us both to keep living.\u201d He kept his face blank. She couldn\u2019t know the real reason why he wanted her blood. That wonderful power boost that he\u2019d get from it. The boost that would make him strong enough to take out Latham.</p><p>Because Latham had also been feeding on vamps.</p><p>The secret was out in the paranormal world. Thanks to the mating of a few werewolves and vampires, folks had realized that if you wanted a power surge, you had to get very, very intimate with those who\u2019d once been your sworn enemies.</p><p>Since Iona had been sleeping during that time of revelation, she didn\u2019t realize just how hot of a commodity her blood had become to the werewolves of the world.</p><p>Blood as old as hers, as powerful...and it\u2019s all mine.</p><p>Jamie knew his smile had widened. He couldn\u2019t help it. Everything was falling into perfect place for him.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d Barely a breath from her. A breath that was full of burning fury. \u201cOne bad human doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m stuck with you. He was probably on drugs. I always hated the taste of drugs in a human\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t letting him go, and Jamie wondered if, deep down, she already knew the truth.</p><p>Then he caught the scent of blood. Heard the softest tread of footsteps. His head jerked up. His nostrils flared.</p><p>Five men. Though not actually men. Not human.</p><p>Coming their way.</p><p>The same knowledge was in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCompany,\u201d he told her as he drew in the scents of the night.</p><p>Her head turned to the left, away from the faint lights from the parking lot and toward the darkness of the woods that waited. Her body seemed to tense against his. \u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But it was company he\u2019d expected. Just not quite so soon. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told her, as he pushed her behind his body. She went easily enough, probably more from surprise than anything else. \u201cI won\u2019t let them hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Five against one. He could handle these odds in his sleep.</p><p>Especially since he\u2019d taken some of her blood. Hmmm...maybe he could even consider this as a test run. To see just how much strength her blood would truly give him.</p><p>The others were coming in fast now. Time to change. Time to show Iona just who\u2014what\u2014she was dealing with in this battle.</p><p>The fire of the change swept through his body. It wasn\u2019t some light, easy shift. It was brutal. As savage as the beast he carried. His bones snapped. His muscles tore and reshaped. Fur seemed to explode along his flesh. He hit the ground, but when his palms slapped against the cement, they were already transforming into the powerful paws of a wolf.</p><p>Iona stood behind him, and the fast pants of her breath echoed in his ears.</p><p>The werewolves were coming for her. He knew it. Once the spell holding Iona had broken, Latham\u2019s witch would have told him the news. And Latham would have sent out his attack dogs.</p><p>Too bad. You can\u2019t have her back.</p><p>Their \u201ccompany\u201d broke from the trees. Two black wolves. Two gray. One white.</p><p>Latham\u2019s foot soldiers\u2014wolf soldiers.</p><p>Jamie barred his teeth and didn\u2019t wait for them to come lunging at him in an attack. He sprang toward them, more than ready to draw first blood.</p><p>The sounds of the vicious snarls and howls filled her ears. The waves were crashing close by, and the music still blared from the bar, so the humans probably weren\u2019t even aware of the bloody battle going on so close to their safe little world.</p><p>Iona was too aware.</p><p>Jamie wasn\u2019t a man any longer. But she knew that, in truth, he\u2019d never been a man. That had just been a surface lie. Werewolves were always more beasts than men.</p><p>He was in the form of a big, fierce, black wolf now. A wolf that was easily twice the size of the others he attacked. A wolf that drew blood with his claws and his razor-sharp teeth and seemed to love the savagery of the fight.</p><p>No hesitation. No fear.</p><p>Two of his enemies were already on the ground.</p><p>A third would be out of the battle soon.</p><p>It appeared that Jamie was a true werewolf alpha.</p><p>Iona turned away from the battle. Alphas had always annoyed her. Maybe because she liked to be the alpha, too.</p><p>Whatever. She would leave Jamie\u2019s lying beast to his own ends. He could handle the others\u2014and she could find a human to eat. I\u2019ll prove him wrong.</p><p>She just needed more blood. There was still a weakness in her limbs that she couldn\u2019t allow. When she faced Latham\u2014oh, I\u2019ll see you dead soon\u2014she had to be at full strength.</p><p>A wolf\u2019s sharp cry pierced the air behind her. For just an instant, she hesitated and looked back. Jamie had taken out the white wolf. The beast was on his side, and she knew the dark shadow spreading on his coat was blood.</p><p>Jamie stood over his fallen prey, with his big body heaving. The wolf\u2019s eyes\u2014that same, piercing green\u2014were on her.</p><p>I won\u2019t let them hurt you. His words whispered through her mind.</p><p>As if she needed his protection. Her chin lifted. She\u2019d walk back into the bar. Find another, non-drugged man to sample, and Jamie could fight his little blood battles.</p><p>A familiar scent teased her nose. Iona\u2019s body stiffened.</p><p>Then a rumble of thunder broke the air. Jamie\u2014his wolf\u2014staggered back. More thunder rumbled. No, not thunder, a gunshot. Jamie hit the ground.</p><p>She was running toward him before she\u2019d even realized what was happening. The other wolves had scattered back, but when they saw her rushing forward, the grey beast tossed his head and howled.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>And...Iona inhaled deeply, wondering about that other heavy, too thick scent in the air. A scent that was metallic, like...</p><p>Jamie was shifting before her. She\u2019d never seen a wolf shift so quickly. Except for one time when her vamp coven had attacked invading wolves with silver. Silver could always force a fast change for a werewolf.</p><p>The beast was gone. On the ground, Jamie sprawled as a man. Bullet holes were in his chest. Her eyesight was perfect in the dark, probably even better than his, and Iona saw that he appeared to be bleeding in rivulets of silver.</p><p>Liquid silver? Was that the weapon of choice against werewolves these days?</p><p>Jamie\u2019s claws drove into his own chest, and he yanked out a handful of silver. A brutal move that had the breath freezing in her lungs. Then he did it again, to the other bullet hole.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t...get it all...\u201d His voice was barely human. \u201cLiquid...in my blood...\u201d</p><p>Yes, it would be. Unlike a solid silver bullet, the liquid silver would pour through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll...die...\u201d</p><p>She realized that his head was in her lap. Iona didn\u2019t remember sliding her knees under him. Why had she even come to check on him? The shooter could still be out there. The shooter could come for her.</p><p>She should run. Leave. Hunt.</p><p>Not lean over him and brush the hair from his forehead, but, sure enough, she saw her own trembling fingers sliding thought that thick, dark hair.</p><p>What is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cIf I die...\u201d It certainly looked like the wolf was close to death. Jamie growled, then managed, \u201cSo...do you...\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at him. She knew what others said about her. She was evil. Wicked. Without a soul.</p><p>And maybe some of those stories were true. But in this one instance...</p><p>Iona brushed her lips over his. A soft kiss. Gentle. Their first kiss.</p><p>It seemed strange to have it here, with blood around them.</p><p>It seemed strange to have the kiss after she\u2019d already taken his blood.</p><p>But maybe it was fitting.</p><p>The kiss was light, but she enjoyed the taste of his lips almost as much as she\u2019d enjoyed his blood.</p><p>Perhaps the werewolf could prove to be addictive to her.</p><p>And, maybe, she\u2019d show him just how addictive she could be.</p><p>Her mouth lifted from his, a few inches. \u201cWhat makes you think...\u201d Iona asked him quietly, \u201cthat I would let you die by any hand other than my own?\u201d</p><p>Then she lifted her hand. Brought it to her mouth. Sliced the flesh with her teeth, then offered her wrist to him.</p><p>When he drank, she understood that Jamie wasn\u2019t like the others. For some reason, he\u2019d touched a part of her that she\u2019d buried deep inside. The human part. The part that wouldn\u2019t let a man die before her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not a man who\u2019d saved her. Who\u2019d tried to protect her.</p><p>I won\u2019t let them hurt you.</p><p>Funny. No one had ever tried to protect her. Not even her father. No, he\u2019d been the one to tie her to the stake on her twenty-fifth birthday. The day he\u2019d realized she wasn\u2019t aging as she should.</p> <p>He\u2019d tied her to the stake and carried the torch that had started the blaze around her. She\u2019d screamed and begged him to stop. He hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Too bad for him, she\u2019d been strong enough to break free of the bonds that held her. Burned, savaged, she\u2019d escaped.</p><p>Later, she\u2019d gone back for him.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand lifted and locked around her wrist as he took her blood. As far as she knew, only one other werewolf had ever tasted her blood.</p><p>That was the werewolf who\u2019d locked her in that horrible house. Made her a prisoner in her own body.</p> <p>The same werewolf that had been there tonight because, right before the first bullet had slammed into Jamie, she\u2019d caught Latham\u2019s scent.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to the woods once more. The scent was gone now, but it didn\u2019t matter. Latham knew she was free\u2014and she, well, she knew that he\u2019d soon be one very dead wolf.</p><p>The fool had freed her. Latham raced through the woods, his packmates close to his sides. They were bleeding, and he knew that Jamie would track the scent of the blood.</p><p>Jamie thought he was such a fine tracker.</p><p>They burst from the woods. Two black SUVs were waiting for him. Latham rushed into the first SUV, the gun a heavy weight in his gloved hand. The silver bullets should have taken out his rival, but Latham had missed Jamie\u2019s heart because he\u2019d been distracted.</p><p>By her.</p> <p>The witch was waiting for him in the SUV. Unlike the other werewolves, Latham hadn\u2019t transformed into his wolf form.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d The witch asked. Brian Hennessey didn\u2019t look much like a witch. Tall, thin, with small, black glasses perched on his nose, the guy appeared to be a harmless human.</p><p>Brian was far from harmless.</p><p>The other werewolves were shifting. The others who\u2019d survived anyway\u2014two packmates wouldn\u2019t be escaping with him.</p><p>Should have gone in stronger.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jamie is still alive,\u201d Latham bit out. \u201cBecause he wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>Latham knew that once Jamie was out of the picture, the remains of his pack would be easy pickings. Jamie was the strength of that pack. Without him, they\u2019d crumble to nothing.</p><p>He wanted them to crumble. Those fools deserved to crumble.</p> <p>\u201cMore wolves?\u201d Brian shook his head and waved for the driver to get them out of there. \u201cI would have thought you\u2019d be able to take them\u2014\u201d</p><p>Latham grabbed his arm and let his claws rip into Brian\u2019s flesh. \u201cMost witches can see into the future.\u201d</p><p>No fear flickered in Brian\u2019s gaze. \u201cMost witches didn\u2019t nearly burn out their power by locking up a born vampire queen for you.\u201d</p><p>His claws dug deeper. \u201cShe\u2019s not locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she is. I put that bitch in her cell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Latham snarled at him as the rage flared hotter within him. \u201cHe got her out.\u201d In-fucking-possible. Or it should have been.</p><p>Brian paled. \u201cIona...is free?\u201d Ah, now the fear was there.</p><p>The witch was right to be afraid. Iona knew Brian had been the one to cast the spell that bound her.</p><p>She\u2019d be gunning for him, too.</p><p>But Iona would have to get in line. Latham was ready to rip the witch\u2019s head right off. \u201cYou said I was the only one who\u2019d be able to get her out.\u201d Only he hadn\u2019t wanted her out. She just would have fought him then. Tried to take his head. So he\u2019d kept her locked up, and every few months, he\u2019d gone in and drained blood from her.</p><p>Iona\u2019s blood was pure power. It gave him the strength of a werewolf\u2014of five werewolves in fully shifted form\u2014but let him keep the body of a man at all times. Why shift? Thanks to her blood, he always had more than enough strength to break his enemies.</p><p>\u201cI-I told you...as a werewolf alpha, you\u2019d be able to bind her body.\u201d The scent of Brian\u2019s sweat and fear filled the interior of the vehicle. \u201cAnd if a werewolf alpha locked her body, then only a werewolf alpha could\u2014could free her.\u201d</p><p>Snarling, Latham put his claws at Brian\u2019s throat. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that any werewolf alpha would do the trick! I thought I was the only one! Just me!\u201d</p><p>More sweat. More fear. But Brian shook his head. \u201cI never said you were the only one who could free her.\u201d</p><p>That information would have been important before then. Yet even as the rage pulsed in his blood, Latham smiled at the witch.</p><p>Brian\u2019s fear deepened. Ah, the witch knew him well.</p><p>\u201cYour power\u2019s nearly out,\u201d Latham said, repeating what Brian had told him. The witch would be regretting those words. \u201cYou can\u2019t see the future, and that\u2019s a pity. If you\u2019d seen it, maybe you could have avoided\u2014\u201d</p><p>Latham sliced his claws right across Brian\u2019s throat. \u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>Then he shoved open the door and tossed the witch\u2019s body into the road.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>The cars had changed. Some were smaller. Some were far bigger. They had computers inside of them. Small screens with maps that showed any area with a touch of a button.</p><p>Iona touched lots of buttons.</p><p>The radio had what seemed like a thousand channels. The music was crazy. Wonderful. Faster, harder than she remembered.</p><p>And the seat beneath her ass? It...warmed.</p><p>She liked that.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, they attacked outside of the Shore Tavern,\u201d Jamie said, speaking into his little phone.</p><p>Iona frowned at the phone. The last time she\u2019d seen a phone in a car, the thing had been huge\u2014and in some black bag that plugged into the cigarette lighter. The phone in Jamie\u2019s hand was just a few inches long and so incredibly thin.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any buttons on it. Jamie just touched its screen and things happened.</p><p>She liked that, too. She\u2019d have to get one of those phones, soon. Gadgets had always intrigued her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on the way. Stay on guard, Sean,\u201d Jamie ordered and ended the call.</p><p>Ah...yes. Her turn. Iona snatched the phone from him. She swiped her fingers over the screen. Music blared. The phone...flashed, as if she\u2019d taken a picture, and then some kind of game with little birds popped up and\u2014</p><p>Jamie pulled the phone away from her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She wanted that phone back. But her fingers clenched in her lap. She\u2019d always been taught...don\u2019t let others know what you need. \u201cI\u2019m playing catch-up. A lot can happen in fifteen years, you know.\u201d</p><p>And it had been fifteen years. Before she\u2019d headed to the bar for a bite, she\u2019d broken into a store and found herself new clothes. After picking up the clothing, it had been time to grab a newspaper in town. As soon as she\u2019d held the paper in her hand, she\u2019d realized all that she\u2019d lost. The date had been big and bold and painful to see. She\u2019d clutched that paper and wanted to rip and tear into Latham.</p><p>He\u2019d taken fifteen years of her life away. Fifteen years.</p><p>In return, she\u2019d take forever from him.</p><p>Jamie was quiet for a moment, as if processing her words, then he said, \u201cSo you just...slept, that whole\u2014\u201d</p><p>Iona turned away from him and gazed out at the blur of darkness beyond her window. \u201cI told you already, I wasn\u2019t asleep.\u201d If only.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I was there. Your body wasn\u2019t moving. Hell, when I first saw you, I thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to die. For so long.</p><p>Iona pulled in a steadying breath and said, \u201cMy body was paralyzed.\u201d That was how it had felt. She hadn\u2019t been able to move a muscle. Not one single muscle.</p><p>Her hands shook at the memory.</p><p>Kill him. A whisper that came from inside of her..</p><p>During that long, long time...Iona had begun to hear voices. She\u2019d lost her sanity, she knew it. After so many years of being frozen, hell, just talking with Jamie still felt strange to her.</p><p>\u201cYour body...\u201d He repeated in that faint brogue that Iona wouldn\u2019t admit she rather enjoyed hearing. \u201cBut...your mind?\u201d</p><p>Smart wolf. Maybe he was picking up on the things that she said and the things that she didn\u2019t say. \u201cI could hear everything for years. Could smell. Could feel the bed beneath me.\u201d For at least the first five years. Was it stupid that she\u2019d been counting the days then? \u201cI heard the bugs and the rats. I heard the crash of the waves and the whisper of footsteps.\u201d Latham had kept a guard on her. Always.</p><p>A guard that...Iona\u2019s head whipped toward him. \u201cDid you kill the guard? The one who smelled of whiskey and cigars?\u201d The odor of his cheap cigars had burned into her over the years.</p><p>A grim nod.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t control her smile. \u201cGood.\u201d One less person to hunt and torture. And she was going to kill. The thought of killing had sustained her until her mind had finally broken.</p><p>Broken...and slid into the dark.</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>The guard? He\u2019d liked to touch her. Touching a corpse. What a sick freak. He\u2019d also liked to burn her with his cigars. Good thing her kind didn\u2019t scar. \u201cDid he suffer before he died?\u201d Iona asked instead of answering him.</p><p>\u201cNo. The death was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d Her little claws drummed on the leather inside the vehicle. \u201cI would\u2019ve liked taking my time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did hurt you.\u201d Anger roughened his voice.</p><p>And caused her to glance at him with surprise. \u201cWolf, you sound as if you actually care.\u201d A lie, of course, but Iona could admit\u2014to herself\u2014that it would be nice, to have one person who cared.</p><p>The vampire coven she\u2019d so carefully created over the years hadn\u2019t cared. The ones she\u2019d fought desperately to protect. They. Hadn\u2019t. Cared.</p><p>They\u2019d left her to wither away.</p><p>She\u2019d been so hungry at first. Starving for just a few drops of blood. She wanted to gorge herself on blood now because that hunger was still eating away at her.</p><p>But...</p><p>But the only blood she seemed to want was Jamie\u2019s. Can\u2019t eat him. Not until I find out what he\u2019s done to me.</p><p>She would find out, soon enough.</p><p>\u201cIf it makes you feel better,\u201d he told her, the words halting, \u201cI killed the five other guards who tried to keep me from you. No one who left you in that house is alive.\u201d</p><p>But there were others still alive. Her coven. They might not have been at that house, but they\u2019d left her there just the same.</p><p>Before she could speak, the vehicle screeched to a sudden stop. Iona jerked forward even as the seatbelt tightened around her and cut into her shoulder. \u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d Jamie snapped out as he jumped from the car.</p><p>She caught the scent, too. Heavy. Fresh.</p><p>Iona hurried out after him. They were on an old, twisting highway. Jamie had kept the driver\u2019s side window down as he drove, the better to follow the \u201cscent\u201d of their attackers, and it sure looked like his nose had led him to their prey.</p><p>He stood over a broken body, and the scent of blood called to her.</p><p>Then she saw the prey on the ground\u2014saw exactly who he was\u2014and fury rolled within her.</p><p>Brian. The witch who had imprisoned her. His throat had been slit, from ear to ear, and blood pooled beneath him.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been so easy for you,\u201d she snapped, the rage clawing inside of her, raking and ripping open her guts. He\u2019d been on her list. Hunting him, killing him\u2014that promise had gotten her through so many days and nights. To see him like this...</p><p>\u201cThose are the claw marks left from a werewolf attack,\u201d Jamie said as he bent to better study the body. He shook his head. \u201cGuess Latham got pissed at his witch.\u201d</p><p>Surprise froze her breath. \u201cYou knew Brian?\u201d</p><p>After the briefest of hesitations, Jamie gave a slow nod, but then said, \u201cNever met him personally, but most paranormals out West, yeah, we knew of him.\u201d He glanced up at her. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who imprisoned the Blood Queen. He kinda got infamous for that bit.\u201d</p><p>Blood Queen.</p><p>The name still hurt, not that she\u2019d let him see her pain. Her father\u2019s men had given her that name. When she\u2019d escaped the fire, her father had sent mercenaries\u2014the most vicious he could find\u2014to kill her.</p><p>She\u2019d been covered in their blood when she went to destroy dear old dad.</p><p>\u201cGuess Latham turned on the witch.\u201d Jamie closed the man\u2019s eyes. Brian\u2019s blue eyes had been wide open.</p><p>Hope you are seeing hell.</p><p>Jamie stared down at the witch. \u201cAfter the guy lost his powers, I\u2019m surprised Latham kept him around for this long.\u201d</p><p>Now that was news. Brian had lost his powers? Good.</p><p>Jamie rose to his feet. His nostrils flared as he sniffed, probably trying to catch Latham\u2019s scent.</p><p>Iona grabbed his arm before he could head back to the car. \u201cHow did Brian lose his powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy caging you.\u201d His hand lifted. Stroked lightly down her cheek. Heat bloomed within her belly, but Iona refused to let her reaction show.</p><p>Fifteen years.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to cage a queen.\u201d His hand curled under her chin. \u201cWant to tell me how he did it?\u201d</p><p>She remembered screams. Pain. An agony that she\u2019d thought would never end then\u2014can\u2019t move. Help! \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust him. There was no point in telling Jamie her dark secrets. Not then.</p><p>I must get more blood. Iona knew she had to get her strength back to her maximum level. So she straightened her shoulders, took a long look at the wolf and said, \u201cThis is where we part ways.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie stared at her like she was crazy. I so am. She knew her own weakness. Fury was boiling inside of her right then, and she was going to let that fury out. Jamie needed to be away from her when the rage broke free. I should have been the one to kill Brian.</p><p>\u201cGet back into the car, and just drive away,\u201d she told Jamie, fighting to keep her voice steady. Iona figured he deserved the warning to get the hell away from her.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s jaw clenched even as his hand dropped. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this. You need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone or anything.\u201d She stepped back. Glanced down at Brian\u2019s body. He certainly looked dead.</p><p>But then, according to Jamie, she\u2019d appeared dead, too.</p><p>Let\u2019s make sure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Latham,\u201d Iona told him as she tossed a quick glance back at Jamie\u2019s tense face. \u201cHe\u2019s next on my list.\u201d Latham wouldn\u2019t escape their battle alive. \u201cSo consider whatever little war that you had with him, well, consider it over.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t...\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her hands. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know. I\u2019m not just a vampire.\u201d If she had been, then Brian would have never been able to bind her. Kill her, yes, but a binding wasn\u2019t the type of magic that would normally work on vampires.</p><p>Binding. That was what he\u2019d done. Not just a curse or a spell. He\u2019d performed a ritual binding on her. One witch...</p><p>To another.</p><p>Flames began to flicker above her palms. Not touching her skin, never that, but spinning, burning, right above her flesh. \u201cYou need to leave now,\u201d she told Jamie.</p><p>This time, he backed the hell up.</p><p>Smart man.</p> <p>She stood near Brian\u2019s body. Her father had known what she was so long ago. That was why he had tried to burn her. If you wanted to destroy a witch, truly destroy her, then you had to use fire.</p><p>Iona drew back her hand and sent flames rushing right at Brian\u2019s body. \u201cBurn,\u201d she whispered as the fire greedily leapt onto his flesh. \u201cBurn.\u201d</p><p>One down. One to go.</p><p>She was everything he\u2019d hoped that she would be...and so much fucking more.</p><p>Jamie stalked behind Iona, being careful to keep a safe distance between them. He was downwind of her, but with her enhanced vampire senses, he was still worried she\u2019d catch his scent.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her aware of him, not yet.</p><p>She\u2019d stirred fire.</p><p>Vampires didn\u2019t control fire. As a rule, they were just bloodsuckers. Sure, they could be super strong, they could live for freaking ever\u2014provided they didn\u2019t get staked or lose their heads to a werewolf\u2019s claws\u2014but they didn\u2019t stir fire from nothing.</p> <p>Only witches could do that.</p><p>The stories had been right about that point, too. Iona wasn\u2019t just a Born Vampire. She was a very, very powerful witch.</p><p>No wonder she\u2019d been locked up. Caged near the water so the energy from the ocean would work to reinforce the spell. She might just be the most dangerous woman he\u2019d ever met.</p><p>That fact only made him want her more.</p><p>Perfect. In so many ways. And Jamie wasn\u2019t about to let her go. Not when he\u2019d risked so much to find her.</p><p>Not when he\u2019d had to make his own deal with the devil to claim her.</p><p>So now...yeah, okay, probably not his finest moment, but he was following her through the dark. Keeping his gaze on her as she slipped through the shadows.</p><p>Of course, Jamie knew what she was doing. Hunting. Going for another taste of blood.</p><p>Not gonna work, baby. You\u2019re stuck with me. Did he feel guilty about that? No. These days, he couldn\u2019t afford to feel guilty about anything and\u2014</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>Jamie hurried forward as his heart raced in his chest. It had only been a moment and\u2014</p><p>He was tossed against the side of a dumpster.</p><p>\u201cFollowing me? Really? What must I do?\u201d Iona demanded as she put her hands on her hips. \u201cRip off your head in order to make you stop?\u201d</p><p>Taking his time, he stood back up. She\u2019d tossed him about ten feet. Jamie made a show of brushing dirt off his jeans and shirt. Mostly to give himself time to think, then he replied, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid to rip off my head. Part of you already knows that I\u2019ve told you the truth.\u201d He headed toward her, not trying to keep his footsteps quiet any longer as his feet crunched over the gravel. \u201cAnd if you kill me, you know that you\u2019ll be killing yourself.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like she hissed at him. He almost smiled but then\u2014then he blinked and Iona was in front of him. She\u2019d closed the distance herself, effortlessly. A distance of ten feet, in less than a second\u2019s time. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight.\u201d She pushed up on her toes. Stabbed a finger into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything. Or anyone.\u201d</p><p>Right. She probably wasn\u2019t.</p><p>And, damn, she was sexy. His gaze dropped to her mouth. Her lips had been the softest that he\u2019d ever felt. He could still taste her on his tongue. The sweetness had been a surprise. From her, he\u2019d expected spice.</p><p>\u201cWhy...why are you looking at me like that?\u201d Iona asked as her gaze searched his.</p><p>He could tell her the truth. \u201cBecause I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Her poking finger jerked back as if she\u2019d been burned. \u201cYou mean that you want to take more of my blood. So you can get stronger and so you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her shoulders and pulled her close. Her body brushed against his. Soft. He loved the way she felt. \u201cI mean I want your lips beneath mine. I want to taste you. I want to savor you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cYour brogue is...thicker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it gets that way when I\u2019m turned on.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth,\u201d he said again, no longer willing to fight the desire he felt for her. Why bother? They were locked together, even if she didn\u2019t realize it.</p><p>He was more than ready to start enjoying the perks of the deal.</p><p>For an instant, Jamie was sure he saw the flicker of an answering desire in her golden gaze. But then her chin rose as she said, \u201cAnd I want blood.\u201d</p><p>The implied not yours was clear as she pulled away from him. As he watched her, Iona turned on her heel and headed toward the faint sound of music that drifted in the air.</p><p>Yes, she was heading toward big, bad bar number two in the town of Shade. So predictable.</p><p>In fact, her move was so incredibly predictable that he\u2019d already told Sean they\u2019d be coming that way. When Jamie had gone hunting for Iona earlier that night, he and Sean had separated. One bar for each man.</p><p>Jamie had gotten lucky. He\u2019d found Iona at the Shore Tavern.</p><p>But when he\u2019d talked to Sean on the phone, he\u2019d told the other wolf that he\u2019d be coming to meet him. I knew she\u2019d want to try tasting someone else.</p><p>He knew, but he didn\u2019t like it. In fact, it made him feel...jealous?</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>It should have been impossible. Yet Jamie found himself hurrying to keep pace with her. And, moments later, when Iona pushed open the door to the bar, when the bouncer gave her a welcoming smile, and all eyes seemed to greedily stroke her body, Jamie\u2019s beast gave a growl.</p><p>Back the hell off.</p><p>The music was pumping. Loud and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe music has changed.\u201d Iona tilted her head as she listened to the pounding beat. \u201cI think...I like it better now.\u201d</p><p>He kept forgetting she\u2019d missed so much in the last fifteen years.</p><p>Her hips began to sway. The men began to close in.</p><p>Hell. He put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>Those men backed up. Damn straight. If they\u2019d come closer, he might have even flashed fang.</p><p>\u201cIt will be harder to find good prey with you at my side.\u201d Her voice was low and husky and her hips were still rocking.</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I don\u2019t plan on backing off.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to realize the gigantic threat that hung over her. Latham could attack, at any time. Yes, she was strong. But so was Latham. And if he caught her off-guard... \u201cI don\u2019t want Latham putting you under again.\u201d</p><p>Her hips stopped rocking. She glanced at him. Anger had melted the gold in her eyes so that her gaze just burned. \u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Then, with a toss of her head, so queen-like that Jamie had to smile\u2014he\u2019d started to rather like that touch of haughtiness\u2014she sauntered across the bar.</p><p>It took him about ten seconds too long to realize that she\u2019d already picked her out prey.</p><p>By then, Iona had her hand on the chest of her would-be victim. A familiar victim. The bar was behind Sean, trapping the guy as he stood right in front of Iona.</p><p>She chose my first-in-command? Fuck. Jamie stalked toward them. He\u2019d just closed in when he heard\u2014</p><p>\u201cI think this could be fun,\u201d Iona murmured as she leaned toward Sean.</p><p>Sean\u2019s shocked gaze darted to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t doing this,\u201d Jamie snapped. He grabbed her arm. For some reason, he didn\u2019t want her touching the other werewolf. He glared down at Iona. \u201cI already told you, it isn\u2019t going to work. You can\u2019t take anyone else\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you...I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>She was making him want to howl. And making him want to toss her over his shoulder and carry her away from Sean. Away from all the other men there.</p><p>Her head turned as she studied Sean. \u201cMaybe one werewolf will be as good as another, and at least with him, I\u2019ll be sure he isn\u2019t on drugs.\u201d Her gaze slid back to Jamie. \u201cI\u2019m betting you run a tight ship when it comes to that.\u201d</p><p>He did. Drugs would make his wolves weak. He didn\u2019t allow for weakness. Weakness would just get them killed.</p><p>\u201cThis way, I don\u2019t have to kill any humans...yet.\u201d She offered first Jamie, then Sean a smile that flashed her sharp little teeth. Then her focus centered on Sean as she said, \u201cSo point me toward a private room, and let\u2019s just see how you taste, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Women liked Sean, they sure fell into his bed easily enough. Maybe it was because Sean appeared easy-going, and often...normal. A big bonus for a guy who was actually paranormal. Sean was a perfect chameleon. He could fit in with just about anyone, anywhere. Unlike Jamie, he\u2019d dropped his Irish years ago, and, in fact, he could fake other accents\u2014depending on where he was and who he wanted to fool\u2014almost instantly.</p><p>Jamie fisted his hands and fought to hold on to his control.</p><p>Iona appeared determined. And a little too satisfied with her drinking scheme.</p><p>The woman wasn\u2019t stopping. Not until she\u2019d tried to drink from someone else. He could fight her, but he knew Iona wouldn\u2019t give up. \u201cOne sip,\u201d Jamie said, his voice clipped. Just one. That would be all she\u2019d need to find out if the blood worked for her.</p><p>And if it does work? He couldn\u2019t think about that possibility right then. The witch had been adamant. The wolf that woke her would be the wolf that controlled her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think Brian had been lying, but since the witch was dead, it wasn\u2019t like he could find out for certain.</p><p>And I have to make sure she doesn\u2019t find out about my deal with Brian. Because if she did...</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a room in the back.\u201d Sean inclined his head toward a dark, narrow hallway. \u201cRight through there.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that just fantastic.</p><p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d Iona invited him with a wave of her hand.</p><p>But Sean wasn\u2019t an idiot. He glanced at Jamie, waiting to see what his alpha wanted.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands off her,\u201d Jamie ordered him, voice lethal. \u201cShe gets one taste\u2014one.\u201d</p><p>Sean gave a nod. As a rule, werewolves weren\u2019t up for being vamp prey. Only this wasn\u2019t a typical situation.</p><p>Iona wasn\u2019t your average vamp.</p><p>Sean headed down the hallway. Iona didn\u2019t move, and Jamie was far too conscious of her body near his. Her eyes narrowed as she studied him, then Iona crooked her finger, inviting him closer. His head bent toward her, the move automatic. She rose onto her toes. Her lips brushed against his ear as she said, \u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to feed from prey.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head. Made sure their eyes met. \u201cIn order to touch you, he needs my permission.\u201d Because, dammit, Jamie had already started to think of her as\u2014</p><p>Mine.</p><p>\u201cWerewolves...always the same.\u201d Iona sighed as she eased away from him. \u201cYou think that you can control everyone and everything around you.\u201d She sauntered toward that dark hallway.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The growl slipped from him.</p><p>Iona looked back at Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t control everything. If I could, there\u2019d be more than six members of my pack still alive.\u201d He stalked to her, aggressive, deliberately so. \u201cIf I could control everything, my family would be alive. I wouldn\u2019t have come home to find my mother and father dead, their bodies savaged. Latham wouldn\u2019t have killed them.\u201d His parents had come to this country because they\u2019d wanted a fresh start. They\u2019d brought their pack over with them. Everyone had been so hopeful, at first.</p><p>What could have been sympathy or maybe even pity flashed in her stare. That faint emotion just stirred up his anger even more. Pity was the last thing he wanted from her.</p><p>His body brushed against hers. \u201cAnd if I could control everything,\u201d his voice was for her alone, \u201cthen I\u2019d already have gotten you, naked, under me, and I wouldn\u2019t be so wild with lust that I want to rip apart my own best friend...because you\u2019re about to put your mouth on him.\u201d</p><p>The words surprised him with their brutal truth. The lust he felt for her...it was just growing. Stronger and stronger. Almost like he was under some kind of spell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019s part witch. Maybe I am under her spell.</p><p>Under, and falling fast.</p><p>\u201cOne taste,\u201d he told her, \u201cbut you\u2019re going to regret it.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze searched his. \u201cThere are few things I regret.\u201d</p><p>He could believe that.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t be one of them.\u201d Then she turned, head high, back straight, and marched to the door at the far end of the hall.</p><p>He didn\u2019t follow her. He didn\u2019t want to see her with Sean. \u201cYou\u2019ll be coming back,\u201d Jamie said, the words drifting after her.</p><p>And they were a promise. Iona was about to realize that no other man would ever do for her again.</p> <p>Only me, baby. Only me.</p><p>He\u2019d already realized that no other woman would satisfy him.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Her fangs had stretched and sharpened as she prepared for the bite. Iona had locked the door behind her\u2014locked Jamie out\u2014and now she and Sean were alone together in the small storage room.</p><p>\u201cSo...how does this work?\u201d He asked her with a nervous glance at her fangs.</p><p>She almost rolled her eyes. Really? How did he think it was going to work? \u201cThe usual way. I bite you. I drink. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d</p> <p>Sean was nearly as big as Jamie. His shoulders weren\u2019t quite as broad, his muscles not as big. He was probably a few inches shorter than the alpha wolf, too.</p><p>But Sean was...handsome. His features were even and smooth and had no doubt drawn plenty of female attention over the years.</p><p>Iona realized that she preferred the rough danger of Jamie\u2019s hard face. Story of her very, very long life. The bad boys often drew her in.</p><p>Then, frequently, they\u2019d tried to kill her.</p><p>So she\u2019d had to kill them.</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d Iona ordered.</p><p>But Sean shook his head and shoved his hands behind his back. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not supposed to touch you!\u201d</p><p>For the love of...She grabbed his arm and jerked up his hand. Then she lifted his wrist to her mouth. \u201cCalm down.\u201d She could probably try to soothe him. She\u2019d always been good at lulling her prey, when she wanted. Seduce with a look. Kill with a bite.</p> <p>Been there, done that.</p><p>So many times that it rather bored her now.</p><p>But, yes, if she wanted, Iona could seduce just about anyone.</p><p>Only she didn\u2019t want to seduce Sean. She just wanted to find out what his blood would do to her. Don\u2019t burn me, don\u2019t. Because if she was stuck with only taking from Jamie, then she\u2019d be tied to him.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Iona parted her lips. Her fangs pressed into Sean\u2019s skin, and just like that, with one quick press of her teeth, his blood flowed onto her tongue.</p><p>Sean gave a little moan. \u201cOh, shit, no one said it would feel good.\u201d For the first time, she heard the whisper of an Irish accent in his words.</p><p>Only...his blood wasn\u2019t \u201cfeeling good\u201d to her. It felt horrible. His blood tasted rancid, and she was already yanking her mouth away from him and backing up even as her body started to shake and spasm.</p><p>\u201cIona?\u201d Sean called her name as he came toward her. \u201cIona!\u201d</p><p>The door burst in, heaving right off its hinges. Jamie stood in the doorway. His gaze swept around the room, from Sean\u2014and his outstretched hand\u2014to Iona.</p><p>When did I curl up on the floor?</p><p>She didn\u2019t curl. She didn\u2019t hide.</p><p>I do when I realize my choices are gone.</p><p>Because Sean\u2019s blood tasted just like the human\u2019s, and instead of strengthening her, it had made her feel even weaker.</p><p>Now the hunger was ripping through her insides. Hollowing her out.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to touch her,\u201d Jamie tossed Sean back against the wall. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the touching that mattered. It was the blood. Blood she couldn\u2019t drink.</p><p>\u201cIona?\u201d Now Jamie was the one calling her name.</p><p>She forced her head to lift. Made her body rise. She was still shaking, but those trembles couldn\u2019t be helped because they came from the hunger and the weakness that filled her veins.</p><p>Oh, how the mighty have fallen. So many would laugh to see her brought so low.</p><p>Jamie wasn\u2019t laughing. He was staring at her with eyes that saw far too much. \u201cGet out of here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cYank the door back up after you, Sean, and get the hell out,\u201d he said, never looking away from her.</p><p>Sean hurried to comply.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t touch her. Didn\u2019t move another inch. Not until the door was partially up, giving them a bit of privacy, and Sean was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d known the truth. Maybe she had, too. She\u2019d just been desperate.</p><p>\u201cIt makes you sick, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He asked. \u201cWhen you take blood from others.\u201d</p><p>Yes. A vampire who could only bite one man? Talk about falling far from her perch of power. She wasn\u2019t exactly the big terror of the town any longer.</p><p>The faint lines deepened near Jamie\u2019s mouth. \u201cI want you to bite me. Take my blood...I don\u2019t care. I can give you what you want, always.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. But right then, she just didn\u2019t have the energy or the control to make him understand.</p><p>Fifteen years. For all intents, she\u2019d been dead then. Even if her mind had been crying out in agony.</p><p>Now that she was free, Iona wanted to live.</p><p>She was about to break apart because she just wanted to let go\u2014to lose her control and take the blood that he offered.</p><p>But with vampires, when control broke and blood was involved...</p><p>There was a reason she\u2019d been trying to push her vampire coven away from taking blood from live sources. She\u2019d seen the carnage that came from centuries of bloodlust and violence.</p><p>When you took straight from a source, when your control shattered, the lust wouldn\u2019t just be for blood.</p><p>\u201cBlood and sex,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s gaze burned into hers. There was no fear or revulsion or even a hint of hesitation in his eyes. There were just answering hunger. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He knew what he was getting with her. No secrets there. And she needed to feel alive again. She\u2019d gone too long in that cold darkness. There would be no holding back for her. More blood.</p><p>She reached for him. Sank her teeth into his throat.</p><p>His blood was perfect on her tongue. Delicious. Addictive. Like a mix of wine and chocolate.</p><p>His body brushed against hers.</p><p>Pleasure. Close. So very, very close.</p><p>Her nipples were tight. Her sex already growing moist. Iona\u2019s control was fracturing. She could feel the ripples as they shook through her body.</p><p>His hands locked around her wrists. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told her, the words rumbling against her as her tongue licked lightly at his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he did.</p><p>They were about to find out.</p><p>In the next instant, he\u2019d lifted her up. Took two fast steps, and then her back shoved against the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhen you bite me,\u201d his words were a dark rumble that had her sex clenching, \u201cI want to fuck.\u201d</p><p>Not an unusual reaction. The bite did something to prey. Gave them a boost of pleasure. Made them want more.</p><p>The vampire could usually control the bite, especially a vampire as old as she was. Could give pleasure or pain.</p><p>Her fangs scored lightly over his flesh. He growled. With this bite, she wanted to give pleasure.</p><p>His fingers were on her stomach now, under her shirt. His hands were warm and strong and they were sliding up, up, and cupping her breasts. Her breath hissed out as her nipples pebbled beneath his touch. She arched against him, wanting more.</p><p>His blood had already made her stronger. So now she wasn\u2019t just drinking from him. She was kissing. Licking. Learning what the werewolf liked.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he muttered as he lifted her even higher. Strong wolf.</p><p>Then he yanked away her top and put his mouth on her breast. He used his teeth to lightly rasp over her sensitive flesh. Her sex ached. So long...</p><p>Iona wrapped her legs around him even as he kissed and sucked her breast. She pushed her hips against him. He was aroused. No mistaking that hard bulge that shoved back against her.</p><p>Pity his jeans were in the way.</p><p>Not for long.</p><p>This time, she was the one to jerk open his jeans. To pull the zipper down and slid her fingers past the denim. She found him, long, thick, hot, pushing eagerly toward her.</p><p>Her tongue slid over the edge of her left fang. She\u2019d had his blood. Now she just wanted him.</p><p>His rough breaths filled her ears. Then she heard the sound of a frantic heartbeat. His? Hers? Maybe both. Racing too fast.</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d Her demand. \u201cNow.\u201d She didn\u2019t want foreplay that lasted for hours. That could come another time. Right then, she was already clawing at his back. Pushing against him as her control shattered around her. She wanted him inside of her.</p><p>Wanted the pleasure to erupt and sweep everything else away.</p><p>Then his hands were between their bodies. He had her jeans open, and she had to lower her legs, just long enough to kick out of her heels and jeans. She wasn\u2019t wearing any underwear, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about\u2014</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d His hand was between her legs. Pushing into her sex and her head tipped back because she liked the sensation of his fingers sliding in her. Her body was humming, so tuned up that she knew the first climax would hit her soon.</p><p>His thumb pushed over her clit.</p><p>The climax hit.</p><p>She grabbed for his broad shoulders as the release blasted through her. Even as her sex contracted, he was there. Not with those long, broad fingers anymore, but with the heavy length of his cock. Driving into her. Plunging deep.</p><p>His neck was inches from her mouth. She had to taste him again. Bloodlust, physical lust, they blurred in her mind and her control fell to the ground. There was no thought. Only need. Hunger that couldn\u2019t be satisfied.</p><p>He pushed into her, not easy or gentle, and she wanted him that way. His hands were around her hips, forcing her into the air so that he supported her body and he drove into her, again and again with thrusts that stole her breath and made her body shudder.</p><p>She clenched her sex around him, squeezing tight.</p><p>\u201cIona...so good...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d show him better than good. She let the bite linger, knowing it would bring more pleasure.</p><p>Pleasure. It was what they both wanted. Craved.</p><p>He pulled her away from the wall. Wrapped his arms around her so that he held her fully. And his hips still pumped into her. Wolves...so powerful.</p><p>Another climax hit her, and this one had her crying out as she lifted her mouth from his flesh. Her breath was choked and the pleasure...it was so intense that it almost hurt.</p><p>Her whole body was electrified with feeling. So sensitive that every move of his flesh against hers had Iona tensing.</p><p>Then he shoved boxes off a table top. Put her down over it. Her legs dangled in the air.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t done,\u201d Jamie promised, his voice so dark and deep.</p><p>She wanted to smile. Couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d taken her legs. Hooked them over his shoulders so that she was wide open to him. He took her now, hard and wild, and it was exactly what she wanted. The rush of sensation just wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Iona didn\u2019t care that his claws were out. That they\u2019d slashed across the top of the table. She didn\u2019t care that his eyes glowed or that his cheeks had hollowed, signaling the presence of his beast.</p><p>She liked the wildness. Wanted it.</p><p>His head lifted. She saw the flash of his fangs. Fangs that were even sharper than her own.</p><p>Blood and sex\u2014that wasn\u2019t just a combination that worked for vampires.</p><p>She turned her head to the side, offering herself to him. Only fair...she\u2019d had her turn.</p><p>He took the spot where her neck curved into her shoulder. His lips closed over the flesh. His teeth pressed lightly into her. It didn\u2019t feel like he was drinking from her though.</p><p>It felt as if he were...claiming her.</p><p>Then he stiffened against her. The hot splash of his release filled her and sent more waves of pleasure pulsing through Iona\u2019s body. Pleasure, life, lust...she wanted it all.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t sleep. Wasn\u2019t death. Wasn\u2019t whatever the hell had happened to her because of Latham.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s body was pressed to hers. Flesh to flesh. He was the man who\u2019d brought her from that nightmare. Who\u2019d freed her. The man who\u2019d just given her the best orgasm\u2014or three\u2014that she could remember having in this century.</p><p>His scent was on her. Her scent was on him. She\u2019d marked him. He\u2019d marked her.</p><p>Her lips began to curl. How perfect.</p><p>Werewolves were always so territorial. So driven by emotions and needs. By rage. By possessiveness.</p><p>Sometimes, their strengths could be weaknesses. Weaknesses that she could use in her battle.</p><p>Her frantic heartbeat began to slow down.</p><p>She stared up at the cracked ceiling above her, and her hands were still locked around Jamie. When she went to Latham, she\u2019d be carrying Jamie\u2019s scent on her. Revenge, step one.</p><p>Not yours, Latham. Never that. Despite what Latham had done to her, she\u2019d escaped. She wasn\u2019t the prisoner in his little trap any longer. Not his plaything for eternity. She was free.</p><p>And she\u2019d just fucked his enemy.</p><p>Payback was coming for Latham, and it had just started...</p><p>Wait until I bring my nightmare to your door. She\u2019d make Latham scream, plead, then...die.</p><p>\u201cAre the stories true?\u201d</p><p>Iona didn\u2019t glance away from the night sky when Jamie asked the question. She had her back to him. Her legs were drawn up, her arms curled around her knees, and she gazed up at the stars lighting the sky.</p><p>When he\u2019d finally been able to speak\u2014and move\u2014again, he\u2019d gotten her out of that back room. Out of the bar and to a safe place. A safe place that had a good bed and fresh clothing for them both. And more comfortable shoes for her. She\u2019d smiled when he\u2019d given her the shoes. He liked her smile. He liked having sex with her a hell of a lot more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Having sex with her...</p><p>Mind-numbing.</p><p>The pleasure had been deeper than anything he\u2019d experienced before, and even now, he wanted her again.</p> <p>If the stories were true, he wasn\u2019t the first man to feel this way for her.</p><p>\u201cWhich stories do you mean?\u201d Her head tilted back, in what looked like an effort to better see the stars.</p><p>He sighed and eased down beside her. They were at a house Sean had found for him, a little place in the woods, and though Jamie had tried to get her inside the cabin, Iona had insisted on sitting outside. Sitting outside and gazing up at the stars.</p><p>He followed her stare for a moment, then glanced back at her profile. He much preferred that view. \u201cAre you truly the oldest pureblood?\u201d He asked after a moment of just watching her.</p><p>Pureblood...the term for vampires who were born, not made. Most of the vamps populating the world had been made or turned. They were humans who\u2019d been bit, who\u2019d taken vampire blood when they were near death, and who\u2019d been reborn as something more.</p> <p>But Iona wasn\u2019t like those other vampires. He caught her left hand. Opened the palm. His enhanced vision easily let him see the small mark in the middle of her palm. Those who were born to the blood often had that mark.</p><p>That mark...and a circle of gold in their eyes.</p><p>Since her eyes were pure gold, the lady more than met that part of the pureblood requirement.</p><p>Her slender shoulders rolled in a little circle. \u201cThere could be others out there, probably are. I just haven\u2019t met them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you born?\u201d Jamie pressed.</p><p>Her gaze was still on the stars. \u201cLong before men ever thought they\u2019d travel up there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIona...\u201d</p><p>Another little shrug. \u201cAround 600 A.D., give or take a few years.\u201d</p><p>He tried not to let his surprise show.</p><p>\u201cI know, I look good for my age, right?\u201d Her lips had curled into a faint smile.</p><p>Very good.</p><p>He found that he was curious about her. Maybe too curious. \u201cHow did you know...what you were?\u201d He\u2019d always known he was a werewolf. When puberty hit, there\u2019d been no surprise when he grew fangs and claws and had the urge to howl at the moon. Surrounded by others of his kind, it had been an easy transition for him.</p><p>\u201cI got the first clue when one of my father\u2019s warriors stabbed me in the heart, tossed my body in a shallow grave, and left me to die.\u201d Her gaze drifted to him. The smile was gone from her face. \u201cYes, that was my first big clue. He left me to die, only...I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched into fists. \u201cWhy did he do that?\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze turned back to the stars. \u201cHave they traveled up there? While I was...under...did they travel more to the moon? Maybe to another planet? I\u2019ve seen so much in the years I walked the earth, but I\u2019ve always wanted to go beyond the sky...\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. Twined his fingers with hers in order to catch Iona\u2019s attention\u2014and just because he wanted to hold her hand. \u201cThey\u2019ve sent out robots. Rovers. They captured images of planets and stars. Searched and explored.\u201d Hell, he\u2019d take the woman on a little NASA field trip if she wanted...after they were done with Latham. He\u2019d make sure she learned every advance that had been made in space exploration.</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she said, and with her free hand, she pointed to the sky. \u201cVenus waits. Jupiter shines. The constellations are just as they were. Clothes are different. Music. Technology. But up there...it all looks the same to me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her fingers. \u201cWhy did he stab you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my hair wasn\u2019t gray. Because my skin hadn\u2019t wrinkled. Because I wasn\u2019t bearing children for my husband.\u201d</p><p>Her husband?</p><p>\u201cDid I mention...\u201d Iona murmured, \u201cthat my husband was the warrior who stabbed me?\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch. \u201cNo,\u201d Jamie bit out the words, \u201cyou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurebloods usually stop aging around twenty-five. Their bodies just...they freeze. I didn\u2019t realize that had happened to me, of course. I learned later that my father and my husband\u2014they thought I was bewitched.\u201d Her lips tightened. \u201cOr that maybe I\u2019d even made a deal with the devil.\u201d</p><p>Blood Queen.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got out of that grave, I made the mistake of running back to my people for help. You see, I still didn\u2019t get it. I thought my father would help me. I was sure he couldn\u2019t have known what Tylar had done. I was so scared and...\u201d Her stare dipped to Jamie\u2019s throat. \u201cHungry.\u201d</p><p>Because her vampire side would have kicked in with all of the blood loss she\u2019d suffered.</p><p>\u201cBut my father knew. The attack had been his plan. As soon as he saw me, he ordered his guards to prepare the fire.\u201d</p><p>The fire. Jamie found that he couldn\u2019t speak. His hold tightened on her.</p><p>\u201cThe guards bound my hands. Tied me to an old, rotting tree...put brush around me, and it was my father...he was the one to bring the first torch to start the blaze.\u201d</p><p>The Blood Queen slaughtered a whole village. That was the tale he knew of Iona\u2019s birth. Whispers had told of a Born Queen who\u2019d been so stricken by bloodlust that she\u2019d turned and attacked every person near her.</p><p>Only the story that Iona told was much different from what he\u2019d heard. Jamie found that he didn\u2019t doubt her account, not for an instant. There was too much pain humming beneath her words.</p><p>\u201cI begged for help,\u201d she said quietly. Her lips trembled. \u201cSo many were gathered around the fire, but no one would step forward to save me. No one.\u201d</p><p>Now her fingers were squeezing his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never known my mother. My father...he\u2019d said that she was attacked by our enemies shortly after my birth. But there were rumors about her. Stories that said my mother could do magic.\u201d Her long hair slid over her shoulders as she turned her head and gazed at him. \u201cThat day, I used magic, too. The fire should have consumed me.\u201d</p><p>He knew vampires were particularly susceptible to the flames. Their bodies burned so quickly.</p><p>\u201cBut I managed to control the fire. I don\u2019t know if it was my fear or my fury, but...something broke in me and I felt a sure of power.\u201d Her breath sighed out. \u201cI got away. I ran and I ran and then I realized...he\u2019d always hunt me. My father wouldn\u2019t stop searching for me because, to him, I was some kind of\u2014of punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunishment? For what?\u201d He didn\u2019t understand, but he sure would have enjoyed doling out some justice to her sadistic father.</p><p>\u201cFor killing my mother,\u201d Iona said in a soft, sad voice. \u201cOur enemies didn\u2019t kill her. I found out that truth too late. She died by my father\u2019s hand.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had one sick bastard of a father. Family. Sometimes, you couldn\u2019t live with them...</p><p>And sometimes you needed to kill them.</p><p>Iona kept talking, and she didn\u2019t try to pull her hand from his.</p><p>Good. He liked holding her palm against his. \u201cMy father always wanted immortality. Wanted to rule all the land he could find. He thought my mother could help him, and when she didn\u2019t, he made sure she could never use her magic to help anyone again.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe how dark her origins were. A heavy ache had grown in his chest as he listened to her tale.</p><p>\u201cIt was him or me,\u201d she said, and, sure enough, that stubborn chin of hers kicked up. \u201cI knew it, so I went back to my father\u2019s land. I slipped inside and made my way up to kill him.\u201d</p><p>And she had. He knew that, at least, this part of her legend was true.</p><p>\u201cI had my knife at his throat, but I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d Her head sagged a bit, as if she were shamed by the memory.</p><p>Well, hell. So that part wasn\u2019t true, either?</p><p>He\u2019d suspected from the moment her golden eyes first opened that she wasn\u2019t the evil bitch that rumor and legend had made her out to be. Now he knew for certain.</p><p>And that knowledge made him feel...lost.</p><p>What have I done to her?</p><p>\u201cHe laughed at my weakness and stabbed me with his sword.\u201d Her left hand went to her side, as if touching a wound that had to be over fourteen hundred years old. \u201cHe was coming to cut off my head. H-he said that would be the way to end me.\u201d</p><p>Her father had been right. Even a pureblood vampire wouldn\u2019t be able to rise from a beheading.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d killed my mother by taking her head. He told me that...\u201d</p><p>Had her mother been a pureblood, too? It was possible. Maybe Iona\u2019s father hadn\u2019t killed her mother because the woman was a witch. Maybe he\u2019d killed her because she was a pureblood and she\u2019d refused to turn him into a vampire? Then the hate had eaten at him, until he\u2019d unleashed his rage on his own child.</p><p>\u201cAs his blade came for my throat, as I felt my own blood pouring from me, and saw death coming...\u201d Her breath whispered out. \u201cThe woman I\u2019d been, she died. The vampire inside of me\u2014she lived. She killed. I took that sword. Snatched it from him. Then shoved it right back into his heart.\u201d</p><p>Jamie wanted to put his arms around her, so\u2014screw it\u2014he did. Jamie wrapped his arms around Iona and pulled her against his chest. She stiffened but didn\u2019t fight his hold. Good. He couldn\u2019t have fought her then. Her pain was too fresh. Too strong.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to ever cause her anymore pain.</p><p>Too late for that. You\u2019ve stolen her life, and she doesn\u2019t even realize it.</p><p>His jaw locked.</p><p>\u201cWhen his men came and attacked, I fought back. They died. My husband was the first to fall before me.\u201d Said flatly, as if she were yanking back on her emotions. \u201cThen I walked away from that land, with their blood covering me.\u201d</p><p>And the legend of the Blood Queen had been born.</p><p>\u201cI learned an important lesson that day,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>That her father had been better off dead? That her husband had deserved a long, brutal death?</p><p>\u201cEven those closest to you will betray you and kill you, if they have the chance.\u201d Her head turned, and she glanced up at him. They were close enough to kiss. \u201cJust so you know, I won\u2019t give you that chance.\u201d</p><p>Jamie blinked. \u201cI have no plans to kill you.\u201d Keeping her alive was imperative to him. Without her, he would be dead.</p><p>Her smile was sad, and it called him a liar. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so careful about what you revealed to me. But I know more than you think, and when I sleep, I\u2019ll know all.\u201d</p><p>Because powerful vampires could literally steal people\u2019s memories with the act of blood-drinking. Their prey\u2019s blood memories appeared to the vampires when they dreamed. Jamie knew that and he also knew that he had to stop Iona from dreaming, at least until their war with Latham was over. But, lucky for him and\u2014I\u2019m so sorry, Iona\u2014unfortunately for her, he knew the lovely vampire\u2019s weakness. So he had to use that weakness as he asked, \u201cAnd you\u2019re so eager to sleep again, are you? To close your eyes and wake to see that years have passed?\u201d</p><p>She flinched. Jamie had hit his target, and shame burned inside of him.</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d she said, still staring back at him with the eyes that Jamie swore could see into his soul, \u201cI\u2019ll have to sleep. There won\u2019t be a choice.\u201d</p><p>He bent forward and pressed a kiss to her cheek. \u201cEventually, there won\u2019t be a need for secrets.\u201d They both knew he had them. \u201cMy war with Latham will be over.\u201d But the end for him and Iona wouldn\u2019t come any time soon.</p><p>As he pulled in her scent and felt her slender body against his, he had to ask, \u201cWhy did you kill the others?\u201d Not the warriors on that long ago night. He would have gladly killed them himself. No, he meant the vampires that she\u2019d brought in to her coven. \u201cDid they turn on you, too?\u201d</p><p>A faint furrow appeared between her brows. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe coven you had in LA. Why did you kill them?\u201d</p><p>Stark pain\u2014no, anguish\u2014flashed in her eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re dead?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>But then she twisted in his arms, shoved him back, and Jamie suddenly found himself on the ground with one very, very enraged pureblood vampire above him. \u201cThey\u2019re dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Okay, so she hadn\u2019t killed them. Big miscalculation his part. If she hadn\u2019t done it\u2014</p><p>Latham.</p><p>\u201cI wondered why they never came for me.\u201d The words were spoken with sadness, but fury crackled in her gaze. \u201cI waited for them. Thought they\u2019d betrayed me, too.\u201d</p><p>Maybe some of them had, he didn\u2019t know. All Jamie knew for sure was that, \u201cThe compound burned to the ground on the same day that you...disappeared.\u201d The flames had lit up the sky. He\u2019d been in LA at the time, young, barely twenty, still too reckless, and he raced toward those flames.</p><p>But there had been nothing he could do. The vampire compound had been too far from the main city streets. The fire had been too strong.</p><p>Too out of control. For him. And certainly for the human fire fighters who\u2019d tried to battle the blaze.</p><p>A tear slid down Iona\u2019s cheek.</p><p>It felt like someone had just clawed his chest open. He hated the sight of that tear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I-I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She lunged away from him. Raced away in a flash and disappeared into the woods as she used that super vamp speed of hers.</p><p>No. \u201cIona!\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t stopping for him.</p><p>Swearing, he transformed into the wolf, letting the savage shift sweep over him. Then he was running, following her sweet scent. Rushing through the woods as fast as could.</p><p>Can\u2019t let her get away. Can\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But even as he rushed through the woods, her scent was growing fainter. He kept going, knowing she couldn\u2019t maintain her enhanced speed forever. She\u2019d still be weak from her imprisonment. She\u2019d still\u2014</p><p>He burst from the woods. Heard the growl of a motorcycle. Saw Iona, holding tight to the back of some leather-clad bastard. As the breath heaved from him, the motorcycle shot forward, taking Iona away.</p><p>Jamie howled.</p> <p>The driver glanced back, and Jamie could smell his fear. The man was smart to be afraid. Jamie charged after the bike. After them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d The human demanded. \u201cToo big for a dog...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d Iona\u2019s soft voice drifted back to Jamie. Stabbed right in his heart like any knife. \u201cGo faster.\u201d</p><p>The engine gunned and the bike picked up even more speed as it flew down the narrow road and into the fading night.</p><p>For a time, Jamie kept pretty good pace with the fleeing motorcycle. But then the human and Iona vanished.</p> <p>Vanished...before he could make her realize that the human wasn\u2019t harmless. That he hadn\u2019t been outside of those woods by chance.</p><p>He howled again.</p><p>Jamie knew that human\u2019s face. He\u2019d seen him before. At Latham\u2019s side.</p><p>And now that human...one of Latham\u2019s army...had Iona.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The wolf wasn\u2019t following them any longer. Iona\u2019s hands tightened around the male. They should be clear, for now.</p> <p>\u201cStop,\u201d she told him, raising her voice so it would be heard over the roar of the motorcycle.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Her hands squeezed him, harder. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Did he give a negative shake of his head?</p><p>He did. Her gaze searched the road around them. She needed to get to LA, but she didn\u2019t need the human, not any longer.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d He wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet so it would be ridiculously easy to dispatch him. One quick toss and he\u2019d be on the ground. One flick of her wrist and his neck would break.</p><p>She might not be able to drink from him, but she could certainly kill him easily enough.</p><p>\u201cSomeone wants to see you,\u201d the human said as his fingers tightened around the motorcycle\u2019s handlebars.</p> <p>Unease skated through her. \u201cThen he sent the wrong messenger.\u201d She didn\u2019t even hesitate. Iona grabbed the human and threw him off the motorcycle.</p><p>Before the bike could crash, she slid forward and took control of the handlebars. This wasn\u2019t like the old hog she\u2019d had all those years before but...</p><p>But she was a fast learner. Her thighs curved around the body of the bike and she throttled up the speed as she raced away.</p><p>The human could live or die. He wasn\u2019t her concern.</p><p>Her coven\u2014her vampires\u2014they were what mattered. She needed to find out what had happened to them.</p><p>Greg Coleman rose slowly from the pavement. His ankle was broken, thanks to that bitch. And, also thanks to the vamp bitch, blood soaked the right side of his body where the asphalt had ripped his flesh away.</p><p>All that blood, permeating the air, and she hadn\u2019t even stopped for a sip. He yanked out his phone. The screen was cracked, but he still managed to make his call.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he said when the boss picked up. \u201cShe didn\u2019t so much as make a move toward my throat.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled over the line then... \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDriving fast and hot for LA.\u201d That was what she\u2019d told him, anyway. When she\u2019d rushed out of those woods\u2014nearly scaring the shit out of him because he hadn\u2019t been ready for her; hell, he\u2019d been about to go in those woods and scout for her\u2014the vampire had said that she had to get to LA.</p><p>He\u2019d told her to hop on the bike. When she had...holy fuck, talk about perfect luck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alone,\u201d he said into his phone as he tried to take a few steps down the road. Every step sent pain pulsing from his ankle. \u201cProbably heading there to see if she can find any of her coven.\u201d Not that there were any vamps for her to find there. Well, not any who would be on her side.</p><p>Greg stopped walking, sucked in breath, and said, \u201cIt looks like she lost the werewolf, so she should be easy pickings for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>A twig snapped behind Greg. He whirled around and his ankle gave out, sending him falling right back down. His phone slipped away from him, smacked the pavement once more, and landed just out of his reach.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He clenched his teeth and tried to shove toward that phone. \u201cI need transport,\u201d he shouted, hoping the boss would hear him. \u201cFollow my GPS and come get me\u2014shit!\u201d</p><p>A wolf jumped out of the darkness. Big, black, and with sharp green eyes that promised death. One of the wolf\u2019s front paws slammed down onto the phone.</p><p>Greg tried to scramble back. He had a gun full of silver bullets...in the saddlebag on his bike. Fuck, fuck, fuck! \u201cStay away from me!\u201d</p><p>The wolf stalked closer. It was the same wolf that had followed Iona from the woods. That beast had been hunting them, had come all this way?</p><p>The wolf\u2019s sides heaved. Saliva dripped from its mouth and it kept advancing toward him.</p><p>Greg nearly pissed his pants. He\u2019d never had werewolves come at him before. He was part of Latham\u2019s team. The pack. Latham\u2019s wolves attacked others, not him. Never him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Greg lifted his hands, trying to cover his face.</p><p>The wolf\u2019s claws sliced into his left arm. Blood flowed, too quickly.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Greg screamed as he tried to fight the wolf.</p><p>The wolf didn\u2019t stop. Its eyes glinted. The beast barred its teeth and that green stare locked on Greg\u2019s throat. Death. Greg saw the promise in that gaze.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t ready to die. And maybe...maybe he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cYou want the woman?\u201d Greg threw out and tried not to whimper at the pain from his arm...his ankle...his whole body.</p><p>The wolf seemed to hesitate.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s heading for LA.\u201d Who knew how long it would take for her to arrive? \u201cShe\u2019s going after her old coven.\u201d Greg forced a laugh. \u201cDoesn\u2019t realize it, does she? The vamps still left from that coven\u2014just a handful of \u2018em\u2014they were the ones who set her up with Latham. They were the ones who lit that whole compound up in LA. They didn\u2019t want bagged blood and peace with humans.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d been told. He knew nothing first-hand, but he was ready to trade every whisper and bit of gossip that he\u2019d ever heard for a chance to live a little while longer.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll find her. They\u2019ll trick her. They\u2019ll...\u201d Greg\u2019s breath choked out as fear shuddered through him. The wolf wasn\u2019t backing off. \u201cThey\u2019ll take her head\u2014or they\u2019ll just give her right back to\u2014to Latham!\u201d</p><p>The wolf attacked. His razor-sharp teeth locked on Greg\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Greg begged. He could feel the tears pouring down his cheeks. \u201cLet me go...Save her. Hurry...and she could live!\u201d Total lie. That bitch\u2019s death was already set.</p><p>But the wolf didn\u2019t know that, and his teeth lifted away from Greg\u2019s throat. The fool pulled back. Turned away. Rushed back into the woods.</p><p>And then the beast ran away to play the hero.</p><p>Nothing remained. The heavy stone walls that had been erected around the perimeter of Iona\u2019s home in LA still stood firm, but inside of those walls...</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Blackened earth. No buildings. No people. Just...nothing.</p><p>A big FOR SALE sign hung on the front gate, swaying a bit in the breeze. The sign groaned as it rubbed against the iron gate. Iona stood about fifteen feet away from the gate, inside those cold stone walls, lost in the middle of the one place she\u2019d always felt truly belonged to her, and she refused to cry.</p><p>She could almost feel the pain lingering in the air around her. When she closed her eyes, the screams whispered through her mind. Whispered\u2014then burned.</p><p>As her friends had burned. Her family.</p><p>She\u2019d transformed some of the coven herself. Found the rare few that she\u2019d thought could handle the vampire world. They\u2019d turned others. The coven had grown.</p><p>It was all gone now. Ashes.</p><p>Her father had wanted to burn her to ashes. Fire was such a good way to kill a vampire.</p><p>Her gaze fell to the blackened ground. She\u2019d driven for so long that night had descended on her once more, a black shroud to cover her beloved home.</p><p>\u201cIona.\u201d</p><p>At first, she thought the call was just a memory. Then she looked up, and, there, just beyond the front gate, she saw Michael staring at her.</p><p>He looked as if he\u2019d seen a ghost. She felt as if she had.</p><p>Michael. Michael Monroe. The breath rushed from her. One of her coven!</p><p>She hadn\u2019t transformed him. Another member of the coven\u2014Christine\u2014had brought him over. Christine had found Michael, broken and bloody, the victim of a hit and run car accident. He\u2019d begged Christine for help.</p><p>The gate groaned louder as Michael opened the metal bars that lined the entrance. Iona hadn\u2019t bothered opening the gate. She\u2019d just leapt over the stone wall.</p><p>If Michael had known just what sort of help Christine truly offered, would he still have begged? Or would he have chosen death? Iona had always wondered...</p><p>\u201cYou should be dead,\u201d Michael said, shaking his head as he advanced on her. \u201cAll this time...we thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>She kept her hands at her sides. Refused to let hope fill her. He was alive, and he\u2019d just said...we. Others must have survived, too.</p><p>But...but she didn\u2019t let the hope take over. Hope had been crushed too many times. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatham,\u201d Michael bit off the name of the werewolf at the top of Iona\u2019s most-hated list. \u201cWhen you left us, he came in with his wolves. They attacked during the day and burned the place around us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. There should have been safeguards in place. Specific vampires and bodyguard humans who protected the area during the day while the vamp coven was more vulnerable. The compound had been set up with security systems, dozens of alarms. The wolves should never have been able to sneak inside and attack.</p><p>\u201cHow did you escape?\u201d Iona asked him.</p><p>But he just shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe...I\u2019m so glad to see you!\u201d Then he rushed forward and wrapped his arms around her. He smelled of fresh blood.</p><p>Michael had been out hunting. Had his prey been humans? Werewolves?</p><p>Her hands touched lightly on his shoulders. \u201cHow did you escape?\u201d Iona asked him again. Goosebumps rose on her arms. Something was off, something felt\u2014</p><p>A low growl drifted in the air. Iona swallowed.</p><p>Michael lifted his head. Pulled back a bit so he could stare down at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t escape.\u201d He was smiling now. Flashing his fangs. He must have heard the growl, too. Like her, he knew the sound for exactly what it was.</p><p>The sound of a werewolf. After all, that deep, rumbling growl was pretty unmistakable. A werewolf was closing in on them.</p><p>\u201cI killed the human guards,\u201d Michael told her. He was proud. Bragging? \u201cI made sure that the vamps on patrol were given drugged blood. Then I just walked away and let the werewolves have their fun.\u201d</p><p>Fury had her trembling and more than ready to rip off his head. \u201cChristine saved you!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThen she got in my way. Tried to get me to be a good, fuckin\u2019 little vamp who followed the rules.\u201d He shook his head and pulled a stake from his coat. \u201cI\u2019m not the following type.\u201d</p><p>The wolf was behind him, racing with his giant jaws parted and his eyes trained on the prey that waited.</p><p>Michael pressed the tip of his wooden stake over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m guessing all that time, frozen like the dead, slowed you down, huh?\u201d His smile widened. \u201cI\u2019m glad I get to be the one to send you to hell.\u201d</p><p>She snatched the stake from him, and, before he could even have a chance to fight\u2014he deserved no chance\u2014Iona shoved that stake deep into his heart. \u201cYou guessed wrong.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted. His eyes stared at her in horrified surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo time to beg this go around,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d Then she walked away while his body fell to the blackened earth.</p><p>The wolf was charging right at her. Iona braced her legs to face him.</p><p>But the beast started to change. Bones crunched and snapped, and the fur vanished from his body. Golden flesh emerged. Flesh she knew. A face she knew. It would be impossible to ever forget Jamie\u2019s hard, dangerous features.</p><p>\u201cI was...coming to save you...\u201d The words were raspy and grating as his paws became hands that sank into the earth.</p><p>Her head tilted at she studied him. \u201cI didn\u2019t need saving.\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked up at her. His gaze blazed. \u201cThat vamp\u2019s not the only one after you.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t think that he was. She wasn\u2019t that foolish.</p><p>\u201cA few other vamps were helping him, and they\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she finished with a nod because she\u2019d caught their scents, too. They were just beyond the wall, waiting.</p><p>Maybe Michael had been their leader, so they\u2019d let him try for first blood. Would they attack now that they realized she wasn\u2019t weak? Would they be afraid\u2014or would they try killing her, too?</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re smart, they\u2019ll run like hell,\u201d Jamie said as he fired a fast glance toward the wall.</p><p>If they\u2019d been smart, they never would have betrayed her coven.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head jerked to the right. \u201cOne\u2019s running.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she already heard other footsteps. Pounding toward them. \u201cAnd two are attacking.\u201d Iona rushed away from Jamie as she ran to face the threat. Fury boiled in her, the kind that just made her want to destroy. So when she saw the two vampires charging at her with hate twisting their faces and their hands curled around stakes, Iona didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>She was within range now. She\u2019d just needed to get close enough\u2014</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d Iona whispered and flames shot out from her hands.</p> <p>Close enough to kill.</p><p>The vampires screamed as the fire consumed them. A fire stronger than anything they\u2019d probably ever seen before.</p><p>My fire. One fueled by rage and magic.</p><p>They died quickly, though they probably didn\u2019t deserve such a swift death. Not after what they\u2019d done. Betrayal.</p><p>A hand touched her shoulder. Iona flinched and spun around.</p> <p>Jamie backed up, lifting both hands in front of him. \u201cEasy, love. I\u2019m on your side.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe that. \u201cThe woman...\u201d Iona couldn\u2019t look at what was left of her, but she didn\u2019t need to. Iona remembered Luanne\u2019s face. \u201cShe brought the blood to me that last night. Michael and his vamps...they gave me drugged blood.\u201d That was how they\u2019d managed to subdue her. She just hadn\u2019t realized it at the time.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to sleep in her home, and she\u2019d woken in the room that would become her prison, woken just in time to see Latham and Brian. The spell had been cast. The taste of blood filled her mouth\u2014Latham\u2019s blood. She\u2019d tried to lunge at them, but her body had refused to obey her commands.</p><p>If you won\u2019t give me your blood, then I\u2019ll just take it. Latham\u2019s voice. He\u2019d tried to woo her when they first met. Offered her promises of peace between the vampires and werewolves. He\u2019d been handsome. Charming.</p><p>But she\u2019d seen the darkness in him.</p><p>Latham had only wanted her blood. Her power. He hadn\u2019t cared about peace. The werewolf enjoyed his violence and death too much for that.</p> <p>I would have put him down. She\u2019d planned to kill him, but Latham had struck first. He couldn\u2019t kill her, because then he\u2019d never get the blood he wanted from a corpse. And if he let her live, then he\u2019d known she would attack him.</p><p>So he\u2019d decided on a compromise.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cIona?\u201d Jamie eased closer to her. \u201cWe should get out of here. Latham knows this is where you were going when you left Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s coming.\u201d No surprise. \u201cWhen Michael caught the werewolf scent in the air, he thought you were just one of Latham\u2019s army.\u201d</p><p>You thought wrong, Michael.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders. Weariness beat at her. She\u2019d driven so far, non-stop, and Iona always felt drained whenever she used her fire and magic.</p><p>She risked a look up into Jamie\u2019s bright stare and knew he could see her weakness.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to rest,\u201d he told her.</p><p>True, but not likely.</p><p>But when he offered his hand to her, Iona found herself stepping forward and actually clasping his fingers. So many had betrayed her over the years, but...some had been her true friends. Christine. Iona could still see her so clearly in her mind. Her warm smile. Her perfect, dark skin. Her kind eyes. \u201cLatham killed my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine.\u201d Fury vibrated in his words. She could understand that rage. It was no wonder he wanted vengeance against Latham.</p><p>They were outside of the gate now. A big, black truck waited for them. She frowned at it for a moment.</p><p>Jamie laughed softly. \u201cAh, love, did you really think I ran all the way after you?\u201d</p><p>Love? It was the second time that he\u2019d called her that. She\u2019d just been baby before. But Iona pushed the thought aside as he guided her to the vehicle. Her legs wanted to go limp, so she slumped inside, sinking into the soft seat.</p><p>She would go with the werewolf, for now. She could always slip away from him later. She could slip away any time that she wanted.</p><p>In seconds, Jamie was in the truck with her. With a flick of his fingers, he started the ignition, and they left the heavy, stone walls behind them. Iona squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI would have...brought you here,\u201d Jamie said, voice hesitant. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought myself here.\u201d She could protect herself. She\u2019d never needed anyone else to fight her battles. Still didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd maybe I was tired of being used.\u201d Because he was using her, too. She knew it. Wasn\u2019t it always about the blood?</p><p>My blood. My power. The werewolves just kept wanting it.</p><p>\u201cIona\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to shower.\u201d To wash away the ash on her skin. To wash away the death. She forced her eyes to open, and Iona glanced at him. \u201cFind the nearest hotel or just...just find me a safe place.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in his jaw, but Jamie gave a grim nod. He didn\u2019t speak again during the ride, and Iona was glad because the ghosts from her past\u2014the vampires she\u2019d lost\u2014their memories were screaming at her as she left her home behind.</p><p>She was hurting. Not a physical pain. Jamie had checked Iona\u2019s body thoroughly and found no sign of wounds.</p><p>Her pain went far beneath the surface.</p><p>Iona was in the shower, the water pouring down with a heavy thunder that he could hear clearly through the gleaming door.</p><p>He had found her a safe place. Not some pay-by-the-hour dump. She\u2019d deserved better than that. The woman was a queen, and he\u2019d gotten her the best room he could afford. Five freaking stars.</p><p>He wanted to do anything and everything he could in order to make her pain go away. She\u2019d seen enough pain, more than he\u2019d ever expected.</p><p>I want her to be happy.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re there...\u201d Her voice drifted to him. Not a yell, just a whisper. That was all she needed to do...whisper, and his wolf could hear her. \u201cCome inside, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>His body hardened at the invitation. Hell, he\u2019d already been hard, from the moment they entered the hotel. Iona had started to strip. Then she\u2019d walked away. Shut the door. Closed him out.</p><p>But, now...she was inviting him inside...</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be invited twice.</p><p>Jamie nearly ripped the door off the hinges when he rushed into the bathroom.</p><p>The shower was huge. Easily bigger than the little house Sean had found for them back in Oregon. The place was lined with granite. Some kind of stone bench was in the shower, and, in that shower, two different jets of water poured from opposite walls to slide down over Iona\u2019s naked body.</p><p>She stood just behind the glass door. Steam drifted around her. Her gaze met his, then she put her hand on the glass.</p><p>He could see the small birthmark on her palm. That mark had changed everything for her.</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t remember crossing the room, but suddenly, he was right in front of the shower door. His hand lifted and covered hers. Only that thin pane of glass separated his flesh from hers.</p><p>Her gaze met his. He could see the edge of her fangs peeking out from beneath her red lips.</p><p>\u201cWill it be like before?\u201d Iona asked him. \u201cSo much pleasure...it let me forget all the pain.\u201d</p><p>Her words pierced deep into him. No more pain. Jamie lifted his hand. Stripped. Opened the door. Reached for her. His fingers skimmed over the silken flesh that had been heated by the pounding water. \u201cThis time, it will be even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises...\u201d</p><p>He noticed that some of the shadows had lifted from her gaze. So beautiful that she makes me ache.</p><p>His fingers curled around hers, and he bent to taste her. Mine. Her lips parted. Her tongue met his. There was no hesitation in her. Iona knew what she wanted, and she was taking it.</p><p>Jamie knew exactly what he wanted, too, and he\u2019d be damned if he ever gave her up.</p><p>They were hungry from the start. Wild. Full of lust and need. Their kisses were hard, their tongues tasting. He\u2019d never get enough of her. He never wanted to taste another woman. The taste would be bitter. But Iona...</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Their hands were greedy and eager. Iona\u2019s body was slick from the soap and water. Her fingers brushed over his chest. Over the old scars\u2014some he\u2019d gotten just as a child, long before he could shift and heal\u2014that would always mark him.</p><p>Then...she slid down onto her knees before him.</p><p>Jamie hadn\u2019t expected the move, and he tried to pull back. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this.\u201d Demanding, not asking.</p><p>As if he\u2019d deny her anything.</p><p>Then her mouth closed around the tip of his cock, and Jamie\u2019s knees locked. Sweet fucking hell. Her tongue rasped over him. She took him in deeper as she sucked his flesh. The low moan that Iona gave vibrated along his cock and had him nearly exploding in her mouth.</p><p>I made a promise. One he wouldn\u2019t forget, even if the woman was trying to make him go blind from pleasure.</p><p>He pulled back from her.</p><p>She glanced up, her eyes molten. \u201cJamie!\u201d</p><p>He liked her demanding. He lifted her into his arms. He\u2019d like her even more when she gave him a chance to taste her.</p><p>She kissed him while he carried her out of the bathroom. She licked his lips. Then she moved to his neck. When her fangs slid into his skin, his arms tightened around her.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Come. Yet.</p><p>He had to be inside her before he came, and she\u2014she had to be on her second orgasm by then.</p><p>Promises, promises...Now he recognized her words for the taunt they were. Iona wanted him to break. He wouldn\u2019t, maybe.</p><p>He put her on the bed. Hated to move away from her mouth\u2014he loved her bite\u2014but there was a part of her that he\u2019d been dying to taste. Would she taste as good there? Yes. He already knew she would.</p><p>His hands trailed over her body. Over the soft swell of her stomach. He pressed a kiss there. Then, down, sliding into the silken heat of her sex.</p><p>Her legs parted for him. Not far enough. He moved between those sexy legs and opened her even wider.</p><p>So fucking perfect.</p><p>Jamie put his mouth on her. Tasted her secrets and drove his tongue into her sex. She bucked beneath him, and he grabbed her hips, keeping her just where he needed her to be.</p><p>Right beneath his mouth.</p><p>Her hands slid over his shoulders. \u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>He licked her.</p><p>And felt her come. One...the start.</p><p>He kept tasting and licking and her moans filled his ears even as the beast roared inside him. Her pleasure was sweet on his tongue, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He needed so much more.</p><p>When had she become so important to him? When had she become...</p><p>Everything.</p><p>He\u2019d been so desperate to get to LA. To get to her. If she\u2019d been killed...</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hands tore away from her hips just as his claws burst from his fingertips. The claws sliced into the sheets, the mattress.</p><p>He heard her gasp. and he tried to yank back the beast. \u201cWon\u2019t...hurt...\u201d</p><p>His head lifted. He met her stare. Saw his whole world reflected back in that gold.</p><p>Claim. An instinct bred into the wolf. When you saw what you wanted, you took it.</p><p>An alpha\u2019s right. He\u2019d never wanted another this way.</p><p>Take.</p><p>He pushed his cock into her body. Drove deep and hard and the pure fucking bliss of her had his back teeth grinding together.</p><p>Then the animal inside took over. Lust was a frenzy, need a desperation within him. He plunged into her, thrusting again and again, but he couldn\u2019t seem to get deep enough, couldn\u2019t feel her close enough.</p><p>He pulled away from her. Turned Iona so that she was on her stomach. Would she\u2014</p><p>She rose to her knees. \u201cReady for more?\u201d Iona asked him, tossing that shining mane over her shoulder.</p><p>He was beyond speech right then. His mouth closed around the curve of her shoulder. A kiss at first, but then, because this was the spot that would mark a claiming...</p><p>He bit her, even as he thrust into her sex. The pleasure hit them both, sweeping through them, between them, consuming in a white-hot explosion that left him hollowed out, and yet, for the first time in his whole life also feeling...</p><p>Whole.</p><p>As if he\u2019d found something that had always been missing.</p><p>Her.</p><p>Jamie pressed a kiss to the faint wound he\u2019d left on Iona\u2019s shoulder. The mark of a werewolf claiming. There would be no going back from this, and he wondered just what Iona would do now.</p><p>Hopefully, she wouldn\u2019t try to kill him.</p><p>Her arms curled around him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep,\u201d she whispered but her words were husky, and he knew that sleep pulled desperately at her.</p><p>It pulled at him, too. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted back. She stared up at him with eyes so deep and mysterious. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He knew the admission had been hard. For her, hard was probably one serious understatement.</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I swear, I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>The last time, she\u2019d slept for fifteen years.</p><p>He inhaled her scent. Realized that she already felt like she was a part of him. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>But Iona gave a sad shake of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sleep I fear.\u201d Her hand slid over his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s the dreams. What I\u2019ll...see.\u201d</p><p>Because of the blood she\u2019d taken from him. Jamie carefully held his expression, hoping to show only concern for her and not the fear and anger that were suddenly clawing inside of him. Just yesterday, he\u2019d planned to keep her from sleeping. Planned to stop her from using their blood link so she wouldn\u2019t see his secrets in her dreams.</p><p>But now I want her to know me. Pity his memories weren\u2019t the stuff of white knights. Hell, Iona had probably met real freaking knights in her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she\u2019d battled monsters. Like me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to find out...you\u2019re as much of a monster as Latham...\u201d Her voice whispered away as her lashes began to sag. Her slurred words were a painful echo of his own thoughts.</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut. Jamie leaned over to press a kiss to her the tumble of her hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Because he knew exactly what Iona would see in her dreams.</p> <p>And he knew that she\u2019d want him dead.</p><p>But she deserved to know. He couldn\u2019t keep secrets from her anymore.</p><p>Even if the truth she learned made her go for his throat.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The bodies were broken. Twisted.</p> <p>Jagged wounds\u2014claw marks\u2014had ripped into the woman\u2019s neck. Her blond hair was matted with her blood.</p><p>A man\u2019s body rested beside her, his hands still reaching for her even in death. The heavy scent of silver burned in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The cry was torn from her...only when she glanced down, Iona wasn\u2019t staring at her own body.</p><p>No, when she glanced down, she saw Jamie\u2019s strong hands. Jamie\u2019s body.</p><p>Because this was Jamie\u2019s memory.</p><p>Part of her wanted to wake up, but once the blood memories came, there was no stopping them. This was the way the memories always came for her. She relived the memories, the moments, until the blood pushed her free. So she watched, through Jamie\u2019s eyes, as he fell before the people that she knew were his parents. Those memories were there, too, inside of her and\u2014</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re next.\u201d Latham\u2019s voice.</p><p>He was standing over the bodies. His lips were twisted with hate.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jamie demanded again, the cry like a wounded animal. And\u2014he was.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m taking over the pack. He was in my way.\u201d Latham glared at the dead man\u2019s body and then pointed at Jamie. \u201cYou\u2019re in my way, too, brother.\u201d</p><p>Brother?</p><p>A knife seemed to slide into her heart, but the heart\u2014it wasn\u2019t hers. It was Jamie\u2019s. And Latham had just shoved a silver blade into Jamie\u2019s chest. Then Latham...walked away.</p><p>But Jamie didn\u2019t die. Someone else rushed to his side. A wolf she recognized. Sean. Sean took out the blade even as it scorched and blistered his fingertips. But Jamie was still near death. Far too close. Death\u2019s cold hands reached out as the world seemed to go dark...</p><p>Then she was somewhere else. Her eyes opened. She\u2014no, Jamie was on a bed. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d His voice seemed to echo all around her.</p> <p>Sean swallowed and glanced away, as if he couldn\u2019t stand to meet Jamie\u2019s eyes. \u201cHad to...I had to give you vampire blood. It was the only way to keep you alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatham...he...he has a vamp that he keeps prisoner. She\u2019s supposed to be fuckin\u2019 strong.\u201d</p><p>She? Iona\u2019s heart burned because she realized this memory...it had been created when Latham already had her captive.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how my brother stays so strong.\u201d Jamie jumped from the bed. Her blood had pushed his strength level higher than anything he\u2019d ever felt before. \u201cWe have to find her. Find her...and kill the bitch. We kill her, and we\u2019ll kill him, too.\u201d</p><p>Iona whimpered and turned her head against the pillow.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s jaw locked. He wanted to shake her and force her eyes to open, but...he didn\u2019t want any more secrets between them. No more lies. Iona wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d expected. She deserved to know the truth about what happened. About him.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you come for my throat...\u201d His fingers brushed back her hair. \u201cHell, maybe I won\u2019t even fight you.\u201d</p><p>Because he didn\u2019t know who had wronged her more. Him...or his brother.</p><p>Another time, another place. The memories were coming faster now as the blood pushed her to see more. Learn more.</p><p>The pounding of the surf hit her ears even as the scent of the ocean filled her nose. She paced\u2014no, Jamie paced\u2014inside a small beach house. A man sat before him, bound hand and foot to a chair.</p><p>The man\u2019s blond hair fell over his eyes, but then Jamie said, \u201cWitch, we can do this two ways. I can kill you now, or you can help me.\u201d His hands lifted and claws glinted in the dying light. \u201cWe can both work together to take out Latham, and you can keep living.\u201d</p><p>Witch? The man\u2019s head rose. Brian Hennessey stared back at her. Pain froze her heart. Jamie had been working with Brain? With the witch who\u2019d bound her?</p><p>Blood dripped from Brian\u2019s busted bottom lip. \u201cYou can\u2019t...stop him. He\u2019s too strong.\u201d Then Brian laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna take...over every pack...no stopping...\u201d</p><p>Jamie kicked the chair and Brian fell backward, slamming into the wooden floor. \u201cHe\u2019s strong because you gave him magic. You think I didn\u2019t hear the story about the vampires you slaughtered? About the Blood Queen that you\u2019re holding and slowly draining?\u201d His lips curled in disgust. \u201cI know you\u2019re giving her blood to my brother. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so powerful.\u201d</p><p>And for an instant, the fast flood of memories were hers, not Jamie\u2019s. Iona remembered the prick of a needle in her arm. The slow suction as her blood drained away. Again and again and again as the years rolled away...</p><p>Her dark past vanished, and there was only Jamie once more.</p><p>\u201cWhen we take his vamp away, he\u2019ll get weak.\u201d Jamie crouched over Sean and put his claws to the witch\u2019s throat. \u201cTell me how to find her, and I\u2019ll make sure to cut off his little blood supply. Because it\u2019s her, right? Not just any vamp...her. I know she\u2019s old, powerful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-magic.\u201d Blood oozed from Brian\u2019s throat when Jamie\u2019s claws broke the skin. \u201cNot just a vamp...the Blood Queen is part witch, too. Get her blood, get the power. Latham has the power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you helped him!\u201d Fury rolled in Jamie\u2019s voice. \u201cYou backed the wrong brother. But you can regret that while you\u2019re burning in hell.\u201d His claws sank deeper into Brian\u2019s throat.</p><p>Brian shook his head, seemingly frantic at the promise of death he must have seen in Jamie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s claws lifted once more. He attacked.</p><p>More blood flowed.</p><p>The witch broke. \u201cTh-there\u2019s a way...end the curse...you can...can control her...\u201d</p><p>Iona wanted to close her eyes. Wanted to slap her hands over her ears. But this wasn\u2019t her body, and Jamie\u2019s hands\u2014they were too busy slicing into Sean.</p><p>\u201cThen you tell me that way. Tell me how to control the Blood Queen, and you can help me to kill Latham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was alpha,\u201d Jamie said the words, knowing she probably couldn\u2019t hear him\u2014not while she was locked in blood memories\u2014but still needing to speak. \u201cI was his second son. Latham...he was my half-brother. Hell, I didn\u2019t even know about the guy for the first ten years of my life. He just...showed up one day. His mother had never...she\u2019d never joined the pack. That\u2019s why his last name\u2019s Gentry.\u201d</p><p>Latham Gentry. The fucking wolf that had destroyed his world. \u201cHe\u2019d been in America, had grown up there.\u201d And, later, it would be Latham who convinced the pack that they needed to move across the pond and start fresh in the United States.</p><p>\u201cI was a kid when Latham showed up, and Latham\u2014hell, he was a fully mature wolf. He was also a sadistic prick.\u201d Jamie shook his head. \u201cOnly back then, nobody but me ever seemed to see the evil that burned in him.\u201d His fingers were laced with hers. \u201cI tried to tell my father. He wouldn\u2019t listen. He was too damn happy to have a strong, new wolf in the pack\u2014a wolf with his blood.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s fucking crazy. How many times had Jamie said those exact words to his father over the years? He\u2019d seen the evil in Latham. Why hadn\u2019t the others?</p><p>\u201cThe years passed. I could see that Latham was growing darker, more dangerous. I could also tell that he was positioning himself to be alpha.\u201d The hell, no. \u201cI had to leave the pack. I knew...I knew I\u2019d never be able to swear allegiance to Latham.\u201d His parents had been furious. Jamie\u2019s father had disowned him, still refusing to see what Latham was. He said I was jealous. Bitter.</p><p>Their father had learned the truth for far too long.</p><p>\u201cWhen I left, Sean came with me.\u201d Sean had been his best friend for as long as he could remember. Orphaned, Sean had always been treated as the runt of the pack when they were kids. But Jamie hadn\u2019t let the others ever hurt Sean. He\u2019d fought plenty of battles for his friend until Sean had finally grown big enough to fight back.</p><p>When they\u2019d left the only life they\u2019d ever known, Sean had said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to have your back.\u201d Sean could be a smart-ass, but the guy was loyal. True through blood and bone.</p><p>They\u2019d gone out, ready to start a whole new life.</p><p>But...something had happened. \u201cMaybe it was you,\u201d Jamie whispered to her. \u201cThere was talk that Latham had become obsessed with a vampire. That he wanted her for his mate, but she...she turned away from him.\u201d</p><p>Smart choice.</p><p>\u201cThe years passed, and Latham just started to grow stronger. Crazier.\u201d This was his shame. Jamie hadn\u2019t returned to the pack then, despite the stories he\u2019d heard. My father told me if I left, not to return. So he\u2019d stayed away, thinking his father would finally see Latham for what he was\u2014thinking that his father would stop the other wolf.</p><p>\u201cBut when my parents realized the truth about Latham and tried to fight back, he killed them.\u201d The memory was a knife in his heart. \u201cI came back\u2014too late\u2014and found their bodies.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never forget the sight. He\u2019d heard tales of more bloodshed in the O\u2019Connell pack. Tales of torture and death, and he hadn\u2019t been able to stay away a moment longer.</p><p>\u201cLatham tried to kill me, too, but vampire blood\u2014your blood\u2014saved me.\u201d His breath rushed out on a rough sigh. \u201cDidn\u2019t thank you for that, did I? No, instead, I just went right ahead with my plans. I wanted revenge. I wanted Latham taken out, and I didn\u2019t care who stood in my way.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her. \u201cI fucking care now.\u201d</p><p>And he heard the faintest of rustles in the hallway. Footsteps. Someone closing in.</p><p>He brushed his lips over hers. \u201cI care now,\u201d he said again, and went to face the threat coming for them.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d Sean demanded as he glanced around at the two dead bodies that littered the ground. The dead werewolves were slowly shifting back into their human forms.</p><p>Jamie straightened his shoulders. She could feel the determination coursing through his veins. \u201cThe Blood Queen is inside.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d just defeated a small army in order to get to her.</p><p>Sean grabbed his arm. \u201cHow do you even know the witch is telling the truth? That whole story about waking her could be a bunch of BS. We might get in there and just find Latham waiting to gut us.\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced at him. \u201cBrian burned himself out casting the spell for Latham, and he understands...my brother hates weakness. It\u2019s only a matter of time before Latham kills Brian. The witch knows it, even if he can\u2019t see his death coming.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t \u2018see\u2019 it? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitches can see much in this world, and beyond it. Brian saw how to trap the Blood Queen, and he set the spell so that only a werewolf alpha could free her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn alpha like you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded. Then they were running down a hallway. Attacking more wolves. Killing their own kind.</p><p>As Jamie gazed around, searching for more enemies, Iona realized that she knew this place.</p><p>Her prison.</p><p>Jamie stopped before a too-familiar metal door. \u201cI\u2019ll wake her, and she\u2019ll be my weapon.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf she wants to keep living,\u201d Jamie said as he lifted his claw-tipped hand toward that door, \u201cthen she\u2019ll need my blood. So she\u2019ll do what I want.\u201d</p><p>And she knew...He was just like Latham. Not caring what happened to her. Not giving a shit at all.</p><p>Maybe he deserved the same death as his brother.</p><p>Then Jamie and Sean were inside the room. Jamie inhaled the scent of the ocean. Saw the wispy curtains. Saw the body lying in the bed. So still.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s stare locked on her prone form. Sean grabbed him again. \u201cThis is a bad idea. There\u2019s a reason she\u2019s under, man. The woman is evil.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t. Sure, she\u2019d done bad things, but only to those who\u2019d come after her. She\u2019d never hurt an innocent. Iona didn\u2019t care what the twisted lies claimed about her.</p><p>Only Jamie didn\u2019t think she looked evil. She was in his head, and she knew that he thought she looked...beautiful.</p><p>Insane man. She looked like a corpse.</p><p>\u201cGo outside,\u201d Jamie ordered Sean. \u201cGuard the door, just in case...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case the crazy bitch gets loose and kills you?\u201d</p><p>She felt his annoyance. \u201cIn case we\u2019ve been tracked. I don\u2019t want anyone stopping me. Not until I put the bond in place.\u201d</p><p>Bond. The word trembled through her.</p><p>Jamie cut his wrist. It was so strange to watch as he put his wrist\u2014his blood\u2014to her mouth. He tried to force her to drink. Frustration churned within him when her eyes didn\u2019t open. \u201cMaybe you are dead.\u201d</p><p>Then she saw her own eyes open. \u201cI\u2019m not dead...\u201d A weak, raspy voice. Her voice. \u201cBut you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie yanked open the door and put his claws at the werewolf\u2019s throat. Sean froze with his hands up in the air. Then he demanded, \u201cFuck me, man, is that how you answer a door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when I smell Latham\u2019s scent.\u201d And his brother\u2019s scent was definitely on Sean. Jamie grabbed the guy and hauled him inside. \u201cWant to tell me what the hell is happening?\u201d</p><p>Sean swallowed. \u201cHe\u2019s coming for you.\u201d His gaze darted to the bed. \u201cFor her.\u201d</p> <p>That had been the plan. Before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed your mind, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Sean charged. He shoved away from Jamie. \u201cDammit, I knew this would happen. I saw the way you were looking at her in that bar. When she said she was gonna drink from me...shit, you went postal.\u201d</p><p>Postal? Huh. Jamie had thought that he\u2019d held onto his control pretty well. All things considered. He had remembered that Sean was his best friend. So he hadn\u2019t shoved his claws into Sean\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cShe was the big secret weapon.\u201d Sean marched around the bed. \u201cYou were supposed to use her, not fall for her.\u201d Sean\u2019s gaze drifted from Iona\u2019s still body back up to Jamie. \u201cI guess you are more like your brother than you want to think.\u201d</p><p>In an instant, Jamie had his friend against the wall, and his claws were out. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d There were some lines that he wouldn\u2019t even let Sean cross.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d Sean demanded, not backing down at all. \u201cI trusted you. I gave you my loyalty, my life. Latham\u2019s a twisted freak, but he managed to walk the thin sanity line until he met her. Your brother couldn\u2019t have her, and he went batshit. If she wasn\u2019t his, then she was nobody\u2019s. He locked her up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s fist and claws drove into the wall as his fury erupted. \u201cHe was always batshit! I saw it from the moment he came to the pack. He\u2019d get off on torturing the weak. Hell, he almost killed you when you were only six.\u201d But Jamie had stopped him. He\u2019d always had to stop him. Story of my life. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember, but I do. How the hell do you think you became an orphan? He was the one to kill your parents. He was the one who came after you. I told my father. I told him, but no one would believe me. Why would a wolf attack his own kind?\u201d</p><p>Sean stared at him with stunned eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a demented psychopath,\u201d Jamie said, answering his own question as he yanked his claws out of the wall and stepped back. \u201cAnd I am nothing like him.\u201d He turned away from Sean and glanced over at the bed.</p><p>Iona\u2019s eyes were open. She was sitting up in bed. Staring at him. Shit.</p><p>\u201cYou want her just as much as he does,\u201d Sean said from behind him, but the werewolf\u2019s voice shook with pain and sorrow.</p> <p>I shouldn\u2019t have told him like that. Sean deserved better. To him, Sean was his brother, not Latham.</p><p>\u201cRemember your big plan?\u201d Sean said and now he was getting angry. So Jamie wasn\u2019t really surprised when the guy said\u2014right in front of Iona\u2014that, \u201cPart of that plan was that I\u2019d let Latham find me. I\u2019d offer him a deal. Tell him that you\u2019d trade her for peace.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s eyes were on Iona. \u201cThat was just a lie to bring him out. To get him to face me. I wasn\u2019t going to make a deal.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t trade you. He\u2019d thought to defeat Latham, not to actually give Iona to the bastard.</p><p>She just stared back at him. He couldn\u2019t read a single emotion on her face or in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI held up my part of the agreement,\u201d Sean snapped. \u201cI went to him. Found him while he was torturing some human named Greg. I told Latham, and now he\u2019s coming to meet you. Latham sent me to deliver a message. He wants you and the vamp to meet him at her old compound, at midnight.\u201d</p><p>The plan had been to draw out Latham. To force him to face-off against Jamie. Only...Jamie had planned to be riding high off the rush that came from Iona\u2019s powerful blood. Finally, a fair fight between the brothers. He\u2019d planned to drink and drink from her.</p><p>Then use her to distract his brother so that he could go in for the kill.</p><p>I can\u2019t. Because what if he was wrong? What if he wasn\u2019t strong enough? And if Latham got to Iona...</p> <p>Iona cut her gaze to Sean. She studied him a moment, then gave a curt nod. \u201cWe meet at midnight.\u201d</p><p>No. Jamie hurried toward her. He leaned over the bed and had to fight to keep his hands off Iona. Don\u2019t touch her when your claws are out. You can hurt her. \u201cI\u2019ll go after him myself. You don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to be the instrument of your vengeance.\u201d She pushed from the bed. Walked right by him. \u201cAnd now you don\u2019t want to use me?\u201d</p><p>The blood memories. So she had gotten them all while she slept. No more hiding. His shoulders stiffened. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>Her burning gaze touched on him and said that she did.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he told her and meant it. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want any more lies or secrets between us. I was an idiot then. I didn\u2019t know you, and I thought\u2014I thought who you were didn\u2019t matter.\u201d But she\u2019d gotten under his skin. Into his very blood and soul. \u201cYou matter,\u201d he said, the words too simple.</p><p>A furrow appeared between her eyes. \u201cYou expect me to believe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hated that he had an avid audience watching his every word. Jeez, could Sean not give them some privacy for an instant? \u201cI expect you to believe that I was an idiot. I was bent only on getting my own justice, and I didn\u2019t realize the cost to you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath seemed to come faster. Her eyes blazed. \u201cYou tied us together. For me to live, I\u2019ll have to keep taking your blood.\u201d</p><p>Shame burned through him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved away his apology with an angry swipe of her hand. \u201cAnd you think I\u2019d just let you waltz out there and face Latham alone? If he kills you, I\u2019m dead, too.\u201d</p><p>He realized the enormity of just what he\u2019d done to her. Like an apology was gonna cut it. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on dying. I\u2019ll kill him, and when this is over...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? We\u2019ll stay together, because you\u2019ve bound us?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll give you as much blood as you need, anytime you want it. You don\u2019t have to stay with me. You can...\u201d He stopped and cleared his throat. I want her with me. But he wanted her happiness more. \u201cYou can go anywhere you want,\u201d Jamie forced himself to say, \u201cdo anything you want, and I\u2019ll make sure the blood is always sent to you.\u201d He\u2019d be her personal donor, for as long as she wanted.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>She closed in on him and put her hand on his chest. Right over the heart that just seemed to beat only for her now. \u201cAnd what about you? If you don\u2019t get my blood, you won\u2019t be the all powerful werewolf that you so desperately want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also won\u2019t live forever without your blood,\u201d Sean pointed out as he crept closer to them. His voice was controlled now, but Jamie knew the control was an act. I\u2019m sorry, Sean. He\u2019d kept the secret about Sean\u2019s parents for too long. But if he\u2019d told Sean the truth back then, the guy would have gone after Latham.</p><p>And gotten killed.</p><p>Sean was just a foot away now. Shoulders up. Head back. Eyes too determined. \u201cAll my research showed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Iona\u2019s head jerked toward him. \u201cResearch? What research?\u201d</p><p>Sean\u2019s face reddened. \u201cThere\u2019s...ah...a few mated werewolf and vampire couples these days. When they share blood, they stop aging. We even found one couple that had been together for seventy years, and the werewolf doesn\u2019t look a day over twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Iona\u2019s gaze came back to Jamie. So much suspicion in that gaze. He hated that look. I want her trust.</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear to be in the mood to give it to him.</p><p>\u201cSo as long as you have my blood, you get to live forever, huh? I\u2019m betting your brother,\u201d Iona said the word like the curse it was, \u201cknew all this, too. That\u2019s why he just wouldn\u2019t take my hell, no for an answer when he asked me to mate with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m killing him...\u201d Latham would never touch her again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do that. I can fight my own battles, and pick my own mate.\u201d</p><p>A mate that isn\u2019t you. He knew exactly what she meant. His fingers lifted. Curled around the hand that she still had pressed over his heart. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just your battle. He took my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine fuckin\u2019, too,\u201d Sean snarled.</p><p>Jamie flinched.</p><p>Iona\u2019s small, pink tongue slid over her bottom lip. \u201cI-I know.\u201d Her gaze darted to Sean. Jamie saw the sympathy in her stare, then her stare returned to him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him keep hurting and torturing. I will stop him.\u201d Then, he confessed his shame, \u201cAs I should have stopped him years ago.\u201d Because if he had, then none of this would ever have happened. His parents\u2019 deaths. The slaughter of the wolves in their pack. Her imprisonment. \u201cI won\u2019t walk away this time.\u201d</p><p>He was alpha now. He\u2019d been ten when Latham killed Sean\u2019s family. Jamie\u2019s father hadn\u2019t believed his tale. He\u2019d said it was a child\u2019s wild imagination.</p><p>Latham had been furious with Jamie for trying to reveal his slaughter. His brother had found him, separated him from the others...As soon as I\u2019m alpha, I\u2019ll take your head, brother. Latham\u2019s threat had whispered through his head so many nights when he\u2019d been a child.</p><p>But now...I\u2019m coming to take your head, Latham.</p><p>Jamie had fought to be strong. He had his wolf, a fierce, powerful beast that knew how to battle. How to survive. How to conquer.</p><p>And his blood had woken Iona. Only an alpha\u2019s blood could have woken her. He was an alpha. The power was inside of him, as it had always been. Maybe that was why Latham had hated him so much. Maybe his brother had known that, one day, the life-or-death battle would come between them as they fought for dominance.</p><p>That day is now.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were different.\u201d Iona\u2019s voice was so soft now. Not soft because of sadness, but because of the fury he saw blazing in her eyes. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have been different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am different.\u201d He pressed her hand harder against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll prove that to you.\u201d</p><p>But she laughed and the sound cut into him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to prove. I\u2019m in your blood, wolf. I know you.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to hers. Kissed her hard and deep and wild. Kissed her with all of the consuming passion and lust that he felt for her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re in mine,\u201d he gritted out against her lips. \u201cI feel like you\u2019re a part of me.\u201d</p><p>Sean cursed and backed the hell away from them.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s gaze searched hers. Her breath heaved but she didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>He did. \u201cYou\u2019re a part that I didn\u2019t even know was missing...the best part of me.\u201d His heart.</p><p>Then, because it was what he had to do, Jamie stepped away from her. He turned to face Sean. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your parents. I didn\u2019t tell you...because I knew you. Even at six, you would have challenged him. You would have died.\u201d He hadn\u2019t been powerful enough to save Sean. Not then.</p><p>And he\u2019d kept the secret, kept it for so many years, because Latham\u2019s power had just continued to grow. Jamie hadn\u2019t wanted to risk his best friend\u2019s life. He\u2019d protected him the only way he knew how...by staying silent.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a time for silence any longer. It was a time for vengeance.</p><p>Jamie exhaled slowly. \u201cIf Latham said midnight, then we\u2019re getting there as soon as night falls. We\u2019re not going to give him a chance to set a trap.\u201d They were only going to let Latham die.</p><p>\u201cOf course, there\u2019s going to be a trap,\u201d Iona said, but her voice wasn\u2019t quite steady. \u201cWith Latham, there\u2019s always a trap. Werewolves in the shadows, vamps ready to betray their own kind, witches with their spells...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a witch this time,\u201d Jamie pointed out with a fast glance her way. \u201cSo there\u2019s no power for him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there?\u201d Iona asked as she swept past him. \u201cLatham doesn\u2019t make mistakes when it comes to battle. He killed Brian, yes, but I\u2019m betting that was only because he\u2019d already found another witch who was more powerful. A witch he\u2019ll try to use against us in our midnight battle.\u201d</p><p>The kick in his gut told Jamie that she was right.</p><p>\u201cSo we need to be ready to fight that witch with our own magic.\u201d From the corner of his eye, Jamie saw the flames begin to dance over Iona\u2019s hands. \u201cAnd when it comes to magic, this time, I will be holding my own.\u201d The flames flared higher. Jamie\u2019s eyes met Iona\u2019s. The gold in her gaze matched the flames.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>Death had never been so gorgeous. Latham was a fool. Against them, he\u2019d have no chance.</p><p>Time for his brother to die.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cI want you to bite me.\u201d</p><p>Iona blinked at the low, growling words. They were inside the heavy walls that had once surrounded her old home, and the scent of ash teased her nose, a reminder of the fire and death she\u2019d dealt earlier.</p><p>Her head turned so that she faced Jamie. Sean was about fifty yards away, perched carefully at the top of the west side wall. A group of trees grew near the wall, partially concealing Sean as he watched...and held a rifle equipped with silver bullets.</p><p>\u201cMy blood can increase your power,\u201d Jamie told her as his gaze searched hers. \u201cYou know it can. A werewolf\u2019s blood can amp you up for the battle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So it could. The blood of paranormals always seemed to pulse with power. And she would love to have more power before she faced off against Latham but... \u201cIf I take more from you, then you\u2019ll just grow weak before the fight.\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cNot if you give me your blood, too.\u201d</p><p>An exchange. To make them both stronger. Yes, they needed it, but for some reason, when he asked for her blood, it made her feel...used.</p> <p>So she narrowed her eyes and told him, \u201cThe first time I fucked you, I did it because I wanted to make Latham angry. I wanted him to catch your scent on me. I wanted him to know that I was giving my body to someone else.\u201d Anyone else. Not just\u2014</p><p>Jamie shook his head. \u201cWhen you lie, a faint line appears right...\u201d He tapped his finger between her brows. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Iona was so shocked she almost fell onto her ass. As it was, she barely managed to keep crouching next to him without lunging for the jerk. \u201cI\u2019m not lying!\u201d She was the Blood Queen. Like she\u2019d have some easy tell that gave away her lies.</p><p>He stroked the spot between her brows. \u201cThere it is again.\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch. She had a tell. All these centuries, and no one had mentioned it to her before? Wonderful.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said as if reading her mind, \u201cI doubt anyone else noticed. I just know because I can never seem to take my eyes off you.\u201d His hand fell away. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, I made love with you the first time because I wanted you more than I wanted breath. That\u2019s the same reason I did the second time, too. And the reason I\u2019ll do it every chance I get.\u201d</p><p>Arrogant wolf. \u201cI did want to piss off Latham.\u201d But...more...Time for her truth. \u201cI also just wanted you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes seemed to darken.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you needed to hear?\u201d She demanded, angry. \u201cThat you could make the Blood Queen want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really give a shit about the Blood Queen,\u201d he said, the Irish thickening in his voice. \u201cI care about Iona. She\u2019s the one I want. Not some evil queen who is supposed to give little kids nightmares.\u201d</p><p>Nightmares? Really?</p> <p>\u201cI want to give you my blood now because I want to make sure you\u2019re as strong as you can be. And, no,\u201d he muttered, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to give me yours. Just take mine. Just...be strong. I don\u2019t want Latham to ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>The wolf was sure acting like he actually cared about what happened to her.</p><p>And she did need his blood.</p><p>Iona lifted his hand to her mouth. Her fangs sank into his wrist, and the image of them\u2014in that horrible room, her on the bed, him leaning over her\u2014flashed in her mind. Then his blood slipped over her tongue\u2014warm, spicy, that delicious taste that was only Jamie\u2014and her eyes locked with his.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see calculation in his gaze. No secrets. Just desire.</p><p>His power fueled her, heating her body from the inside out. She drank, taking in that wonderful blood and power. Then her tongue licked over his skin as she tried to soothe the small marks that she\u2019d left behind.</p><p>Her head lifted. His taste was still in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted another woman the way I want you.\u201d Gravel-rough, the words seemed torn from him. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never met another woman who was so far out of my reach.\u201d</p> <p>She was less than a foot away from him.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to do it all over again, I\u2019d find another way to break the spell. I wouldn\u2019t force you to be bound to me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help it. Iona laughed at that. Clueless werewolf. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m the one being forced?\u201d Her hand lifted and curled under the hard square of his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m over sixteen hundred years old. I can stir fire with a thought. I\u2019m about to turn your brother to ash...\u201d She smiled at him and knew her fangs would flash. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to be forced to stay with me, wolf. Do you actually believe I\u2019d ever let my blood supply get away?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>Men. Always thinking it was all about them.</p><p>She shook her head and turned away.</p><p>He caught her hand. Held her tight. \u201cLove, the only way I\u2019d ever leave you...you\u2019d have to tell me to leave. Cause otherwise, I\u2019d count myself lucky to be at your side.\u201d</p><p>She stilled. Then her heartbeat kicked up in a double-time rhythm. Jamie sounded as if he meant the words. She stared into his eyes and searched for the truth.</p><p>He did mean them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d She asked him, barely recognizing the soft voice as her own.</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d Just as soft, but his words were darker. So deep. \u201cBut I\u2019ll start with this...give me a chance. Give us a chance. Let me show you that I\u2019m not just a beast.\u201d</p><p>She already knew that.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you the man I can be. Let me\u2014\u201d Jamie broke off, his nostrils flaring. Then he spun away from her. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t caught Latham\u2019s scent yet, but she\u2019d take Jamie\u2019s word for it. Her gaze darted to the big wall surrounding the old compound. She saw the dark shadows scaling the stones, climbing over the wall. Coming for us. Iona counted at least a dozen forms.</p><p>\u201cVampires...werewolves...\u201d Jamie\u2019s claws were bursting from his hands as his shift started. \u201cWhat we...expected...\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was. Now it was time to give Latham what he didn\u2019t expect. She barred her throat to Jamie. \u201cBite.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were more beast than man. \u201cYou don\u2019t...\u201d He still tried to speak with a man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI want you to drink.\u201d</p><p>His hand lifted. His claws seemed to tremble, then he sliced lightly over her skin. His dark head lowered. His tongue rasped over her wound.</p><p>She shuddered against him. Her eyes closed. His lips brushed over her. His claws were at her waist, but he was so careful not to hurt her.</p><p>Latham had never been careful with anyone or anything.</p><p>A shot echoed through the night. She knew the sound had to come from Sean as he took out prey with his silver bullets. Those werewolves fighting with Latham had picked the wrong side.</p><p>Their mistake.</p><p>Sean had chosen a position of his own on top of the west wall. A position that let him take out his prey as he wanted, picking them off with his silver bullets, one at a time.</p><p>\u201cGet away from her!\u201d Latham\u2019s enraged roar. Showtime. \u201cYou bastard, that\u2019s my queen!\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s tongue licked over her flesh once more. A rough caress. Then he was pulling back. Gazing at her with a gaze that burned with emotions she didn\u2019t want to name. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, voice thundering out just as powerfully as his brother\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Then he whirled toward Latham. The two brothers charged at one another. Shifting werewolves were on the ground, some in pain because silver bullets had ripped into them, some were just contorting from the force of their transformations.</p><p>And the vampires who\u2019d sold their loyalty to Latham were there, standing back because they\u2019d caught sight of her. She heard their whispers...</p><p>\u201cBlood Queen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack and pissed,\u201d Iona clarified, letting her voice ring out and not glancing over at Latham and Jamie even as the scent of blood deepened in the air. \u201cSo come closer, and try to take me down, if you think you\u2019re strong enough.\u201d Then she crooked her index finger at them, daring the fools to come and get her.</p><p>Because she needed them closer. They had to be close for her fire to reach them. Just a little closer...</p><p>A tall, red-headed vampire made the mistake of lunging for her.</p><p>When he was within range of her power, she tossed a ball of fire right at his chest. He hit the ground, screaming and rolling as he tried to put out a fire that just wouldn\u2019t be stopped. Only she could stop those flames. Iona wasn\u2019t in the mood to stop them.</p><p>The other vampires froze.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Iona challenged.</p><p>Bones crunched behind her. More shifting wolves. She turned and saw a big, gray wolf rushing toward her.</p><p>A shot thundered out.</p><p>The wolf fell, a silver bullet embedded in his spine. There was a shout then, and Iona saw Sean jump down from his position on the wall. He attacked, fighting the wolves that had come for him.</p><p>He was fighting\u2014and winning his battle.</p><p>Iona\u2019s gaze darted to the right. Sean and Latham weren\u2019t in human form any longer. Two big, fierce black wolves were fighting, tangled in claws and teeth and blood. The wolves\u2014they looked just alike to her. She wasn\u2019t sure which wolf was winning the battle...or which wolf was Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m next!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice shouted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not afraid of that bitch!\u201d</p><p>You should be.</p><p>The line of vamps parted. A woman rushed forward. A small woman with long, curly, brown hair. She smirked at Iona and fire rose above the woman\u2019s delicate palm. \u201cSee? I can do it, too.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so this was the new witch that Latham had picked up. Being right felt so good. \u201cI\u2019m not drugged this time.\u201d Iona felt she should point out that little fact.</p><p>The witch frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how Latham\u2019s first witch got the advantage. The drugs in my system slowed me down...\u201d Iona threw her flames at the woman. The witch\u2019s hair caught fire, and the woman screamed as she stumbled back. \u201cI\u2019m not slow now...and lady, I\u2019m a hell of a lot stronger than you!\u201d</p><p>The witch\u2014minus a whole lot of hair\u2014ran away, shrieking. Easy enough. Too easy. Must be slim-pickings when it came to magic power these days.</p><p>Iona lifted her hands into the air. It was time to send a message to the paranormals out there. She didn\u2019t want to be looking over her shoulder, worried that others would come and hunt her.</p><p>They needed to be too afraid to even whisper her name.</p><p>Blood Queen. She could be her, again, in order to be free.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d she ordered the fools still around her. \u201cOr die.\u201d Then she called up the magic inside, letting it whip through her and form a circle of fire, a bright ring that closed around her and the two black wolves that fought a life-or-death battle. Everyone else was on the outside, and the fire snapped out at those vampires and werewolves, attacking with greedy tendrils of flame that ignited flesh and sent shrieks into the night.</p><p>Most ran. They would be the ones to spread the new story of the Blood Queen\u2019s rebirth.</p><p>As for the ones who didn\u2019t run? The slow? The idiots who still thought they could kill her?</p><p>They died.</p><p>And then there was only Iona...in the circle with her wolves.</p><p>She could kill them both with a thought. Send the fire ripping at them but...</p><p>Iona didn\u2019t want Jamie to die. Which wolf?</p><p>She needed to see their eyes. Their scents were too linked then\u2014they were too close to each other. There was too much blood. If she could just look into the wolves\u2019 eyes, she\u2019d know her lover.</p><p>The claws of one wolf shoved into his opponent\u2019s stomach. A long, mournful howl filled the night. The injured beast heaved on his side and slowly, slowly began to transform.</p><p>The fur melted from his body. Familiar, golden flesh emerged once more. She knew the strong line of that jaw. Knew the heavy slash of those cheeks.</p><p>The other beast snarled into the air, a cry of fury and dominance. Then the beast turned to face Iona.</p><p>Not Jamie\u2019s eyes. But then, she\u2019d already known her lover was the one bleeding out on the ground.</p><p>She lifted her hands and tossed as much fire as she could at Latham. She wanted that bastard to burn.</p><p>Only, he didn\u2019t burn. The flames just sank into his thick fur and disappeared. Tendrils of smoke drifted into the air.</p><p>The snap and crunch of his bones reached her ears. He shifted before her, a fast, brutal shift.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see Jamie\u2019s body behind him. Was Jamie still alive? And why did it feel like someone had ripped out her heart?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got so much of your blood pumping in me,\u201d Latham snarled as he closed in on Iona and grabbed her wrists. His hold was rough, too strong, so painful it felt like he was about to break her bones. \u201cThanks to all that blood, your magic can\u2019t hurt me, Iona. Nothing can anymore.\u201d</p><p>The fire sure couldn\u2019t. But she wasn\u2019t about to give up yet. \u201cThen let\u2019s just see what my teeth can do...\u201d And she sank her fangs into his throat.</p><p>His blood burned her, going down as hot as acid on her tongue, but she didn\u2019t let him go. She\u2019d drain him, if that was her only way and\u2014</p><p>He screamed and pulled away from her.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t pull away. Jamie had snatched Latham back. Because her Jamie wasn\u2019t dead. He was on his feet and he\u2019d spun Latham around to face him...spun him around and, as she watched, Jamie shoved his claws into his brother\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cShe was the distraction,\u201d Jamie whispered as he let his brother stagger away from him. \u201cYou should have made sure I was dead.\u201d</p><p>Latham\u2019s head swung toward her. He shook his head even as blood pumped from his chest. \u201cI\u2019m...immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore you\u2019re not,\u201d Iona told him. Jamie had been right. Latham was still too fixated on her. Fixated enough to make a fatal mistake.</p><p>He\u2019d turned his back on a werewolf who wanted his blood.</p><p>Latham\u2019s teeth snapped together. \u201cYou won\u2019t...live...without...me!\u201d He rushed toward Iona.</p><p>And Jamie\u2019s claws slashed over his brother\u2019s throat even as the thunder of a gun echoed and a bullet slammed into Latham\u2019s chest.</p><p>Sean...doing his job and avenging his parents. Overkill could be a good thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Iona slowly walked around Latham\u2019s body. Jamie stood over his brother, chest heaving, and with blood dripping from his claws.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m still living just fine,\u201d Iona murmured to the dead werewolf. She was living, and Latham had finally gotten just what he deserved.</p><p>His eyes were wide open. His face twisted in horrified disbelief. He truly hadn\u2019t thought that he\u2019d die.</p> <p>He\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>She stared down into his eyes. She could still see the madness there. Even in death. \u201cI went to Latham...\u201d It seemed like another life. Maybe because it was. \u201cBecause I wanted to form a truce between the vampires and the werewolves. I didn\u2019t want more bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>When blood was all they had around them.</p><p>She looked away from Latham. Stared up at Jamie. \u201cI wish you\u2019d been in the pack when I came calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d</p> <p>Her head tilted as she studied him. \u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved you from the start.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and shook her head. \u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t love me, Iona.\u201d</p><p>They were standing over his brother\u2019s body. It wasn\u2019t a place to talk about love. Not the right place. Not the right time. There was too much death here. Too many memories.</p><p>And she wouldn\u2019t lie. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel for you.\u201d At that moment, she just felt...relieved. One less monster to face.</p> <p>Finally, she was free. Latham would never hurt her again. Free.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s gaze held her own. \u201cDo you think,\u201d he asked her softly, \u201cthat one day, you might?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes wanted to sting with tears. Tears, from the Blood Queen? What had happened to her? Maybe it was the place. The echoes of pain and sadness. Get away. She couldn\u2019t be there any longer.</p><p>Or maybe...maybe it was Jamie. He was asking for things that she wasn\u2019t sure that she could give to him. Fifteen years...gone. She wanted to see the world again. See what had changed. Learn how she\u2019d changed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t talk to him about love then. She needed her freedom.</p><p>A freedom that their bond had taken away.</p><p>Iona spun around, giving him her back. Then she began to walk away, from Latham and from Jamie. Every step that she took tore at her heart.</p><p>What was she supposed to feel for Jamie? Everything had happened too soon. Love couldn\u2019t come this way for her.</p> <p>She needed time. Time was stolen from me. Now I have to learn to live again.</p><p>Good thing that she was a vampire. Time was on her side. Always.</p><p>\u201cIona!\u201d Jamie\u2019s cry stopped her. Not because he yelled after her with fury or desperation. But because he said her name with...love. Maybe he\u2019d been saying it that way for a while now, and she just hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped calling me \u2018baby\u2019 and he\u2019d been calling me \u2018love.\u2019\u201d Her throat ached. She glanced back at him. He hadn\u2019t moved. He wasn\u2019t trying to stop her from leaving him. Maybe because Jamie knew that she\u2019d have to come back to him, sooner or later.</p><p>The blood would always bind them.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you ever might?\u201d Jamie said the words softly, with blood on his flesh, with his claws out, and with his eyes so fierce and bright.</p><p>She needed to give him an answer. Iona just wasn\u2019t sure what to say. So she didn\u2019t speak, but, almost helplessly, she found herself nodding. It was a small movement, and she wasn\u2019t even sure he noticed it. Then she saw the hope on his face and knew that he had.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t stay with you because we have to be together.\u201d She\u2019d come to hate him then, just as he\u2019d hate her if she forced him to stay at her side. \u201cIt should be...we should be together because that\u2019s what we want. Because anything else is unthinkable to us.\u201d That was why she had to get away then. Latham was dead. The battle over. Now she had to figure out what the hell she wanted. What she needed.</p><p>So with her head up and her back straight, she began walking once more. She passed by the dead. Passed a silent Sean. She didn\u2019t let her tears fall. After all, she truly was the daughter of a king, and she wouldn\u2019t let anyone see her break. Not Sean. And not even the one man who\u2019d managed to touch a heart she\u2019d long thought was ice-cold.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that you\u2019re ready for this?\u201d The witch stood over Jamie, a silver knife gripped in his hand.</p><p>The tip of that knife burned molten.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt like a bitch,\u201d the witch warned then the guy gave a long whistle. \u201cI sure as hell hope the woman is worth it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gritted his teeth. Ray was a smart-ass, some witch that Sean had literally dug up from a hole in Mexico, but the guy knew his magic.</p><p>Well, his dark magic anyway.</p><p>And he knew how to break the bond that locked Jamie\u2019s blood to Iona\u2019s.</p><p>Two months. Two long fucking months had passed since she\u2019d walked away from him in LA.</p><p>He knew where she was, of course, because it wasn\u2019t easy to overlook a woman like her.</p><p>He\u2019d sent his blood sent to her. Werewolf take-out. But he hadn\u2019t gone to her, because he couldn\u2019t offer her the one thing that she needed.</p><p>Choice.</p><p>He\u2019d taken that from Iona when he gave her his blood.</p><p>I can\u2019t stay with you because we have to be together. Her voice haunted his nights. And his days. It should be...we should be together because that\u2019s what we want. Because anything else is unthinkable to us.</p><p>Anything else was unthinkable to him, and without her, he was going insane. Slowly, moment-by-brittle-moment insane.</p><p>He needed her. He wanted her. And, hell, yeah, he\u2019d get his heart cut out for her. Not because you have to be with me. Once the spell was broken, she could stay because that was what she wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cYou have to sever the bond to free your vampire.\u201d Ray looked a little too comfortable holding that knife three inches above Jamie\u2019s chest.</p><p>Sean stood in the background muttering once more about bad ideas and wrong choices. The same song he\u2019d been singing when they first went to wake up Iona.</p><p>\u201cAm I gonna live through this?\u201d Jamie asked the witch.</p><p>Ray frowned at that. \u201cYou expect to live?\u201d He seemed surprised. \u201cI thought it was just about her living.\u201d He began to lower the knife. \u201cI can\u2019t make any guarantees for you.\u201d</p><p>Sean lunged forward and grabbed Ray\u2019s wrist. \u201cGuarantee it.\u201d Lethally soft.</p><p>Ray swallowed.</p><p>Jamie stared at the tip of the knife.</p><p>\u201cI-I...he should survive. It will hurt, probably worse than anything he\u2019s ever felt, but he\u2019ll live...and his vampire will be free.\u201d</p><p>That was what he needed to know. \u201cCut me,\u201d Jamie ordered and his hands fisted, pulling against the heavy chains that held him place. Silver chains that Ray insisted were necessary.</p><p>Not a good sign. But at least he\u2019d stopped feeling the burn from those chains now.</p><p>Jamie closed his eyes. Pictured Iona. His beautiful queen.</p><p>Then the knife stabbed into his chest, bringing the fires of hell, and he roared her name.</p><p>Pain exploded in her chest. Burning, white-hot, twisting and cutting and tearing into her flesh.</p><p>Iona opened her mouth to scream but found she didn\u2019t have any breath. The smell of burning flesh filled her nose even as bile rose in her throat.</p><p>What is happening to me?</p><p>She\u2019d been on her way to find Jamie. She\u2019d discovered a witch who knew a way to break their bond. Only...</p><p>Another burst of pain had her nearly on her knees.</p><p>Iona screamed and realized that another cry had echoed her own.</p><p>Her head lifted as sweat soaked her clothes. She stared at the house before her, the one nestled off the main road and hiding in the shadow of thick trees.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s house. The roar she\u2019d heard, it had been her name. His voice.</p><p>Iona forced her body to straighten. Jamie. Fear and adrenaline rushed through her.</p><p>Another pain-filled roar shook the night, and she ran forward. Iona kicked in the house\u2019s front door.</p><p>Two men\u2014probably werewolves\u2014turned and lunged at her. She knocked them back and followed the echo of that roar down a hallway. Then to the right. Another kick and the door before her flew off its hinges.</p><p>A man whirled toward her. Some guy with too-long red hair. He had a long, wickedly sharp knife in his hand. The blade was glowing red.</p><p>Jamie was on a table, chained. Smoke rose slowly from his flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to him?\u201d Iona leapt for him.</p><p>Someone grabbed her from behind. \u201cWait!\u201d A familiar voice shouted in her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s a witch, he\u2019s breaking the bond and\u2014\u201d</p><p>And she tossed Sean into the nearest wall. Iona advanced on the witch. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting him.\u201d Us. She rubbed her own aching chest. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d She raised her hands. Let the fire burn.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d the man muttered with eyes that had doubled in size.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie\u2019s snarl.</p><p>Her head snapped toward him. Surely he wasn\u2019t protecting his attacker?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...almost...finished...\u201d Sweat soaked his body. The brightness of his eyes had dimmed. \u201cOne more slice, and you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>She pushed the man\u2014now she knew he was a witch\u2014away and rushed to Jamie\u2019s side. When she saw his chest, she had to bite her lip to hold back her own scream of fury. It looked like the skin had been branded, a dark, fierce red. But she knew the knife was enchanted and the branding wasn\u2019t just on the surface.</p><p>The brand would go all the way around his heart.</p><p>No, not all the way, not yet. Jamie had said that he needed one more slice.</p><p>The floor creaked behind her.</p><p>Iona spun around and grabbed the knife from the witch\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Jamie urged her. \u201cFinish it. Be free...then you can come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch was cutting out your heart!\u201d She\u2019d found her own witch, a woman who told her this could be done, that this was the way to sever the tie between them.</p><p>Take out the heart and the bond is broken.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jamie shook his head and jerked on the chains. Silver chains. The fool werewolf had let himself be locked down with silver chains. \u201cI\u2019ll still live,\u201d Jamie told her. \u201cRay\u2019s not actually taking my heart\u2014\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, she knew how the magic worked. The enchanted blade both cut and healed at the same time. The witch would cut a circle around the heart, severing its connection to the body. Then, in the next instant, the blade would burn and heal\u2014reconnecting the heart with magic. The severing and healing would continue until a full circle had been cast around the heart.</p><p>Brutal. Hellish. Iona knew that the agony she\u2019d felt was just a psychic echo of the pain that he\u2019d experienced. Her witch had warned her of that, too.</p><p>When one is sacrificed, the other will feel the whisper of the pain. Just a whisper. The real agony is a hundred times stronger than that whisper.</p><p>\u201cA spell.\u201d She glared at the knife.</p><p>\u201cThe knife cuts through the magic that binds you, but he still lives.\u201d Did the witch think those words would make her feel better?</p><p>She knew their hearts were linked. The blood pumping from her heart linked to the blood pumping from his. To cut their ties, a heart had to be severed.</p><p>And Jamie, he was willing to face the agony, for her?</p><p>She licked her lips. Felt tears on her cheeks. Not about breaking. About living. \u201cYou\u2019re not like Latham.\u201d</p><p>He stared up at her. His face was too pale. Her wolf looked too weak. \u201cTold...you...\u201d</p><p>She snapped the knife and let the pieces fall from her fingers. The witch gasped and got the hell back.</p><p>Sean had picked himself off the floor. He stood back, too. Smart guy.</p><p>She grabbed the chain around Jamie\u2019s right wrist. Shattered the heavy silver. Did the same with the links that bound his left hand.</p><p>\u201cI can feel you...\u201d Iona told him, and brought his hand to rest over her heart, \u201cin here.\u201d Even when they were apart, she felt him. Like a caress in her soul, she could feel him touching her.</p><p>His gaze searched hers.</p><p>\u201cYou let him come at you with that knife...\u201d Well, the witch wouldn\u2019t be comingagain since she\u2019d destroyed his knife. \u201cHe would have cut me out of your heart.\u201d And taken you from mine.</p><p>Jamie rose. The back of his hand slid down her cheek, and she turned her face to better feel his touch.</p><p>\u201cNothing will ever take you from my heart,\u201d he told her. The words sounded like a promise.</p><p>He\u2019d been willing to suffer so much...for her.</p><p>Jamie sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI can...I can still send you the blood. I can do whatever you want...\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, then shook his head.</p><p>She put her hands on his shoulders. Those shoulders of his seemed even bigger than before.</p><p>I missed him. \u201cI want you to kiss me, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>His mouth took hers. Ravenous and wild with its hunger. The same hunger that she felt.</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes. She\u2019d lived so long and had never expected to find a man who looked at the Blood Queen and...loved.</p><p>He loves me.</p><p>So she kissed him back. Hot, eager, their mouths met. She didn\u2019t care about the others in the room. They didn\u2019t matter. Nothing, no one mattered to her except him.</p><p>His arms locked around her. He pulled her close, right between his legs as they hung over the edge of the table. His mouth was feverish on hers, his hands seeming to touch her everywhere.</p><p>\u201cMissed you...\u201d Jamie growled the words against her lips. Then his head rose. He stared at her with the eyes of a beast in the face of a man. \u201cYou\u2019re...giving us a chance?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had to shake her head, and when she did, pain flashed in his gaze. Iona spoke quickly, desperate to make him understand as she said, \u201cNo, Jamie, I\u2019m giving us more than a chance.\u201d Her shoe crunched over the remains of the knife. \u201cI want to give us forever.\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened around her. \u201cBe...sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything.\u201d Or anyone.

She\u2019d felt his fear...until he\u2019d seen her.</p><p>Her lips brushed over his once more. He\u2019d woken her up, but not just from Latham\u2019s spell. He\u2019d given her life again.</p> <p>He\u2019d given her love, and it was exactly what she wanted. No, he was what she wanted now.</p><p>Not because they had to be together.</p><p>\u201cBecause anything else is unthinkable,\u201d she whispered. And it was. Her body and soul had ached for him.

Not ever.</p><p>Some bonds weren\u2019t meant to be broken.</p><p>\u201cForever,\u201d Jamie said against her lips. A demand.</p><p>Her werewolf had just spoken true...some bonds really were meant to last forever.</p><p>They kissed again. She tasted the wildness of his beast. The love of the man.</p><p>Forever. </p> </body></html>"]
