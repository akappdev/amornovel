Inspired me to look one up online.\u201d</p><p>Jake Monroe\u2019s gaze narrowed as he eyed the red sports car, awareness rippling down his spine.</p><p>\u201cYou have to custom order one like that,\u201d Chad went on, returning his attention to topping off Jake\u2019s coffee. \u201cI\u2019d do it for Jenn, if I could; but the diner doesn\u2019t bring in that much dough. Who in hell spends a hundred and fifty grand on a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRich, paunchy bald guys who hope to get laid by women young enough to be their daughters.\u201d Jake knew someone else who would. Knew her as well as any man could know his woman. Which was why he was certain she wouldn\u2019t have come back to Whisper Creek after all these years without bringing trouble with her.</p> <p>As the driver\u2019s side door of the Jag swung open, his attention remained riveted. The ragtop was up, shielding the occupant, but he knew exactly who was going to step out by the flare of heat that raced over his skin. \u201cAnd someone like her.\u201d</p><p>One long, black trouser-clad leg extended to the asphalt, then the driver unfolded in a graceful rise. Her blouse was black, too, making a stark contrast to the wild red curls pulled back at her nape. She looked cool and restrained, but he knew the woman inside that exterior was anything but. His body tensed and hardened with primal recognition, his breathing deep and slightly quickened.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Chad murmured, straightening. \u201cCan\u2019t miss that hair, can you? And she\u2019s parked right in front of Tilly\u2019s shop. I haven\u2019t seen Ana in... Shit. How long\u2019s it been now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost ten years.\u201d Nine years, five months, and a couple weeks. It just pissed Jake off that he was still counting down the damn days since Anastasia Miller had driven out of his life without looking back.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Chad shook his head. \u201cWonder if she got what she was after when she left.\u201d</p> <p>Had she? Was it possible she\u2019d found what she was looking for with some other guy in some other place in the world? \u201cGood question.\u201d</p><p>Ana pulled a satchel out from behind the driver\u2019s seat, then shut the door of her expensive toy. She paused, her head turning as if she sensed Jake\u2019s gaze on her. She wore big dark sunglasses, effectively shielding her eyes.</p><p>Her lips were just like he remembered. Full and pink, and capable of blowing his mind. He\u2019d felt those lips all over his body, still felt them sometimes when he was lying in bed at night, stiff and aching from wanting her.</p><p>Rolling her shoulders back, she moved toward the entrance to Tilly\u2019s Yarn Shop with a swift, determined stride. She disappeared through the door and not five minutes later, the ladies who gathered there for tea and gossip came hustling out with their knitting bags. The open sign on the door flipped over to read Please Call Again and the shade that covered the inset glass was yanked down.</p><p>Jake picked up his coffee, considering. \u201cI\u2019ll need the check, Chad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnastasia! My god, baby, I had no idea you\u2019d be coming home.\u201d</p> <p>Ana stared hard at her mother, silently challenging that lie, but Tilly Miller acted as if she didn\u2019t notice her daughter\u2019s frustration and suspicion.</p><p>\u201cLet me see you.\u201d Tilly approached with her arms outstretched and pulled Ana close for a hug. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re heading to a funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may yet,\u201d Ana said grimly.</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about your work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about your work, Mom. Your life\u2019s dream. I\u2019m just here to clean up after you.\u201d</p><p>Tilly stepped back and smoothed a hand over hair that had once been the same vibrant red as her daughter\u2019s, but was now a faded strawberry, sprinkled liberally with white strands. She looked the part of a small-town shopkeeper. Only another world-class thief and grifter would recognize her for what she really was.</p><p>\u201cI made a new pot of tea just before you arrived. Why don\u2019t you sit and we\u2019ll talk? It\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve been home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to play this game.\u201d Ana crossed her arms, her anger simmering. \u201cFrankie\u2019s life is in danger, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>Like their parents, her brother Frank had the same need for the rush, the same fascination for the bright and shiny and illegal. Ana supposed it was in their blood. Inevitable, considering she was named after a famous identity con and Frank was named after an infamous con artist.</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>What a question. Her mother was good at pretending to be clueless. \u201cI know he and Eric would\u2019ve wanted to go into the heist with blanks, but their associate was using live rounds,\u201d Ana said tersely. \u201cWhoever he is, he\u2019s a wild card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always so good at dramatizing things, dear.\u201d Her mother sank into one of the mismatched chairs arranged in a circle near an unlit woodstove.</p><p>Ana had to consciously relax her jaw to speak. \u201cYou know you\u2019ll never be able to fence those diamonds. You knew it when you set this up. The Crown is too distinctive.\u201d</p><p>Tilly poured tea as if she hadn\u2019t a care in the world. \u201cThe Crown of Roses.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSo rare to find any diamond of that deep pink color, but an entire tiara\u2019s worth? Has the piece been stolen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Mom. Do you think I\u2019ve forgotten how you talked about the \u201994 Carlton heist in France? This job in Manhattan was textbook Tilly Miller... until the guard got shot.\u201d</p><p>Digging into her briefcase, Ana yanked out a tablet and tossed it on an empty chair beside her mom\u2019s. \u201cI bought that for you. Look at the newspaper apps on there and read the reports. Did you know that jewelry shop is a Cross Industries property? Gideon Cross has offered a quarter-million dollar reward for information leading to the arrest of the thieves. I\u2019ve been told that amount will increase to half a million if the guard dies.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Tilly paled. \u201cIs he that bad off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had body armor on, but he took two hits: one to the shoulder and another to the thigh. That second hit nicked his femoral artery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear god...\u201d Her mother sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cYou know Frankie would never go along with anything like that. The guard... was it Terence Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ana gripped the back of an old wicker chair. \u201cI already figured out Terence was your inside man. And it\u2019s obvious the shooter wanted him out of the way. A three-way split is much more lucrative. But why not make it a two-way split? Or better yet, take it all. Frank, Eric, Terence, and someone else. Who\u2019s the other guy, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. You had this planned down to the second.\u201d Tilly and Bill Miller were known to spend years planning a job that would take only seconds to pull off. Ana was afraid that since her dad had died, her mom had focused on the heist to bury her grief. And she\u2019d dragged Frankie into it with her.</p><p>Tilly looked at her with stricken eyes. \u201cThere was no fourth guy in the plan. Just Terence, Frankie, and Eric. You know it\u2019s safer to keep the number of people involved to the bare minimum.\u201d</p><p>Ana knew neither Frankie nor Eric would\u2019ve deviated. Tilly would\u2019ve trained them better than that. Most likely Terence had brought in someone to guard his interests, someone he\u2019d thought he could trust... and ended up paying for it.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mom. The shooter is going to turn on Frankie and Eric the first chance he gets, if he hasn\u2019t already. I need to get to him before that happens.\u201d</p><p>Tilly picked up her teacup and saucer, the china rattling as her hands shook. \u201cAre you here for the reward or the gems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why I\u2019m here. You knew I\u2019d come, because you knew who the insurer was before you went after the diamonds. That was part of the fun. I\u2019m sure you figured there\u2019d be no harm done\u2014you mastermind your perfect heist, Frank follows in dad\u2019s footsteps by pulling it off, your daughter claims five percent of the take in a legitimate finder\u2019s fee, and the owner gets their gems back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one was supposed to get hurt,\u201d Tilly breathed, looking stricken.</p><p>\u201cSomeone always gets hurt, Mom. They don\u2019t make stealing illegal just to spoil your fun.\u201d Sighing, Ana pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cWhen were Frankie and Eric supposed to show up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a week.\u201d Tilly met her gaze with unusual somberness. \u201cWe knew the insurance company would bring you in on this, and we didn\u2019t want any lines being drawn between there and here and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ana said sourly.</p><p>\u201cFrank\u2019s not even supposed to call until he gets down to Florida. He and Eric planned on stretching the trip out over a few days.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms, Ana snapped, \u201cNo matter how clever you are, you went into this knowing I could face prosecution along with you. By not turning you in, I could be seen as an accessory after the fact. And if I took the finder\u2019s fee and Frankie\u2019s involvement ever got out, I\u2019d have a hell of a time arguing that I wasn\u2019t a participant in a multi-million dollar fraud against the insurance company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake would never let that happen,\u201d Tilly argued.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t God, Mom,\u201d Ana muttered, her stomach knotting at the thought of facing her high school sweetheart again. Jake Monroe\u2014a man she\u2019d never gotten over. \u201cI\u2019ll have to talk to him. Maybe Eric\u2019s contacted him. I\u2019d expect it, considering how protective Jake is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be staying in Whisper Creek until this is worked out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be staying tonight, at least. If Terence survives\u2014God willing\u2014I\u2019ll be heading back to Manhattan to see him. And if I sniff out any leads on who Terence might\u2019ve brought in as the fourth, I\u2019ll take off to pursue those. How\u2019s the Wi-Fi at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not good. I use the computer here at the shop when I need reliable internet access.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll stay at Victoria\u2019s Inn.\u201d</p><p>Picking up her briefcase, Ana exhaled harshly. \u201cLet me know if you hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnastasia.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice stopped her when she reached the door. \u201cYou\u2019ll watch out for Frankie, won\u2019t you? He\u2019ll be all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, Mom.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t make any promises. She couldn\u2019t even be sure she wouldn\u2019t go down with them.</p><p>Reaching for her sunglasses on the top of her head, she stepped outside.</p><p>And found a deputy U.S. Marshal waiting next to her car.</p><p>Ana\u2019s breath caught and her heartbeat accelerated with a mixture of surprise and guilt.</p><p>The deputy was a tall and leanly built man with cool blue eyes and a firm mouth. His chiseled face was impassive and his arms casually crossed. His long legs were braced slightly apart, anchoring him to the asphalt as he assessed her from head to toe from beneath the brim of his hat.</p> <p>\u201cDeputy,\u201d she greeted him, regaining her composure.</p><p>\u201cAnastasia.\u201d His voice was whisky-rough and it spoke her name like a caress. \u201cWhat brings you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPit stop during a work assignment.\u201d She shoved her free hand into her pocket to hide how it trembled. Wondering if he had more news than Tilly did, she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Eric?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s lips pursed. He had a gorgeous mouth. Neither too full or too thin and perfectly sculpted. That mouth knew every inch of her body. She still had dreams about what he could do with it. \u201cHe headed down to Florida with your brother.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and somehow refrained from shifting on her feet. \u201cI never did like Florida. Too much humidity for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you gonna be in town?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few days, at most.\u201d</p><p>He adjusted his weight, his body moving with sleek fluidity. \u201cSo why are we wasting time talking about nothing?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, absorbing everything about the man she\u2019d left behind. He was harder than before. Bigger, too. He\u2019d been twenty-two the last time she saw him. He was fully a man now, his frame filled out. The formidable strength of will he\u2019d exuded as long as she\u2019d known him hadn\u2019t changed. \u201cAre we supposed to be doing something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting to the point would be good. You staying with Tilly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou married?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll stay at my place, then.\u201d</p> <p>Heat shimmered through her, her pulse quickening. She hadn\u2019t expected him to move so fast. If she was honest, she would admit that she\u2019d been afraid he would brush her off, having long gotten over her. Worse, she\u2019d wondered if he had a woman in his life, someone who had a normal family she could be proud of and he could be a part of.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your internet access?\u201d She was thinking about how much closer she\u2019d be to getting a bead on Eric if she was staying at Jake\u2019s house. She would also be closer to Jake himself, the man she loved so much it was like an aching wound in her chest.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he drawled, his gaze hot. \u201cYou really want to start out that way? I was planning on easing you back into it, but if you\u2019re eager to be punished, you just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Her body responded to the sensual threat with familiar alacrity. Jake had always been able to make her ready for him with just a look, because she knew exactly where that look would lead\u2014to dark pleasure that took her to her limits. \u201cI have to work, Jake. It was a valid question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t. Just that it\u2019s insulting to imply that the quality of the Wi-Fi in my house has a damn thing to do with whether or not I\u2019ll be nailing you into my mattress tonight.\u201d</p><p>She winced inwardly. He\u2019d always been raw and blunt when talking about sex, but there was an undercurrent of hurt anger to his words now and it broke her heart. Not that she could show it. Her sympathy wasn\u2019t what he wanted or needed, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair of her to give it anyway, considering she was the cause of his unhappiness.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cGlad we cleared that up.\u201d</p><p>His smile sent goose bumps racing across her skin. \u201cI\u2019m not as far outside of town as Tilly is. My internet is just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys. \u201cYou know how to get there.\u201d</p><p>Ana took them from him, swallowing hard at the sight of the keychain. It was a round piece of wood, a one-inch thick cross-section of a small branch. She\u2019d made the thing as an assignment in woodworking class. On one side she\u2019d burned the letters Jake + Ana surrounded by little decorative hearts and asterisks. The other side read Forever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some business to take care of,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll call you at the house to see if you\u2019re up for dinner in town or if you\u2019d like me to bring something home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you now?\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you would,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cYou\u2019re a man.\u201d</p><p>Jake pulled a business card out and gave it to her. \u201cThat has my office\u2019s number and my cell number on it. Call me if you need me for anything.\u201d</p><p>She held his gaze. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen that way for twelve years now, Ana. Despite spending ten of those waiting for you to get your ass back here.\u201d</p><p>Ana took a deep breath. He was everything she\u2019d always wanted, but could never have. Lawmen and grifters didn\u2019t mix. \u201cI\u2019m just passing through, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you said.\u201d He touched the brim of his hat. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>Ana drove her Jag slowly down the tree-lined street, her gaze taking in just how much the area had changed since she\u2019d left a decade ago. At one time\u2014back when Jake\u2019s home had belonged to his parents\u2014the house had been one of only a few on a new street. Now the homes lined up one after another, forming the perfect picture of Small-town America.</p><p>She parked at the curb in front of the ranch-style house, smiling at the white picket fence that said a lot about the man he was. The yard was immaculately landscaped and a swing hung from the porch rafters. It was just the sort of normal family home she\u2019d always fantasized she would have one day.</p><p>Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t normal and neither was her family. Her brain was filled with a variety of larcenous information, which was how she\u2019d come to be an insurance investigator specializing in fine art and jewelry theft\u2014her mind worked like a criminal\u2019s.</p><p>Keeping Jake had never been an option for her, despite how much they loved each other. His brain had always worked out problems from the opposite side of the law, and he\u2019d always planned on working in law enforcement. She couldn\u2019t imagine him being anything other than a cop.</p><p>How could she ever ask someone like him to connect his life to those of a band of criminals? The reason she\u2019d come back only proved how right she had been to walk away. What would it do to him, to his career, to their love if she went to jail? She\u2019d known that one day Tilly or Frankie would land into trouble and when that happened, it would impact Jake. She couldn\u2019t do that to him. In the end, she\u2019d loved him enough to leave him.</p><p>\u201cYet here you are at his place,\u201d she murmured to herself, grabbing her weekend bag from the passenger seat. She slung it over her shoulder and opened the gate, admiring the cobblestone pathway to the front door and knowing Jake must\u2019ve laid it himself. She imagined him outside on a sunny day, shirtless and sheened with sweat, the muscles of his back and arms flexing as he worked his way across the lush lawn.</p><p>She wondered what he\u2019d been thinking of while he was working. Had he imagined a wife waddling over it while pregnant with his child? Or his kids skipping along it on the way in from school? Or a dog bounding over it as neighborhood children played in the yard with his own?</p><p>Her hand clenched around the keychain she\u2019d made for him when she was just sixteen.</p><p>Been that way for twelve years now, Ana.</p><p>Jesus. That was a heartbreaker. And yet she was touched that his love was as true as hers.</p><p>She let herself in, dropped her bag on a black leather couch, and took in the surprisingly modern style of the furnishings. He\u2019d gone with pale blue and chrome with black furniture, and the cool palette went remarkably well with the warmth of the gleaming hardwood floors.</p><p>If she\u2019d had any sense at all, she would have stayed at the inn. Leaving had shattered her last time. What would she suffer through this time? What would Jake?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ana pulled the much-loved scent of him deep into her lungs, her entire body tingling with awareness. Jake had been her first lover and her senses were trained to be attuned to his. He\u2019d trained them, first with his hands and mouth, and later with restraints and the delicious bite of pain. It was a lifestyle they\u2019d fallen into together, both of them realizing that she had a deep-seated need to surrender to his authority, and in the process, he\u2019d ruined her for other men. Sometimes, when she was lying in bed at night, she wondered if she\u2019d ruined him for other women.</p><p>Ana dug out her laptop from her bag and carried it into the dining room. Jake had a square, high table and she kicked off her heels before climbing onto a barstool. As her laptop powered up, she pulled out her cell phone and his business card, and texted him.</p><p>Password for your wi-fi?</p><p>A moment later, he replied.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>She stared at the code and smiled. \u201cAna-mine-69, huh?\u201d</p><p>Wishful thinking or a hint? she texted back.</p><p>He answered fast. An order.</p><p>\u201cWell. Some things never change.\u201d Ana flexed her fingers and rolled her shoulders back, focusing her mind on the work ahead.</p><p>She was going to dig up information on Terence Parker and she was going to break the law doing it. She pushed aside her guilt, knowing it had to be done. \u201cI hope you pull through, Terence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ana had decided to focus on his relatives. She could imagine how it would feel to go into the heist as the lone outsider in a family group\u2014a mother, her son and his best friend. Although Eric wasn\u2019t technically related to them, he was practically a brother to Frankie. Terence would understandably want someone similarly close to him on his side.</p><p>God... Frankie. Her throat tightened with fear and her eyes stung. Her baby brother had never really had a chance to walk the straight and narrow. And if something happened to Eric, it would destroy Jake.</p><p>\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cFind the fourth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making the rest of us look bad, Jake.\u201d</p> <p>Jake looked up from the paperwork he was trying to clear so he could take the next day off. Luke Stiles\u2014one of his fellow deputies and a longtime friend\u2014stood in the doorway, grinning. \u201cI heard Ana\u2019s back in town and staying at your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Whisper Creek, where the whispering about other people\u2019s business never stops.\u201d Leaning back in his chair, Jake gave himself permission to think about the woman who was as much a part of him as his badge. She\u2019d been the most important thing in his life since her family drove into town when she was sixteen. Together they\u2019d helped each other cross the threshold from adolescence to adulthood, and they\u2019d discovered what they needed from the person they loved. A lot of people never figured that out.</p><p>And some never found their soul mates.</p><p>He still didn\u2019t get why they weren\u2019t together. He understood that she\u2019d needed to get out of Whisper Creek to spread her wings, but he couldn\u2019t figure out why she hadn\u2019t let him go with her. He\u2019d cajoled and begged and threatened and teased, making her tell him a hundred times over that she\u2019d never leave him. But in his heart he\u2019d known she would go; he\u2019d seen the truth in her eyes.</p><p>She loved him; he knew that and didn\u2019t doubt it. There would never be another man for her, not one who knew her as deeply and completely as he did. They\u2019d experienced so much together, raw and searingly intimate encounters that bound them tighter than gold rings and vows.</p> <p>But as the years passed and she didn\u2019t come back to him, he realized something was keeping her away and today proved it. The love was still there in her beautiful green eyes. She still wanted him and obeyed him, still craved his hunger for her. If she left again, he\u2019d have his</p><p>answer\u2014it wasn\u2019t him; it was Whisper Creek. And if location was what was keeping them apart, he\u2019d paddle her ass for not saying so.</p><p>Luke leaned against the front of Jake\u2019s desk. \u201cIs she back for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh... okay. You two coming into town for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cooking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? You should know I was in Home Ec with her for a semester. She couldn\u2019t crack an egg.\u201d</p><p>Jake smiled. \u201cWarning noted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d Luke\u2019s smile faded. \u201cShe did a number on you last time, Jake. I don\u2019t want to see you like that ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the only one who got hurt. Guess Ana and I can\u2019t quit each other.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Luke left the room, then pulled out his cell to call Eric. His younger brother was supposed to check in twice a day, but he hadn\u2019t called since yesterday morning. Which, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t totally unexpected.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eric,\u201d he said, when he reached voicemail. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be checking in. Yes, I know you\u2019re a grown man now, but this isn\u2019t about what\u2019s good for you, it\u2019s about doing something good for me. I worry.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath, thinking.</p><p>\u201cText me when you get a chance or leave me a message. Shit, send me a picture if you can\u2019t be bothered to type or talk. But don\u2019t send me a damn mug shot or I\u2019ll be kicking your ass all the way to jail.\u201d</p> <p>Ana finished her report and emailed it to her contact at the insurance agency. It was difficult showing progress when she didn\u2019t want to give up any names. Even using the guard\u2019s name was tricky, because he might flip on Frankie or Eric if he felt the heat. So she\u2019d reported that she was researching the backgrounds of all the store\u2019s employees, which didn\u2019t make her look any more competent that the local cops, but she\u2019d dug up a couple dark spots that would\u2019ve been viable leads if she didn\u2019t already know who was responsible for the crime. The information should be enough to make it look like she was worth her fee... at least for today.</p><p>As for her hunch, she\u2019d discovered that Terence had two brothers\u2014one was a tenured professor in Virginia and the other had a sealed record that she\u2019d hacked. Richard Parker had a previous armed robbery conviction when he was fifteen and a variety of petty larceny and drug charges. His record was clean as an adult, but her parents proved that not getting caught didn\u2019t mean you were straight.</p><p>Shutting down her laptop, Ana slid off the barstool and went to check on dinner. She\u2019d done a quick check of Jake\u2019s fridge and pantry earlier and hadn\u2019t been surprised to find both well stocked. After debating her options, she\u2019d put a pot roast in the oven and a salad in the crisper. Then she\u2019d opened a bottle of red wine and left it to breathe on the counter. Because she\u2019d prepped in advance, she had time to take a shower before Jake got home.</p><p>She grabbed her bag off the couch and headed to the guest bathroom, admiring the tile work in the shower that she knew was another of Jake\u2019s projects. When he\u2019d inherited the place from his parents, it hadn\u2019t had such upgrades. It had been a cookie-cutter house, one of the first homes built by a developer who\u2019d thought the town would grow much faster than it had. Now it had Jake\u2019s stamp over most of it, but the guest bathroom was clearly Eric\u2019s domain. The razor on the edge of the sink was a bright lime green and the men\u2019s body wash in the shower was the kind marketed to hormonal young men.</p><p>Jake had assumed responsibility for his brother at the tender age of nineteen, when the Monroes had been killed by a collision with a drunk driver. Ana had supported him through that rough time and offered him what comfort she could, considering how young she herself was, but he\u2019d been good with Eric from the beginning. Jake was a born leader, firmly anchored by his moral compass and unshakeable confidence.</p><p>She\u2019d needed his quiet strength as much as Eric had, having been raised by two of the flightiest people ever to be parents. And even after all these years, Jake was still her touchstone.</p><p>Ana scrubbed, shaved, and perfumed herself like a woman bent on seduction, a mindset she hadn\u2019t adopted for a very long time. She hadn\u2019t packed anything sexy, so her simple cotton baby doll nightgown would have to do.</p><p>\u201cTen years,\u201d she murmured to her reflection in the mirror, fluffing out her damp curls with her fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re bound to be a little rusty.\u201d</p><p>When she opened the bathroom door, she knew immediately that Jake was home. There was a palpable energy in the air and it flowed over her, awakening her senses. She could hear the shower running in his bedroom and appreciated the time to finish prepping dinner. She smiled when she saw the white roses in a vase on the dining table and when she went to pull out the salad, she found one of Victoria\u2019s famous cheesecakes in the fridge.</p><p>She was tossing the salad when she heard Jake pad into the kitchen behind her. A moment later, his arms were circling her and his lips were pressed to the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he murmured, his voice low and husky.</p><p>\u201cHi back.\u201d Her head fell against his shoulder and she allowed herself the temporary luxury of leaning into him. His chest was bare, hard, and warm. \u201cI like the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The tip of his tongue touched the lobe of her ear; then he caught it between his teeth. \u201cI walked in the door and the smell of dinner made me hungry. Now I\u2019ve smelled you and I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t talking about food, she knew. That was proven when his hands slid down the flat plane of her stomach and gripped her thighs just beneath the hem of her baby doll.</p><p>\u201cDid you get some work done?\u201d he breathed, bending his knees to press his erection against the swell of her buttocks.</p><p>Ana became so aroused the denim of his jeans and the cotton of her baby doll might as well have not been there. She dropped the salad servers into the bowl, shaken by the lust that burned through her. It felt as if she\u2019d been numb for ages and was suddenly reawakened to sensation, overwhelmed by the vibrancy of it after living through miserable loneliness. \u201cYes, I did. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent the last half of it thinking about you and cursing the paperwork I needed to clear so I could stay home tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you leave my bed, Anastasia, you\u2019re going to explain to me why we\u2019re not together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake\u2014\u201d Her words cut off as his fingers pushed under the elastic edge of her lace thong. She was slick and hot, primed for him by deprivation and the depth of her love. His fingertip slid between the lips of her sex, stroking through the moisture to tease her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cYou still want me.\u201d He pulled her back against him and rolled his hips, making sure she felt the steely hardness of his erection. \u201cAnd you know I\u2019ve never stopped wanting you. We should be in the same bed every night and the same house every day. We both know it.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, removing his touch and leaving her bereft. \u201cCan I help with anything?\u201d</p><p>Ana shot a narrow-eyed glance at him over her shoulder and found him grinning unrepentantly. He wore a pair of soft, well-worn jeans that hung low on his hips and nothing else. His hair was longer than it had seemed with his hat on. Dark as night and glossy, his hair had always been a lure to her. She loved to run her fingers through it and clench it in her fists as he pleasured her.</p><p>\u201cYou can set the table,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He washed his hands at the sink and set to work, not surprising her in the least by having all the necessary components of a dinner setting\u2014cloth napkins, salad and dinner plates, silverware, and placemats. She could imagine him dishing up dinner for Eric every night, ensuring that his brother had as near to a traditional family life as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How ironic that Jake had encouraged Eric to spend time with Frank. He\u2019d thought the Miller family was ideal\u2014the yarn shop owner, the computer guru, and their two kids. Jake believed Frankie would be a good influence on his troubled, grieving brother. He had no idea that her dad had been a hacker, her mom a fence, and Frankie covered everything in between.</p><p>It\u2019d broken her heart not to clue him in. And now the heist was weighing heavily on her mind. So many secrets between them. Too many.</p><p>They sat down for dinner and Jake sliced the pot roast with quick efficiency.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Eric doing?\u201d she asked him, as she poured the wine.</p><p>\u201cGood. Although I wish he\u2019d go to graduate school or join the military. He\u2019s a smart kid and he works hard when he\u2019s motivated. When he\u2019s not, he doesn\u2019t apply himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankie\u2019s got the same problem. Lots of potential, too little drive. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s been a bad influence on your brother.\u201d</p><p>Jake slid a slice of pot roast off the end of the carving knife and onto her plate. \u201cAre you kidding? Before Frankie came along, Eric was in and out of trouble all the time\u2014shoplifting, vandalism, boosting cars. Frankie changed all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankie just taught Eric to be smarter about it, so he didn\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed at the skeptical look he shot her. Like many cops, Jake couldn\u2019t believe anyone could pull the wool over his eyes, especially not his own brother. But there weren\u2019t many cops who ran across top-shelf grifters like her parents, and both she and Frankie had learned their lessons well.</p><p>He took a drink of his wine and asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re passing through on a job? You still doing investigative work for insurance companies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the time, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the job you\u2019re on now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChasing down jewels taken during a heist, including a valuable tiara set with pink diamonds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His blue eyes flared with interest. \u201cBig take?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApproximately forty million.\u201d</p><p>He whistled. \u201cHow much do you get for the recovery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive percent.\u201d She watched him do the math.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ana. Up to two million?\u201d He stared at her. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been doing this a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough. I guess it pays to think like a criminal.\u201d</p><p>Jake looked down at his plate. They ate quietly for a while, each of them lost in private thoughts. Then he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a good cook, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI took lessons after I got sick of eating take-out all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot having someone to share home-cooked meals with is a lonely life.\u201d He took a bite and chewed, watching her thoughtfully. \u201cIs the money why you never came back?\u201d</p> <p>She focused on cutting her meat. \u201cNot the money, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you that unhappy here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d Ana set her fork and knife down and met his gaze. \u201cThere are things you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t know about you, Anastasia. And nothing you don\u2019t know about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think someone\u2019s a criminal whether they get caught or not?\u201d She knew what his answer would be already. Jake had fully supported the local authorities when Eric had been caught committing a crime. Eric suffered the same punishments as anyone else in town would.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019m a criminal, Jake. And a good, honest cop like you can\u2019t spend his life with a woman who skates the line and occasionally falls over it.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his wine and sat back then, studying her with those cool cop\u2019s eyes. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, but let me ask you this: What the hell do you expect me to do if you\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ll ever want? Be alone? You can\u2019t be that cruel, Ana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t compromise your principles for me. Eventually, it\u2019ll ruin what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have? Two lonely, miserable lives? I\u2019d love to fuckin\u2019 ruin that.\u201d He took a drink and held her gaze over the rim of his glass.</p><p>Her breath caught at the fiery look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d he went on, \u201cnot a news flash that PI\u2019s don\u2019t toe the line. Cops switch to private investigative work because they find the line confining. I know that. At the end of the day, you\u2019re still doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you that I don\u2019t care if the perps get caught? I just want the take. In fact, there are times when I\u2019ve deliberately not pulled on a thread because I almost admire them for the guts it took to make the attempt and the brains to get away with it, if they do.\u201d She sat back. \u201cI may let these jewel thieves I\u2019m chasing right now slip away, Jake, after I get the gems. What do you think about that? Think you can slide into bed at night with a woman who might be an accessory after the fact?\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cAna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Jake.\u201d She hopped off the barstool and grabbed their plates. \u201cI decided years ago that it\u2019s a question you\u2019re never going to have to answer.\u201d</p><p>Ana took the dishes to the sink and willed herself to relax. There was no need for them to fight and she was determined that they wouldn\u2019t, not when they had so little time together.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make that decision by yourself, Anastasia,\u201d Jake drawled dangerously, coming up behind her.</p><p>She gripped the edge of the counter, knowing where the warning note in his voice would lead. \u201cYou can\u2019t change my mind, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Never was able to do that.\u201d His hands wrapped around her wrists. \u201cBut I can remind you of what we\u2019ve both been missing.\u201d</p><p>Gently, he pulled her hands away from the counter and brought them behind her, pinning them to the small of her back. A moment later she felt the chill of steel as one handcuff clicked shut around her wrist, then another.</p><p>An instant calm settled over her.</p><p>He turned her around and cupped her face in his hands, his mouth sealing over hers. Ana gasped at the first press of his firm lips, opening herself to the slow, smooth glide of his tongue. He licked deep and slow, savoring her with an easy, unhurried eroticism. She moaned and wriggled against him, impatient and greedy.</p><p>His hands moved down to her throat, wrapping lightly around it. The feeling of being collared soothed her further.</p><p>\u201cYou with me, baby?\u201d he asked softly, the pads of his thumbs stroking over her fluttering pulse.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time is gonna be quick. I\u2019ve been waiting too long.\u201d</p><p>Ana nodded, feeling the same way. She was so wet and swollen already, she was certain the slightest pressure on her clit would set her off.</p><p>Tenderly, as if she was fragile, he squeezed her breasts through the cotton of her baby doll, hefting them lightly to judge how heavy and tender they\u2019d become. He caught her nipples between his thumb and forefingers, rolling them, tugging with just the perfect amount of pressure. Her eyes closed, her body lost to him.</p><p>Jake kissed her again, his tongue gliding over the curve of her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so damn much, Ana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He hooked his fingers beneath her straps and pushed them off her shoulders. \u201cIf you\u2019re good, I might let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d She gasped as the scalloped edge of her bodice dragged over her hardened nipples.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he breathed, stroking his thumbs over the furled tips. Lowering his head, he took one into the drenched heat of his mouth, swirling his tongue around it before his cheeks hallowed on a drawing pull.</p><p>She moaned, her head falling back as the sensation of his sucking echoed in the saturated flesh between her legs. The gentle tugging rippled through her, making her shiver in delight. When he paid the same service to her other nipple, her knees weakened and he caught her up, his arms banding around her waist to lift her. Holding her aloft, he ravished her swollen breasts, fluttering his tongue over the tight tips and scraping the edge of his teeth across them.</p><p>\u201cOh god, Jake...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll give you what you need, sweetheart. And I\u2019ll keep giving it to you until you can\u2019t imagine getting by for more than a few hours without my dick inside you.\u201d</p><p>Jake carried her into the living room and set her down, turning her away from him. He urged her over the armrest of the leather couch with a gentle, but unyielding, grip at her nape. She folded, her buttocks thrust upward to accept the hard drives of his big, beautiful cock.</p><p>His hands stroked over her, rubbing down her sides and thighs in soothing circles. Cool air caressed her back as her gown was pushed up beneath the handcuffs. Her fingers flexed with the need to touch him in return, to feel the skin she knew became feverishly hot when he first pushed inside her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Anastasia,\u201d Jake said gruffly, bending to press a kiss between her shoulder blades. \u201cYou\u2019re the best thing that ever happened to me. I won\u2019t ever believe that we can\u2019t make it work, because we always do when we\u2019re together. You can\u2019t deny that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake, please...\u201d The smell and feel of the leather stirred blazing memories from their past, reminding her of the needs only Jake could appease.</p><p>His thumbs slid beneath the elastic of her panties and pulled them over her hips and down her legs. His lips followed, skimming over the curve of her buttocks and suckling along the back of her thigh. She began to shake, her body overloaded by need and desire she hadn\u2019t felt in far too long. When he sank into a crouch behind her, her breath caught with expectation.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he murmured, his breath hot against the lips of her sex. \u201cSo soft and pink.\u201d</p><p>Leaving her panties around her knees, Jake parted her with his thumbs and paused. She could feel his gaze on her, the heat and hunger almost tangible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd I know how sweet you taste, Ana mine.\u201d</p><p>Ana tensed in anticipation of the first lick, but when it came, she still wasn\u2019t prepared. She cried out, her entire body shaking violently.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sweetheart,\u201d he said hoarsely, anchoring her with his palm pressed flat to the small of her back. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>The next stroke of his tongue was skillful, rubbing over the hard knot of her clit with the perfect amount of pressure. She came in a rush, her back bowing as the pleasure seared her senses and racked her over-sensitized body with shudders of delight. In the midst of an orgasm that darkened her vision, Jake\u2019s tongue darted inside her, thrusting furiously. The soft velvet of his licking against the tender tissues of her core was too much, yet not nearly enough. Her hips churned into the shallow plunges, her body seeking a deeper, stronger penetration.</p> <p>\u201cNow, Jake. Now. Now!\u201d</p><p>He stood in a rush. Ana heard the sound of his zipper lowering; then she felt the silky heat of his rigid erection brush against her. He teased her, gliding the plush head of his cock through the slick lips of her sex.</p><p>She arched her spine, her fingers grasping at air, her cheeks flushed and damp from the strain of being bound and unable to reach out to him as she needed. Not just for the physical pleasure of touching him, but to satisfy the demands of her heart.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she gasped, unable to hold the words back. \u201cI love you, Jake.\u201d</p><p>With a low growl, his hips jerked and pushed him into her with one fierce, deep stroke.</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d Tears filled Ana\u2019s eyes and spilled over onto the cushion. She ached for this, the delicious burn of his possession and the sense of connection she\u2019d felt with no one else.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you slow.\u201d His voice was rough and raspy. \u201cSlow and deep. But I can\u2019t... It\u2019s been too long.\u201d</p><p>He hitched against her, shoved the last little bit inside her that crammed her all the way full. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re like a fist, Ana. Squeezing me tight... rippling around me. I\u2019m gonna come hard for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Jake withdrew, then slid in to the root. He rolled his hips, screwing deep. The feel of his long, thick cock stroking inside her was perfect\u2014the slight burn as he stretched her, the decadent feel of him rubbing and pushing, the maddening clenching in her core as her body tried to hold him deep...</p><p>Gripping her hips, he pumped hard again, an expert stroke that lifted her to the tip of her toes. Ana panted with pleasure, spinning dizzily toward climax.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she begged, desperate for the friction that would set her off again.</p> <p>\u201cNever, Ana mine,\u201d he purred, lunging quick and hard, shafting her tender pussy. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop...\u201d</p><p>The erotic sound of flesh slapping mingled with the heated words that spilled from his lips\u2014tender promises and sensual threats, loving praise and coarsely-voiced hunger\u2014all of which made her crazy with lust. She was rocking back into his measured thrusts, moaning at the way they radiated through her, her mind fogged with the intensity of her pleasure.</p><p>When Jake bent his knees and hit the perfect spot inside her, Ana unraveled with a muffled scream. She quaked with her release, struggling to breathe as her body seized in the throes of a powerful orgasm. Jake was right there with her, gasping as his body jerked with each scorching spurt of semen. He folded over her, clutching her close, the hard ridges of his abdomen slick with sweat against her palms.</p><p>She sagged into the cushions as the tension left her, feeling wrung out and well-loved.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d Jake\u2019s chest heaved against her and when he shifted slightly, Ana realized he was still hard and thick. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop needing you.\u201d</p><p>It took Ana the space of two heartbeats to figure out what had woken her.</p><p>Her cell phone was vibrating beneath her pillow.</p><p>She pulled it out and squinted against the bright light of the backlit screen. Seeing an East Coast area code, she hit the button to answer the call before it went to voicemail and slipped out of bed. She hurried out of Jake\u2019s bedroom and quietly shut the door, then ran to the living room while answering with, \u201cMiller.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAna! My god.\u201d Frankie gasped with relief. \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble, Ana. Eric and me... And Mom. Ah, god, Mom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankie.\u201d Relief flowed through her, making her aware of just how worried she\u2019d been. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewark. Jesus... it all went wrong. Rick went in hot. Fuck\u2014 You know how Mom had it planned. Like Cannes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She remembered the famous Carlton heist, just as she remembered that Terence Parker had a brother named Richard. \u201cIs Rick\u2019s name Richard Parker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d He barked out a laugh. \u201cWhat am I saying? Of course you know. He shot his own fucking brother, Ana. Lit him up like... Fuck. Oh fuck... Rick shot his own brother in cold blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Eric with you?\u201d She snatched up her duffel bag and dug out a pair of jeans and a top.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have the take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Fuck. Will you listen to me, goddammit! He\u2019s got Mom!\u201d</p><p>Ana froze, her heart thudding violently in her chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick knew Mom was the fence. Eric and I ditched him and took the stones, because he\u2019s fucking crazy. Shot his own goddamn brother. Who does that, Ana? We ditched him and made off with the take and he got to Mom.\u201d</p><p>She activated the phone\u2019s speaker and set it on the coffee table. \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s got Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just called and said he had her. Said he\u2019d trade her for the stones. I tried calling the house but I keep getting the voicemail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Think, Ana. Damn it. She yanked on a pair of panties. \u201cWhere are you supposed to make the trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say. He\u2019s supposed to call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m here in Whisper Creek. I\u2019ll head over to Mom\u2019s now and make sure the bastard\u2019s not bluffing.\u201d She hopped from one foot to the other as she tugged on her jeans, becoming aware of the deep soreness between her legs. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s got the ringer off or her sound machine turned up loud. You know how she needs white noise to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAna... He\u2019ll kill her. Rick must\u2019ve planned all along to get rid of everyone who knew anything. He had to have looked her up before we ditched him. There\u2019s no reason for him to keep her alive for a trade. We won\u2019t know the difference until he\u2019s got us face-to-face, then he\u2019ll take us out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Frankie.\u201d She pulled a sports bra over her head, then grabbed her top. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to think about anything but keeping your head down and your mind sharp. I\u2019m gonna run by Mom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep that burner phone on you at all times, you hear me? I want you and Eric to check in every thirty minutes. And find a safe place to hole up and stay there until I tell you otherwise. Don\u2019t make a move without me, got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I got it. Ana...\u201d Frankie\u2019s voice broke. \u201cIt\u2019s all fucked up. It all fell apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s usually what happens when you break the law, Frankie. You\u2019ve just been really damned lucky so far.\u201d She shoved her nightgown into her bag. \u201cBe careful. Love you.\u201d</p><p>Ana was straightening from grabbing her heels off the floor when Jake stepped into the room fully dressed with his gun on his hip and his badge clipped to the waistband of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t come with me,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I can\u2019t.\u201d His gaze bored into hers. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother out there with yours. Christ, Ana. You\u2019re here because you knew they\u2019d pulled off that heist and you didn\u2019t say a damn thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re not going to jail, Jake!\u201d She shoved her heels in her bag and slung it over her shoulder. \u201cI can take care of this and you can keep your hands clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you think I worry about?\u201d He stared at her face, then cursed under his breath. \u201cI\u2019d break any law for you. Every law. There\u2019s nothing I won\u2019t do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She went to him and put her palm over his heart. \u201cI know you would. I\u2019m just not sure you could live with yourself afterward and I don\u2019t want to put you in that position. I love you, Jake. Just the way you are.\u201d</p><p>Jake lifted her fingers to his mouth. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now!\u201d</p><p>He released her hand and shoved his own into his pocket. A moment later, he was sliding a diamond onto the ring finger of her left hand, a square cushion-cut that caught the light of the moon shining through the gap in the shutters on the windows.</p><p>She swallowed hard, afraid to blink. \u201cJake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been holding on to that for years. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d He tugged her bag off her shoulder and dropped it on the couch. \u201cGive me your keys. I want to drive the Jag.\u201d</p><p>Ana felt damn near giddy. Too much adrenaline, she told herself. Neither of them was thinking straight. It\u2019d never work... unless it did.</p><p>But they had to make it through the next few hours first.</p><p>\u201cYou got a jacket?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the car. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Jake watched as Ana opened the trunk of her car and revealed body armor and a handgun safe. She selected one of three guns she had locked away and slid it into her shoulder holster, then shrugged on a windbreaker and relocked the box. Her movements were calm, practiced, and efficient. Jake marveled at the strong, sexy woman she\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Shutting the trunk quietly, she studied the two-story house tucked into the woods. \u201cBut I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here. Come on.\u201d</p><p>In the silver glow of moonlight, the old Victorian with its round, pointed rooftops and wraparound porch looked like something out of a fairytale\u2014the kind where things went wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ana kept her cool even after they\u2019d searched the house and confirmed that Tilly had been taken. There were signs of a struggle in the master bedroom, but mercifully no blood.</p><p>\u201cRick Parker could\u2019ve killed her here, if that was his plan,\u201d she said flatly, picking up Tilly\u2019s cell phone from the nightstand and searching through it. \u201cCould\u2019ve made it look like a burglary gone bad. She talked him out of it, maybe gave him information that made her valuable. She conned him. It\u2019ll keep her alive for a while. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He caught her by the shoulders before she moved past him and looked down at her face. Recognizing her fierce determination to keep her emotions at bay, he settled for a soft kiss to her brow.</p> <p>\u201cJake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both needed that. Now we can go.\u201d</p><p>They went downstairs and were almost out the front door, when Ana stepped on something that crunched beneath her black running shoes. Crouching, she examined the broken glass; then she found its source lying on the floor just inside the door.</p><p>\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said, straightening. \u201cMom has kept this photo on her side of the bed forever.\u201d</p><p>Jake took it from her, looking at the yellowed image through the cracked glass.</p> <p>Her mouth curved in a smile. \u201cThat photo was taken the day my dad proposed, after they left the bank and took a stroll on the boardwalk. It\u2019s a message she knew I would understand. Mom\u2019s leading Rick to Atlantic City.\u201d</p><p>His brows arched. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a big leap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d Ana insisted. \u201cThe minute he went along with whatever story she sold him, it became her show. She\u2019s running it. We just need to catch up with them, before he figures that out.\u201d</p><p>As they drove east on 422, Ana pulled out her laptop and began typing furiously. Jake watched her out of the corner of his eye. Reaching over, he slid his hand beneath her hair and stroked her nape with his fingers.</p><p>He was so damn glad to be able to touch her again. To be able to smell her and hear her, to have her nearby to look at. She was keeping him sane instead of frantic with worry over Eric.</p><p>She looked at him, her face made stark by her grimness and the shadows of night. \u201cFrankie will take care of Eric. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just Eric I\u2019m worried about.\u201d He tugged gently on her hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think about that. I can\u2019t lose it. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we\u2019ll keep your mind off it. Do you travel a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that\u2019s because there was nothing to keep me home. I won\u2019t so much now.\u201d She returned her attention to her laptop screen. \u201cThe good citizens of Whisper Creek will have to get used to seeing me around again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you want to live?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot to him again. \u201cThe last time I checked that\u2019s where you lived, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stayed because it kept me close to your family. I was afraid if I moved away, I might lose touch with you altogether.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t look so horrified. There wasn\u2019t any place I had a burning desire to get to and Eric needed the stability of staying in one place. But my job can take me anywhere\u2014you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d she asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you, Anastasia. You make me a happy man.\u201d</p><p>Ana was quiet for a few moments, then, \u201cYou know how my parents got engaged? They met in Atlantic City. My mom was running an insurance scam and my dad was hustling old stuff. She wanted to get her hands on his antiques and he wanted to get a fraudulent payout. They played each other for a few weeks, then they agreed to meet at a local bank where he was supposed to show the goods for appraisal\u2014he pulled an engagement ring and a bottle of Dom Perignon out of the safe deposit box instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad proposed in a bank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurrounded by other people\u2019s safeguarded valuables\u2014absolutely the perfect venue for my parents. They\u2019d been onto each other almost from the first, but for them the game was their version of flirting and dating. That\u2019s what my family is like, Jake. And I don\u2019t see them ever changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running scared, Anastasia. If it takes a few decades or a lifetime, you\u2019ll eventually figure that out.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Ana got back to work.</p><p>The sky over the turnpike was lightening when Ana answered a check-in call from Frankie.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said quietly, achingly aware of the block of ice in her gut. \u201cI got an email from Detective Samuels in New York\u2014Terence Parker passed away an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. Terry. Jesus. He was a good guy, you know? He didn\u2019t deserve to go out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Frankie took a deep breath. \u201cAnd he let me talk to Mom. She sounded okay. Not scared at all. And you were right about Atlantic City\u2014that\u2019s where he wants to do the swap. Eric\u2019s texting the address to Jake\u2019s cell now. I told Rick I\u2019d have to talk to Mom directly before the meet or I wouldn\u2019t show up, and I said we wanted to get out of town before nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re doing real good.\u201d She shoved a hand through her hair and said what was weighing heavily on her mind. \u201cFrankie, you and Eric... You need to be working on a Plan B.\u201d</p><p>Jake cursed. \u201cAna, damn it!\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and kept talking. \u201cWhen we turn Rick in, he\u2019s going to turn state\u2019s evidence to get some leniency on the murder charge.\u201d</p><p>Frankie\u2019s voice was as serious as she\u2019d ever heard it. \u201cWe\u2019re considering our options, Ana. Don\u2019t worry about us. Take care of Mom.\u201d</p><p>The moment she killed the call, Jake went off. \u201cWhat the fuck are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking I\u2019d like to salvage as much from this mess as I can. The store is going to get its gems back, Terence\u2019s killer is going to be apprehended, and I\u2019m not going to take the finder\u2019s fee from the insurance company for obvious reasons. Putting Eric and Frankie in jail isn\u2019t going to bring the injured parties any more justice or restitution than that.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his phone from his lap and took the address of the meet from his text messages and typed it into the GPS.</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Think about it, Jake. Think hard. When all\u2019s said and done, we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>The meet was at a rundown motel in a depressed, forgotten corner of Atlantic City. It seemed worlds away from the boardwalk and tourist mecca. The signs and architecture of the buildings were decades past their prime. Time and the sun had faded what color might have distinguished features before.</p><p>Ana wondered if her mother knew this place from its heyday. What had led Rick here? The convenience of exterior walkways and parking directly in front of the room doors? Was that enough to negate the fact that the bank was on the far side of town?</p><p>Whatever the reason, she\u2019d valet parked her car at the Mondego Resort for safekeeping before picking up a rental to get to the dive motel. Then she and Jake had split up\u2014he waited in the car down the street, while she holed up in a dingy room that smelled like an ashtray and old sweat. They waited for the call from Frankie that would put everything in motion.</p><p>\u201cRoom 105,\u201d he said the second she answered her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Ana said. \u201cI\u2019m going to head out with the ice bucket. I\u2019ll be nearby as you approach the door. Go up alone and make him come outside. Tell him Eric\u2019s watching from a safe distance and has the diamonds. If Rick wants to prove his trustworthiness, he\u2019ll step out. He\u2019ll probably leave Mom in the room for safekeeping. Jake\u2019ll drive around back to the bathroom window and see if he can get to her. You with me so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Ana appreciated hearing the quiet strength in her brother\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in a minute.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to tell him not to look at her too long or too often, or worse, not look at her at all\u2014anything that would point her out as suspicious. Frankie was a pro. Shoving her gun into the waistband of her jeans at the small of her back, Ana yanked her top over it and grabbed the ice bucket. She left the room, gratefully breathing in the fresh air outside.</p><p>Texting Jake as she went, Ana walked across the crumbling parking lot of the U-shaped single-story motel. She felt her pulse steady when Frankie knocked on the motel room door\u2014she was never calmer then when a game was in play.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Rick,\u201d she heard Frankie say when the door opened. \u201cYou look like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking bastard! You cut me out! Cut Terry out! Where the fuck is Monroe? Where\u2019re my fucking diamonds?\u201d</p><p>Ana slipped into an alcove that led to a maintenance/housekeeping door and pressed her back up against the wall. Rick was erratic; his breathing was heavy and his voice far too loud. It made Ana nuts to think of her mom having to spend the last few hours with him and as the conversation between Rick and her brother progressed, she grew more and more uneasy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Miller, you slimy piece of shit,\u201d Rick snapped. \u201cDo I look like an idiot? Do I? I\u2019m not going outside and swapping diamonds where anyone can shoot pictures! Tell Monroe to get his ass over here now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do I need pictures for? If I had the heat out here, you\u2019d already be done. You\u2019ve got a kidnapped woman in your room and you\u2019re a murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerry\u2019s dead,\u201d Frank said flatly.</p><p>The unmistakable thud of flesh hitting flesh got Ana\u2019s back up. She withdrew her gun.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Terry\u2014\u201d Frankie stumbled back from the door and into Ana\u2019s line of sight. His hand was pressed to his lip, blood trickling between his fingers. Staying where he was, he forced Rick to follow him out into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cLiar! You\u2019re a fucking liar, Miller.\u201d Rick stumbled into daylight with bare feet and rumbled clothes. His blond hair was disheveled and he gestured wildly with his hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve been lying from the beginning. Setting everything up. I told Terry you were going to jack us and you did! Who killed him? You or Monroe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJesus Christ, you strung-out sonofabitch. You fucking shot your brother. What the hell did you expect was going to happen?\u201d</p><p>Rick slammed his palms into Frankie\u2019s shoulders, sending him stumbling back \u201cWhat did you do? What did you do? I shot him up just enough to make him look innocent. And now he\u2019s dead? Dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead the damn papers, man. Or watch the news. One of your bullets opened a vein. He nearly bled out. Never recovered. He had a heart attack.\u201d</p> <p>Ana stepped away from the wall, taking advantage of the opportunity to intervene between Rick and her mom. She inched toward the open motel room door, her eyes never leaving Rick\u2019s back.</p><p>She was ready when he spun with a scream and faced her.</p><p>\u201cCop bitch!\u201d he yelled, before charging toward her.</p><p>Ana fired low, hitting him in the shin, and watched as he fell to his knee. He reached behind him. She barely ducked the flung blade that stabbed through the stucco wall behind her. Rick lunged past her crouched position and through the open room doorway, tucking and rolling across the threshold, then kicking the door shut.</p><p>Turning, she fired at the ancient doorknob and kicked out with her foot. The door held. She fired again just as Rick began to scream inside.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she? Where is she?\u201d</p><p>She stopped, holding out her arm when Frankie rushed the door. \u201cWait. I think Jake\u2019s got her.\u201d</p><p>The rental sedan pulled into the parking lot to their left. Jake was at the wheel. Both Tilly and Eric were in the car with him.</p><p>\u201cOh god,\u201d Frank choked out. \u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>Ana kept her eye on the room door and the curtained window. \u201cGet in the car and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p> <p>Rick continued to yell, followed by the firing of a gun and the shattering of glass. \u201cNooooo! No! No!\u201d More shots rang out, and more wailing. Then it fell eerily quiet.</p><p>\u201cTake care of Mom,\u201d she told him, pulling her phone out to call nine-one-one. \u201cLeave this to me.\u201d</p><p>Jake paid the street vendor for his coffee, then turned to face the Crossfire Building again. Foot traffic on the sidewalk swarmed around him, congesting the pavement the same way the cars clogged the street at his back. Car horns blared over the din at regular intervals, yet the residents of Manhattan seemed unaffected by the near frantic pulse of their city.</p><p>Tilting his head back, he let his gaze travel up the length of the sapphire-hued spire of glass that pierced the sky along with the hundreds of other towering buildings in the city. The theft of the Crown of Roses was finally coming to a close, and his life with Ana was about to begin. With both of the Parker brothers dead, there was no one who knew the identity of the other two accomplices in the crime, and with all of the items recovered and returned, the cops on both sides of the Hudson River were likely to call the case closed.</p><p>The gun Rick had used to end his own life had been a ballistics match to the bullet found in Terence\u2019s shoulder, putting that aspect of the crime to rest as well. There was one last thing to do...</p><p>Ana came twirling out of the revolving doors of the Crossfire and her searching gaze found him on the corner. Dressed once again in head to toe black, she looked sleek and very sexy. Her mouth curved slightly as she approached him and deftly took the coffee from his hand.</p><p>She took a drink and her nose wrinkled. \u201cUgh. Black. I like a little cream and sugar.\u201d</p><p>He tapped her on the end of her nose with his fingertip. \u201cI\u2019m sure you like it hot, too, so I waited for you to come out before I ordered you one. How did it go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Gideon Cross agreed to give the reward to the Parker family. That\u2019s where it should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t question why you\u2019d give away a half million dollars like you would a five dollar bill?\u201d Not to mention the two million dollar finder\u2019s fee for the return of the diamonds...</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sure he thoroughly researched my portfolio before I ever stepped foot into his very impressive office.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s brows rose. \u201cHow rich are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m very good at my job.\u201d Her smile turned into a grin.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Got me a sugar mama. How\u2019d I get so lucky?\u201d</p><p>Ana licked her lower lip. \u201cWanna get luckier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah.\u201d He caught her hand in his and they set off. </p> </body></html>"]
