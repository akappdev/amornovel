Shaking her head, she reached for her weapon and followed.</p><p>They didn\u2019t see her when she rounded the corner. The guy had the woman pinned up against the wall, his hands shoved under her skirt, and his face buried between her very, very ample breasts. He groaned and grunted and she moaned and twisted against him.</p> <p>Dee blew out a hard breath as she waited. Not for them to finish, but for the monster to show itself.</p><p>Probably in about ten more seconds, maybe less, cause they were getting pretty hot over there and\u2014</p><p>The woman, a long-legged redhead, opened her mouth wide. Thanks to the spill of lights from the building\u2019s second story windows, Dee got a great view of that mouth.</p><p>And of the woman\u2019s two-inch long fangs.</p><p>Got you.</p> <p>Fangs that were currently heading right for the idiot\u2019s neck as the vamp prepared to rip open his throat and guzzle his blood like a frat boy enjoying the cheapest beer in town.</p><p>Death wishes. Would people never learn?</p><p>Dee cleared her throat. \u201cAh, excuse me?\u201d</p><p>The shiny white fangs froze over the guy\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d From the idiot. The man still didn\u2019t know how close death was to him. Judging from what Dee could see, it looked like death was about, oh, an inch away.</p><p>He swung around to face her. Early twenties, preppy, with a face that she judged as handsome, if kind of bland.</p> <p>Dee smiled at him. \u201cHi, there.\u201d</p><p>His gaze raked her and the vamp hissed.</p><p>Vamps always got pissy when their food was taken away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave,\u201d Dee murmured. The fangs were too close to his carotid artery. The vamp might get twitchy and decide to take a bite, and, well, Dee\u2019s shirt was white and when she snatched the dude free, she\u2019d ruin her shirt with that dark red splash. Not that it was anything fancy, but...</p><p>She really hated doing laundry.</p><p>\u201cGet. The. Fuck. Away.\u201d Bland/handsome snarled at her.</p><p>Ah, now some people could almost deserve a bite from a vamp, but\u2014no, she was being paid for this gig.</p><p>The vamp smiled at her. \u201cYou heard him. Leave, bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Dee lifted her weapon. Not her gun, that was still holstered at her side, but the wooden stake was an easy and familiar weight in her hand. \u201cJust how long do you think it\u2019s gonna take me to shove this into your heart? A minute? Less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d The guy\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d</p><p>Debatable.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Karen, let\u2019s get the hell out of\u2014\u201d</p><p>The vamp grabbed him and twisted the man around. Using him as a shield. Why did the vampires always do that with their prey? Like a human shield was ever going to stop her. Dee just shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou take so much as a step, and I break his neck.\u201d</p><p>She could do it. Vampire strength. She\u2019d snap him in half a second, but...\u201cI\u2019ll be on you before his body hits the ground.\u201d</p><p>The man whimpered.</p><p>The vamp\u2019s eyes flashed to black. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a woman who was hired to do a job.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a kill mission, but if there was no choice, she\u2019d bring her prey down any way she could.</p><p>Besides, vamps were already dead, so it wasn\u2019t like she was really breaking the old bring-\u2019em-in-alive rule, anyway. Not that the Night Watch Agency really followed that rule. Not when the bounty hunters were after dangerous supernaturals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting bored,\u201d Dee said, \u201clet him go and come with me.\u201d</p><p>The guy was crying now. Sobbing. Hell.</p><p>The vamp\u2019s gaze darted from Dee back to the edge of the street. Desperation there. Fear.</p><p>Time for the takedown. \u201cLet him go,\u201d she repeated, voice lashing out, and then, Dee heard the faintest sound.</p><p>A soft rustle. A footstep?</p><p>Behind her.</p><p>She tensed.</p><p>The fear faded from the vamp\u2019s eyes and a smile tilted her lips.</p><p>Uh, oh.</p><p>\u201cTake the bitch out!\u201d The vampire screamed and Dee knew that the person behind her wasn\u2019t just some innocent bystander drawn in by morbid curiosity. Not innocent at all. Shit.</p><p>She spun around, ready to face another vampire, ready to\u2014</p><p>He lunged at her, hitting her hard and fast and slamming her ass right down to the ground. At that same instant, she heard the shot. A crack of fire that would have taken her out.</p><p>Had her ass not been on the ground.</p><p>A hard cry broke the night. Pain. Fear. Not her cry, because she\u2019d learned long ago not to cry out.</p><p>Dee stared up at the man before her. Darkness.</p><p>Black hair, hair much longer than her own. Sharp-edged, hard features. Cold, gray eyes, thin lips. Cheekbones that jutted too sharply.</p><p>And his body...his weight pinned her to the ground. His body was tight with muscle, heavy with strength.</p><p>He felt hot against her. His flesh so warm and\u2014</p><p>Ah, fuck it.</p><p>Dee rammed up with her elbow, catching him hard and fast in the chin, sending his head snapping back as she scrambled beneath him, twisting, jerking, and punching.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Shit\u2014I just saved your ass!\u201d He clamped down harder on her, freezing her movements. \u201cWoman, someone just tried to shoot you!\u201d</p><p>And some big and thick asshole had tackled her.</p><p>But the crack she\u2019d heard had registered in her mind now and the cry of pain\u2014</p><p>If it hadn\u2019t been hers, then it had been...</p><p>Damn. Her neck craned and she glanced back. The idiot lay on the ground, moaning. Not with passion anymore. Pain. Blood soaked his shirt and pooled around him.</p><p>The vamp was gone.</p><p>But was the shooter? Only one way to find out. \u201cGet off,\u201d she gritted.</p><p>His jaw clenched but he rolled to the side. \u201cYour funeral, babe.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lost her stake. Whatever. She had plenty more in the car. Dee jerked her gun free of the holster. She scanned the buildings, the darkness.</p><p>It was at times like these when being a human was a real vulnerability for her. The shifter hunters who worked for Night Watch would never have been caught off guard like this. They would have caught the shooter\u2019s scent on the wind, heard him creeping up for the shot.</p><p>Even the demons would have gotten more warning than she had.</p><p>But when you played with the big boys, you didn\u2019t get to piss and moan about the extra senses you didn\u2019t possess.</p><p>So she scanned every building. Every shadow. Then, staying as low and keeping as much cover as she could, she went to the idiot.</p><p>\u201cHelp me! I\u2019m dying! You\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted over him. A lot of blood. Huh. And the vamp had run away from that? Who ran when the buffet was free?</p><p>\u201cHelp me! I can\u2019t die like this, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dying.\u201d Jeez. She yanked out her phone, then pressed the button that would send an SOS to the surveillance team at Night Watch. \u201cIt\u2019s a flesh wound, moron.\u201d She\u2019d sure had her share of them.</p><p>\u201cDispatch.\u201d A soft, modulated voice flowed over the line.</p><p>\u201cNeed an ambulance.\u201d She didn\u2019t identify herself. Why bother? Stella would recognize her voice. \u201cFour fifteen Brantley. Human down and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sirens wailed in the night. Of damn course. The shot would have attracted attention.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the phone. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Time for explanations.</p><p>Or, okay, lies.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we say?\u201d</p><p>The deep, rumbling voice came from the left. From Mr. Tall, Dark, and, yeah, Sexy, who\u2019d tailed her over to the victim. She spared him a glance. \u201cYou can get out of here. I\u2019ll handle the cops.\u201d She\u2019d had lots of experience with the Baton Rouge PD. Most of the uniforms owed her, anyway.</p><p>One black brow shot up. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d A grin flashed, one that showed a lot of strong, white teeth. \u201cI was happy to save your life. Really. Think nothing of it. Yeah, I nearly got shot, but I\u2019m okay. No need for concern.\u201d His right hand lifted and gingerly rubbed his chin.</p><p>A patrol car rounded the corner, screeched to a stop, and Dee clenched her teeth. \u201cThank you,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cNot very gracious, are you?\u201d he murmured, and he knelt, his hands going toward the moaning guy\u2019s wounds. \u201cYou should work on that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes slit. \u201cI didn\u2019t need saving.\u201d Cops were approaching. She could see them from the corner of her eye. Their guns were up, their steps slow.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d</p><p>She almost growled at him. Any minute now, the cops would be saying\u2014</p><p>\u201cPut your hands up! Nice and slow and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ah, good. She recognized that voice. \u201cHarry, we\u2019ve got a gunshot vic here. He needs to be routed to Mercy General.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d Not real surprise. More like horror.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Be careful, the shooter could still be around.\u201d</p><p>Harry and his partner immediately crouched. Harry jerked out his radio and barked some commands.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised that the cops know you?\u201d Dark and Sexy murmured.</p><p>She spared him a withering glance. Then she leaned in close to the victim and whispered, \u201cIf you want to stay out of the psych ward, don\u2019t say a word about the vampire.\u201d</p><p>He blinked once, then gave a quick, jerky nod.</p><p>Good. Because the cops on scene didn\u2019t understand the paranormal score in this town, and if the vic started rambling about Dee trying to take down an undead bloodsucker, things could get tricky.</p><p>She eased back into her crouch. So much for an easy bag. The guys at Night Watch would be giving her hell about this one for days.</p><p>And who\u2019d been out there with the gun? Why had the shooter been aiming for her?</p><p>She\u2019d find out. As soon as damn possible.</p><p>Because no one took a free shot at her and got away. No one.</p><p>Sandra \u201cDee\u201d Daniels was small, grubby, and she really, really shouldn\u2019t have been attractive.</p><p>Her blond hair barely skimmed her chin and it looked like the woman had taken scissors to it herself\u2014leaving the hair in short, twisted layers. Her nose was a little off center, her bottom lip a little too big, her chin a little too pointed.</p><p>No, she shouldn\u2019t have been attractive.</p><p>The jeans she wore were ripped and faded. Her white T-shirt clung too tightly to her small breasts, and her black boots were scuffed pretty much to hell and back.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>But she was damn sexy. Maybe it was the eyes. So big and dark. Chocolate. Once upon a time, he\u2019d loved the stuff.</p><p>And that mouth. The lips were lush, soft, so red. Okay, so maybe he liked her mouth.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>She had her hands balled into fists on her hips. Cops were everywhere, running like ants as they searched the scene. He\u2019d already been questioned three times, and both he and Dee had been given the all clear to leave.</p><p>But the woman wasn\u2019t moving, and if she wasn\u2019t moving, neither was he.</p><p>After five minutes of silence from her, she finally deigned to glance his way. \u201cHarry said you could leave, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon. Simon Chase.\u201d She knew his name. She\u2019d been right there when he spelled it for the uniforms. Each time.</p><p>She grunted.</p><p>He almost smiled. Almost. \u201cAh, I can\u2019t help but notice, Sandra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d Her voice snapped like a whip.</p><p>He\u2019d been there when she had to spell her name, too. He\u2019d rather enjoyed her gruff, \u201cHarry, you know this shit, S-A-ND-R-A...oh, fuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee,\u201d he allowed. But he\u2019d be calling her Sandra again soon. He liked that. Liked the way her cheeks flushed so red when she heard the name. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too upset that someone tried to kill you tonight.\u201d</p><p>The victim had been hauled away in an ambulance. Blood still soaked the ground, but Simon didn\u2019t glance at it. His nostrils twitched, just a bit, but the scent was starting to fade.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders in a little shrug. \u201cNot like it\u2019s the first time.\u201d</p><p>He let his eyes widen. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>A grunt from her. She seemed to like that sound.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have no idea why folks want you dead?\u201d</p><p>A furrow peaked between her golden brows. \u201cNo clue.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>Her hands lifted, then fell in a vague little gesture. \u201cWell, it\u2019s been fun, Chase, but I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the wooden stake from his back pocket. \u201cJust what kind of work is it that you do, Sandra?\u201d</p><p>Red flush. She lunged for him and locked her fingers around the stake, but he didn\u2019t let go. She was close now, close enough that he could see light flecks of gold in her dark gaze. Close enough that he could see the pulse pounding at the base of her throat. Close enough that he could almost taste those lips.</p><p>He tightened his hold on the stake. The wood was smooth and hard. The woman had obviously spent some time honing her weapon.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me.\u201d She glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to explain this shit to all of them right now, not with the last silver shooting still hanging over me.\u201d</p><p>Silver shooting? Sounded like an interesting story.</p><p>Slowly, he released his hold and she jerked the weapon from him. Kneeling, she shoved the weapon into some kind of custom holster near her ankle.</p><p>When she lifted the ragged hem of her jeans, he caught sight of her leg. Nice. Smooth and pale and\u2014</p><p>She shot back up, nearly clipping him in the chin. Again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon shook his head. She was so not what he\u2019d been expecting. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me,\u201d he said and tried to ignore her scent. A heady scent, rich and dark. A woman\u2019s sensual flavor.</p><p>She licked her lips. A quick swipe of her tongue that had his cock jerking.</p><p>Definitely not what he\u2019d been expecting, but he wasn\u2019t going to complain. No way.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me on this, you don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She shuffled back a few steps and tossed him a careless smile. \u201cThanks for watching my ass tonight, Chase.\u201d</p><p>Then she was gone. Turning away and marching through the cops still on scene, and he kept watching that ass. Nice and firm, round enough to hold tight.</p><p>Yeah, he kept watching that ass, right until the moment she disappeared around the corner.</p><p>He waited a beat. Two.</p><p>Then he stalked after her because he wasn\u2019t about to let his prey escape that quickly. There\u2019d be no fun in such an easy exit.</p> <p>He followed her, giving brief, polite nods to the cops as he made his way past their vehicles.</p><p>It only took a moment to realize that Dee wasn\u2019t headed back to the main street. His eyes tracked her. No, the woman wasn\u2019t retreating to the safety of her car. She was snaking through the back alleys, going even deeper into the underbelly of the city.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t even glancing back.</p><p>Because she was hunting, too.</p><p>What the hell? The woman had almost been shot, shouldn\u2019t she be hesitating a bit? His hands fisted as he followed her. The night closed around him, her, and they both hunted.</p><p>The minutes ticked past. Another tight corner. Another alley. He kept her in his sights. His nostrils stung because these streets reeked. Garbage. Shit. Who knew what the hell he was stepping in as he trailed her?</p> <p>The woman had better be worth this effort. She\u2019d better\u2014</p><p>He rounded another turn, one that led him between two thick buildings.</p><p>Dee had vanished.</p><p>He froze and stared straight ahead.</p><p>A soft footfall sounded behind him. Could have been a whisper, could have been\u2014</p><p>Simon spun around and came face to face with Dee. She was armed, not with a stake this time, but with her gun, and the lady had it pointed dead center between his eyes.</p><p>He probably should have acted scared. Should have mumbled some kind of half-assed apology for following her.</p><p>Instead, he just stared at her.</p> <p>\u201cThere a particular reason why you\u2019re tailing me?\u201d</p><p>The gun didn\u2019t waver. Those sexy-as-sin lips pressed into a thick line.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He allowed himself a glance down her body. He\u2019d have to be careful with her. He kept forgetting how small and fragile she was.</p><p>Maybe because of the gun. Maybe that was making him forgetful.</p><p>She acted tough. But that body\u2014soft curves and sweet, tender flesh.</p><p>\u201cEyes up, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Apparently the lady didn\u2019t like him ogling her breasts. Fair enough. \u201cYou left before I could get your number.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYour number. I mean, I saved your life. Shouldn\u2019t I at least be able to get your number for that?\u201d</p><p>She growled and finally lowered the gun. \u201cLook, buddy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I don\u2019t have time for this shit. I\u2019m not going to screw you because you shoved me into the pavement. And, just so you know, I didn\u2019t need you to save me. Not like it\u2019s my first ball game, okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to screw you. Hmmm. \u201cDon\u2019t remember asking for a screw.\u201d Though he wouldn\u2019t refuse one with her. \u201cJust your number.\u201d</p><p>She barred her teeth. Pretty teeth. White and straight. Not too sharp, though, but then, she was human.</p><p>His tongue scraped across his own teeth. A bit sharper than hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working now, I don\u2019t have time for this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you never did answer my question.\u201d Simon cocked his head to the side. \u201cJust what kind of work do you do?\u201d</p><p>She holstered the gun. \u201cThe kind you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. \u201cLet\u2019s see...you had a wooden stake and you were about ten feet away from a vampire the first time I saw you.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019d say that makes you a hunter.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze raked over him. \u201cSo what? You know about vampires? Good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know about vampires.\u201d Too much about them. \u201cI also know about the demons and the charmers and the shifters that are running this city.\u201d He even knew her boss, Jason Pak. Pak was the Night Watch Agency. He\u2019d started the bounty hunting business almost twenty years ago, and Dee was one of his top hunters.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t need to know that he\u2019d already researched her.</p><p>His hands were loose at his sides now. \u201cI know all about the Other.\u201d The humidity from the hot July night had his shirt sticking against his flesh. \u201cAnd I stopped being afraid of the monsters in the dark one hell of a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cFucking hunter.\u201d A snarl, high-pitched with fury.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Simon\u2019s stare shot over Dee\u2019s shoulder. The vamp was there, blood dripping down her arm, her fangs bared and her eyes glazed black.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rip your throat open and drain you dry, bitch, I\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee shifted her stance slightly. Simon\u2019s gaze jerked back to her. \u201cSure you\u2019re not afraid?\u201d She whispered.</p><p>He gave a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll slice your lover open! He\u2019ll beg for death. He\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee spun around. The stake was in her hand. Wow\u2014he hadn\u2019t even seen her grab it and now the wood was in her hand, no\u2014it was in the air. Flying end over end in a deadly arc.</p><p>Then sinking into the vampire\u2019s chest.</p><p>The vamp gave a muffled scream and dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to take you in alive,\u201d Dee murmured. \u201cBut you just couldn\u2019t make this night easy, could you?\u201d</p><p>The black faded from the vampire\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Dee squared her shoulders and stalked toward the vamp. \u201cAnd he\u2019s not my lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Simon said and realized that he was impressed.</p><p>Sandra Dee had taken down her prey. She hadn\u2019t let him distract her. She hadn\u2019t given up and faded away when the cops appeared.</p><p>And when given a chance for the kill, she hadn\u2019t hesitated.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Finally, exactly what he\u2019d expected.</p><p>A team from Night Watch came to clear the alley. The vamp\u2019s body was taken away, hell if he knew where. But, then, he didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s exercise had been very fruitful. In all, Simon was pleased with the progress that had been made.</p><p>Of course, if he\u2019d gotten Dee\u2019s number, he would have been more pleased.</p><p>Next time.</p><p>Simon stepped into the shadows and rapped against the black door that waited in the darkness. It opened instantly and he crossed the threshold, already pulling out his money.</p><p>The man inside was small, squat, and he had his gun cradled in his hand. Greasy black hair was slicked back from his forehead and his beady eyes gleamed when he caught sight of the cash in Simon\u2019s hand.</p><p>The guy reached for the bills\u2014</p><p>Simon snatched his fingers back. \u201cYou hurt the human.\u201d</p><p>Sweat trickled down the man\u2019s cheek. It was hot as fuck in there. But, hell, it was summer in Baton Rouge, it was hot as fuck everywhere. \u201cD-didn\u2019t mean to, when you took the woman down, the bullet clipped him\u2014\u201d</p><p>Clipped him, hadn\u2019t killed him, and that was why the shooter was still alive. \u201cI want you out of town, tonight.\u201d Simon kept the money out of the guy\u2019s reach. \u201cIf I ever see you again, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>A gulp.</p><p>Simon leaned in close, close enough for the shooter to see the intent in his eyes. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t be an easy death.\u201d Those he delivered rarely were. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>The man managed a quick nod.</p><p>Simon tossed the money to him. The bastard had done his job. He\u2019d taken the shot at Dee. Given Simon the perfect opportunity that he\u2019d needed.</p><p>The human\u2019s injury just hadn\u2019t been part of the plan.</p><p>Simon turned away from him and headed for the door. There was more work to do. Always more.</p><p>The bullet slammed into his back, a hard punch of fire that burned through skin and muscle, and tore right through the bone.</p><p>He hit the floor hard, his face slamming down and the blood pouring from his body. Dammit.</p><p>Should have seen that one coming. You just couldn\u2019t trust killers these days.</p><p>He heard the creak of footsteps and caught the whisper of excited breath. \u201cN-nobody threatens Frankie Lee.\u201d Another shot. This one fired into the back of his right leg.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t cry out. He locked his jaw and battled the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who won\u2019t get an easy death, asshole.\u201d Another shot. Left thigh this time.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>Frankie grabbed the back of Simon\u2019s head and wrenched his face up. The gun barrel stared back at Simon and the scent of burning metal filled his nostrils. \u201cNobody threatens\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon lunged off the floor. One jerk of his hand and he broke Frankie\u2019s wrist.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Frankie\u2019s face bleached of color.</p><p>The gun clattered to the floor. Simon didn\u2019t even glance at it. He wouldn\u2019t need the weapon. The gun really would be too easy, and so not his style.</p><p>Simon grabbed the squirrelly bastard, wrapped his hand around Frankie\u2019s throat, and pinned him up against the wall. Frankie\u2019s fat legs dangled a good two feet off the ground.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon smiled.</p><p>Frankie started to shake.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you,\u201d Simon whispered, the scent of his own blood clogging his nostrils. \u201cYou had your chance.\u201d</p><p>Now, it was his turn.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cReady for a new case?\u201d</p><p>Dee glanced up when Jason Pak strolled into her office. The guy had on one of his fancy suits\u2014always, the fancy suits\u2014and he was smiling.</p><p>A smile from Pak was never a good thing.</p><p>Dee slowly eased her feet off the desk. \u201cWhat kind of case?\u201d She\u2019d been thinking about taking a break. Maybe heading over to Biloxi and staying at one of the casinos and enjoying the beach.</p><p>He shut the door. No sound. Pak was good at not making any noise. He\u2019d told her once that he\u2019d learned to hunt and track with his Choctaw grandfather.</p><p>And that he\u2019d learned to kill by trailing his Korean mother.</p><p>He crossed the room and tossed a file onto her desk. \u201cWe\u2019ve got word that a Born Master is in town.\u201d</p><p>Her blood froze. The ice thickened inside of her, then rose to coat her skin as the chill enveloped her.</p><p>Born Master. She licked dry lips. Okay, not a lot scared her, but those bastards did. \u201cWhat\u2019s a BM doing in this city?\u201d Born Masters were rare, thank Christ. Only a handful were in the United States. Most of them preferred to stay in Europe or Africa.</p><p>Born Masters were the vamps who were born bloodsuckers. Well, okay, technically, they were born looking human, acting human, but they weren\u2019t.</p><p>Eventually their bodies stopped tolerating human food. The hunger for blood consumed them. Their teeth sharpened. Their senses kicked up to super level, along with their strength.</p><p>And then you knew, those freaks weren\u2019t human. They were pretty much immortal.</p><p>Pak gave a shrug and his dark eyes never left her face. \u201cI\u2019d guess he\u2019s looking to build a beautiful little vamp army.\u201d</p><p>Her back teeth locked. The disease of vampirism had come from the genetic jokes that were the BMs. The Born Masters had gone out, bitten their prey, exchanged blood, and what should have been a few DNA freaks way back when\u2014well, they\u2019d multiplied. Nearly swept away a whole country back in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Black Plague, her ass.</p><p>It was so easy to rewrite history sometimes. Especially when you were trying to stop the humans from panicking.</p><p>Dee pressed her palms against her jean-clad thighs. The better to wipe the sweat away. Because, yeah, she was sweating. Taking down a Born Master wasn\u2019t an easy task. BMs were too strong. All the ones she\u2019d ever heard of were close to a millennia old.</p><p>In the vamp world, age brought strength. Especially to the Borns.</p><p>\u201cThe streets can\u2019t be flooded with Taken,\u201d Pak said, crossing his arms over his chest and watching her with the cold stare that always saw too much.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders and tried to look like her heart wasn\u2019t about to break out of her chest. \u201cMaybe the bastard isn\u2019t planning to change folks.\u201d The Taken were the vamps who were killed, then reborn to a life of blood and fury. Not everyone could survive the transformation. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just looking for some kills.\u201d Her voice was cool, expressionless. \u201cCould be he just wants a bloodbath.\u201d</p><p>Sandra Dee! Run, baby, run\u2014</p><p>The scream pierced her mind and her hands pressed harder against her thighs. No, can\u2019t think about that now.</p><p>Not with Pak watching her like she was some kind of lab rat.</p><p>\u201cBeen a long time since the city saw a vampire rampage.\u201d</p><p>Her face had been ice cold, now her cheeks burned with pinpricks of heat. \u201cYeah. About sixteen years.\u201d Could have been yesterday though. Because those blood-soaked memories weren\u2019t ever gonna fade.</p><p>Mama? Not sleeping. No, she wasn\u2019t sleeping in her bed.</p><p>Pak\u2019s head cocked to the right. \u201cI need you to be straight with me, Dee.\u201d</p><p>Now that snapped her out of the past. She sat up, fast, eyes narrowing. \u201cI\u2019ve always been upfront with you, Pak. Always.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a shadow in her life he didn\u2019t know about. Without Pak, she would have been on the streets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, she would have been dead.</p><p>She\u2019d been eighteen and he\u2019d given her a place to stay. He\u2019d taken shit for it, too. A forty-year-old man bringing in a stray from the streets.</p><p>Sex hadn\u2019t been an issue with them, though most folks didn\u2019t buy that. Course, Dee didn\u2019t give a shit what most folks thought. Pak hadn\u2019t been a father figure. She\u2019d had a father. Pak had just been someone to keep the monsters at bay.</p> <p>Then someone to teach her how to kick the monsters\u2019 asses.</p><p>And he\u2019d been someone who understood loss.</p><p>\u201cThis is different. This case is going to be different.\u201d The man was so still. She\u2019d never understood how the guy could be so motionless. She was always moving. Twitching. Tapping.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just another vamp,\u201d she said, and tried to believe the words. \u201cBorn Master or Taken, they can all die.\u201d Just getting them to die was the tricky part.</p><p>Getting them to die again.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t handle this, I\u2019ll put Zane on point. He can go after the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZane doesn\u2019t know vamps like I do.\u201d Zane Wynter was a good hunter, no denying it. But the demon didn\u2019t understand the undead like she did.</p><p>A pause from Pak. \u201cZane also isn\u2019t human. He won\u2019t have your...weaknesses.\u201d</p><p>Oh, now, that was just hitting below the belt. So Zane was half-demon. Dee shot to her feet. \u201cCharmers don\u2019t have any damn strengths that put them above humans, either.\u201d So the charmers could talk to animals\u2014yeah, like that was an advantage when you were hunting paranormal predators. Over a dozen agents at Night Watch were charmers and they had no advantage over her.</p><p>She stared down the lead charmer. \u201cI\u2019m not weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever said you were.\u201d Another pause. Jeez but the guy was always working the silences. That tactic used to drive her crazy. Okay. Still did. \u201cNever said I was going to put a charmer on point, either.\u201d</p> <p>No, just a demon.</p><p>\u201cZane would be a lot harder to kill than you,\u201d Pak said flatly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Yes, dammit. Freaking demon strength. He wouldn\u2019t have been caught unaware last night. \u201cBut I\u2019m one hell of a better vampire killer than he is.\u201d True and so what if she sounded bitchy?</p><p>His nod had her breath easing out. \u201cYes, you are.\u201d He pointed a finger toward her. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to need help on this one. I want Zane watching your back.\u201d</p><p>Not going to argue. She could always use the demon\u2019s powers.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll get Jude to come in for cover, if we need him.\u201d</p><p>Ah, Jude. The tiger shifter who was currently blissed out with his new mate. Dee gave a nod. No way would she turn down a shifter\u2019s nose when she was tracking a vamp.</p><p>Her pounding heartbeat still shook her chest, but her palms were dry now, and she asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s the target\u2019s name? Which badass thinks he\u2019s taking over our city?\u201d</p> <p>Pak smiled then, his gator grin, and Dee\u2019s muscles locked. \u201cDon\u2019t know who is he. Just what he is.\u201d He inclined his head toward the file. \u201cIntel says word is ripping through the city about the BM. No name. No face. Just the knowledge from every witch and psychic in the area that power is coming through\u2014and it\u2019s coming through hard.\u201d</p><p>Her brows shot up. No name? \u201cThen who\u2019s the client on this one?\u201d There was always a client with Night Watch. The agents didn\u2019t hunt for pleasure. They weren\u2019t supposed to, anyway. They hunted the Other because the cops couldn\u2019t track those killers. When a supernatural went on a killing spree, the higher ups at the Baton Rouge PD called in Night Watch.</p><p>Sure, the Night Watch team brought down some humans every now and then, just for the sake of keeping their cover in place as a legit bounty hunting agency, but the paranormals were the real targets.</p><p>Pak straightened his already straight suit. \u201cOn this case, I\u2019m the client.\u201d</p><p>Damn. He must think this threat was serious because Pak never let the cases get personal. His rule number one.</p><p>\u201cAnd Dee\u2014I want this bastard taken down, got me? Because I don\u2019t want to see blood pouring in my streets, not again.\u201d</p><p>With a Born Master, that could happen. Hell on earth could happen with one.</p><p>\u201cConsider him staked.\u201d Easy words, hard job. But she\u2019d do it, because no way was she going to stand by and watch innocents get slaughtered by vamps gorging on blood.</p><p>As Pak had said, not again.</p><p>Time to sharpen up her stakes and hit the hunting grounds.</p><p>The music was terrible, the food was shit, and the crowd of dancers were all but screwing on the floor.</p><p>Dee leaned against the bar, trying to ignore the throbbing in her temples and letting her gaze sweep past the throng inside Onyx.</p><p>This was the eighth club she\u2019d been in since she\u2019d hit the streets. Humans only. Well, mostly humans. Onyx catered to the unaware, and that made the place perfect for vamps. So much easier to pick up prey when the humans didn\u2019t realize the danger they faced.</p><p>They didn\u2019t realize it, not until their dates stopped seducing them and started feeding from them.</p><p>By then, it was too late to scream.</p><p>Her nails drummed on the bar. Zane lounged in the back corner, his emerald gaze sweeping over the room. Some big-breasted blonde was at his side. Typical.</p><p>Jude hadn\u2019t made an appearance yet. But he would soon. She\u2019d use his nose to sniff out the place. See if he could detect the rot of the undead and\u2014</p><p>\u201cLet me buy you a drink.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d ignored the men beside her. Greeted the few come-ons she\u2019d gotten with silence. But that voice\u2014</p><p>Dee glanced to the left. Tall, Dark, and Sexy was back.</p><p>And he was smiling down at her. A big, wide grin that showed off a weird little dint in his right cheek. Not a dimple, too hard for that. She hadn\u2019t noticed that curve last night, not with the hunt and kill distracting her.</p><p>Shit, but he was hot.</p><p>Thanks to the spotlights over the bar, she could see him so much better tonight. No shadows to hide behind now.</p><p>Hard angles, strong jaw, sexy man.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cAlready got one.\u201d Dee held up her glass.</p><p>\u201cBabe, that\u2019s water.\u201d He motioned to the bartender. \u201cLet me get you something with bite.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d spent the night looking for a bite. Hadn\u2019t found it yet. Her fingers snagged his. \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d Booze couldn\u2019t slow her down. Not with the one she hunted.</p><p>Black brows shot up. Then he leaned in close. So close that she caught the scent of his aftershave. \u201cYou gonna kill another woman tonight?\u201d A whisper that blew against her.</p><p>Her lips tightened. \u201cVampire,\u201d she said quietly and dropped his hand.</p><p>He blinked. Those eyes of his were eerie. Like a smoky fog staring back at her.</p><p>\u201cI hunted a vampire last night,\u201d Dee told him, keeping her voice hushed because in a place like this, you never knew who was listening. \u201cAnd, technically, she\u2019d already been killed once before I got to her.\u201d</p><p>His fingers locked around her upper arm. She\u2019d yanked on a black T-shirt before heading out, and his fingertips skimmed her flesh. \u201cGuess you\u2019re right,\u201d he murmured and leaned in even closer.</p><p>His lips were about two inches\u2014maybe just one\u2014away from hers.</p><p>What would he taste like?</p><p>It\u2019d been too long since she\u2019d had a lover, and this guy fit all of her criteria. Big, strong, sexy, and aware of the score in the city.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance with me?\u201d Such dark words. No accent at all underlined the whisper. Just a rich purr of sex.</p><p>Oh but she bet the guy was fantastic in the sack.</p><p>Find out. A not-so-weak challenge in her mind. Why not? She wasn\u2019t seeing anyone. He seemed up for it and\u2014</p><p>Dee brought her left hand up between them and pushed against his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t dance.\u201d Especially not to that too fast, pounding music that made her head ache.</p><p>He didn\u2019t retreat. His eyes bored into hers. \u201cPity.\u201d His fingers skated down her arm and caught her wrist. He took her glass away and placed it on the bar top with a clink.</p><p>She cocked her head and studied him. \u201cAre you following me?\u201d Two nights. First one, sure, that could have been coincidence. A coincidence she was grudgingly grateful for, but tonight\u2014</p><p>The faintest curl hinted on his lips. \u201cWhat if I am?\u201d</p><p>His thighs brushed against her. Big, strong thighs. Thick with muscle.</p><p>Dee swallowed. So not the time.</p><p>But the man was tempting.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t afford a distraction. Not then. \u201cThen you\u2019d better be very, very careful.\u201d Dee shoved against him. Hard.</p><p>He stumbled back a step and his smile widened. \u201cYou keep playing hard to get, and I\u2019m gonna start thinking you\u2019re not interested in me, Sandra Dee.\u201d</p><p>Who was this guy? Dee jumped off the bar stool. \u201cYou\u2019d be thinking right, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He took her wrist again with strong, roughened fingers. The guy towered over her. Always the way of it. When you couldn\u2019t even skim five foot six with big-ass heels, most men towered over you. And since Dee had never worn heels in her life...</p><p>The guy bent toward her when he said, \u201cI see the way you look at me.\u201d</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>\u201cCurious...but more. Like maybe you got a wild side lurking in you. A side that wants out.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she did. The guy sure looked like he could play. After the case.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you, Chase,\u201d she finally told him, too aware of his touch on her skin. Too aware that her nipples were tightening and she was leaning toward him as her nostrils flared and she tried to suck up more of his scent. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved your life.\u201d A fallen angel\u2019s smile. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that count for something?\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s hard snarl.</p><p>Chase\u2019s hold tightened on her.</p><p>Maybe not.</p><p>The white tiger shifter stormed through the crowd. People jumped out of his path because they were semi-smart. In seconds, he was at her side, nostrils flaring, lips curling back, blue eyes...watering?</p><p>\u201cUh, Jude? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblem,\u201d he growled and the man was good at growling. His eyes\u2014and, they were most definitely watering\u2014zeroed in on Chase. The two men were about the same height, and had the same rough, strong build. But Jude was light, his skin fair, his hair blond, and Chase...</p><p>Darkness. The thought came to her once more.</p><p>Jude\u2019s gaze dropped to the hand that still bound her wrist. \u201cMan, you\u2019d better not be bothering Dee.\u201d</p><p>Great. Because she needed him to act like an overprotective jerk right then. \u201cGot it covered.\u201d More than covered. So what if Chase\u2019s thumb was sliding back and forth over her wrist and the movement had her heart jumping? No big deal.</p><p>Jude\u2019s stare turned back to her. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a situation.\u201d</p><p>One that shouldn\u2019t be discussed in front of an outsider. She got that. She tossed a careless smile Chase\u2019s way, and tried really hard not to care. Her life wasn\u2019t like other women\u2019s. She couldn\u2019t go out, find a great guy, and forget the world while they had sex.</p><p>Not when killers were waiting.</p><p>If the people in this bar had half a clue what was hunting them...</p><p>\u201cSee you around,\u201d she told him, keeping her voice bland and tugging her hand free. His fingers had been rough against her, lightly callused, warm, and strong.</p><p>Too easy to imagine those fingers sliding over her flesh. Cupping her breasts. Spreading her thighs.</p><p>Dee swallowed. Okay. So maybe it had been too long since she\u2019d been laid.</p><p>\u201cI can help you.\u201d His cool words had her hesitating, glancing back, dammit.</p><p>He stared at her, unblinking.</p><p>\u201cNot amateur night, buddy,\u201d Jude murmured and his nostrils twitched. \u201cDee and I have a job to do, we don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need prey to draw out the vampire,\u201d Chase continued, never taking his eyes off her. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the man you need.\u201d</p><p>Only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cHell, what have you been telling him?\u201d Jude demanded, swiping his hand across his forehead. \u201cLow profile, woman, low profile.\u201d</p><p>Dee ignored him. Pretty easy to do most days. \u201cWe\u2019ve got this one covered.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s jaw worked but he shoved his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a card. \u201cYou change your mind, you call me.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t take it, don\u2019t take it, don\u2019t, ah...hell. Dee\u2019s fingers curled around the card.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even see his hand move. But in the next instant, his fingers were around hers and he brought her hand to his mouth. His lips pressed against her flesh, his tongue tasted her.</p><p>Two seconds, maybe three. Then he dropped his hold and flashed that bad boy grin. \u201cI wanted a little taste.\u201d</p><p>So did she.</p><p>\u201cDee...\u201d</p><p>She knew that tone. Jude would be having a fit any second\u2014or as close to a fit as a tiger could have.</p><p>Chase brushed past her and disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cShop for a new lover later, we\u2019ve got problems now.\u201d He bent his head toward her and whispered right against her ear, \u201cKymine.\u201d</p><p>Dee sucked in a sharp pull of air.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pumping it in the place. And if the kymine is here...\u201d</p><p>Then the vamps were, too.</p><p>Kymine. A sweet little concoction the vamps had created about ten years ago, a brew that they pumped into the air in order to screw with a shifter\u2019s sense of smell.</p><p>With about 95 percent accuracy, shifters could pick up the stench of a vamp in a crowded room. Jude had told her once that, to him, vamps smelled like corpses. Yeah, that made sense, considering that vampires were dead. Kinda anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To be reborn as a vampire, a human had to die.

The heart would beat again, the lungs would fill, and the brain would kick-start to life again.</p> <p>Alive once more, with a few new extra features.</p><p>Like fangs, super strength, and a nearly insatiable lust for blood.</p><p>Because the vampires knew that the shifters could smell them\u2014and have one hell of a hunting advantage\u2014they\u2019d researched like crazy and finally produced kymine.</p><p>Kymine could only be used in a closed, restricted area.

He\u2019ll need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready did.\u201d He eased back and she caught the glimpse of fang. \u201cYou armed?\u201d</p><p>Her brow shot up. \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re asking me that?\u201d</p><p>A ghost of a smile tugged at his lips. \u201cLet\u2019s get the bastards.\u201d</p><p>Good plan.</p><p>She reached into her bag and curled her fingers around her stake.</p> <p>Showtime.</p><p>The night was too quiet. Especially for this part of town. There should have been laughter on the wind. Drunken voices. Car horns or the fading beat of music.</p><p>Dee paced about twenty feet behind Onyx. No stragglers waited outside. No lovers looked for a quick screw.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>With the thick silence.</p><p>So not natural.</p><p>She rocked back on her heels and tried to ignore the fact that Chase lounged somewhere in that bar. He\u2019d probably moved on to a more agreeable partner. One of those women who could laugh and smile and mean it, and not someone who couldn\u2019t stop glancing over her shoulder because she knew there were monsters out there, waiting.</p><p>Be afraid of the dark. A lesson she\u2019d learned when she\u2019d been fifteen.</p><p>So very afraid.</p><p>The faintest pad of footsteps reached her ears. Dee didn\u2019t tense, that would alert her prey. She exhaled, nice and slow and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead, Dee.\u201d</p><p>A woman\u2019s voice, soft and mellow.</p><p>Slowly, Dee turned toward her. Tall, thin, with a long mane of midnight black hair, the woman stood near the exit of the back parking lot. She was alone, unarmed, and smiling.</p><p>Dee kept the stake hidden. No way to tell yet if she was staring at a vamp, a demon, a human\u2014or hell knew what. Come on, Jude, get your ass back here. But if the kymine hadn\u2019t worn off, he wouldn\u2019t be much help, either.</p><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>Dee decided she hated the bitch. \u201cNo. Are you?\u201d</p><p>The woman glided closer. One of those annoying graceful moves that dancers seemed to make.</p><p>Dee marched toward her, more than ready to meet the chick head on.</p><p>\u201cNo one will mourn, Dee. No one will even miss you when you\u2019re rotting in the ground.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so she was little Miss Sunshine and Light. Dee grunted. \u201cAnd what? You think you\u2019re the one whose gonna take me out?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSorry, sister, it\u2019s been tried more than a few times and the assholes who come for me are the ones who wind up in the graves.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips tightened. Good. It was always better to get under their skin, to rattle them, to\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou should have died with your family.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s vision flashed red. Blood red. Like the blood that had stained her hands, covered her body, and pooled on the floor when she\u2019d found them.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The bitch\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cYou\u2019re dead now.\u201d</p><p>So Sunshine had gotten under her skin. \u201cI seem to be breathing just fine.\u201d She didn\u2019t hear any other sounds. That could mean it was just her and Sunshine, or it could mean others waited silently and patiently in the darkness, ready for the perfect moment to attack and kill.</p><p>Uh, Jude?</p><p>Sunshine had on jeans, strappy sandals, and some kind of light, lacy top. Her smile was broad and flashed lots of teeth.</p><p>No fangs, not yet. A vamp\u2019s fangs grew right before they got ready to feed. Just like a vamp\u2019s eye color changed to black when they hunted.</p><p>Or when they fucked.</p><p>One way to find out what she was dealing with here.</p><p>Dee lunged forward, the stake gripped tight in her hand. She struck out, grabbing Sunshine and tossing her ass to the ground. Then she went in for the kill.</p><p>The woman never even flinched.</p><p>That same vacant smile was on her lips when Dee brought the stake down over her heart. \u201cDead,\u201d she whispered again.</p><p>No fangs. No black eyes. If the woman were a vamp, she\u2019d be fighting for her life. She would have gone into hunting mode instinctively. Not just lay there like a lamb at a slaughter.</p><p>Dee froze. The tip of the stake pressed into the lace of Sunshine\u2019s shirt. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Laughter. Low. In-freaking-sane.</p><p>Dee lifted the weapon. Staking a human was not part of her agenda for the night. She rose, never taking her eyes off the nutjob. \u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you are.\u201d The woman climbed slowly to her feet. \u201cAll alone. Poor little hunter. Will you beg at the end?\u201d</p><p>What the\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not alone.\u201d Hard, deep.</p><p>Not Jude.</p><p>Chase.</p><p>Sunshine\u2019s lips parted.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d Dee told her, fighting back the impulse to ram one fist into that thin little nose. \u201cAnd stop screwing around in shit that you don\u2019t understand.\u201d The woman was obviously some kind of messenger. Most of the hunters at Night Watch had a standing policy of not hurting innocents. Well, Zane wasn\u2019t part of that \u201cmost\u201d group. But she didn\u2019t like to hurt humans.</p><p>The Other knew the safest way to send their warnings to the hunters was to employ puppets. Humans who thought playing in the dark was fun.</p><p>When it was more like suicide.</p><p>Yeah, she didn\u2019t normally hurt innocents. But this time, oh, talk about temptation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a week,\u201d the woman said and when she tilted her head, Dee caught sight of the bruises on her neck.</p><p>Bite marks.</p><p>Figured. \u201cNeither do you,\u201d she told her, sadly, still not glancing back at Chase. Not yet. \u201cYou need to run from them, as fast as you can and never look back.\u201d</p><p>A blink. \u201cWhy? They can give me everything.\u201d</p><p>Or nothing. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust vamps.\u201d</p><p>Her smile dimmed. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust anyone.\u201d Her hand rose to her neck. Covered the wounds. \u201cBut when you can live forever, does it matter?\u201d</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Fingertips brushed her shoulder. Dee spun around, the weapon up.</p><p>Chase stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Christ, man, how the hell did you move so fast?\u201d And so quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your partner?\u201d</p><p>Thudding footsteps. Dee glanced back in time to see Sunshine make a break for the line of cars. She lunged forward\u2014</p><p>He jerked her back. \u201cYour. Partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting away!\u201d If she could trail her, they could find out where the vamps were hiding and\u2014</p><p>\u201cGood. The bitch just threatened you. If she didn\u2019t get her ass out of here, I might have killed her.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>An engine kicked to life. No time to argue. Dee elbowed him, twisted, shimmied, then kicked out with her foot.</p><p>He flew back, and she shot forward.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Her legs pumped as fast and hard as they could. Go, go. A car lurched forward, a small, red Ford. Exhaust burned her nostrils and the squeal of tires grated in her ears. Tag, get the\u2014</p><p>Damn. Her shoulders slumped.</p><p>Gravel crunched behind her. \u201cThat hurt, Dee.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful. If she\u2019d wanted him hurt, he would have been hurt. \u201cYou should have let me go.\u201d She stared at the disappearing taillights. No tag. Sunshine had planned for their meeting. Turning back to Chase, she glared. \u201cShe got away.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his side. \u201cWhere. Is. Your. Partner.\u201d</p><p>Dee tried to brush by him. He caught her shoulders, trapping her against him.</p><p>His eyes glittered down at her. \u201cYou know, the blond bastard who was licking your ear inside. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>Ah, what was that? Jealousy? Men. Take away the jeans and designer labels and you had cavemen beating their chests. \u201cJude isn\u2019t my partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he your lover?\u201d</p><p>Her breath rushed out. \u201cNone of your business, okay? I\u2019m on a case, you just let my lead get away and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Chase crushed that too hard mouth down on hers and drove his tongue past her lips.</p><p>She could have broken free. Could have given him another hard punch but\u2014</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>She wanted to taste him.</p><p>So for a few wild seconds, she forgot the vamps and the death and she locked her arms tight around him and she opened her mouth wide.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Her tongue met his. She wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who liked to be taken. She liked to take.</p><p>His hands caught her waist, pulled her closer, and the rising ridge of his cock thrust against her.</p><p>His lips caressed. Savored. His tongue swept into her mouth. Slid against hers and had her wanting more. So much more.</p><p>A quiver began in the pit of her belly. A stir of hunger that she hadn\u2019t felt in so long.</p><p>This man could make her feel. Make her want, and\u2014the sex\u2014it would be fantastic.</p><p>His fingers cupped her ass. Squeezed.</p><p>Then he lifted her, hauling her high in the air and holding her close so that her nipples, already tight, aching peaks, pushed against his chest.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>She liked her men strong. Liked her sex hot.</p><p>He sure fit the bill and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dee, I thought you were working the case, not screwing around with\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stiffened against her. Chase\u2019s head rose and his lips, red and shining from her mouth, hovered over hers. \u201cNot your lover,\u201d he repeated and it took her a half-dazed moment to realize he was talking about Jude.</p><p>The guy who\u2019d finally decided to make an appearance. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He put her down, nice and slow. \u201cThen you won\u2019t mind when I kick his ass.\u201d</p><p>Um, nah, generally she wouldn\u2019t mind but\u2014</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t a fair fight. No way would Chase be able to take down a shifter, unless\u2014unless he was much more than human.</p><p>\u201cCome and try,\u201d Jude invited and she didn\u2019t have to look at him to know he\u2019d be sporting his come-get-some grin.</p><p>She grabbed Chase\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat the hell kind of question is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that needs an answer.\u201d In this city, you couldn\u2019t take risks.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t answer and his jaw locked.</p><p>She glanced over at Jude. \u201cKymine gone yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly.\u201d He sniffed a bit. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t smell like death.\u201d A grimace. \u201cJust some fancy ass cologne.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed. Not a vamp. Okay. Everything else was pretty much doable.</p><p>Chase stepped back from her and Dee dropped her hands. He slanted Jude a seriously pissed glare. \u201cDon\u2019t come sniffing around me again, tiger.\u201d</p><p>Tiger? He knew about Jude?</p><p>Not a flicker of surprise crossed the shifter\u2019s face. \u201cYou gonna piss and moan all night or are you gonna answer the lady\u2019s question?\u201d</p><p>What are you?</p><p>Chance stared back at her. Gazed too deeply with those smoky eyes. \u201cI\u2019m the man who had her back, twice, when you weren\u2019t anywhere around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee doesn\u2019t need anyone to watch her. The woman\u2019s a freaking machine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs backup.\u201d His fingers brushed over her cheek. Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cAw, Dee...shit,\u201d Jude muttered.</p><p>Her shoulders snapped up. She wouldn\u2019t be weak. Not in front of Jude. He\u2019d trained her. Walked with her on the first mission.</p><p>Not in front of him. \u201cWe had a visitor.\u201d Now she was the one to back away. Because that soft touch wasn\u2019t something she could handle.</p><p>Hard, wild, and rough\u2014yeah, that was more her style.</p><p>Chase\u2019s fingers fisted, then fell.</p><p>\u201cAnd you noticed the...ah...visitor with your tongue down this guy\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a name. It\u2019s Simon Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014throat?\u201d</p><p>She stared at Jude. Long and hard and waited until his blue gaze dropped. That was better. \u201cThe visit came first. Some sweet little ball of fluff sporting bite marks on her neck.\u201d</p><p>Jude sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cA lure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Well, maybe. Vamps were known to use sexy women to draw in other prey. Worked wonders for them. Most folks were always attracted to a pretty package. You followed the package, and found hell waiting with open fangs. \u201cShe was sent to deliver a message to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>Chase glanced between them. \u201cWhy send the woman? I mean, if you think a vampire sent her\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her unused stake. \u201cThey knew I wouldn\u2019t hurt her.\u201d Much.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>Dee hesitated.</p><p>Chase didn\u2019t. \u201cThe bitch told Dee she was going to die.\u201d</p><p>Well, so much for subtle.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d</p> <p>That pretty much summed things up nicely.</p><p>\u201cAnd you let her get away?\u201d Jude growled. A very deep, rumbling growl. His beast had to be close.</p><p>\u201cI got distracted.\u201d The six foot three, two-hundred-pound distraction shifted beside her. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it,\u201d Chase murmured.</p><p>Her gaze jerked to his.</p><p>And the bastard smiled at her.</p> <p>Trouble. Why, why did trouble always find her? And why did this trouble have to be so sexy?</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Dee awoke screaming, her skin slickened with sweat and her drumming heartbeat rattling her chest.</p><p>It took her a minute to banish the blood. To choke back the fear.</p><p>So long ago, but the dreams still came.</p><p>Dee jumped out of bed. The neon digits of her clock glowed too brightly. Four-oh-eight. She\u2019d slept for an hour.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Her T-shirt clung to her body, damp and too confining. Every muscle in her body quivered. Her skin burned and her belly knotted.</p> <p>Damn dreams.</p><p>Why tonight? Why? It had been over three months since the last bout, and just when she\u2019d thought she was finally mastering the demons, they\u2019d come sneaking back.</p><p>She paced across the room. No way would she be going back to sleep. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Adrenaline had her walking faster, faster.</p><p>Get out.</p><p>The apartment was too small. Too hot in the summer. Dee shoved open the balcony doors, but the air outside was even thicker, even hotter.</p><p>Her air conditioner droned with a low hum. Not doing her a damn bit of good.</p><p>Love you, Sandra Dee.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. Hell, no. She wasn\u2019t doing this. Not again.</p><p>Sirens wailed in the distance. There was always trouble somewhere in this city. Human killers. Supernatural monsters. Never any peace. Not for her, not anywhere.</p><p>No peace, but, maybe\u2014</p><p>Maybe there was something else she could have. For just a little while.</p><p>Her eyes opened. She turned around, fumbled for the card she\u2019d tossed on her nightstand. Her fingers trembled when she touched the edge.</p><p>The minute she\u2019d come home, she\u2019d balled up the card and tossed it into the garbage can.</p><p>Then she\u2019d dug it out. Stupid. But\u2014</p><p>But her heart wasn\u2019t slowing down. Her skin was burning hot, and when she thought of Simon, she pictured him and stopped seeing the blood.</p><p>Dee was so tired of the blood.</p><p>A name and a number were typed in black letters across the white card. No address.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t call him now. No way. Only one reason a woman called a man at this hour.</p><p>Yeah, one reason.</p><p>A hard breath shook her chest. Dee realized she could still taste him. Still feel the press of his lips against hers. The brush of his tongue.</p><p>He might not be alone. He probably wasn\u2019t. A guy like him, oozing sex, he\u2019d probably snapped his fingers and\u2014</p><p>She put the card down. For an instant, she thought she saw red staining her fingers.</p><p>No, no, just a memory.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Shaking her head, she walked toward the shower. A nice, cold shower, that was what she needed.</p><p>Or him.</p><p>Fuck. Dee grabbed the phone. Dialed before she could stop herself. One ring. Stupid. You can\u2019t do this. Two. Are you crazy? You can\u2019t. Three.</p><p>\u201cNight Watch.\u201d The private security line for the team. The one they called when they needed Intel, twenty-four-seven.</p><p>\u201cGrace? It\u2019s Dee. Did you\u2014did you run that check for me?\u201d Because she was a suspicious bitch, always would be.</p><p>A faint hum on the line, then...\u201cFinished it earlier tonight. You want me to fax over the file?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and give me a quick and dirty rundown.\u201d Because she had to know, right now, before she made a deadly mistake. \u201cAnd then send over the paperwork.\u201d She\u2019d want to know every detail later. That was her way.</p><p>\u201cSimon Lawrence Chase.\u201d Dee\u2019s fingers tightened around the phone when Grace began. So she ran background checks on all her potential lovers, what was wrong with that? A woman had to be safe. These days, you never knew what you were dragging home.</p><p>\u201cAge thirty-four.\u201d Really? It\u2019d been so hard to judge his age, he could have been younger or\u2014\u201cBorn in New Orleans, he left when he decided to be all he could be.\u201d Military? With that long hair?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not still serving.\u201d Dee was definite on that.</p><p>\u201cNo. Looks like he went Merc for a while,\u201d Grace said.</p><p>Merc. Mercenary. Yeah, she could see that. A brief hesitation, then she asked the most important question, \u201cAny sign he\u2019s more than human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNegative.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed. She\u2019d had a demon lover once or twice. They weren\u2019t anything to complain about, for sure, they\u2019d been phenomenal in the sack, but a human\u2014</p><p>I can control him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s...something else, though, Dee. Something you should know.\u201d</p><p>Aw, hell. Always something to spoil her party. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe records show his parents were killed a few years back. It went down as a B and E gone bad, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re telling me it wasn\u2019t a breaking and entering? It was more?\u201d Often was.</p><p>\u201cJewelry was snatched, the TVs and a computer were missing, and the parents, Janice and Ned Chase had their throats slit.\u201d</p><p>A slit throat. The easiest way to cover a vamp attack.</p><p>\u201cI made a call to a coroner I know down in New Orleans.\u201d One of the reasons Grace was so good at Intel\u2014the woman had connections everywhere. \u201cSeems there wasn\u2019t enough blood at the scene to match the severity of the wounds.\u201d</p><p>Because the parasites had drained them dry. Huh. No wonder the guy knew so much about vampires.</p><p>Personal experience.</p><p>Just like me. \u201cThanks, Grace. I owe you.\u201d</p><p>Silence, then very softly, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The call ended and Dee clenched the phone tight. He\u2019d passed the screen, and his past was as screwed up as her own.</p><p>She swallowed. He was safe.</p><p>Or as safe as a lover could be for her.</p><p>Her fingers dialed quickly. There was no hesitation this time. No stupid voice whispering in her mind, no\u2014</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d</p><p>Just that, her name. Breathed with need. With the same lust that was tightening her nipples and making her sex clench.</p><p>Oh, boy. Her own breath came out in a hard rush. Course he would have known she was calling. In this techno crazy age, her name would have appeared instantly on his caller ID. No backing out now.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d He asked, a dark demand.</p><p>She pulled at her shirt, trying to break it away from her hot flesh. \u201cMy place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Sandra Dee?\u201d</p><p>Her sex quivered. Just that voice, whispering to her in the dark.</p><p>He knew what she wanted. Had to know. \u201cAre you alone?\u201d Probably not. Probably had some stacked bimbo crawling all over him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d A sensual demand.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cApartment B-6, Groves Terrace.\u201d</p><p>His breath rushed over the line.</p><p>Then, click.</p><p>She knew he was coming.</p><p>Dee hung up the phone and paced to the edge of the bed. She lifted the mattress and checked to make sure her gun was close. She always kept her weapons close.</p><p>He was coming.</p><p>Her gaze darted to her hands. No blood. This time.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck\u2014talk about some serious bad timing. Simon jumped out of his Mustang and stared up at the apartment on the left, the one with the white terrace and the French doors open on the second floor balcony.</p><p>Dee.</p><p>She\u2019d moved fast. Faster than he\u2019d expected, but he wasn\u2019t about to turn away from her. If the lady wanted him, she\u2019d get him.</p><p>Screw the dawn.</p><p>They had an hour. At least. He\u2019d take more time later. Now, now he\u2019d give her what she wanted.</p><p>And make her need him more. Because soon, she\u2019d have to need him more than she\u2019d ever needed anyone. Need him enough to turn away from everything and everyone she knew.</p><p>Simon bounded up the flight of stairs. He raised his hand to pound on the door.</p><p>Dee wrenched open the door. She stood there, clad in a thin T-shirt that cupped her breasts, a T-shirt that barely skimmed the tops of her pale thighs, and she stared at him with those dark, wide eyes.</p><p>Simon tried to jerk his tongue back inside his mouth. \u201cUh, Sandra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d She grabbed him. Her fingers fisted around the front of his shirt, and she jerked him inside.</p><p>\u201cAh, what\u2019s the rush\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want the neighbors to see.\u201d</p><p>What? She had neighbors who were awake at four thirty in the morning?</p><p>And since when was he the woman\u2019s dirty little secret?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want forever.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened at that. Couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me that you love me. I don\u2019t want lies or promises that you won\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>He kicked the door shut behind him. Stared down at her. No bra. Panties? His nostrils flared. Yeah, but they were wet.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She\u2019d said she wanted him and she did, no denying her body\u2019s response, but even before her lips parted, he knew she was going to say\u2014</p><p>\u201cI just want to forget.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d known she would say that, because he knew her. Know your enemy.</p><p>But Dee wasn\u2019t his enemy. She was\u2014</p><p>She stepped away. Caught the edge of her T-shirt and tossed it to the floor.</p><p>His cock jerked against the zipper of his jeans. Damn. Small breasts, but perfect. Round, with light brown nipples. Tight nipples, ready for his mouth and\u2014</p><p>The couch was behind her. He caught her in his arms. Swept her back and dropped her onto the cushions. Then he followed and took a nipple into his mouth because he had to taste. To take.</p><p>Time was running out.</p><p>His lips closed around the peak and his tongue laved her. Her moan filled his ears and her hips thrust up against him. The woman\u2019s arousal flooded his nostrils. Rich, wet cream.</p><p>The edge of his teeth pressed against her flesh and she shivered. Not fear, no, not even close.</p><p>Damn her. Damn her.</p><p>He kissed his way across her chest. The faint ridges of scar tissue pressed against his mouth. Long, thin lines. Light white now because Sandra Dee was a fast healer.</p><p>She could have died.</p><p>He knew about the attack. He\u2019d done his research, too.</p><p>He caught her other nipple. Sucked her with tongue and lips. Her fingers clenched against his shirt, jerked it up, and then she touched his flesh. Hot, fast fingers that skated over him.</p><p>He rocked against her, driving the fully erect length of his cock against her sex. Dee\u2019s legs were open, spread, and when he\u2019d lowered her onto the couch, he\u2019d pushed between them.</p><p>The better to play.</p><p>The better to torture himself.</p><p>\u201cLose the jeans,\u201d she ordered, her voice a husky rasp, and her fingers were on his stomach, sliding down, aiming for the button of his jeans.</p><p>No.</p><p>He caught her hands. \u201cYou\u2019re not calling the shots here, babe.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide, so brown and deep, but burning with a hungry fire. Her lips had parted\u2014</p><p>He kissed her. Drove his tongue deep inside and tasted the wild honey and spice that was Dee. Sweet and wild\u2014the perfect flavor for his little vampire slayer.</p><p>The dark hunger built within him. Feeding the lust that he chained back. Tempting, tempting so much...</p><p>Her tongue swiped against his. Give her what she wants.</p><p>No, no, she didn\u2019t even know what she wanted. Not really.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>He tore his mouth from hers and tried to ignore the spreading darkness within.</p><p>Dawn comes.</p><p>He licked her neck. Sweet flesh. Her pulse pounded against his mouth. Fast with excitement. Bursting with life.</p><p>Testing now, he let his teeth score her flesh.</p><p>She jerked, but didn\u2019t fight. He chained her hands over her head, caught her wrists and held them against the couch with his left hand.</p><p>Dee probably thought she could break away from him at any time.</p><p>The lady didn\u2019t know how wrong she was.</p><p>She should have known better than to invite him inside. Now he held the power and she didn\u2019t even realize it.</p><p>His teeth wanted to press harder into her skin. Part of him wanted her to know the danger.</p><p>His right hand trailed down her body. Soft flesh, covering a finely muscled body. Dee was a fighter, no denying it or the marks of the past that scarred her pale skin.</p><p>His fingers paused over her belly. Flat and smooth.</p><p>His mouth opened wider.</p><p>Her hands jerked free in an instant. Hadn\u2019t expected that. She shoved against him, once, hard.</p><p>Simon raised up and stared down at her. So many lights were on in her house. Lights against the dark.</p><p>Dawn was coming.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play the vamp game on me. That shit doesn\u2019t get me off.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cAnd it sure as hell can\u2019t work for you.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so she\u2019d already done her research on him. That meant he had to let Grace go free.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>He could have used her services again.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t deliver, get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>Cold. Hard. Just what he\u2019d expect from a hunter like her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But her eyes were wild. Not just with lust but with fear. Her lips trembled and he knew, better than others, what demons rode her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going any place.\u201d Not yet.</p><p>Fuck the dawn.</p> <p>Forget.</p><p>He\u2019d make her forget all right. And make her always remember him and what he could give to her.</p><p>His fingers caught the edge of her panties. Plain white cotton. Serviceable. The panties shouldn\u2019t have been sexy. On her, they were.</p><p>He eased down, lowering his head, and kissed her through the fabric. Her hips shot up at the sensual touch.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d His eyes lifted to hers. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t. He could read the words on her face though she didn\u2019t speak a word.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to,\u201d he said and meant it. Sooner or later, there would be no choice.</p><p>He licked his lips and knew he couldn\u2019t stop. Didn\u2019t want to stop. His cock was nearly bursting, so full he hurt, and the woman who\u2019d crept into his mind and twisted his fantasies into nightmares quivered beneath him. His to pleasure.</p><p>His.</p><p>For the moment, anyway.</p><p>Her scent was so much richer now and the hunger inside had only grown stronger. His teeth caught the band of elastic. He jerked his head and the fabric tore.</p> <p>\u201cChase!\u201d</p><p>His head shot up. \u201cSimon.\u201d No distance here. No walls. He wouldn\u2019t allow them.</p><p>His fingers ripped away the torn panties and tossed them across the room. Then he touched her. Easing his fingers into the blond curls between her legs, he found her plump, wet, and hot.</p><p>Just the way he liked a woman.</p><p>Her breath hissed out when he touched her clit. A hard press with his thumb then a slow caress with his fingers. He\u2019d learned long ago how to pleasure a woman. How to make her moan and beg. How to make her scream.</p><p>He wanted Dee to scream for him.</p><p>His index finger found her opening. Pushed inside. Tight. Sweat beaded on his brow. So tight.</p><p>The back of his zipper was going to be permanently indented on his dick at this rate.</p> <p>Another finger thrust inside and stretched her. Dee\u2019s neck arched.</p><p>Don\u2019t tempt.</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her thighs, and he opened her even wider to his touch and his stare.</p><p>To his mouth.</p><p>Pink flesh, moist and waiting.</p><p>His lips touched her first. A light caress. Gentle and easy.</p><p>\u201cSimon, more!\u201d No gentle and easy command there.</p><p>His tongue swiped over her clit and she jolted. His fingers tightened around her thighs, clamping down harder and he pulled her flush against his mouth.</p><p>He took.</p><p>His tongue tasted, licked. His mouth worked the tight button of her desire. He felt her stiffen, felt the coil of her muscles, and he learned what she liked.</p><p>What she loved.</p><p>Her thighs shook. Her fingers latched onto his shoulders\u2014the better to hold him tight. Not that he was going anywhere. No damn place right then.</p><p>His tongue stabbed into her sex. Her taste, that sweet and spicy blend, filled his mouth, and he knew he couldn\u2019t get enough. Not now.</p><p>Not even close.</p><p>The tremble began in her sex, a telling tightening that he knew came right before orgasm.</p><p>Scream for me.</p><p>He freed her thighs. His thumb pressed onto her clit. His tongue thrust into that tight slit\u2014</p><p>Dee came against his mouth, her body bucking, her fingernails biting deep into his flesh.</p><p>But the woman didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>His gaze lifted and he saw her eyes go blind. The perfect lash of pleasure covered her face, but she bit her lip, holding back the cry of pleasure.</p><p>Screw that shit.</p><p>He rose, licking his lips, tasting her and wanting to fuck her so badly that he burned. A bead of blood appeared on her lip. Small, so red.</p><p>His mouth lowered toward her. Easy.</p><p>She turned her head away and his lips skated over her jaw.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Her nails retreated and he missed the bite immediately. Her hands curved over him, hesitant now that the fire was slaked. \u201cThat was...ah...nice.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he lifted his upper body. Simon caught her chin and forced her to look at him. Her tongue slicked over her lower lip, taking away that drop of blood. \u201cNice?\u201d He repeated.</p><p>No, the woman hadn\u2019t just said that to him.</p><p>Her smile came then, a slow curl that lit her face, then her eyes. \u201cMaybe better than nice.\u201d</p><p>A tease. Should have known it.</p><p>Her bare legs shifted against his jean-clad thighs.</p><p>\u201cA lot better,\u201d he told her definitely.</p><p>One blond brow rose.</p><p>\u201cThe best you ever had,\u201d he continued, keeping his lips flat when they wanted to lift in response to the furrow that appeared between the brows.</p><p>Dee blinked, a long, slow blink. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve had.\u201d</p><p>He bit back the sudden fury that rose in him. \u201cDon\u2019t want to know,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>Her fingers slid between them and reached for the button on the jeans. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens when we have\u2014\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. Now this was the painful part. His balls would be blue all day long. \u201cI\u2019ve got to leave, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Surprise there. Hurt?</p><p>Maybe. A good sign.</p><p>He rose from the couch and didn\u2019t bother dragging his gaze off her naked body as he straightened his own clothes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to cover up. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo take one very cold shower.\u201d Honesty, finally. Kind of felt good to be honest with her.</p><p>Her brows pulled low in confusion as she asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because sex right then wasn\u2019t the way to gain her trust. The way to gain some hard, fast pleasure, hell yeah, but not the way to get to his end goal. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to be more than a fast fuck, Sandra Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d Her breasts heaved as she straightened. Gorgeous. Maybe he\u2019d have one more taste.</p><p>He bent toward her and swiped his tongue over her nipple. Yes.</p><p>Could have been his sigh. Could have been hers.</p><p>Leave.</p><p>A hard suck on that nipple, then he pulled back. \u201cThe hours before dawn are hard, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Her breath came fast. \u201cWh-what are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Everything he could.</p><p>\u201cYou needed me to fight the dark. You called, I came.\u201d Well, not quite the coming he would have liked. \u201cRemember that. I gave but I didn\u2019t take a single thing from you.\u201d</p><p>Next time, he wouldn\u2019t be so nice. Especially since being nice wasn\u2019t really in his genetic makeup.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her sex. He could still taste her. His teeth snapped together.</p><p>She rose but didn\u2019t bother reaching for her clothes. What was she trying to do to him?</p><p>He could lift her up, shove into her, and take the woman right there. Dee was so light, he\u2019d hold her and thrust and make her scream.</p><p>Pleasure, not pain.</p><p>Because he could do that, too, no matter what the whispers said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think you understand me better than anyone else.\u201d He let the words fall between them and managed to drag his gaze up to hers. \u201cI did my research, Dee, just like I know you did yours.\u201d</p><p>Not even a flicker of expression. But she reached for her shirt. Tugged it on with steady hands.</p><p>\u201cWe both know what it\u2019s like when the monsters come.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t say anything else. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Simon turned away and marched for the door. Dee didn\u2019t stop him. He didn\u2019t expect her to. That was, after all, part of the plan.</p><p>When he yanked open her door, the first rays of sunlight hit him.</p><p>Dawn.</p><p>He glanced back. \u201cMore than a fuck, Dee.\u201d So much more. \u201cWhen you need me, you know how to find me.\u201d</p><p>Squaring his shoulders, he headed into the light.</p><p>And not once did he glance back.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>When night fell, coming with its thick, hot darkness and moonless sky, Dee headed back to Onyx.</p><p>There\u2019d been no sign of the woman since their last encounter, and she\u2019d spent all day using every one of Night Watch\u2019s contacts in hope of finding Sunshine.</p><p>No luck.</p><p>So Dee figured she\u2019d better let the woman find her again.</p><p>And that was why her butt was parked once again at the bar.</p><p>Her gaze scanned the crowd. Pretty light since it was only a little past nine. The heavy hitters would come in later.</p><p>Her stare tracked across the room, not lingering too long, looking for the tall, muscled length of\u2014</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Dee ground her back teeth together as she caught herself. The object was to find the woman from last night, not Chase.</p><p>Not the man who\u2019d given her a fast, hard ride straight into one of her better orgasms, then walked away.</p><p>Walked away.</p><p>What had been up with that?</p><p>More than a fuck. She spun toward the bartender. \u201cA beer, Mike. The cheaper, the better.\u201d One drink, that was all she ever allowed herself when she hunted. A big, long glass mirror ran the length of the bar and Dee stared at her reflection. Wow\u2014was that her hair? Maybe she should\u2014</p><p>Her eyes locked on a man. Black hair. Broad shoulders. Tall, strong. Don\u2019t-give-a-damn swagger.</p><p>Chase.</p><p>Her breath eased out.</p><p>The man was double-timing it to the exit.</p><p>Running from her?</p><p>Or chasing something? Someone?</p><p>\u201cHold the beer.\u201d She shoved away from the bar. \u201cBe back in five.\u201d The exit door had already swung shut, but Dee rushed forward. If there was a hunt, she\u2019d be in on the action. And if there wasn\u2019t...</p><p>Well, she had a few things to say to Mr. More Than A Fuck.</p><p>Her fingers clamped around the door knob. Just in case, she went out silently, armed, ready.</p><p>But no one was there. Just an empty back lot.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cYou did well.\u201d The vampire stared into the human female\u2019s eyes, enjoying the soft ebb and flow of her blood. Her heart raced as he crossed to her. With every step, the blood flowed faster.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cShe was right where you said she\u2019d be. All alone.\u201d A quick swipe of her tongue across those ripe red lips. \u201cI-I could have killed her for you. I would have.\u201d</p><p>Such an eager little helper. \u201cI know.\u201d He trailed his fingertip down her cheek. Lisa. He didn\u2019t remember her last name. Didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d she whispered and her eyes were so wide and blue. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>Because she wanted to live forever. Because Lisa, with her thin thighs and her big breasts and her perfect face, was aging. Slowly. One faint line at a time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to kill.\u201d Her chin lifted even as she swayed toward him.</p><p>His fangs lengthened. He\u2019d love to have one more taste of her. Fresh blood was always the best. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve proven that.\u201d She\u2019d brought prey to him that very first night. His fingers trailed down her throat and curled over that frantic pulse. \u201cBut are you afraid to die?\u201d</p><p>Hope lit her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do it? You\u2019re going to change me?\u201d Her smile stretched her face. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Then he lifted the weapon he\u2019d kept hidden and stabbed her. Right in that laboring heart.</p><p>She choked at first, probably on her own blood because he saw the trickle of red slide from the corner of her mouth. Those wide eyes filled with pain and shock because this wasn\u2019t the death she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Because he hated for all that good blood to go to waste, he bent toward her, and licked those sweet drops away from her lips.</p><p>Then he let her body fall.</p><p>Time to get the other bitch.</p><p>Now this was just...weird. Dee shoved the stake back into her ankle holster. She tilted her head, straining to pick up some sound to indicate movement, but she just caught the muted beat of music.</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d circled back around to the front of the building. Possible. But that fast?</p><p>Her gaze darted to the row of cars nestled on the left. She didn\u2019t see anyone over there, but...</p><p>Dee stalked to the vehicles, aware of a growing tension in her body. Last night, a woman had told her she\u2019d die here.</p><p>Being back now, okay, that would make anyone nervous.</p><p>Narrowing her eyes, she caught sight of a small, red vehicle. Wait\u2014that was\u2014</p><p>A rush of wind behind her.</p><p>Oh, damn. Dee froze. She didn\u2019t need to look back to know she wasn\u2019t alone anymore. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d show up,\u201d she muttered. Her fingers were just a few inches away from her gun holster. So if she was right and a vamp had just closed in on her\u2014damn but they were almost as quiet as shifters these days\u2014then a gunshot wouldn\u2019t kill him.</p><p>But it would still hurt. A lot. And it would give her the precious minutes she needed to stake the asshole.</p><p>\u201cI have been watching you,\u201d he said, his voice clipping a bit with an English accent.</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d She turned, slowly, to face the vampire. Her fingers brushed the holster. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been waiting on you.\u201d Dee shook her head. \u201cDidn\u2019t your mother ever tell you it\u2019s wrong to make a woman wait?\u201d</p><p>His fangs were out. Long and sharp. As she watched, his blue eyes faded to black. Great. Dee swallowed. A vamp in full hunting mode.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to play with you.\u201d That black stare raked her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d This was it. \u201cThen I guess we better skip the fore-play, huh?\u201d No way to tell if this was the Born Master or one of his minions because the Borns, they always had freaking minions. \u201cMaybe we should just get around to the death part.\u201d Dee jerked out her gun and fired, six times, dead center in his chest.</p><p>Flesh and bone torn away, blood splattered around them. Dee stood so close that the bastard\u2019s blood rained on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he didn\u2019t flinch. Didn\u2019t fall to his knees. Didn\u2019t stumble. Just stared at her, and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll wish I killed you, before it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She still had more bullets. This time, Dee aimed for the head. \u201cPromises, promises.\u201d Her finger tightened around the trigger\u2014and they attacked.</p><p>Five, no, six vamps jumped from the darkness, teeth and claws out and ready to kill. Dee didn\u2019t waste breath on a scream. She fired, fired until the trigger just clicked. They took her down and her body hit the ground, hard. But, twisting like a snake beneath the fists and bodies, she managed to grab her stake\u2014new weapon, new fight. Dee swiped out at them, too aware that she\u2019d made a fatal mistake and walked right into their trap.</p> <p>You\u2019re dead, Dee. Sunshine\u2019s voice rang in her head. No one will mourn. No one will even miss you when you\u2019re rotting in the ground.</p><p>Simon had just walked into Onyx when he heard the distinct thunder of gunfire. Hell.</p><p>His gaze scanned the big room. Dee, be here.</p><p>A curvy redhead walked by him, a wide smile on her lips. \u201cHi there, handsome, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d He brushed by her and cut a quick path to the bar. He slammed his hands down on the counter. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a woman.\u201d</p> <p>The bartender didn\u2019t glance up. \u201cTry looking behind you.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Simon leaned over the counter and grabbed the idiot\u2019s shirt. Whiskey spilled over his hand. \u201cYou remember the woman I was with last night.\u201d Not a question.</p><p>The guy\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cYou kidding me? Do you know how many chicks come in here every night? No way do I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall. Blond hair she\u2019d hacked to pieces. Tight ass and lips that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p> <p>The bartender pointed one hand to the left. Exit.</p><p>Simon thrust him back. He spun around\u2014</p><p>And came face to face with a demon.</p><p>Not just any demon. Her demon. Another Night Watch hunter. Zane Wynter. The guy looked like a human, but Simon knew he was far more monster than man. Simon snarled, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be watching her ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought that was what you were doing last night.\u201d</p><p>The music had kicked up. The band blasted some screaming shit and\u2014was that another shot? \u201cOut of my way,\u201d Simon ordered.</p><p>The demon didn\u2019t move. Fine.</p><p>Simon shoved the bastard back, a good three feet, and ran for the exit even as the demon shattered a table before he hit the floor.</p> <p>A kick sent the door flying open. \u201cDee!\u201d He could smell her, that wild scent drifting in the air.</p><p>Simon rushed forward and saw the gun tossed on the ground. Her gun. \u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t see his little hunter.</p><p>Gone.</p><p>Maybe dead.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>Growling, he took off into the night, following the scent of the blood trail as fast as he could. Dee had made her attackers bleed and that sweet scent would take him right to her.</p><p>If he could get there in time.</p><p>The wail of sirens woke her. A loud, hard scream she\u2019d heard too many times before. Dee fought to open her eyes. A groan tore from her lips as pain wracked her body.</p><p>Vampires.</p><p>The breath she\u2019d tried to suck in now choked out as realization crashed into her.</p><p>Had she taken them down? Or had they Taken her?</p><p>Please, no.</p><p>The stench hit her then. The coppery odor she\u2019d first caught long ago and had never forgotten. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>No, not again.</p><p>Her lashes fluttered open. She squinted, trying to see. But it was so dark. Pitch black.</p><p>She shoved up and a blast of agony burned through her head at the move. Shit that hurt. Her hands slapped down as she struggled for balance, and something sticky and wet coated her fingertips.</p><p>No.</p><p>The scent hit her again, stronger now that she was aware, striking like a hard punch in the face. Bile rose and she choked, scared, sick.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>She scrambled back, but hit something. Something soft and still.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed as she strained to see but the darkness was too perfect. Her hands fumbled, reaching out.</p><p>Flesh.</p><p>An arm. Cold to the touch.</p><p>A hip.</p><p>Stomach.</p><p>Then\u2014oh, God, no\u2014</p><p>A loud boom blasted to her right and light exploded on her as\u2014what? A door?\u2014flew open.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked at the sound and the move sent fire burning through the base of her skull.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn, what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>That voice...Simon.</p><p>A crack of light shot in behind him, illuminating the sparse interior of her hell. She glanced away from him, following the horror in his eyes to see the body.</p><p>High-end clothes, soaked red. Long, tangled black hair covered half of the woman\u2019s face. A face she knew. Little Miss Sunshine lay dead beneath her hands. Not a pretty death. Too brutal.</p><p>Dee\u2019s fingertips fluttered around the wooden stake that had been driven into the other woman\u2019s heart.</p><p>Her breath rasped out. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Her hands flew back. A human. Sunshine had been a human. In life, and in death.</p><p>Dee tried to scramble up, but she slipped and fell in the blood that coated the floor.</p><p>Just like before. \u201cMom? Mom! Help me!\u201d</p><p>But no one had helped her.</p><p>\u201cDee? Dee?\u201d Simon grabbed her and lifted her into his arms. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, but the other woman was dead.</p><p>Did I kill her?</p><p>Please, God, no. She couldn\u2019t remember anything. Not since the alley, when all those vamps jumped her\u2014</p><p>Her hand flew to her neck. Had she been bitten? Christ. If they\u2019d bitten her, they\u2019d be able to get into her head. Sick, twisted freaks.</p><p>Simon turned away from the body. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the hell out of here!\u201d His hold bruised her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, we can\u2019t leave her. The cops\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre about to storm the place any minute.\u201d The sirens screamed, so close now. So close.</p><p>Dee heaved against him, but he just clamped his hands tighter around her and ran from the pit. No, not a pit, she realized as more light spilled onto her. Some kind of warehouse?</p><p>Simon raced outside, holding her tight.</p><p>Yeah, a warehouse. With some boarded-up windows, a condemned sign on the side, and a few streetlights spilling light on her hell.</p><p>\u201cThe cops find you here, your ass will be headed for jail.\u201d He all but shoved her into his car. The smell of leather flooded her nostrils but it couldn\u2019t block the stench of blood. So much blood.</p><p>Sunshine\u2019s blood had stained her skin.</p><p>A car door slammed. Dee glanced up just as Simon cranked the engine, then he gunned the Mustang and they flew forward with a snarl of the motor.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t...leave the scene.\u201d Her mind wasn\u2019t working right. She knew it. Everything seemed slow. The streetlights too bright. Dee squinted as she ran a hand over the back of her head.</p><p>When Dee touched the fist-sized knot at the base of her skull, her breath rasped out. What did they do to me?</p><p>Simon jerked the wheel to the right and turned down a street. Then another. Another. The mustang snaked through alleys and back roads, taking so many turns that Dee felt dizzy.</p><p>She\u2019d thought she knew the city.</p><p>She\u2019d thought wrong.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut and she saw\u2014</p><p>A stake, driven deep into the woman\u2019s chest. Blood.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The word broke from her lips as her eyes cracked open. \u201cShe was a...lure. She shouldn\u2019t have been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d Simon spared her a glance. \u201cFocus for me. How much of the blood is yours? Did the bastards bite you?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t know. Her hands started to tremble. The steady pounding in her head had nausea rolling through her. \u201cNot sure.\u201d Okay, that sounded normal. Didn\u2019t it? Her tongue seemed so thick in her mouth. \u201cThe woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Dee! She\u2019s dead! She was part of a setup! The vamps left you there, with a stake\u2014probably one of yours\u2014in that woman\u2019s heart, and they sent the police to find you.\u201d</p><p>The sirens\u2014how had the police known to come?</p><p>He took another corner and the tires squealed. \u201cWhat do you think would have happened when the cops found you crouched over a dead human?\u201d</p><p>The throbbing was worse. She could actually hear the pulses. That couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cGot...friends who are cops.\u201d They would\u2019ve listened to her. Tony\u2014she could count on him. \u201cT-Tony...\u201d Okay, that had been slurred.</p><p>\u201cHell! You\u2019re about to pass out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Um, yeah.</p><p>\u201cDee? Dee!\u201d He hit the brakes and she fell forward. The seat belt she didn\u2019t remember buckling\u2014maybe he had?\u2014cut across her chest. \u201cStay with me. I\u2019ve got to know...it\u2019s important. Did they bite you?\u201d</p><p>The street lights didn\u2019t seem so bright anymore. Or maybe her eyes were just closed. Hard to tell for sure.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she whispered and the last thing she heard was\u2014</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Death had a way of making the beautiful...ugly.</p><p>Baton Rouge Police Captain Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Young stared down at the body before him. He was used to the blood, so the stench and the sight didn\u2019t bother him. This wasn\u2019t his first time to find a horror/freak show crime scene. Wouldn\u2019t be his last either.</p><p>He crouched beside the body and a soundless whistle passed his lips. Someone had screwed up. He could see the bite marks on the woman\u2019s neck, so yeah, she\u2019d been a vamp chew toy, but\u2014</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been a vamp.</p><p>The movies and TV shows had vampire killings all wrong. When vamps were staked, they didn\u2019t age or shrivel or explode into dust.</p><p>Nothing so fancy.</p><p>But the change was there. You just had to know what you were looking for to see it.</p><p>At death, well, their second death, anyway, a vamp\u2019s elongated fangs retracted. The darkness in their eyes\u2014the darkness that came when they hunted\u2014faded away.</p><p>Their bodies stiffened, hardening immediately so that when an ME looked later, the TOD was never right. No way could you determine the time of death for a vamp, just couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Their skin whitened, not slowly turning ashy and yellow like a human\u2019s. No, the skin drained of color until the flesh was the starkest of whites, and the drain was nearly instantaneous.</p><p>Those signs were always dead giveaways that you were dealing with a vamp. Those indicators, and the wooden stake that was generally lodged in the chest. Hard to miss the stake.</p><p>\u201cOh, man, is that who I think it is?\u201d The uniform next to Antonio pressed in a bit too close.</p><p>Antonio slapped his hand against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about screwing up my crime scene.\u201d Like things weren\u2019t screwed up enough. That tip they\u2019d received...\u201cTwo women fighting, screaming, someone needs help at Belmont and Queens. The crazy bitch was screaming about vampires.\u201d</p><p>Screaming about vampires\u2014and now the victim had been staked.</p><p>\u201cCaptain, don\u2019t you recognize her?\u201d</p><p>He turned to stare at the uniform. Red spots blotched the kid\u2019s face. \u201cShould I?\u201d Another body. Another case that would give him heartburn. Couldn\u2019t the supernaturals ever back off?</p><p>A quick swipe of the cop\u2019s tongue. \u201cShe\u2019s Lisa Durant. You know, Senator Durant\u2019s niece. I saw\u2014I saw her on TV a few weeks back. She was...\u201d His gaze fell to the body. \u201cHot.\u201d</p><p>Not anymore.</p><p>Antonio\u2019s back teeth locked. Senator\u2019s niece. Oh, hell. Keeping this quiet would be a bitch.</p><p>He glanced back at the stake. His eyes narrowed. \u201cJon...is that what I think it is?\u201d Not enough light to tell for sure from this angle, but that looked like\u2014</p><p>The crime scene tech who\u2019d crouched beside the body shot him a grin. \u201cBloody fingerprints. Hell, yes.\u201d</p><p>Antonio\u2019s hand ran over his face. \u201cRun \u2019em, and give the report to me.\u201d His eyes held Jon\u2019s. \u201cOnly me, you got that?\u201d</p><p>Jon gave a grim nod.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Because he had a feeling the supernatural shit was about to hit the fan in his city.</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d</p><p>Somebody shook her. Hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to wake up. That hit you took to the head left you concussed. You can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>But she really wanted to, just a little longer anyway.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d Another shake. One hard enough to rattle her teeth.</p><p>She managed to crack open one eye. \u201cShould you really...shake a woman with a...concussion?\u201d</p><p>A brief grin turned up his lips. \u201cIt was either shake you or maybe let you slide into a coma.\u201d</p><p>Something wet and cold pressed against the back of her neck and Dee sucked in a fast breath. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>The grin flashed again. Was the guy enjoying her pain or what? \u201cThe ice will make the giant knot go away sooner.\u201d</p><p>Both of her eyes opened. Dee realized she was on a couch, propped up against some cushions, and Simon, he was over her, around her. One hand held her shoulder, urging her close, while the other anchored the ice pack at the base of her skull. Mere inches separated their faces. His smoky eyes were so deep and intense. She noticed his lashes then. Really long, dark lashes. Weird, because his face was hard and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou back with me this time?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She blinked, realizing that though her skull still throbbed, the grogginess of before was gone. \u201cYeah, I...think so.\u201d If she could stop being an idiot and gazing into his eyes like some lovesick teen with a crush. Jeez. Dee fumbled for the ice pack. Her fingers tangled with his. \u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve got this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His jaw locked.</p><p>Okay, so maybe she wasn\u2019t being the most gracious victim.</p><p>Good southern manners had never been her strong suit.</p> <p>Simon\u2019s hand fell away and she pressed the frigid pack against her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry...about me,\u201d she managed. \u201cI\u2019m a fast healer.\u201d For a human, anyway. She dragged her gaze away from him and scanned the room. Bare walls. No photos, no paintings. A TV, DVD player, game consoles. And in the corner...what was that? A porn magazine? \u201cAh, your place?\u201d</p><p>A grim nod.</p><p>The ice shifted beneath her fingers. \u201cLook, Simon, I appreciate you trying to come to my aid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saved your ass, Dee, again.\u201d</p><p>True, though she was a bit sketchy on the details. \u201cI don\u2019t...I can\u2019t remember what happened after I left the alley.\u201d The vamps had jumped her. She\u2019d fired her gun. Run out of bullets. Started staking.</p> <p>Too many of them.</p><p>They\u2019d knocked her down. Her head had thudded into the ground and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI woke up in her blood.\u201d She didn\u2019t even know the woman\u2019s name. Another vic. So many nameless faces.</p><p>Simon began to ease back. Dee\u2019s left hand grabbed for him. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill her.\u201d</p><p>His head cocked. \u201cThought you just said you didn\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Dee swallowed and hoped she was telling the truth. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t kill a human.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou had the stake against her heart last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo scare her, not to kill her!\u201d Oh, bad idea. Shouting made the throbbing much worse. \u201cSimon, trust me, I-I wouldn\u2019t kill a human, not after what happened to\u2014\u201d She broke off, clamping her lips together. So, what? A bump on the head had made her super chatty?</p><p>\u201cYou want me to trust you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dee realized her fingers were digging into his wrist. With an effort, she unclamped and nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me why you\u2019re so gung-ho against the vamps, and make me believe you\u2019d never stake an unarmed woman. Then we\u2019ll see about talking trust.\u201d</p><p>The ice had begun to melt. A trickle of water slid down the back of her neck. \u201cMy story\u2019s not so different from yours.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Fine. He wanted her soul naked\u2014that was the way it would have to be. Because right now, she needed him. Until I can find out what the hell is happening. \u201cWhen I was fifteen, I came home to find a bloodbath at my house.\u201d</p> <p>Mom? Mom? Where are you?</p><p>Dee ignored that soft voice whispering in her head. The voice of the girl she\u2019d been a lifetime ago.</p><p>She cleared her throat and said, \u201cMy date dropped me off at the door. My first date.\u201d He\u2019d wrapped his sweaty palms around her shoulders and given her a kiss. Wet, sloppy, but her first kiss. Then he\u2019d hightailed it out of there when he heard a thump from inside.</p><p>Vince had thought her dad was coming. The ex-marine, tough as nails guy who\u2019d been cleaning his gun before they left.</p><p>\u201cDammit, I loved him so much,\u201d she murmured. That stupid gun. She\u2019d begged him to put the thing up before Vince arrived. People didn\u2019t really do things like that, but he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe boy you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hard shake of her head. \u201cNo. Forget it.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cThe lights were on when I went inside, but I couldn\u2019t find anyone.\u201d But she\u2019d smelled a thick, hard odor.</p><p>Blood and death.</p><p>\u201cI found my dad first. He was in the hallway. His throat had been ripped open.\u201d So much blood. She hadn\u2019t screamed when she\u2019d seen him. She should have, she\u2019d even tried, but her breath had been gone.</p><p>She\u2019d dropped to her knees next to him. His precious gun had still been in his hands. Her dad never loaded the thing so it hadn\u2019t done him a bit of good.</p><p>Simon\u2019s fingers skated down her cheek and Dee realized she\u2019d dropped her gaze. His hand curled under her chin and he forced her to look at him again.</p><p>Better him than the past. \u201cI found my sister next.\u201d She paused, felt the pain. \u201cShe was seven.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d killed her in her bedroom, right there next to Sara\u2019s pretty pink bed and her tall, white doll house.</p><p>\u201cSome vamps get off on children\u2019s blood. They think it makes them stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cDee, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She was, but she could still see Sara. \u201cShe used to drive me crazy. I was so much older and\u2014\u201d And Simon probably didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t want to know what a bitch she\u2019d been to her kid sister. Didn\u2019t want to know that she\u2019d run straight to Sara\u2019s room after finding her father, her heart burning her chest. When she\u2019d found Sara, she\u2019d fallen.</p><p>The scream had come then. Breaking from her mouth and shattering her.</p><p>\u201cI screamed for her, for help, and then I heard the footsteps coming.\u201d</p><p>So stupid.</p><p>\u201cThey would have heard you the minute you entered the house,\u201d Simon said and his face hardened. \u201cThe bastards were just playing with you.\u201d</p><p>She knew that now. They\u2019d let her find the bodies, let the terror and grief break her, and they\u2019d crept out to watch her. Sick, twisted freaks.</p><p>Then they\u2019d attacked.</p><p>\u201cTheir mouths were stained with blood. When I saw their teeth, I-I didn\u2019t believe what I was seeing at first.\u201d</p><p>Because who would believe vampires were real? That they\u2019d just slaughtered your family?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you, little Sandra Dee, waiting so long.\u201d</p><p>Dee jumped and the ice pack tumbled from her fingers. \u201cWhat? What the hell did you just say?\u201d</p><p>His fingers fell away. \u201cI said they were waiting for you, probably trying to make sure you were alone before they attacked. It\u2019s the way the bastards work.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it was.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d</p><p>Because of a miracle. Or, no, maybe because the devil had gotten bored and decided to stir up hell on earth. \u201cMy mother came down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Still alive. Dee had gasped those words. One vamp had held her right arm, another her left. She\u2019d thought they were going to rip her apart. And the other vamp bastard\u2014the one with the blond hair, coal black eyes, and the lying, kind face\u2014he\u2019d watched her with a smile.</p><p>Her mother had stumbled down the steps. Thick, gaping wounds covered her neck. \u201cThe vamps hadn\u2019t been easy with her.\u201d A rusty, broken laugh. \u201cWhen are they ever easy?\u201d A kind kill wasn\u2019t generally an option for vampires. They liked prey to suffer.</p><p>Blood had soaked her mother\u2019s shirt. Her face...\u201cShe was so pale. Trembling. And her eyes, they were\u2014\u201d Changing. Fading from a brilliant gold to dark shadows. She hadn\u2019t known what that darkness meant. Not then.</p><p>\u201cThey laughed when they saw her. Told her that she couldn\u2019t have a drink.\u201d Mom doesn\u2019t drink. The stupid thought had been the fifteen-year-old\u2019s. Her mother never touched alcohol. Never.</p><p>His jaw locked but his gaze never wavered. \u201cFinish it,\u201d he gritted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to. Dee squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Just like her mother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Were all vampires really bad?</p><p>Some hunters claimed a vampire lost his soul when he was transformed. That goodness died and only evil remained. A shifter had told her that once\u2014he\u2019d said the decay and the rot that he smelled from vamps came from the decay inside, where a soul should be.</p><p>Maybe the old fox had been full of bullshit, but she\u2019d asked Jude and he\u2019d said he caught the same stench any time a vamp was near.</p><p>Except once, he\u2019d told her about a vamp in LA who\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow did you get away?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Dee opened her eyes. \u201cShe\u2014she had a weapon. That thump I\u2019d heard before, she\u2019d broken a table. I guess they didn\u2019t think she had any fight left, but she did.\u201d A bit of pride there. \u201cWhen she reached the landing, she lunged and stabbed the lead bastard in the back.\u201d</p><p>A moment of weakness. That was all she\u2019d needed. Just a moment.</p><p>\u201cGo, Sandra Dee. Go,\u201d she whispered her mother\u2019s last words. A sad smile curved her lips. \u201cAnd I did. I ran and I left her there.\u201d To die.</p><p>Rage and fear had twisted her stomach as she rushed down the hall and out of the house. \u201cI left her,\u201d she repeated, voice still soft. The other vamps had turned on her mother when she\u2019d stabbed the leader, and their attack had given Dee that one moment to break away.</p><p>Kill them. The thought now was the same as it had been then. Kill them. She hadn\u2019t wanted to get help. She\u2019d wanted to find someone to kill the bastards in her house.</p><p>\u201cI ran outside. Went to a neighbor\u2019s.\u201d They hadn\u2019t been close. Not close enough to hear her first scream. If only.</p><p>Mark McKenley and his wife Julie had wanted to go to her house, right away. They\u2019d called the cops, and Mark had taken off with his old hunting shotgun. Dee remembered rushing after him, screaming that the gun wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cSomething happened in my house.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cFire...the smoke, I saw it the minute I went back outside.\u201d</p><p>Mom!</p><p>\u201cFire burns fast, you know. So fast.\u201d Greedy flames, licking up the side of her house, peeling the paint away in thick bubbles, eating at her home.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d his gruff whisper.</p><p>Julie had held her back. Mark, sixty, with stooped shoulders and shaking hands, had burst into the burning house, screaming her mother\u2019s name.</p><p>He\u2019d stayed inside, until the firefighters arrived and dragged his body out.</p><p>Dead. Like the others.</p><p>My fault. She hadn\u2019t even been able to look at Julie after that.</p><p>\u201cThe cops and firefighters didn\u2019t believe me when I told them what happened.\u201d Not that she could blame them. Hell, they\u2019d probably thought she was crazy or high. \u201cThe story ran in the paper a few days later.\u201d She\u2019d read it with tears streaming down her face. \u201cThey ruled it a murder-suicide. After the fire stopped, the only remains they found inside were\u2014well, they said they could identify Mom, Dad, and Sara.\u201d Not her. Not now. \u201cNo sign of the vamps, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Understanding in the guttural word. He knew where this was going.</p><p>\u201cThey said my mom killed Dad and Sara, then she shoved a knife into her own throat.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. Not her mom. Not the woman who\u2019d sacrificed her own life so Dee could get away. \u201cNo one would believe me.\u201d The steady throb in her head was driving her crazy, but she\u2019d deal.</p><p>She always did.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do? Where did you go?\u201d</p><p>To the streets. \u201cI took off on my own.\u201d With the stupid idea of finding the vamps who\u2019d attacked her family and killing them. But, at fifteen, she hadn\u2019t known how to live on the streets. She\u2019d been close to starving a week later, dirty, cold. Her jaw locked. \u201cI managed to get by.\u201d A shrug. Like she could shrug away those dark years. \u201cThen I met Jason Pak.\u201d No, he\u2019d found her. Stalked her and found her in that roach-infested apartment she\u2019d bleed to pay for.</p><p>\u201cPak.\u201d He echoed the name. Most folks in Baton Rouge knew of Pak, even if they hadn\u2019t personally met the guy. Bad reputations carried too easily.</p><p>\u201cThe first thing he told me...He said I wasn\u2019t crazy.\u201d But she\u2019d thought he was.</p><p>\u201cAnd the second?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers fisted. \u201cHe said he\u2019d teach me to kill the bastards.\u201d</p><p>Pak had always been a man of his word.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found those vamps yet, but I will.\u201d One day. Then maybe she\u2019d stop hearing Sara\u2019s screams late at night. Maybe. Or maybe she\u2019d just hear them until she died.</p><p>His gaze roved over her face. Her neck. \u201cThey didn\u2019t bite you that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Adamant. A good thing, too, because most folks didn\u2019t understand just how dangerous even a little nip from a vamp could be.</p><p>Once a vampire took a victim\u2019s blood, he had a psychic link with his prey. If he was strong enough, he could steal thoughts, memories, and send seductive whispers in the hours of darkness.</p><p>Some of them\u2014those ancient Born Masters\u2014it was possible they could even control their prey. Get humans to follow their every twisted command. Like sick, freaking puppets.</p><p>Dee never wanted to be a puppet. Never.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she shoved off the couch. Their thighs brushed and she fought to ignore the wave of heat from that quick touch.</p><p>Her knees shook a little when she stood. For just a second, black spots danced before her eyes and the nausea rolled in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d He was there, rising, too, and putting a bracing hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Careful. Don\u2019t get used to him being there.</p><p>Alone. That was how she lived her life. How she\u2019d keep on living it.</p><p>She stiffened her spine and lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d Not a total lie. Dee was pretty sure there was no immediate threat of death.</p><p>Slowly, she turned to face Simon. She looked up at him. \u201cAfter what happened to my family, do you really think I\u2019d ever take a human\u2019s life? I couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d be the same as\u2014\u201d</p><p>Them.</p><p>The vampires. Stealing life, spilling blood.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember what happened in that room, but I know I wouldn\u2019t have staked her.\u201d The vampires. Had they made her watch and she couldn\u2019t even remember it? Had the woman begged her for help?</p><p>Simon weighed her with icy eyes. Silence filled the room, heavy and thick, then he gave a grim nod. \u201cIf you\u2019d wanted to kill her, she would have been dead on the ground last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not a ringing endorsement, but she\u2019d take what she could get. \u201cThanks for that much, at least.\u201d</p><p>Then it was her turn to pause because this part, yeah, it would be awkward. Well, hell, not like he hadn\u2019t already had her naked. \u201cI need a favor.\u201d She\u2019d bared her soul to him, a small favor really wasn\u2019t so much to ask in return. \u201cI played your game, told you the hell from my past, now I want one thing from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p> <p>She thought so.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d He gave a shrug. \u201cYou know you can crash here until we find out what\u2019s\u2014uh, Dee?\u201d</p><p>Her shirt hit the coffee table. The pounding in her head kicked up a notch. No help for it. She\u2019d had to yank the shirt off. Blood had stained and hardened the fabric, and she never wanted to see the shirt again.</p><p>Dee toed out of her shoes. Jerked open her jeans and\u2014</p><p>\u201cJust what kind of favor do you need, babe?\u201d His voice had thickened, darkened, and when she glanced up, Dee saw that those smoky eyes of his didn\u2019t look so cold anymore. No, not cold at all.</p> <p>She shoved down the jeans. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what happened\u2014that means they could have done anything to me.\u201d No, no, no. \u201cI...need you to check me.\u201d She licked her lips. It would have to be a full body check. No way could she take chances.</p><p>\u201cCheck you?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze held his. \u201cFor bite marks.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Oh, but he\u2019d sure like to take a bite. Simon swallowed and let his gaze slide over Dee\u2019s pale flesh. The woman knew how to strip, fast. A simple black bra and matching panties covered her. Well, covered what he most wanted to see, and she stood there, shoulders back, small breasts out, and told him...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need a full body check.\u201d</p> <p>Yes. He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious, Simon. It\u2019s not like a damn mosquito. If I\u2019ve even got one bite, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Real curious now. \u201cIf they bit you, there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Soft. Her hands lifted, hovered between them. \u201cI just\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened as she stared at her fingers. \u201cHer blood\u2019s still on me. On my hands.\u201d</p><p>Her fingernails were tinted red. Steaks of blood had dried on the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cSink.\u201d Snapped out.</p><p>He pointed to the bathroom and watched her dash away as he enjoyed the tight ripple of her ass. He followed slowly, the better to enjoy the view. Nice.</p><p>Dee wrenched on the water and, with his temperamental faucet, it flew everywhere. But she didn\u2019t so much as flinch beneath the lash of what he knew to be icy cold water. Simon stalked closer and watched as she grabbed his soap and began to all but scrub the flesh off her fingers.</p> <p>After about five minutes, he told her, \u201cI think you\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. Dropped the soap. The rush of the water seemed too loud to him. Always did, though.</p><p>\u201cCheck me.\u201d She growled the words. \u201cI\u2019ve got to know.\u201d</p><p>He eased up behind her, and he saw her elbow move as she turned off the water. But Dee didn\u2019t turn to face him.</p><p>The lights blazed in the small bathroom, giving him a perfect view of her body. Small, fragile...sexy. Even though she was small, the woman really had a fine ass. Maybe it was those panties. They hugged her curves so very, very well.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips skimmed her shoulders. \u201cHold still.\u201d</p><p>He caught the sharp inhalation of her breath. His gaze lifted from that sweet ass and scanned the rest of her body. Okay, his cock was so hard that it was about to bust through his jeans, but he\u2019d hold onto control and manage to focus for a while. He had to, for her.</p><p>This\u2014his fingers trailed over her small shoulder blades\u2014was important. To her and to him.</p><p>Because if she\u2019d been bitten, then she\u2019d been compromised. She\u2019d be a risk to herself, to her friends.</p><p>To him.</p><p>Not that a bite would change his plans. No way would he abandon her now. Not when he\u2019d really just found her.</p><p>\u201cThe bra\u2019s got to come off.\u201d Guttural. Too bad. Not like he could manage much more than that. Simon figured he was lucky to be able to speak right then. His fingers slipped under the straps, then trailed down to the hook. If the vamps had fed on her, they would have tried to hide the mark.</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t want her aware.</p><p>The better to keep track, to torment.</p><p>He unhooked the snap. Pushed the bra off her shoulders and let it fall.</p><p>Simon had one damn good idea why the vamps had let Dee keep breathing and why they\u2019d tried to set her up.</p><p>Word on the street was that certain vamps had plans for Sandra Dee. Plans of pain and madness.</p><p>Death would have been too easy.</p><p>His mouth hovered over her, right above her shoulder. The skin looked so tender. He could\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>Simon jerked back. \u201cLet me check your front.\u201d</p><p>A huff, but she spun around.</p><p>His eyes widened when he saw her tight nipples. Still wet from the spray of water. Pointed, arching right up to him.</p><p>Fuck. The woman had a concussion for shit\u2019s sake. He couldn\u2019t devour her now, no matter how hungry he might feel.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t that much of a bastard.</p><p>Was he?</p><p>Her hands clamped on him. \u201cCheck.\u201d Breathy there. Hungry\u2014just like me.</p><p>Because she felt it, too. The lancing heat of lust. Always there. When she was close, he burned.</p><p>He slapped his hands against the sink, caging her. He let his eyes touch her flesh, the way his hands and mouth wanted to do so badly. \u201cLift your arms.\u201d</p><p>Of course, the move just made those breasts arch more.</p><p>Dammit. Con-cus-sion.</p><p>His gaze raked across her flat stomach. Down to the black bikini panties.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Simon, I\u2019d know if I\u2019d been bitten there.\u201d</p><p>His lips curved. Couldn\u2019t help that. \u201cFair enough.\u201d He sure didn\u2019t need that sensual temptation then, anyway.</p><p>He wrapped his hands around her waist and he lifted her. He put her down on the counter\u2014probably with a bit too much force\u2014and reached for her legs.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>He pinned her with his stare. \u201cYou wanted this.\u201d</p><p>A grim nod. Her pupils were too big. Her eyes so dark. Almost like a vampire\u2019s. Almost.</p><p>He caught her right leg. Curved his fingers around the flesh and stroked upward. No breaks in the skin. No tears. No blood.</p><p>Her skin was so silken and soft. As he touched her, his heart slammed into his ribs. Simon pressed a kiss against her thigh. Can\u2019t help it.</p><p>A soft rasp came from Dee.</p><p>His fingers stilled around her knee. \u201cIf I find something, what are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>The question had to be asked. Had to be. His fingers rose.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ll get as far away from those bastards as I can.\u201d</p><p>Good. The more distance, the less control they\u2019d have. A lesson he knew well.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d She whispered and there was a quaver of fear in that husky voice.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He caught her left leg. Stroked her calf, worked up her leg and curved his fingers over her thigh. \u201cI don\u2019t think they touched you.\u201d</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t have dared. Not if they were following orders, and he suspected that there were definite orders out for Dee.</p><p>They\u2019d jerked her around. Had their fun.</p><p>Break her, but don\u2019t taste. Not yet.</p><p>An old order he\u2019d once heard a vampire give. Sick bastard.</p><p>He left his hand on her thigh. Such smooth skin. Such strong muscle beneath the silk.</p><p>His teeth ground together. Only one more place to check, and she\u2019d already told him that sweet spot was off limits. \u201cYou\u2019re clear,\u201d he gritted and shoved back.</p><p>Dee blinked at him. Then her gaze dropped, fell to his crotch, to the bulging hard-on he knew there was no hope of hiding.</p><p>Not like he wanted to hide the thing anyway. He wanted Dee. He\u2019d have her. But not when she was still spinning from an attack.</p><p>He stepped back, giving her some room, and yanked off his shirt. Simon stared at those breasts. Want them in my mouth. Her scent surrounded him. That deep, rich scent that was Dee.</p><p>His cock throbbed.</p><p>Could have found her corpse. The stake could have been lodged in her heart.</p><p>Then what the hell would I have done?</p><p>What. The. Hell?</p><p>Simon tossed Dee his shirt. \u201cCover up.\u201d The thing would swallow her.</p><p>Her fingers fisted in the material, catching it easily. \u201cSimon, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Dressed.\u201d He sucked in a harsh gulp of air. \u201cOr get fucked because, babe, it is a very near thing.\u201d A gentleman, no, he\u2019d never been that. The woman might not realize it, but he was trying for her.</p><p>Trying to protect her. From the freaks out there who were after her, and even from himself.</p><p>Slowly, taking her sweet time about it, Dee stuck her arms into the sleeves of the shirt. She hadn\u2019t put her bra back on\u2014what, did she want to torture him? He could see the tips of her nipples and he hadn\u2019t gotten to taste them and\u2014</p><p>Simon spun away from her. \u201cJust so you know,\u201d he growled. \u201cI was an idiot the other night.\u201d Should have taken her. Would have made things easier.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d A pause. \u201cSo what\u2019s your excuse now?\u201d</p><p>His head swung back toward her. \u201cThe concussion that has you trembling, your eyes dilated, and your speech still slurred.\u201d Okay, not really slurred. He\u2019d just thrown that one out for fun and to make his point. The woman was barely on her feet, if he took her, no\u2014no.</p><p>\u201cSo, when I\u2019m healed, it\u2019s game on?\u201d</p><p>What? His eyes slit. \u201cCount on it.\u201d Was this some bluff? Some tease? She\u2019d learn soon enough he wasn\u2019t the teasing kind.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her smile punched him in the gut and had him almost weaving. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired of waiting on your hard-to-get ass.\u201d</p><p>The laughter came from him, a little rusty and a little too hard.</p><p>That smile of hers widened, showing her pretty white teeth. Then she laughed with him, even as she put up a hand to touch the base of her head.</p><p>Oh, shit. He couldn\u2019t look away from the fullness of her lips. I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>Headed straight to hell, following a woman who would never be an angel.</p><p>Antonio entered the Night Watch building just before dawn. Hunters milled around, voices buzzed. The place was always the busiest at night.</p><p>The darkness was the best cover for catching prey.</p><p>He hurried past the line of back offices, a file gripped tightly in his left hand.</p><p>Rounding a corner, he headed down that last, lonely stretch of space\u2014</p><p>\u201cSir? Sir, may I help\u2014\u201d</p><p>New assistant. Antonio halted. Great. Leave it to Pak to be breaking someone new in now.</p><p>Turning slowly, he eyed Pak\u2019s new PA. The woman looked to be pushing seventy. Her hair was a white mane, and her dark eyes were narrowed behind her wire-framed glasses. Her shoulders had stooped with time, just a bit. The woman looked like a small wind could slam her against the wall.</p><p>She also looked like she was someone\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>But, knowing Pak and the folks he liked to employ, odds were good that the woman was a witch. A demon. Or...who the hell knew what else.</p><p>Flashing his badge in a quick move, Antonio said, \u201cI need to speak with Pak. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d Or else he wouldn\u2019t have dragged his butt across town. He would have been at home, in bed, dreaming of\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy you want to see him?\u201d Her head cocked. Her thin lips pursed.</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cCan\u2019t say, ma\u2019am. This is a private matter.\u201d For now. But when the news got hold of this story...</p><p>\u201cHmmmph.\u201d</p><p>Pak\u2019s door opened down the hallway. A soft creak that had Antonio\u2019s shoulders stiffening.</p><p>\u201cAntonio, come on in.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head, casting one last glance at the woman. \u201cMa\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She moved her head in the faintest of regal acknowledgments.</p><p>He marched into Pak\u2019s office. The door closed behind him with that same creak.</p><p>Pak didn\u2019t sit. The guy just stared at Antonio with his dark, can\u2019t-read-me eyes. After about thirty seconds, Pak asked, \u201cWhere is my hunter?\u201d And Antonio knew they were on the same page.</p><p>He handed Pak the file. \u201cDon\u2019t know, but we damn well need to find out.\u201d He exhaled and fought to keep his voice flat, unemotional. Hard, that. Because he cared about Dee. More than he\u2019d ever cared for another woman. \u201cWe\u2019ve got trouble, Pak.\u201d</p><p>The guy that was Night Watch grunted as his eyes scanned the typed notes. \u201cHer fingerprints were on the murder weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Antonio said, even though he knew he shouldn\u2019t. He should at least pretend to be impartial, but\u2014this was Dee. \u201cSomeone could have lifted one of her weapons. The lady\u2019s got too damn many stakes. I\u2019ve been telling her that for years.\u201d But Dee always had the weapons. She hid them around her apartment for God\u2019s sake. Not that he really blamed her, with her past.</p><p>Pak\u2019s fingers whitened around the file. \u201cSomeone saw Dee attack the victim on the previous night?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and that shit was the part that was biting them all in the ass. \u201cI\u2019ve got two witnesses who told uniforms they saw Dee fighting with a woman matching the victim\u2019s description the night before. They were behind Onyx. The bartender there ID\u2019d Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was working a case.\u201d A fierce growl. \u201cYou know she doesn\u2019t hurt humans.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee\u2019s number one rule. Yeah, he knew it. That was why he was there. \u201cShe left the crime scene. We\u2019ve got hair samples that I\u2019m sure will match her.\u201d Had to match, everything else was so nice and neat. Like it had been gift wrapped for him. \u201cHer leaving...man, that doesn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>Pak glanced up at him. Those eyes were as dark as a demon\u2019s. Well, when a demon let the glamour drop anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure Dee left willingly.\u201d</p><p>What?</p> <p>With steady fingers, Pak placed the file on top of his perfectly arranged desk. \u201cThere\u2019s been no contact from Dee since she was last seen by Zane on the mission. Her car is still at the bar. She hasn\u2019t gone back to her house. She\u2019s made no attempt to contact the agency.\u201d</p><p>His stomach knotted. \u201cIs she alive?\u201d</p><p>One shoulder lifted. \u201cAt this point, I can\u2019t say for certain.\u201d A pause. \u201cI can say that Dee would never kill a human.\u201d</p><p>Not intentionally, anyway. \u201cWhat if things got away from her? What if there was an attack and she was fighting the vampires and the woman\u2014the woman attacked her, too?\u201d Made sense. He\u2019d sure been over all the different scenarios a dozen times. Trying to find a reason, an excuse. \u201cShe would have acted to defend herself. She would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have left on her own. If that\u2019s the way it went down, she would have stayed, waited for the cops.\u201d</p> <p>True. That was the way Dee worked. Or so he\u2019d thought. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for her,\u201d Antonio said, statement, not question.</p><p>A nod.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful with this, very careful.\u201d The wrong word, the wrong ear to hear it, and the town would explode. \u201cThe vic, she was the niece of Craig Durant\u2014the senator. He\u2019s already been calling the PD, talking to the DA.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThis case won\u2019t disappear easily.\u201d If at all.</p><p>No expression crossed Pak\u2019s face. \u201cThank you for coming to me with this information. I\u2019ll remember how helpful you were to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d He ran a hand over his face. His eyes were so grainy they hurt. \u201cWhen my ass gets tossed off the force for sharing confidential info, I just hope you have a job for me.\u201d He turned away, marching for the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Pak\u2019s soft voice. \u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>Pak waited for the cop to leave. A good guy, if too grounded in human ways.</p><p>He glanced at the manila file, then picked up his cell phone. Dee\u2019s number was one of the few automatically programmed in the phone because she was one of the few who mattered to him.</p><p>The text message was short. Simple.</p><p>Don\u2019t come in. Cops are hunting you.</p><p>Dee wouldn\u2019t go to jail. He\u2019d never let that happen.</p><p>Stick to the case. Kill the Born Bastard.</p><p>Before the Born succeeded in killing her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they kill me?\u201d Dee asked as the first rays of dawn began to appear on the horizon.</p> <p>Dawn. Her favorite time. She loved it when the light kicked night\u2019s ass across the sky.</p><p>Simon sat next to her. They were on his back porch. Small, compact. Two old rocking chairs that reminded her too much of her past.</p><p>At her question, he turned to her and his eyes seemed shuttered. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re still breathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t have asked the question if she knew. What was this, some kind of Freud crap? \u201cThey\u2019re setting me up, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her pocket vibrated. No, her phone. She\u2019d jerked on her jeans earlier, knotted Simon\u2019s shirt at her waist, and tried to feel normal. She\u2019d even found her phone, checked the battery, and thought about calling Pak.</p><p>She\u2019d also realized that if the vamps were truly setting her up, he might be ass-deep in cops. So she\u2019d waited.</p><p>Protocol for an agent in trouble was to wait, stay low for twenty-four hours, then seek contact.</p><p>Unless a superior from Night Watch contacted first.</p><p>She pulled out her phone. Punched the buttons until she saw her text, then her breath whistled out. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>Simon rose. \u201cTrouble?\u201d</p><p>Of course. Like good tidings followed her. Dee licked her lips and glanced up at him. \u201cCan I...\u201d Yeah, his gaze had definitely heated with the swipe of her tongue. Her heartbeat kicked up a notch. \u201cCan I stay with you? Just for a day or two?\u201d</p><p>His gaze was still on her mouth. \u201cI already said you could. Stay as long as you want.\u201d The words were a dark rumble.</p><p>Oh, they would so be getting into bed soon. Her head was better now. The swelling had eased. No more black spots danced before her eyes.</p><p>Simon had pushed for a visit to the hospital, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to risk that.</p><p>Vamps loved hanging out in hospitals. Talk about free and easy access to a blood supply.</p><p>If she\u2019d had double vision, if she\u2019d passed out, if she\u2019d vomited on Simon\u2019s sexy self, then, yeah, she would have found a doctor.</p><p>But it looked like she\u2019d pull through.</p><p>And that she\u2019d get to jump Simon soon.</p><p>\u201cYou keep saving me,\u201d she told him. Weird. Usually, she did the saving. The protecting. She wasn\u2019t quite sure how to act with him. But twice, twice, he\u2019d saved her butt from the flames.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do the same for me.\u201d Absolute certainty.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. That phrasing...it was off. Not, you\u2019d do the same, but you\u2019ll do. She forced a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I always pay my debts. In fact, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her arms. \u201cWe need to go inside.\u201d</p><p>His hold seemed too tight. \u201cUh, okay.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019m...sorry. I\u2019m tired. Hell of a night, you know?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, she did.</p><p>He eased his grip.</p><p>And Dee realized he looked tired. There was an edge of darkness under his eyes. The faint lines near his mouth had hardened.</p><p>Only fair, considering I probably look like warm hell.</p><p>She followed Simon inside. He bolted the back door, rolled his shoulders. Then he asked, voice distracted, \u201cYou want some food?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already had a shower, and sure, food sounded real good right then \u201cYes, why not?\u201d</p><p>His head shot up and his gaze zeroed in on the front door. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>An icy stillness settled over her. \u201cUh, Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompany.\u201d</p><p>Understanding hit hard. \u201cAnd here we are without a welcome mat out.\u201d Weapon. Simon had to\u2014</p><p>The windows exploded. Glass shattered, raining into the room as bullets ripped through the panes.</p><p>Shards hit her, cutting deep, and the rapid fire thunder of the guns echoed in her ears.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>Dee hit the floor just as the wooden front door burst apart. Bits of wood flew across the room, some biting into her flesh, some scraping the skin right off.</p><p>She crawled behind the couch. Pitiful cover, but it was better than nothing. Simon inched toward her. A long trickle of blood ran down the side of his face.</p><p>Dee sucked in a quick breath. Whoever was firing\u2014the bastards were sure doing a fine job of shooting up the place.</p><p>Where was her gun? Back in that blood-soaked room? Perfect time to be unarmed.</p><p>Simon grabbed her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to run for it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem like the best option, but then, sitting there and waiting for the assholes with guns to come and shoot her right in the face didn\u2019t seem like such a fine plan, either.</p><p>He pointed to the right, to a closed door. \u201cGarage,\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>Five feet away. Maybe six. But where were the shooters? Still outside? Or working their way in?</p><p>The faint groan of wood reached her ears. The porch was wooden. Old, faded wood. Fuck. Their attackers were getting too close.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d Simon heaved her up, moving at the same time to cover her back. Dee lunged for the door. How had they found them so quickly? How had\u2014</p><p>Bam. Bam.</p><p>One bullet cut right across her shoulder. Sonofabitch.</p><p>Using her left hand, she jerked open the door.</p><p>Simon hit a button on the wall even as he fell into her. They tumbled down three steps, hit the concrete, hard, and staggered up in a tangle of limbs and curses.</p><p>The Mustang waited. Black coat gleaming. Dee jumped into the passenger seat even as more bullets flew. Simon took the wheel.</p><p>The garage door was opening\u2014must have been a door control that he hit before\u2014</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He dug under the seat. \u201cGet those bastards off our backs.\u201d</p><p>A gun. A sweet, black Beretta that fit perfectly in her hands.</p><p>Two assholes in black appeared, heading down the steps into the garage. Ski masks covered their faces and their guns were up.</p><p>Simon jerked the gear shift into reverse. Dee hoped the garage door was open enough.</p><p>Bullets plowed into the windshield. One. Two.</p><p>Dee shot right back. The bullet hit the guy high in the shoulder. Not a flesh wound, a deep thud of bullet into muscle and bone. And so down went one jerk in black. The other dove for cover.</p><p>\u201cFuck! Behind us!\u201d</p><p>She spun around. Two more men, revealed now by the opening in the garage. Guns up. Since when did vamps hunt in the daytime? And wear ski masks?</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he growled and the car flew backward even faster.</p><p>Because he was aiming right for the men.</p><p>They jumped away at the last second, flying to the overgrown side of the road before the Mustang rammed them.</p><p>Simon shifted quickly. The Mustang snarled forward, horses pounding away.</p><p>Dee stared back at the men. Not giving chase. Not yet. Too busy picking their beaten butts up off the ground.</p><p>And the way Simon was driving...hell, no, they wouldn\u2019t be following them anytime soon.</p><p>The Mustang was easily pushing one hundred on the long, empty stretch of road.</p><p>Dee took a deep breath. The first she\u2019d had since she\u2019d risen from her cover in his den. Her shoulder burned like a bitch. Carefully, she unlocked her white knuckled grip and clicked on the gun\u2019s safety before she put in on the floor-board.</p><p>Wincing, she touched the wound. Okay. A lot of blood, but the bullet hadn\u2019t gone in the shoulder, just grazed her. No big damage. She\u2019d keep living.</p><p>Dee eyed Simon. \u201cAre you hit?\u201d</p><p>He growled at her. Seriously, growled.</p><p>Dee reached for him. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>His head jerked toward her. \u201cBack off.\u201d His teeth snapped together.</p><p>What? Her hand hovered in the air between them.</p><p>He shook his head even as his knuckles whitened around the wheel. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me now.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers fisted, then fell. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t think someone would come after me.\u201d Not so quickly. But, hell, she should have known. Someone could have easily followed her and Simon from that death pit.</p><p>And that someone had wrecked his house. Nearly killed him.</p><p>Yeah, because all that will put a smile on a guy\u2019s face. No wonder he was growling at her. She\u2019d just brought her usual death and danger into the guy\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask for this,\u201d she said, even as she glanced back to make sure they still weren\u2019t being followed. This time, she was alert enough to spot a tail. Being unconscious had really slowed down her game before. \u201cI-I\u2019ll contact Zane at the first safe stop. Get him to come for me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will.\u201d Guttural, but without the dark fury of before.</p><p>\u201cDammit, don\u2019t you see what being with me is doing to you?\u201d He had to see it. \u201cThose bastards were after me, Simon, they wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck what they wanted.\u201d He spared her a burning glance. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>He shifted in his seat, flinching a bit. \u201cAnd those weren\u2019t vampires, babe. Since when do vamps hunt in the daylight? And use guns on prey?\u201d</p><p>Hardly ever. Vamps didn\u2019t explode in the sunlight. That was just some BS myth Hollywood had invented. Good old Bram had been right when he\u2019d said that vampires could walk in the daylight. They were just weaker in the hours of light\u2014human weak. Dee had always figured Bram must\u2019ve had the inside track on the vamps.</p><p>As for using guns...why shoot your prey? For vampires, that was just a waste of good blood. Dee swallowed. \u201cWhy would vamps send humans after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. Sweat beaded Simon\u2019s upper brow.</p><p>\u201cThey know I\u2019m helping you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cNow they\u2019re trying to shut us both down. Not. Gonna. Happen.\u201d</p><p>The car jerked a bit. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAll...right.\u201d His fingers tightened around the steering wheel, but his eyes began to drift shut.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d Her heart slammed into her ribs. \u201cYou\u2019re hit, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Don\u2019t touch me now. Gruff and angry. Had to be man slang for I\u2019m hurting. \u201cStop the car, let me see what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Won\u2019t...let them...take you...\u201d</p><p>Uh, being all macho and protective was kind of sexy, especially since she was usually the ass-kicking one, but...</p><p>The car swerved off the road and headed straight for the line of twisted pines.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d Dee lunged for the wheel.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Simon stared at the grim-faced reflection in the broken gas station mirror.</p><p>He\u2019d fucked up. Gotten distracted by a sexy smile and curvy body.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been on guard, hadn\u2019t known the attackers were going to hit until it was too late.</p><p>Running\u2014his only option. He hated to run.</p><p>When the gun had fired, he\u2019d taken the hit. Taken it hard, right in the back. A human would have died. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Good thing he wasn\u2019t a human.</p><p>Dee had saved his ass when she taken the wheel. A head-on crash with trees. Never good.</p><p>But if he didn\u2019t do something, fast, Dee would be stalking her pretty little ass into the dingy restroom and demanding answers.</p> <p>She knew he was hurt, but she hadn\u2019t figured out how badly. Not yet.</p><p>If he had his way, not ever.</p><p>Simon jerked off his shirt, gritting his teeth as the pain knifed into his back. He spun around, craning his neck to see the wound in the mirror.</p><p>Dee waited just outside the door. She\u2019d tucked the gun into the back waistband of her jeans and the woman was standing guard.</p><p>But he doubted he had more than a few minutes time until she burst in to see what the hell had happened to him.</p> <p>The wound was open. Deep as hell. The bullet had lodged inside. No way could he get it out now. Eventually, he\u2019d find someone to dig it out. He just had to stop the blood loss now.</p><p>Because if he didn\u2019t stop bleeding, his ass would be in serious trouble.</p><p>Human attackers. That bastard Grim was playing smart. He hadn\u2019t sent his vamps because they would have been weak in the growing sun. But humans, probably puppets desperate for that immortal kiss, had done his dirty work.</p><p>And really screwed Simon over.</p><p>The door squeaked open. The scent hit him instantly. Cigarettes. Coffee.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, buddy!\u201d The door swung closed behind the guy. Balding, but young. Fit. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p> <p>Simon cocked his head. Shouldn\u2019t...</p><p>But there was no choice.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014do you need some help?\u201d Ah, a good Samaritan. Wouldn\u2019t those guys ever learn?</p><p>The Samaritan crept closer. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman outside. I can get her to call for help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>The Samaritan moved a few more precious inches closer.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Simon\u2019s hand whipped up and caught the guy right around the neck, closing off his airway. \u201cI can\u2019t let you call for her at all.\u201d</p> <p>The fear came then. In the widening of the man\u2019s eyes, in the fast drumming of his heart.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Simon said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d Dee\u2019s worried voice as she rapped on the door. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d The rusty door began to inch open.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d He yelled back. \u201cBe right there.\u201d</p><p>The door froze.</p><p>He stared into his prey\u2019s eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t kill you,\u201d he repeated again because the guy had really only wanted to help.</p><p>And that was exactly what he\u2019d do.</p><p>Three minutes later, Simon left the Samaritan sleeping in a bathroom stall. The cleaner stall. The one that didn\u2019t have feces floating in the toilet.</p><p>Dee still waited outside for him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to hit the road,\u201d he told her, trying to brush past her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re hurt. Let me help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cFlesh wound, just like yours.\u201d The scent of her blood hung in the air between them. Not as much of a temptation though, not now.</p><p>She braced her legs and cocked her chin. \u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p><p>This part, he\u2019d expected. Dee Daniels was one stubborn woman. He lifted his shirt. Twisted a bit, and showed her the long gash on his lower left side.</p><p>Not really a mark made by a bullet. One he\u2019d carved himself, using his claws.</p><p>He and Dee were sure going to have to talk soon. No way would he be able to keep hiding his true self from her.</p><p>Just wanted her to trust me first.</p><p>Trust. Such a hard thing to earn and so easy to lose. One word. One wrong move and she\u2019d turn away from him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got some bandages inside,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me get some, clean you up better.\u201d</p><p>A grim nod. If that was what she wanted. \u201cOnly if we do the same to you.\u201d They\u2019d have to hurry. Simon didn\u2019t want to risk any more unexpected company. Not until his strength had fully returned.</p><p>Dee turned away from him, but he reached out and snagged her arm.</p><p>A frown pulled her brows low when she glanced back at him. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Dee.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, you don\u2019t.\u201d That was the problem. \u201cI just want you to try. I\u2019m not one of the bad guys.\u201d Well, depending on your definition of bad. \u201cYou and I\u2014we want the same thing.\u201d</p><p>For the vampires who were hunting her to pay.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re after the Born,\u201d he told her, deciding to cut through the shit.</p><p>Dee\u2019s gaze darted around the deserted lot. \u201cNot here. We can\u2019t talk about this now\u2014\u201d</p><p>His back teeth clenched. \u201cThen let\u2019s hurry and get to safety, because we damn well have to talk.\u201d</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, confess.</p><p>Can\u2019t. Lose. Her.</p><p>Safety was her grandfather\u2019s cabin. A place he\u2019d built by hand long, long ago.</p><p>Her parents had sold the place when she\u2019d been a kid, but she\u2019d gotten lucky and been able to buy it back two years ago. The only tie to my family.</p><p>Winding dirt roads took them back to the two-bedroom shelter. The old wood gleamed in the bright sunlight.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut I installed a generator up here a few months ago. So, we\u2019ll have power, a roof over us, and time to figure out our next move.\u201d</p><p>He eyed the cabin. \u201cCan the vamps trace this place back to you?\u201d</p><p>Dee slammed her door and ignored the throb in her shoulder. \u201cNo, Night Watch made sure this place was buried for me.\u201d Because she\u2019d wanted a retreat, no, a haven.</p><p>Pak had made certain she was protected.</p><p>She found the key she\u2019d hidden so carefully on her last visit. The scent of pine teased her nose. Birds chirped from their nests high in the trees. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re both about to crash.\u201d And after the night they\u2019d had, the crash would be hard.</p><p>A flick of her hand and the key slid into the lock. The door opened soundlessly and the place was just as she\u2019d left it. Rocking chair, faded rug, the quilt she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cUh, are those stakes?\u201d</p><p>A smile lifted her lips as she stared at the glass gun cabinet. \u201cStakes...\u201d She crossed the room and spun the lock, turning the code automatically. \u201cKnives, guns. Everything we need to be ready for those bastards.\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted and opened the door. Then her fingers smoothed over the wood and tested the sharp points of the stakes. If she\u2019d been better armed before, they wouldn\u2019t have been on the run now. No way would she be caught unaware again. Out here, every sound was magnified. Human ears or not, she\u2019d hear the assholes coming long before they stepped onto her small porch.</p><p>\u201cYou hate them, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>At his soft question, Dee glanced back and found Simon watching her with hooded eyes.</p><p>No need to ask about the \u201cthem\u201d in question. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d She fired back. \u201cI know what happened, Simon. I know they killed your family. Slaughtered them, just like they did mine.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and he slammed the cabin door closed with his heel. \u201cI want those bastards. I want them to pay.\u201d He wrenched the lock into place and stalked toward her. \u201cI took some of them out already. Hunted them down...\u201d He reached behind her, grabbed one of the deadly stakes, \u201cand made them beg for death.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. Vengeance. How long had she wanted it?</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been hunting the ones who killed your family, Dee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince that night.\u201d A stark whisper. But she\u2019d been little more than a kid. She hadn\u2019t known where to hunt. Hadn\u2019t known how to track. By the time she\u2019d learned, they\u2019d been long gone from the city. \u201cI won\u2019t stop,\u201d she told him and her gaze darted to his hand. The stake was so sharp. So deadly. \u201cNot until I find the bastards.\u201d Because she\u2019d never forget their faces. Never.</p><p>He pulled back a bit and lifted the stake between them. \u201cHow many vampires have you killed? How many did you stake because you were trying to punish the ones who hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. What was this? She wasn\u2019t in the mood for some kind of therapy session. Not her thing. \u201cThe vamps I staked were killers. They got off on fear, on torture\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo vampires are all evil? They all have to be put out of their misery and given a one-way ticket to hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they?\u201d He\u2019d hunted, too. Just like me. She caught his hand and wrapped her fingers around the stake. \u201cI\u2019ve never met one who wasn\u2019t addicted to the power.\u201d That was the problem with vamps. As humans, maybe they\u2019d been okay, normal even, but when they woke as vampires, the power rush got to them. Human life lost its meaning.</p><p>Humans became nothing more than prey. No, food. And so many vamps enjoyed playing with their food.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned and pulled away from her, dropping the stake onto the floor. \u201cThe vamps who went after my family. Hell, yeah, they were freaks. Sick, twisted bastards who deserve hell, but I-I\u2019ve met vamps who aren\u2019t pure evil.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, waited.</p><p>Simon exhaled. \u201cYou need to open your mind, babe. You got a raw deal. We both did, but hating every vampire isn\u2019t gonna bring your folks back.\u201d A pause. \u201cKilling \u2019em all won\u2019t either. Trust me, I know.\u201d</p><p>Dammit, she knew that, too. But when she\u2019d first started hunting, the rage of revenge had been all she\u2019d had.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to live. When the remains of her parents, and, God, Sara, were hauled out the next day, she hadn\u2019t wanted to take another breath. She\u2019d fallen to her knees, wished for death.</p><p>Even thought about\u2014</p><p>Dee shook her head, hard. Her mother had died for her, no way would she have taken the easy way out. \u201cSometimes vengeance is the only thing that keeps you going.\u201d Especially once you found out the world wasn\u2019t the happy, picture perfect postcard all the TV ads promised you.</p><p>His hands fisted at his sides. \u201cThere\u2019s more to life than death, Dee.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled at that. Not a smile. Not yet. \u201cTell that to the vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling it to you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cWhy are you here? Why did you track me to that vampire hell? What do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I\u2019d just left you in the pool of blood? Left you with the body and with the cops on the way?\u201d His shoulders stiffened. \u201cWell, fuck, next time I\u2019ll know to just leave you the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>He spun away. She reached for him. Her fingers brushed over his shoulder.</p><p>Simon stilled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good at this emotional stuff,\u201d she told him, and felt rough, awkward. \u201cI know how to fight. I know how to kill. I don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d Love. No, no, they weren\u2019t talking about love.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>But he wanted more from her than she was used to giving. That need was there in his eyes, in his voice, in the rough demand of his questions. Simon wasn\u2019t going to settle for small offerings from her. He wasn\u2019t that kind of guy. She\u2019d have to open up to him if she wanted to keep him.</p><p>And she wanted to keep him with her. Maybe the best way to do that was to start by being civil. She could do that. She could drop her guard and try being normal.</p><p>So she let the armor fall and jerked up her big girl panties. \u201cThank you for pulling my butt out of that place.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cHard, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Uh, yeah.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to needing anyone else.\u201d</p><p>No, even at Night Watch, she usually worked on her own. She liked it that way. If you had a partner, you\u2019d start to care too much.</p><p>Then it would hurt like a bitch when the partner left...or died. Hunters at Night Watch didn\u2019t always have the longest life expectancy.</p><p>Slowly, he turned fully toward to her. His hand lifted, skimmed her cheek. \u201cI told you I knew about the Born coming to the city.\u201d His fingers were light, but strong. His thumb brushed over her lips. \u201cEvery vamp in the city is lit up because of him. Some are scared shitless. Some are thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Because some loved to see death and chaos.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll bring hell, Dee. Born Masters have too much power. He\u2019ll bring the vamps he\u2019s turned, all those...\u201d A gritted jaw, then, \u201cpuppets that he controls, and he\u2019ll burn down the city if he can.\u201d</p><p>Borns didn\u2019t come out and play much in the States. Not much at all. Because when they played, life ended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stop him,\u201d she breathed the words against his fingertip. She would stop him. Dee was certain of that. Maybe not too sure of the how part of the equation, but she\u2019d find a way to stop him. There wasn\u2019t any other choice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop him.\u201d A vow. Then he kissed her.</p><p>Just what she\u2019d been wanting.</p><p>Dee rose onto her toes, locked her arms around him, and held on tight.</p><p>So she sucked with emotions and nice words, but getting physical was definitely her strong suit.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth and she moaned, loving that strong glide. His lips were firm, hard, just what she wanted, and her nipples tightened as need burned through her.</p><p>The aches, the pains, the fears\u2014all faded away.</p><p>Lust. Hunger. Need\u2014all that remained.</p><p>His hands slid down her back, curled over her ass, and jerked her up high against him.</p><p>No mistaking the swollen ridge of his cock.</p><p>Good, I\u2019m not alone in this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth tore from hers. \u201cNot stopping this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better not.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed against her throat. Oh, Christ. Her sex creamed. Yeah, her panties were about to get really wet. Good thing she wouldn\u2019t be wearing them much longer. \u201cBed,\u201d she gasped. Not real big, but it would do. \u201cNext...room.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d had her naked, but she hadn\u2019t seen him. Not yet.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Flesh on flesh. Pleasure fighting the darkness. That was what she wanted.</p><p>Because the darkness always followed her, even in the daylight.</p><p>They fumbled their way to the bed. Kissing. Stroking. Hands sliding over flesh and making the lust spike.</p> <p>Not stopping. Not!</p><p>He hit the button for the lights. No windows in this room. You had to have the lights to see.</p><p>She definitely wanted to see everything.</p><p>Dee shoved him onto the mattress and laughed when his eyes widened.</p><p>Then she stripped. Nothing fancy, because she wasn\u2019t the strip tease type. Her borrowed shirt hit the floor. No bra. Not like she really needed one.</p><p>She kicked off her shoes. Pushed down her jeans\u2014</p> <p>\u201cDamn, Dee.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cI could eat you.\u201d</p><p>No, this was her turn. Her panties fell to the floor.</p><p>His nostrils widened, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got too many clothes on,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He jerked off his shirt.</p><p>\u201cNice start.\u201d Her gaze darted to his jeans. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to see more.\u201d</p><p>He held out his hand. She so didn\u2019t need a second invitation. Dee climbed onto the bed. Onto him. Straddled him. Her fingers trailed down his chest. Tight, strong muscles. A few scars, faint white lines of raised flesh.</p><p>Dee hesitated at the sight, all too aware of the marks on her own body. She wasn\u2019t perfect, not by a long shot. Especially not after that last tangle with the wolf.</p> <p>But to her, Simon was perfect. The marks just meant he was a fighter. A survivor.</p><p>Like me.</p><p>As she stared at that expanse of muscled flesh, Dee realized she\u2019d never seen a man look so good or feel so right. She bent and licked one taut brown nipple.</p><p>His breath hissed out.</p><p>He liked that. Good. She used her teeth on him. A little nip. Nothing too hard, she didn\u2019t want to\u2014</p><p>Bite.</p><p>The whisper, almost a command, slipped through her mind and Dee jerked back.</p><p>Simon stared at her, eyes so intense. She shook her head.</p><p>His fingers rose, cradled her breasts. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Lust could make men so blind.</p><p>Dee managed to unsnap his jeans. Being careful, though, because she didn\u2019t want to jar the bandage she\u2019d placed on his\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go easy with me, babe.\u201d He pushed up. \u201cTrust me, I can take anything you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d see about that. His zipper came down with a hiss. No underwear. Her kind of man.</p><p>His cock was long and thick, bulging up toward her. The tip was dark, round, and smooth to the touch. She eased back, sliding her bare legs down his jean-clad thighs.</p><p>\u201cDee\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her turn.</p><p>Her mouth closed over his cock. Her tongue licked the broad head, tasted the saltiness of his flesh.</p><p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>She would. Eventually.</p><p>Dee took his length into her mouth. Looked up at him and saw his narrowed eyes, his clenched jaw, and the naked need on his face.</p><p>Just the way she wanted him.</p><p>Her tongue and lips teased. Took. Her cheeks hollowed as she worked his length.</p><p>She liked his taste. Liked the feel of his flesh and the jerks of his breath and\u2014</p><p>His hand curled under her chin. \u201cCan\u2019t...not much longer...\u201d</p><p>One more lick, to prove that she\u2019d do what she wanted. Then, one more because what she wanted was him.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>A caress with her lips, then she freed his flesh. But she still tasted him on her tongue. \u201cWhy should you get all the fun?\u201d</p><p>In a flash, he flew forward, and Dee found herself flat on her back, near the edge of the bed. His mouth was on her breast. Sucking, licking, tasting, and taking.</p><p>Okay, so this was...damn...fun.</p><p>His fingers pushed between her thighs. Stroked her sex, thumbed her clit.</p><p>\u201cSo wet,\u201d he muttered, sending that lust-filled stare her way. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna feel fantastic.\u201d</p><p>So would he. Her teeth clenched and her heels dug into the bed. A few more strokes and she\u2019d be coming. Just a few more.</p><p>A strong finger drove into her.</p><p>Dee bit her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He glared down at her. \u201cNot this time. I want to hear every sound you make. Every sound.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dried. No holding back. She always held back. Pushed her partner, but kept her own control as she\u2014</p><p>\u201cI want everything.\u201d Two fingers. \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna have everything.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back. So she\u2019d come this way first, fine with her. The second time, he could be inside, he could\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, babe.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze snapped to him.</p><p>\u201cNot without me.\u201d</p><p>He shoved a hand into the back pocket of his jeans. Pulled out a small foil packet.</p><p>She loved a man who was prepared.</p><p>Of course, she\u2019d also picked up some condoms at that rundown gas station. Just in case.</p><p>Because she liked to be prepared, too.</p><p>He ripped the foil with his teeth. Rolled the protection down his thick length.</p><p>Then he pushed her thighs apart. Wider. He stared at her flesh. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>Simon drove into her, thrusting his cock balls deep into her sex.</p><p>She let her moan out, full and loud, because he felt great. And because she wouldn\u2019t hold back, not with him. Her nails dug into his arms.</p><p>He withdrew. Thrust deep. Again. Again.</p><p>\u201cHarder.\u201d The coil within her tightened. Release\u2014so close. So close.</p><p>Sweat slickened their bodies. Her hips rose to meet the plunge of his body. Faster. Stronger.</p><p>He stretched her, drove deep and had her shuddering for more.</p><p>Pleasure, that sweet release, was temptingly near.</p><p>Her legs curled around him. He pressed a hard kiss against her lips. His tongue thrust into her mouth.</p><p>Her sex quivered around him\u2014that full, hard cock, driving so deep.</p><p>His head lifted. His teeth were clenched. Eyes glittering.</p><p>His neck was close to her. The strong curve of his shoulder. Close enough to\u2014</p><p>Bite.</p><p>Her teeth snapped together. What the hell? Not during sex, she\u2019d never wanted to\u2014</p><p>His cock eased back, almost to the entrance of her straining sex.</p><p>She flattened her hands against his chest. Push away. Fight the\u2014</p><p>His hot flesh slammed into her.</p><p>She came, screaming, \u201cSimon!\u201d Her muscles clenched as the white-hot wave crested. Her sex rippled around him, contracting as the pleasure blasted her.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he growled and his fingers dug into her hips. He lifted her up, arching her toward him and thrusting fast and deep. \u201cSo much better.\u201d</p><p>He bent toward her, pressing his lips against her neck. Tasting and licking her flesh. The muscles in his arms bunched. So much power there, so much strength.</p><p>He came on a long shudder, pumping out his release.</p><p>Her sex throbbed around him, the aftershocks of pleasure reverberating through her core.</p><p>Dee sucked in a breath. Then another one. She licked desert-dry lips.</p><p>His tongue skated over her neck.</p><p>She shivered. Nice.</p><p>His hold tightened around her as the sound of her drumming heartbeat filled her ears.</p><p>Oh, yeah, she\u2019d known it would be that good. When a guy oozed sex like Simon, a good time was pretty much guaranteed.</p><p>Her hands skimmed down his back, and Dee realized that his muscles were locked tight. \u201cSimon?\u201d He\u2019d come, she knew he had.</p><p>His lips pressed against her neck once more. A bit harder this time, then his head rose. His eyes were such a turbulent gray. Stormy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to hurt you,\u201d he told her, voice gruff.</p><p>Her brow pulled low. \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d Simple enough.</p><p>A finger rose and traced her cheek. \u201cYou cried when you came.\u201d</p><p>Dee blinked. \u201cI\u2014\u201d Okay, now she didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cOne tear drop. Just one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t usually\u2014\u201d Hell, she never cried. Not in years, anyway.</p><p>His lips pressed against hers. A soft, gentle touch after the wildness of the lust. His cock was still lodged in her, and swelling.</p><p>His mouth lifted, just an inch. \u201cYou can trust me,\u201d he breathed the words.</p><p>She\u2019d already trusted him with her body. What more did he want?</p><p>But she could read the answer in his eyes. Everything.</p><p>And suddenly, even the heat of his body couldn\u2019t warm her. Because everything\u2014she\u2019d never had that to give a man.</p><p>They slept. Finally. Dee drifted away in Simon\u2019s arms. The sleep was deep, heavy, and filled with the soft whispers that haunted so many of her dreams.</p><p>Go, baby, go! Get out. Hurry! Her mother. Always warning her.</p><p>Dee\u2014Dee, why didn\u2019t you help me? Sara. Always blaming her.</p><p>So many voices. So many.</p><p>Why, bitch, why\u2019d you come after me? The vampires. Their last words haunted her.</p><p>Fucking whore. More of my kind will come. More. You can\u2019t stop us. Twisted murmurs that followed her into the darkness.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t escape the voices. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cDee. Dee. Wake up.\u201d Strong hands shook her.</p><p>Her eyelids flew open. Simon stared down at her, his hair tousled, his face grim. \u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>A surge of adrenaline had her out of the bed and dressed in moments. They ran to the outer room. Dee grabbed two stakes and a gun.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t reach for a weapon. Funny, she\u2019d actually never seen him armed.</p><p>She killed the lights and inched toward the window. A car door slammed outside. Gravel crunched beneath someone\u2019s feet. Carefully, she pushed the curtain back, just a tiny crack of space.</p><p>Darkness without, to match the blackness within.</p><p>Night had fallen.</p><p>The vampires would be at full strength again.</p><p>But since when did vamps come right up to your front door when they wanted to attack?</p><p>Her eyes adjusted almost instantly to the dark and she motioned with her hand, pointing for Simon to take up a position on the left hand side of the door. The right side would be hers.</p><p>As she watched, the door knob began to turn. What? The bastard had picked the lock? Skilled SOB.</p><p>Not that lock-picking talents would save his ass.</p><p>Dee waited in the darkness. Silent. Steady.</p><p>The door swung open. The scum walked inside.</p><p>Dee attacked.</p><p>She moved fast and came in hard. She caught the guy with a hard punch in the gut, then slung him back and rammed him into the wall.</p><p>Simon slammed the door closed. Good. Who knew how many of the bastards were out there? Better to separate them and make them weaker.</p><p>\u201cStart talking,\u201d Dee ordered, pulling out her stake. \u201cHow many of your asshole friends are out there waiting for their turn to jump me?\u201d</p><p>The guy moved, shifting from a hunched shadow to the tall, strong form of a man. Dee stared at him, frowning as\u2014</p><p>\u201cDammit, Dee! Why the hell do you always have to punch first?\u201d</p><p>She knew that voice. \u201cSimon, hit the lights.\u201d</p><p>A bright flood of light lit up the room, and Dee stared at an all too familiar face. \u201cTony? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He pressed a hand to his stomach. Groaned, then said, \u201cI\u2019m here to arrest you for murder.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are.\u201d Simon lunged forward. No one would be taking Dee away from him. No one.</p><p>And sure as shit not the bastard who\u2019d been her lover.</p><p>Captain Antonio Young lifted his chin and glared at him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d His hand still rubbed his wounded stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe guy who\u2019s been watching her ass.\u201d Simon let his lips curve into a feral smile. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no damn way you\u2019ll be taking Dee out of here.\u201d But if the cop wanted to try...</p><p>Come and get some.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d Dee caught his hand. The cop\u2019s eyes dropped at the move, narrowed. Oh, didn\u2019t like that, huh? Too bad.</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cAre you...are you okay, Tony?\u201d</p><p>He instantly dropped the hand he\u2019d been pressing against his stomach. \u201cFine.\u201d Bit off. \u201cI thought you were up here alone.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that\u2019s why Lancelot had come bounding to the cabin.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was even out here?\u201d</p><p>Dark eyes flickered over her face. Too much emotion there. \u201cI know you pretty well, Dee. I knew where you\u2019d go if you wanted sanctuary.\u201d He held up a key. \u201cAnd I stayed here with you before, remember?\u201d</p><p>The hell he had. Simon\u2019s vision bled to red. So what\u2014Dee had a habit of bringing lovers here?</p><p>Not any longer she didn\u2019t and if that pretty boy kept looking at her with his puppy dog eyes, he\u2019d plant a fist in the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>Dee glanced at Simon, then looked away quickly. \u201cI remember. That was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Good to know, and Simon didn\u2019t want to hear any more about that. \u201cDee didn\u2019t kill the woman.\u201d</p><p>The cop blinked, then looked over at Dee\u2019s left hand. Her fingers were clenched around a wooden stake. \u201cEvidence says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a setup,\u201d Simon gritted. \u201cThe vamps want to take her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Dee jerked away from him and marched toward the weapons cabinet. Some women collected figurines, Dee\u2014</p><p>Instruments of death.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would they go to all that trouble?\u201d The cop, Tony, shook his head. \u201cVamps don\u2019t work like that. They kill, drain a vic dry, and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd some of \u2019em are sick freaks who get off on playing with their prey.\u201d Not all, though. Not all were like that. Dee would learn that truth. Eventually. \u201cThey want to break Dee. Not just kill her. By setting her up, they rip her out of her nice, safe world.\u201d Not that Dee was much for safety. \u201cThey tear her away from her friends, isolate her\u2014\u201d He broke off, shaking his head. No, he couldn\u2019t say any more.</p><p>\u201cI was fighting a pack of vamps behind Onyx.\u201d Dee\u2019s voice was flat. She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cMy head hit the pavement, and the next thing I knew, I was in some stinking, dark room. Blood was all around me and your victim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa Durant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas dead.\u201d Her shoulders tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anything that happened in between that alley and that room. I just remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there,\u201d Simon spoke, holding the cop\u2019s gaze and daring him for a challenge. \u201cI saw the vamps kill the woman. They left Dee in her blood. I saw it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Tony stepped forward. \u201cI don\u2019t buy that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my story.\u201d A brief pause. \u201cThe one I\u2019ll tell everyone I see if you so much as even think about hauling Dee away from here.\u201d Not going to happen. His temples throbbed in a sickening, painful rhythm.</p><p>No one could threaten Dee. She was too important.</p> <p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re just gonna fucking out the vampires?\u201d Disgust had Tony\u2019s lips tightening.</p><p>\u201cThey outed themselves.\u201d Maybe it was time for the whole world to stop pretending. Feeding rooms were cropping up in most cities\u2014and dumb humans were stumbling inside, some quickly getting addicted to vamp bites. Some never making it back out. Lucky for the vamps, they\u2019d perfected the body ditch over the years.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a Born Master coming to town,\u201d Dee said and she tilted her head. Simon\u2019s eyes narrowed. Yeah, that was his mark on her neck and he knew the cop saw it. No blood drawn, no bite since Dee didn\u2019t like that. But a sweet suck had done the trick. \u201cI\u2019m the best vampire hunter at Night Watch. You take me out of this game, and there\u2019s no telling what hell will come to the city.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s eyes widened. Ah, so the dick hadn\u2019t ever come across a Born? Then he didn\u2019t know what hell looked like. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill Borns the way you can most vampires.\u201d No, they were so much harder to slay. He\u2019d once heard of a Born who\u2019d survived a stake to the heart and a partial beheading.</p><p>Their bodies were tougher. They healed ten times faster than the Taken. When you were changed into a vampire, you brought some of your human weaknesses with you.</p><p>But when you were Born a vampire...</p> <p>There was no weakness for you. Not once the powers kicked in and the bloodlust began.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Tony demanded again.</p><p>\u201cEase up, Tony. Simon\u2019s not the bad guy here.\u201d She unfolded her arms. \u201cHe knows what I\u2019m up against. He can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tony flinched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a cop. You protect innocents.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut your job isn\u2019t to kill vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days it is,\u201d he fired back.</p> <p>Simon\u2019s brows shot up. So the cop had some bite, did he?</p><p>\u201cI know things look bad right now,\u201d Dee said.</p><p>\u201cYou ran, Dee. Innocent people don\u2019t run.\u201d</p><p>Okay, his fault. Simon rolled his shoulders. \u201cI didn\u2019t give Dee much choice. When I hauled her out of that pit, she was barely conscious. Sirens were wailing\u2014I just couldn\u2019t risk her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Nothing more to say on that. \u201cThe woman on the floor was dead. Dee wasn\u2019t. My priority was getting her to safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, cause getting in her pants had nothing to do with it, right?\u201d</p><p>Fuck him. Simon attacked. In a second\u2019s time, he had the cop pinned to the wall as his fist twisted the front of Tony\u2019s shirt. \u201cDon\u2019t...talk about Dee like that.\u201d</p><p>A tap on the back of his shoulder. \u201cEase up. Tony just turns into an asshole when he\u2019s worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to watch that tendency. It\u2019ll get him into trouble soon.\u201d He held the cop\u2019s stare. \u201cReal soon.\u201d He unknotted his fingers.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Dee, where\u2019d you find him?\u201d Tony muttered, straightening his shirt.</p><p>\u201cIn an alley, one littered with bullets.\u201d She pushed in between the two of them. \u201cSame place I found you a few years back.\u201d</p><p>A grunt, then his lips started to curl, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cTony, we were attacked right before dawn. Some guys in ski masks found us at Simon\u2019s house. They shot up the place.\u201d Her hand lifted to her shoulder. To the wound Simon had all but forgotten when he\u2019d had her in that bed. \u201cWe were lucky to get out alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s where we are.\u201d She swallowed and Simon heard the soft click. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be damned if I stay here. I\u2019m not going to keep hiding out, waiting for the vamps to strike. We needed to rest. We needed to recover\u2014done that.\u201d</p><p>Simon knew where this was going. Knew, and didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s time to hunt these bastards,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I really don\u2019t like it when jerkoffs try to kill me, especially when I\u2019m already down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I like it much, either,\u201d Simon added.</p><p>Tony\u2019s gaze snapped to him, then back to Dee. \u201cYou really think you\u2019ll be able to find the vamps?\u201d</p><p>A little shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d Her chin was up. The woman was cute when she was promising death. \u201cI was weak before, I\u2019m not now.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, um, humans didn\u2019t recover that fast from concussions and gunshots. Maybe she was feeling all good and vampire-pumped-for-killing, but the woman still wasn\u2019t 100 percent.</p><p>Neither was he.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cBrass is leaning on me like a tree about to fall.\u201d Tony blew out a hard breath. \u201cIt\u2019s those witnesses who say they saw you fighting with the vic at Onyx. They\u2019re nailing your coffin shut.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to Simon. \u201cThat part\u2019s right, Tony. Lisa...met me behind the bar. She was working for the vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lure?\u201d the cop asked.</p><p>\u201cMore a messenger,\u201d Simon said. \u201cYou know, the cheery kind that comes and says You\u2019re going to die. Beg for death. Blah. Blah.\u201d</p><p>Tony blinked.</p><p>Dee gave a little shrug. \u201cShe pissed me off. I lost my temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d Lines of worry tightened the cop\u2019s face. \u201cToo many folks know about that temper of yours. It\u2019s not a leap to think you met up with the woman again, and got angry one more time, so angry you didn\u2019t stop yourself when the stake came out. After all, it\u2019s easy to kill, isn\u2019t it? So easy.\u201d</p><p>The guy sounded like he was speaking from experience. As if he could ever compare. \u201cGive us time and we\u2019ll prove Dee\u2019s innocent.\u201d The words snapped out. Not what he\u2019d been planning. Simon rubbed his temples. The throbbing was getting worse. The sleep hadn\u2019t been enough for him. To recover fully, he\u2019d need so much more.</p><p>\u201cThe DA knows the score about this town,\u201d Dee told them. \u201cPak told me, after Erin Jerome\u2019s case...the DA knows.\u201d</p><p>Erin Jerome. Simon knew the name. Erin was the assistant district attorney. She was also involved with one of the Night Watch hunters, Jude, the shifter.</p><p>\u201cFigured the bastard knew more than he let on.\u201d Tony ran a hand through his hair. \u201cToo many cases that seemed to disappear before court date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one has to disappear, too.\u201d Dee\u2019s body vibrated with tension. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a witness. I\u2019ll bring proof that I\u2019m innocent, and I want Clark to make this thing vanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the vamps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make them vanish.\u201d</p><p>Big promise. Real tough to keep.</p><p>Tony stared at her. Too deep and way too long.</p><p>\u201cTony, give me this time. You know me.\u201d</p><p>Too well it seemed.</p><p>A grim nod. \u201cForty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I can do. I\u2019m not the only one on this case and I won\u2019t be able to hold the others back longer than that.\u201d A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cForty-eight hours\u2014and you bring me a vamp who\u2019ll convince Clark you\u2019re clear or else I\u2019ll have to lock you up.\u201d</p><p>She whistled. \u201cNot giving me much time to work, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you all that I can.\u201d He stepped toward her, cupped her cheek with his palm, and very nearly lost a hand. \u201cThe last thing I want is to have to take you in, but I might not have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Simon gave him a long, level look. \u201cThere\u2019s always a choice.\u201d Always. Might not be the right choice, and that was the problem.</p><p>Tony dropped his hand. \u201cGuess you\u2019re gonna be her backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better take care of her or I\u2019ll be coming to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Doubtful.</p><p>The cop headed for the door. \u201cBetter hurry out of here,\u201d he tossed back, \u201cthe way I figure it, two squad cars will be pulling up in about thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Dick.</p><p>\u201cYou sent the uniforms after me?\u201d A whistle. \u201cDamn, man, you really did come to toss me in jail.\u201d</p><p>The dick in question glanced back at Dee. \u201cNo.\u201d A hint of sadness there. Regret. \u201cI came to give you a chance, one I knew the others wouldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s why the uniforms won\u2019t be arriving until you\u2019re gone.\u201d A flash of white teeth. \u201cSo move that sweet ass, Dee. Get out there and find those vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where the hell are we headed?\u201d Simon asked, and tightened his fingers around the leather steering wheel. They\u2019d been staying to the back roads, trying to fly under the radar as they headed back to the city, and the silence\u2014thick, heavy\u2014was getting on his last nerve.</p><p>Was Dee having regrets? Maybe seeing the old boyfriend had made her hesitate. That jerk had the worst timing.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any feeding rooms in Baton Rouge.\u201d</p><p>Feeding rooms. His back teeth clenched. The places set up to look like bars but, deep inside, they were just all-you-can-eat buffets for vampires. Folks went inside and some never came back out. Others got addicted. They became controlled by the vamps, and they would do anything to go back into the rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought those places were in damn near every city now.\u201d Some said they were safe houses for vampires. And those some just really knew how to bullshit.</p><p>Not a safe house. More like a slaughterhouse.</p><p>Even though humans were the preferred prey in the feeding rooms, the vamps never had to worry about the humans turning on them and shouting to the authorities about the new night club that served up blood. After all, one bite, and a vampire could link with a human\u2019s mind.</p><p>A link meant control. You didn\u2019t turn on those who controlled you.</p><p>For the humans, it was all too easy to get hooked on the thrill of the bite.</p><p>If the vamp wanted the victim to feel pain, the bite could hurt more than a knife wound or gunshot.</p><p>The bite could also feel better than sex.</p><p>It was all up to the vampire. Pleasure or pain.</p><p>Simon slanted a quick glance at Dee\u2019s still figure.</p><p>Almost better than sex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a point of shutting down any feeding room that tries to spring up.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yeah, he bet she had. \u201cSo where do we start then?\u201d</p><p>He felt her eyes. Didn\u2019t have to look, just knew those chocolate eyes were on him. \u201cI thought you had vamp contacts in this town.\u201d</p><p>Careful now. \u201cAh, the vamps I know scattered when word came down about the Born Master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? If they weren\u2019t linked to him, there\u2019d be no need to flee.\u201d</p><p>The link. The screwed family tree that connected vampires. A Born Master took a victim, and formed a psychic connection with his prey. But if the Master turned that prey into the Taken, and the new vampire took another victim, the Born Master\u2019s connection would trickle into the new prey, and keep trickling down through every blood exchange. Like freaking tentacles, reaching out for minds and spirits.</p><p>A Born Master wasn\u2019t just stronger physically than other vampires. He was like a psychic black hole, sucking in all the prey he could find.</p><p>And controlling them.</p><p>A Born Master didn\u2019t just pick up the thoughts of those in his link. He could whisper his thoughts to them. Compel them.</p><p>Rule them. His army of helpless minions. Good, bad, everything in between. All his for the taking and for the killing.</p><p>The Taken were never truly free. Not until the Born Master who\u2019d started their blood lineage was dead.</p><p>Never an easy feat.</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, if your contacts are out, then I guess we\u2019ll just have to do it the old-fashioned way.\u201d</p><p>Simon knew he was not going to like this. \u201cAnd that would be?\u201d He braked at a Stop sign, one that had been spray painted a garish yellow. They\u2019d reached the edge of the city. The part where the good folks never visited. Too many criminals. Too much darkness.</p><p>Too much evil.</p><p>Simon glanced at Dee. Yep, her eyes were on him. \u201cWe find the perfect prey,\u201d she said simply. \u201cThen wait for the vamps to take the bait. When they come up for a bite, we nail their asses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting plan.\u201d His fingertips pounded a fast, hard beat on the steering wheel. \u201cYou really think it\u2019s going to work?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One shoulder lifted. \u201cFigure I\u2019ve got a fifty-fifty shot with it. If it doesn\u2019t, then I have a witch who owes me a favor. Maybe I can get a summoning spell.\u201d</p><p>A summoning spell? Now she was talking spooky shit. You had to be damn careful when you used dark magic. You never knew what in the hell would hitch a ride on that darkness and come traveling straight to you.</p><p>As he watched her, thinking about his own darkness, a shiver worked over Dee\u2019s body. \u201cUh, Dee? You okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Just cold. Can we turn the heater up?\u201d</p><p>Because summers in Baton Rouge were cold. Right. But he still flicked on the heater. Didn\u2019t matter to him. \u201cMaybe we should wait.\u201d He sure wasn\u2019t feeling up to kicking major vampire ass right then. Perhaps after a meal or two.</p><p>\u201cNo time.\u201d She criss-crossed her arms and rubbed her flesh. She had on a light blouse, one of her shirts she\u2019d found at the cabin. One that gave him a nice glimpse of her breasts. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost a few hours. We hunt, now and\u2014there.\u201d</p><p>He followed her suddenly sharp gaze. A man had stepped out of the shadows. The faint red glow of his cigarette lit the night. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn informer.\u201d She tilted her head and his stare snapped back to her and to that beautiful bared throat.</p> <p>Focus.</p><p>But the drumming was back in his temples. Harder, more painful than before.</p><p>\u201cIan knows this city. He\u2019ll be able to tell me the latest whispers on the vamps.\u201d</p><p>Control. Simon sucked in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI knew he\u2019d be here.\u201d She unhooked her belt.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019d you know that?\u201d He gritted, turning off the engine.</p> <p>Dee pointed toward the hollowed-out husk of a building on the left. \u201cBecause his brother died in that fire a year ago. He comes here every Friday. He comes to remember.\u201d</p><p>Simon narrowed his eyes and looked once more at that glowing cigarette. \u201cUh, yeah, how\u2019d that fire start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She pushed open the door, then hesitated. \u201cIan doesn\u2019t take too well to others. Just stay here, okay? I\u2019ll only be a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Staying in the fucking car. Was that what he\u2019d been reduced to?</p><p>But the woman was gone. Running across the street. Disappearing in and out of the shadows.</p><p>Staying in the fucking car. No. Not his style.</p><p>He was there to watch her back. Not to be left behind.</p><p>He opened his door soundlessly, then, moving slower than her, but keeping to the same shadows, he began to follow her.</p> <p>The smoke from the cigarette drifted to her nostrils. Dee stepped into the faint streetlight, deliberately placing herself in Ian\u2019s path. With Ian, you had to identify yourself fast\u2014or he\u2019d attack.</p><p>And sometimes, he attacked no matter what.</p><p>\u201cIan.\u201d She made her voice quiet but calm. \u201cIan, I need your help.\u201d</p><p>He was half-hidden by the darkness. The cigarette dangled from his fingertips. He wasn\u2019t smoking. Hadn\u2019t smoked in a year.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d The tip of the cigarette bobbed and ash drifted into the night. \u201cThat you?\u201d</p><p>Okay, he wasn\u2019t coming at her with fists yet. A good sign. She\u2019d told Simon to stay back because one look at him, and she knew Ian would have broken.</p><p>The guy just hadn\u2019t been the same since the fire. Not that she blamed him. No, not at all. \u201cYeah, Ian, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his stance a bit, bringing the right side of his face more into the light. A strong, hard face. \u201cHeard you killed a human, Dee.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBad move that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans are supposed to stick together. All those paranormal assholes out there want us gone. We have to fight \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>More ash drifted away.</p><p>\u201cI want to fight them tonight, Ian.\u201d She had to keep Ian focused. So hard. The man already had one foot in the grave. Maybe that was how he did it because she sure as hell wasn\u2019t sure how he found out all his information about the Other.</p><p>Ian was psychic. She\u2019d always known that. But since the fire, it was like he was some kind of open channel to the darkness in the city.</p><p>He took a step forward, and the light drifted across him, across the ruined, twisted, and reddened flesh on the left side of his face.</p><p>Dee kept her eyes on his. \u201cHelp me, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vampires are coming for you, Sandra Dee.\u201d His voice had hollowed and taken on that empty tone that came with his visions. \u201cInching ever closer. Closer than you know...\u201d</p><p>Simon caught the scent in the air. Blood. Fresh blood. He jerked to a halt, his nostrils flaring. Dee stood about ten feet away from him, whispering to the bastard in the shadows.</p><p>But the blood scent was coming from the left. Drifting from the mouth of that alley. Garbage and decay\u2014and sweet human blood.</p><p>He hesitated, his gaze on that yawning opening.</p><p>\u201cHelp...\u201d The faintest of whispers.</p><p>Simon closed his eyes. An attack. Right there, so close.</p><p>Close enough for the blood to tempt him.</p><p>Dee had been right. This was the perfect place to hunt. But not for them.</p><p>These hunting grounds belonged to the vampires.</p><p>\u201cHelp...m\u2014\u201d A choked gurgle. A death cry.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Simon ran for the alley\u2019s entrance.</p><p>Dee\u2019s head snapped up at the thunder of footsteps. Simon. She spun around and saw him run into an alley. Where the hell was he going?</p><p>Ian grabbed her hand, the hard flesh of his burnt fingers and palm scraping against her. \u201cComing from the inside, Sandra Dee. The thing you fear will take you tonight.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, the odd chill she\u2019d felt in the car was back. \u201cYou telling me I\u2019m going to die, Ian?\u201d</p><p>His muddy gaze drifted back to the burnt house. \u201cSaw the fire, you know. Dreamed it.\u201d</p><p>Ian always had his dreams. Dreams that had sent him to the edge of sanity and beyond. \u201cI know about your dreams.\u201d Everyone knew, human and supernatural.</p><p>\u201cTold Brian it wasn\u2019t safe. Told him to leave.\u201d</p><p>Brian. Ian\u2019s twin. Addicted to crack and eaten away by cancer.</p><p>\u201cBut then I felt the fire start, and I had to go to him. I knew\u2014I knew he hadn\u2019t left.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d walked into the flames for his brother. Faced death.</p><p>And still Brian had been taken by the flames.</p><p>But Ian hadn\u2019t died. Not fully.</p><p>\u201cI saw Death that night.\u201d He turned away, so that only the perfect side of his face remained. \u201cI see him now. He\u2019s with you. Standing so close.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the tip she\u2019d wanted.</p><p>His lips rose in a humorless curl. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sandra Dee. You won\u2019t be alone. I\u2019ll be right there with you. Every minute.\u201d</p><p>She rocked back. Shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not dying tonight.\u201d</p><p>But that lop-sided smile didn\u2019t fade. \u201cWe both are,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI dreamed about us last night. Sweet, beautiful dreams full of blood and screams.\u201d</p><p>A scream pierced the thick silence of the night, and Dee ran for the alley, Simon\u2019s name on her lips.</p><p>I\u2019m not dying tonight.</p><p>Simon grabbed the vamp and threw him against the wall. The scent of blood flooded his nostrils and the hunger he\u2019d tried so hard to fight bubbled to the surface.</p><p>Weak. Just need to feed once more.</p><p>No! Dee was too close.</p><p>He spared the screaming woman a glance. Blood trickled down her throat. \u201cGet the hell out of here,\u201d he snarled. If the woman had sense, she would already be running.</p><p>He opened his mouth and bared his own fangs. \u201cGet. Out.\u201d</p><p>But at the sight, the redhead just screamed louder.</p><p>And another vampire jumped him.</p><p>Dee ran fast, her heart slamming into her ribs. She caught sight of Simon, fighting with another man, both of them spinning and thrashing on the ground as\u2014</p><p>Simon\u2019s attacker opened his mouth and sank his fangs into Simon\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The scream burst from her.</p><p>Simon threw the vampire off him, sending the guy hurtling a good ten feet into the air. What\u2014how in hell had he done that?</p><p>Some woman was screaming in a continuous howl, the sound piercing Dee\u2019s ears as the chick huddled near a Dumpster.</p><p>The vamp rose. \u201cYou think you can attack me? Chase, I\u2019ll fucking cut your heart out, you don\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon ran straight for him. Tackled the bastard. \u201cYou won\u2019t do a damn thing to me!\u201d</p><p>And then he sank his teeth into the vampire\u2019s throat.</p><p>Sank his fangs into the vampire\u2019s throat.</p><p>Dee froze, every muscle in her body hardening. No, please, Christ, no, this couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>The screaming snapped off, the silence rough and jolting. Dee wrenched out her stake. Realized her palms were soaked with sweat when she nearly lost her weapon. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>He dropped the vampire and whirled toward her. Blood dripped from his mouth.</p><p>She\u2019d wondered if he were fully human. Thought perhaps he might be a hybrid. Or a demon. Maybe a shifter.</p><p>In the end, she\u2019d been leaning toward him being a charmer, like Pak.</p><p>But she\u2019d never thought he was a vampire.</p><p>Not a vamp. Not him.</p><p>He licked his lips. Licking the blood away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking vampire.\u201d What had Ian said? Shit, stupid, he\u2019d said\u2014He\u2019s with you, Dee. Standing so close.</p><p>Simon had been with her from the beginning, sneaking under her skin. Getting too close.</p><p>The perfect setup.</p><p>She\u2019d trusted him. Vampire. No, no\u2014</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Simon held up his hands. \u201cI\u2019m on your side, Dee.\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t. He knew the vamp he\u2019d just attacked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been setting me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I swear, I\u2019ve been trying to help you.\u201d</p><p>Cigarettes and old smoke burned her nose. Ian had come to join the party. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he called out and Dee didn\u2019t glance his way. Fucking crazy Ian. He\u2019d been insane since he and Brian shot up on that bad batch years ago and\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time, bitch,\u201d another voice growled and Dee\u2019s gaze shot to her left. The woman\u2014the one in the skin-tight dress and the spike heels, the woman with blood soaking her neck and a weird, trembling smile on her lips\u2014that crazy chick lunged at her.</p><p>And sank a knife into Dee\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s knees gave way and she hit the ground, hard. The bloodstained bitch stared down at her, that stupid grin still on her face. \u201cThey said you wouldn\u2019t fear me. What? Didn\u2019t you think a human could kill, too?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s fingers fumbled with the hilt of the knife. Fire pulsed from her heart.</p><p>Her heart...slowing, slowing...</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d Simon shoved the bitch out of the way. He grabbed Dee\u2019s shoulders, his fingers biting into her flesh. \u201cOh, shit, babe, hold on!\u201d</p><p>She blinked and tried to focus on his face. What big teeth you have. \u201cVam...pire...\u201d A croak. She tried to jerk free from him. Weapon. She needed her weapon.</p><p>Dark spots danced before her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you! I won\u2019t! I swear, I\u2019d never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vampires lied.</p><p>Everyone lied. Even the victims. No, the victims didn\u2019t just lie. They stabbed you in the fucking heart.</p><p>Laughter. The bitch\u2019s laughter.</p><p>Dee\u2019s fingers curled around the hilt.</p><p>\u201cDying! We\u2019re dying tonight...\u201d Ian\u2019s stupid singsong voice. \u201cDeath\u2019s here. Standing right here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for telling us where to find her.\u201d The bitch was talking again and Dee blinked, sure she was speaking to Simon. He set me up? Why?</p><p>She\u2019d...trusted him.</p><p>And been so damn blind.</p><p>Ian laughed. Loud. Deep. Crazy. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what I said, nothing could have changed. Nothing ever changes. Death is coming...for you, too...\u201d</p><p>Ian had told the woman where to find her? I dreamed about us last night.</p><p>Ice numbed her body, gentled the fire in her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Simon. His fingers were still on her flesh, but she could barely feel them now. No, she couldn\u2019t feel much, but she could still see\u2014him. Fangs out and gleaming. Eyes\u2014pitch black. A vampire\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She wrenched the knife out of her chest. The fire roared to life again and her heart\u2014</p><p>Dying.</p><p>\u201cDee, babe, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>She fumbled. The knife slipped from her fingers. \u201cBastard,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy...didn\u2019t I...see y-you?\u201d She\u2019d been too weak with him, from the beginning. Needed him, wanted him\u2014</p><p>Cared.</p><p>So dumb. She should have known better.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die. I won\u2019t let you!\u201d His bared fangs came toward her throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d a breath, because that was all she had.</p><p>\u201cWe die tonight!\u201d Ian yelled. \u201cTonight! Brian, are you waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting the hell out of here,\u201d Simon growled and then he grabbed her, jerking her up against his chest.</p><p>Vampire. Dee tried to shove against him. Failed. Her hands just weren\u2019t working right now.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going any damn place, bastard.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s head fell back against Simon\u2019s shoulder as he turned to face the mouth of the alley. The exit that was blocked by easily half a dozen vampires.</p><p>Trap.</p><p>The human had been the willing bait. Lure. Should have known.</p><p>Stupid fucking rookie mistake. But she\u2019d been so busy watching Simon, that she hadn\u2019t seen the threat screaming in the shadows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon.</p><p>She tried to speak, but choked on her own blood.</p><p>One of the vampires grabbed Ian. \u201cThanks for the tip, asshole.\u201d The vamp yanked Ian\u2019s neck to the side and sank his teeth deep.</p> <p>We die tonight.</p><p>Ian\u2019s gaze pinned her. \u201cReady?\u201d His lips moved in a near soundless whisper.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cGive us the bitch!\u201d A vamp spat at Simon. \u201cHurry, before she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t touch her.

His arms curled tightly around Dee\u2019s limp body and blood dripped on the floor around him.</p><p>Her blood and his.</p><p>He\u2019d had to bite and claw his way through that gang of vampires. He\u2019d taken as many of them down as he could, then he\u2019d run like hell.</p> <p>Staying and fighting hadn\u2019t been an option. Not with Dee bleeding out all around him.</p><p>The shifter must have caught the blood in the air because Jude Donovan came charging down the long corridor, barreling past the guards who had their weapons up, but who stared with wide, shocked eyes at Dee\u2019s prone body.</p><p>Donovan shoved one of the guards out of his way. \u201cWhat the fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s hold tightened around Dee. She was so damn still.</p><p>Donovan\u2019s hands reached for her. Simon clenched his jaw and let the tiger shifter take her away. No choice. The vamps would be coming for him. He had to leave her someplace safe.</p><p>It didn\u2019t get much safer than a hunters\u2019 den.</p><p>Her lashes cast dark shadows on her cheeks. Such pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cPak!\u201d Donovan bellowed.</p><p>One of the guards ran behind the shifter, grabbed a phone, and immediately called for an ambulance.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t do any good,\u201d Simon said, voice grim. \u201cDoctors can\u2019t help her now.\u201d</p><p>Donovan looked up, his teeth lengthening, his nostrils flaring. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Ah, now there was the problem. He reached out and trailed his fingers down Dee\u2019s cheeks. \u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d Her flesh was warm. No longer chilled as she\u2019d been in that alley.</p><p>Life, not death.</p><p>Why was it so hard for people to understand?</p><p>Footsteps thudded down the hallway. More hunters, coming to the aid of their fallen friend.</p><p>His thumb brushed over her lips. Those soft lips were stained red with her blood.</p><p>Simon dropped his hand. \u201cTell Dee...tell her I didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>Pak rounded the corner. Maybe he\u2019d heard the shifter\u2019s bellow or maybe one of the guards had buzzed him. Pak staggered to a stop at the sight of a limp Dee in Donovan\u2019s arms.</p><p>Don\u2019t leave her. Stay. The command came from inside, from the soul he\u2019d all but forgotten in the last few years.</p><p>Stay. A temptation that almost broke him. She\u2019d wake up. Confused. Angry.</p><p>She\u2019d need him. She\u2019d need\u2014</p><p>No. The vamps could track him. They couldn\u2019t track her.</p><p>This time, it wouldn\u2019t be about what he needed. Simon met Pak\u2019s dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll know how to take care of her.\u201d</p><p>Pak flinched as understanding hit. \u201cNo...Dee?\u201d</p><p>His head inclined in the briefest of nods. Then, one last look. Couldn\u2019t help it. He had to see her once more.</p><p>Dee.</p><p>Donovan had dropped to his knees and spread Dee out on the floor before him. His hands were at her chest, jerking open her shirt and pressing against the wound.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bleeding, not any longer.</p><p>Simon swallowed. The game hadn\u2019t gone according to plan. Not at all.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Dee.\u201d Simon turned away and went back to the darkness.</p><p>The darkness always waited for him.</p><p>And now, for her.</p><p>Dee opened her eyes and sucked in a sharp, hard breath. A fierce pounding filled her ears. Hard, too loud. A dozen scents assaulted her nose. Perfume, too strong. Cigars. Mint. A wild, animal scent and\u2014</p><p>Voices buzzed in her ears. Dozens of them. The buzzing grew, louder and louder, turning into a mad roar\u2014</p><p>\u201cDee! Dammit, Dee, look at me!\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the thundering voice and her gaze flew to meet Pak\u2019s glittering stare. Pak? How had he found her? She\u2019d been in that alley, bleeding all over the place\u2014</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>Vampire.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Dee.\u201d Hands were on her shoulders. Holding her in place. Holding her down? She glanced to the right. Saw Jude, his face white, his jaw clenched. There was something in his eyes as he looked at her, something\u2014</p><p>Pity?</p><p>\u201cI-I-\u201d She sounded like a freaking frog. A really loud frog. \u201cI was...dying.\u201d Her hand fumbled, reached for her chest.</p><p>Her shirt had been cut away and she touched skin. Smooth, unmarred flesh right over her heart.</p><p>No, no, that wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, hunter. You\u2019ll still need to breathe,\u201d Pak told her softly.</p><p>Well, of course she needed to breathe. Everyone did. She took another hard breath and swallowed and realized that she was thirsty.</p><p>Very, very thirsty.</p><p>Her teeth began to ache.</p><p>\u201cAre you in control?\u201d Pak asked.</p><p>Dee could only stare blankly at him. Why am I alive? Did the knife miss my heart? Maybe the wound hadn\u2019t been as deep as she\u2019d thought, but there had been so much blood.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>The drumming in her ears pounded faster, louder. Her hand rose higher, brushing over the edge of her bra, and her fingers circled her throat. So dry. It hurt to swallow.</p><p>\u201cDrink this.\u201d Pak shoved a black mug into her left hand.</p><p>Pak had never led her wrong. Dee lifted the mug, and the liquid, sweet and rich and oh, God, good, slid over her tongue and down her parched throat.</p><p>More.</p><p>Greedy, desperate, she drained the mug in three swallows. \u201cMore!\u201d The taste lingered on her tongue. Pak had been holding out on her. He\u2019d never given her anything like this before and\u2014</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should give her the whole bag.\u201d Jude\u2019s voice. Deep and booming, except maybe he\u2019d been whispering.</p><p>Her gaze slanted to him, and she found him holding up one of those bags, kinda like the IV drips you\u2019d see in a hospital, only\u2014this one was filled with red fluid. No, with blood.</p><p>Give her the whole bag.</p><p>Dee licked her lips and the mug dropped from her hand, shattering onto the floor.</p><p>She vomited then because she knew what they\u2019d just given her. What she\u2019d eagerly taken.</p><p>\u201cFuck! Get towels in here!\u201d Shouted to someone, somewhere, then, \u201cEverything is okay, Dee.\u201d Pak, still trying to be reassuring.</p><p>No, everything was not okay. Her head fell back even as her tongue skated over her teeth, caught the too-sharp edge of her canines\u2014</p><p>No, Christ, no! \u201cPak?\u201d</p><p>Jude moved toward her, holding that damn vampire takeout, and Dee shuddered. Her hands came up. Her short nails were turning into claws. \u201cWhat did he do to me?\u201d</p><p>Simon.</p><p>The vampire who\u2019d held her in her last moments. The lover she\u2019d stupidly trusted. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d But she knew. Oh, dammit, she knew.</p><p>Jude lowered his hand. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d She screamed as the voices droned in her head and the smells blasted her nose. \u201cI\u2019m not human anymore! That bastard changed me.\u201d I\u2019ve become what I hate most.</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d Pak, calm, trying to talk her down. No talking down from this.</p><p>The blood\u2014so close. She wanted more.</p><p>No, no, she was going to be sick again\u2014</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Her gaze rose to Jude\u2019s throat. To the pulse that throbbed beneath the skin. Fresh blood would be better. So much better.</p><p>His brow furrowed. \u201cWhy you looking at me like I\u2019m your meal, hunter? Stay in control, you got me? Stay in\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shoved her hand against her mouth. The hunger was so intense she nearly doubled over. A vampire. Just like those bastards who\u2019d slaughtered her family. No. Never this. Never. \u201cStay away from me,\u201d she growled, and didn\u2019t look at him. Couldn\u2019t, because he tempted her too much.</p><p>\u201cYou have to drink more,\u201d Pak said, voice smooth as silk. Calm, steady Pak. Acting as if nothing were wrong. As if her world hadn\u2019t just gone to hell thanks to a sexy, lying vampire who\u2019d set her up from the beginning. \u201cThe first hunger can be too strong for some. I can\u2019t allow you to attack anyone, Dee. You have to drink.\u201d</p><p>She threw out her hand. Another mug was pushed against her fingers. She lifted the cup, guzzled the blood. Keep. It. Down.</p><p>I\u2019m drinking blood. Nausea rolled inside her, the human remnants fighting what she\u2019d become.</p><p>Empty. She pushed the mug back at Pak. It was refilled almost instantly.</p><p>She swallowed the dark liquid. Keep. It. Down.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Dee drank and closed her eyes. Her cheeks were wet, but she didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d never cried in front of the other hunters. Never cried, period. But this was different. This was hell.</p><p>Her teeth ached. Her stomach knotted. She still drank. Drank until the vicious need pounding through her body eased, until she could breathe without wanting to sink her teeth into Jude\u2019s throat.</p><p>Until the monster inside had quieted.</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d Pak took the cup from her. Dee swiped the back of her hand over her cheeks. Stupid tears\u2014what good would crying do her? She glanced at her hands, frowning. Wait, was that blood? She\u2019d cried tears of blood?</p><p>Dee\u2019s chin came up. \u201cWhere\u2019s Zane?\u201d She wasn\u2019t stupid. She hunted vampires for a living. She\u2019d known that a day like this could come, probably would come, sooner or later. She\u2019d hedged her bets to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t turn into one of those killers who preyed on innocents. So many vampires just lost control and killed...killed.</p><p>Because the bloodlust could flare so strongly.</p><p>Zane was her safety net.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with the cleanup team on Bymore.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been on Bymore, right before the attack. \u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard\u2019s dead, and so is some cop, a female who\u2019d been working vice.\u201d</p><p>The bitch who\u2019d stabbed her. And she\u2019d been one of Tony\u2019s girls?</p><p>\u201cThe place is a fucking mess, blood everywhere, dead vamps torn apart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d With the hunger slaked, she could think better. \u201cDid Night Watch get there to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot our kills.\u201d Pak crossed his arms over his chest and stared down at her. \u201cWe found the bodies like that and thought maybe you\u2019d managed to take some of the bastards out.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, no, the cop stabbed me. I was down for the count.\u201d Should have been, anyway.</p><p>You won\u2019t touch her. Dee could still hear the rage in Simon\u2019s voice. \u201cHe brought me here?\u201d Dumped her. He\u2019d changed her, then dumped her.</p><p>She swallowed, aware that the knowledge hurt. The jerk still had the power to hurt her.</p><p>Dumped me like garbage. Why?</p><p>Because he knew she\u2019d be coming after his ass.</p><p>\u201cChase wanted you taken care of. He knew you\u2019d be safe here.\u201d</p><p>But the hunters weren\u2019t safe. She was too unstable. Too\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou know the first forty-eight hours are the hardest.\u201d Pak, still with those crossed-arms and quiet voice. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to keep you under lockdown until we can make sure you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Insane. Driven crazy by bloodlust and power. A freaking killer who would slaughter everyone and everything in her path.</p><p>\u201cI know you gave Zane kill orders,\u201d Pak said and Jude sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jude\u2019s claws sprang out.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not dying yet,\u201d Pak told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already dead!\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head toward Jude. \u201cLock her up. And, do whatever you have to do, but keep that demon away from her.\u201d A pause. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Because if she went bad, if she couldn\u2019t keep her control, Zane would come for her.</p><p>He\u2019d given her his word, after all, and one thing about that demon, he always kept his word.</p><p>Unlike Simon...I\u2019ll find you. Sooner or later, she\u2019d find her lover and make him pay.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smell like a vamp,\u201d Jude said four nights later when he led her out the back door of Night Watch. His nostrils flared a bit and he leaned in close. \u201cDamn, woman, you just smell, hell, like you.\u201d</p><p>Dee glanced his way, then turned to stare at the long, dark street. Since the moment she\u2019d awoken, Pak had kept her under close scrutiny. He\u2019d watched her. Fed her. Helped her to focus the chaos in her mind that came from the enhanced senses and the fears.</p><p>Just like before, Pak had taught her.</p><p>Not how to hunt this time.</p><p>How to live as a vampire.</p><p>\u201cPak told me that a vamp\u2019s scent changes,\u201d Dee said, not sure she understood why she wasn\u2019t reeking like a corpse. \u201cThose bastards that hunt and rip apart humans, they stink of death and decay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they have no soul left,\u201d Pak\u2019s soft voice, coming from behind them. Dee didn\u2019t glance back. She\u2019d known he was there. It was too easy to catch even his soft footfalls now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy grandfather once said that when the Taken lose their humanity, they become no more than the walking dead.\u201d</p><p>His grandfather had been a Choctaw shaman, so Dee figured the guy had known a thing or two about the walking dead.</p><p>\u201cYou still have your soul, Dee. Your mortal life is gone, but you\u2019re still the same inside.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, right. She just had a few flashy additions on the outside. New teeth. New nails. New eyes.</p><p>Taken. Why had Simon changed her? \u201cWhy not just leave me to die?\u201d she asked the night, her hands clenched into fists.</p><p>No answer. Dee hadn\u2019t really expected one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll hunt now.\u201d Pak sounded certain.</p><p>She would, because there was still a job to do.</p> <p>\u201cFor some reason, the Born Master left the city.\u201d</p><p>A great stroke of luck for them. Because she sure hadn\u2019t been up to hunting the last few days.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t risk him coming back,\u201d Jude said, voice grim.</p><p>She uncurled her hands and glanced down at her new claws. \u201cHe won\u2019t be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take him down alone!\u201d Jude snapped. \u201cYou\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie?\u201d She finished and gave him a tight smile. \u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d Her eyes darted around the street. No sign of Zane. He hadn\u2019t come to Night Watch, not once during her little \u201cstay.\u201d She would have known. Would have caught his scent just as she\u2019d caught all the others.</p> <p>But he\u2019d come for her, sooner or later.</p><p>Just like Tony would be coming. Her time had expired for him, and the little matter of her being undead wasn\u2019t going to stop him from taking her down.</p><p>She stepped into the night.</p><p>\u201cNever the innocents, hunter. Remember that. Never them,\u201d Pak ordered.</p><p>Dee gave a nod. The prey she\u2019d be hunting first, well, he wasn\u2019t innocent.</p><p>She doubted if he ever had been.</p><p>Sure, she\u2019d track the Born Master. Find him, do her damned best to kill him. But first\u2014</p><p>First, she had some personal payback coming.</p> <p>Her nostrils widened as she scented the night. \u201cCome out, come out, Simon Chase.\u201d I\u2019ll find you, wherever you are.</p><p>The hunt was on.</p><p>Following the scent of blood was ridiculously easy. Fighting the urge to let her fangs out, to take a bite, not so easy.</p><p>But the need for blood had been slaked under Pak\u2019s watchful eye. Control, yeah, she had that now. He\u2019d gotten her through that first mad rush of blood hunger. The rush that drove some vampires crazy and pushed others beyond that thin good/evil line.</p><p>She\u2019d survived. She wouldn\u2019t need to feed for weeks now, and when she did feed, the thirst wouldn\u2019t be as overwhelming.</p><p>The first time\u2014it was always a bitch in vampire land.</p><p>So she had her control. For what it was worth. Once she got her hands on her lying lover, Dee wasn\u2019t real sure how long it would be before that old wall of control started to crack.</p><p>The first stop on her little hunt was his place. Not that she expected Simon to still be hanging around town. No, once he\u2019d dumped her ass, he\u2019d probably hit the road as fast as he could.</p><p>Why change me? Why? That question had haunted her every moment. Was this some kind of sick punishment? Another way of torturing her? Damn vampire. He\u2019d probably thought turning her into what she hated most was hilarious.</p><p>His house stood at the end of the road, lined off by garish yellow police tape. She could see the color of the tape so clearly in the darkness. Could see everything so clearly. The bullet holes in the siding. The broken shards of glass. The front door that swayed drunkenly on its hinges.</p><p>Dee hunched down and slid under the police tape. No sign of any uniforms. No sign of anyone. Maybe she\u2019d find something inside to lead her to the vampire bastard.</p><p>Getting inside was easy\u2014the front door was pretty much gone. The TV lay smashed on the floor. Stuffing from the couch cushions covered the room.</p><p>And to think, she\u2019d actually been happy here, for a brief, stupid moment of time, she\u2019d been happy.</p><p>The floor creaked. A groan, more vibration than sound, and she caught the faintest hitch. Breathing. Coming from the bedroom.</p><p>Claws out, she sprang forward.</p><p>And slammed into her lover\u2019s chest.</p><p>Dead lover\u2019s chest.</p><p>Dee took him down, hard and fast. Simon\u2019s head rapped against the hardwood. Her hips straddled him and she pinned his arms to the floor. Oh, yeah, vampire strength, baby. Payback was going to be hell.</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d Why was he saying her name like that? All husky and hungry. Like he hadn\u2019t royally screwed her.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d Her fangs were growing, sharpening, and she wanted to sink them into his throat.</p><p>Bite.</p><p>The whisper she\u2019d first heard here, with him. She should have known back then what was happening. Vampires were highly psychic. He\u2019d been the one broadcasting that need, not her. Him.</p><p>\u201cYou should have let me die,\u201d she growled and her fingers tightened around him.</p><p>His eyes flashed to black as fury hardened his face. Finally she was seeing the real man. Not the fake veneer. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He lunged up, breaking her hold and rolling them in a tumble of limbs. In the next second, Dee was on the floor, he had her caged, and his teeth glinted down at her. \u201cHaven\u2019t taken straight from a source yet, have you, babe? That was a mistake. You won\u2019t be strong enough to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee tried to head-butt him, but Simon pulled back, shaking his head. \u201cStill thinking like a human. You can\u2019t do that, Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you no!\u201d She knew her fangs were out. Didn\u2019t care. Her words were starting to lisp, just a bit. Still not used to those damn teeth. \u201cI knew what you wanted, at the end.\u201d That part was seared in her mind. \u201cI told you no!\u201d</p><p>The memory of his voice rumbled in her mind. \u201cYou won\u2019t die. I won\u2019t let you!\u201d Then his bared fangs had come toward her throat. Must have been her imagination, or maybe just the insanity brought on by dying, but she\u2019d sure thought the man sounded scared then. Afraid, for her.</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou played me all along. Lied to me! Tricked me! You were the one who set all this shit up, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Her hands jerked against his, but, he was stronger and he wasn\u2019t letting up.</p><p>\u201cThinking like a human,\u201d he muttered again. \u201cDee, calm down.\u201d</p><p>She was so sick of people telling her to calm down, relax, or go easy. She was a vampire for fuck\u2019s sake! She didn\u2019t have a cold or a broken hand\u2014she was a vampire! Dee rammed her knee up and caught him right in the groin. His hold loosened, a moment was all she needed, and she hurled him back.</p><p>He flew five feet and thudded into the wall.</p><p>Sometimes thinking like a human wasn\u2019t bad.</p><p>She bent low and jerked her stake from her ankle holster.</p><p>He bounded back to his feet and shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come here to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, she tested the weight of the stake. \u201cI want to know where the Born Master is.\u201d If she had to get physical with him to find out the location, so be it.</p><p>A rough laugh burst from his lips.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the stake. \u201cDon\u2019t push me.\u201d Her control had begun to waver the minute she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>But the man stepped forward and a hard smile curled his lips. \u201cI made you scream for me. I took you and you came and you screamed for me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d screamed his name. A growl built in her throat. \u201cThe Born Master.\u201d</p><p>The smile wiped away. \u201cI got you out of that alley. Those vampires wanted to rip you apart. I got you out. I kept you safe.\u201d</p><p>She lunged at him and closed the distance instantly. She shoved the stake right above his heart, not breaking the skin, not yet. But it would be all too easy to go in for the kill. \u201cYou should have let me die.\u201d And let me stay dead.</p><p>His hands came up, moving in a fast blur, not to push her away, but to wrap around her wrist, and to hold that stake close. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said the same thing before, but this time, a shiver worked over her. \u201cSomeone else made me?\u201d</p><p>His hold didn\u2019t waver. \u201cDon\u2019t get it, do you? I thought Pak would have told you before he sent you out to hunt.\u201d</p><p>The stake pressed into his flesh. \u201cTold me what?\u201d</p><p>His gaze tracked over her face. \u201cIt\u2019s you. You. You were Born in that alley. You died\u2014\u201d He sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cRight in my arms, but then you came back.\u201d</p><p>And Simon almost died then because the roaring in her ears blasted her mind apart and the stake was suddenly so light in her hands\u2014</p><p>He shoved her back. She should have fallen to the floor. She barely stumbled. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d That black gaze bored into her. \u201cIn certain circles, the truth about you has been known for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertain vampire circles?\u201d Her stomach rolled.</p><p>A slow nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she spat the words. Had to be. There was no way she was Born.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you hear?\u201d he asked and he didn\u2019t advance toward her. A rivulet of blood ran down his chest. The scent was so ripe and rich, better than the strawberries she\u2019d always loved and Dee wanted to slither closer, to taste. \u201cWhat do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heartbeat.\u201d The myths were wrong. The hearts of vamps still beat. They still breathed. Still fucked. Still did everything that humans did. Because vampires only died for a moment of time, then they came back\u2014they just came back different.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cCars.\u201d Far away. Zooming on the road. \u201cInsects.\u201d Couldn\u2019t focus on them or their buzz would drive her crazy. She\u2019d learned that lesson in the first hour of her new life. Death. Whatever.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Hunger. Lust.</p><p>Looking at him, Dee knew she should hate him, but the need simmered below the surface. He\u2019d lied to her, betrayed her, but the vamp inside looked out from her eyes and lusted.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Sex.</p><p>Prey.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel the call, do you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel the pressure.\u201d He sounded certain. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear it, right? The nagging voice in your head, telling you to come, to listen, to heed?\u201d</p><p>No, there was nothing in her mind like that. Just the lust and the need.</p><p>And the strong urge to rip the guy apart.</p><p>\u201cThe Taken are linked to the Born, you know that.\u201d</p><p>Vampire 101. Every hunter learned that lesson early.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a link. If you did,\u201d his hand clenched, \u201cyou\u2019d be about to go as fucking crazy as I am because the Born we\u2019re after is calling his vamps to him, calling \u2019em in a frenzy because the bastard is scared as hell.\u201d</p><p>The Born we\u2019re after? She could see the tension in Simon\u2019s body. The faint sweat on his brow. She\u2019d thought that was fear, fear of her. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that you\u2019re linked to the Born who was in Baton Rouge?\u201d</p><p>The barest of nods.</p><p>Her breath exploded, and for a moment, she saw red. Literally saw him in a wall of blood. Betrayed. Dee attacked. Not with the stake this time, but with claws and teeth.</p><p>She slammed into him and they staggered to the floor. She wrenched his hands down and her mouth went for his throat.</p><p>Her fangs scraped across his flesh.</p><p>It took a moment for her to realize that he wasn\u2019t fighting her. His body was held too still, taut, like a wire, and he was just...waiting.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d a rasp and he bared his throat. \u201cThis is why I hunted you, why I fought for you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing was making sense to her.</p><p>\u201cI killed for you, and I would have died. Died.\u201d</p><p>The blood flowed so close, right beneath her teeth. Her tongue slipped out, tasted that flesh.</p><p>Should have stayed with Pak longer. Not ready for this.</p><p>But she\u2019d never be ready for this.</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>The bite gave a vampire power. Why would he want to be weak?</p><p>That blood...so close.... She shuddered against him, fighting the beast she\u2019d never known until now.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you from the moment I saw you. I want you now. I fought like hell burning for you, don\u2019t you see that? Woman, don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He jerked forward and her fangs pierced the skin. Accident! No, she hadn\u2019t meant\u2014</p><p>His blood slipped over her tongue. Warm and sweet.</p><p>A groan tore from his lips.</p><p>Her fangs sank deeper. The blood flowed faster. More, more. Her breasts pressed against his chest and she freed his hands, the better to drag her fingers through his hair and hold his head so she could take.</p><p>His hands curled around her hips and yanked her tight against him, the aroused length of his cock shoved between her legs. Thick, hard. She arched her hips, loving that pressure even as she drank from him.</p><p>Sex and blood.</p><p>\u201cMore, Dee, take more!\u201d</p><p>Helpless, she did.</p><p>His fingers fumbled with the button of her jeans. He jerked the fly open, managed to push his fingers between them and shove down her jeans.</p><p>Heat pooled in her sex, and a hungry, vicious need ripped away her reason as she fed from him. Fed, for the first time on a living being.</p><p>Addiction.</p><p>Power.</p><p>Lust.</p><p>This was what Pak had warned her about. This was why she\u2019d given Zane kill orders. Dee couldn\u2019t pull back. She wanted her teeth in Simon\u2019s throat and she wanted his cock driving into her.</p><p>What he\u2019d done to her, who he was\u2014didn\u2019t matter. She needed, so badly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Take.</p><p>More.</p><p>Mine.</p> <p>Her body began to heat, from the inside out, and a rush of power and euphoria swept through her. She could have anything. Do anything. The world was hers. There was no stopping her. She could take and take and\u2014</p><p>Her hands joined his and they jerked her jeans and panties down even as she kicked off her shoes. But Dee didn\u2019t free his throat. No, there was no way she\u2019d stop drinking that wonderfully sweet blood.</p><p>His zipper hissed down. Her legs widened. The touch of his bare cock had her jolting, but not stopping. No, not stopping.</p><p>She was undead. No protection required. No diseases. No pregnancies.</p><p>Just need.</p> <p>The need that had her sex slick when she should have been horrified. The need that had her nipples tight and her back arching, the need that\u2014</p><p>Simon thrust into her and she slammed her hips down on him at the same moment.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t be doing this. Shouldn\u2019t be. She didn\u2019t trust him. Didn\u2019t even like him.</p><p>But the vampire didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Blood and sex. A vampire\u2019s wet dream.</p> <p>Their bodies strained together. His cock was long and thick and every frantic move of his hips had him sliding deeper inside. She was wet, more than ready, and he filled every inch of her core.</p><p>Her mouth tightened on him, fangs in deep.</p><p>He drove harder, shoving up with his hips, and Dee took every straining inch of his shaft and wanted more.</p><p>His fingers thrummed her clit.</p><p>Her knees tightened around him. She pushed down harder, wanting to take, take.</p><p>She exploded around him as her sex contracted on a wave of pure pleasure that had her trembling, quivering, coming with the best orgasm she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>Simon bucked beneath her and climaxed, jetting out the hot splash of his release deep inside of her.</p><p>This time, he was the one who screamed. No, more like a roar.</p> <p>Her name.</p><p>Her mouth gentled on his neck. The driving rush of bloodlust began to ease and the haze of red cleared from her mind.</p><p>What have I done?</p><p>Oh, Christ, what had she just done? She hadn\u2019t come to screw him. Not part of her plan. She\u2019d come to find out what he knew about the Born and to make him pay for changing her.</p><p>Two bodies on the floor. Man. Woman. Older. Graying hair and sightless eyes. Blood around them, oozing from their torn necks.</p><p>Her hands clamped on Simon\u2019s shoulders. Her claws dug deep.</p><p>Simon, running to them, falling to the floor, slipping in their blood.</p><p>Dee tried to lift her head. This was wrong. She shouldn\u2019t be seeing\u2014</p><p>\u201cTold you there was no choice, Chase. You\u2019re ours now.\u201d A tall, pale vampire. Beautiful and perfect. Laughing as he stared at the dead bodies, blood dripping from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill you!\u201d Simon\u2019s bellow of fury.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>His memories. His mind. His blood.</p><p>What was she doing?</p><p>Linking. The way of the vampire.</p><p>Dee jerked her mouth away from his throat. She scrambled away, shaking, the taste of him still in her mouth, on her tongue, and her sex quivering for more. Dee shoved back her hair and she stared at him.</p><p>What have I done?</p><p>No, no\u2014what have I become?</p><p>Blood and sex.</p><p>More.</p><p>He smiled at her, a sad, painful sight, and said, \u201cWelcome to my world.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cSandra Dee Daniels rose.\u201d</p><p>The words fell into the silence of the room. The Born Master didn\u2019t glance up, he kept his teeth buried in the neck of his prey and her blood flowed over his tongue.</p><p>One minute stretched to five. Then ten.</p><p>The prey stopped moving. No more whimpers. No more tears.</p><p>He kept feeding. Kept drinking. Until nothing was left.</p><p>Only a shell.</p><p>His head rose and he licked his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll need another.\u201d The hunger was never satiated for him. Never.</p><p>His glance drifted back to the woman. Pale limbs. Limp neck. Hair a long, straight black.</p><p>Death had been kind to her. No fear showed on her face. Her eyes had closed, and she almost looked like she might just be sleeping.</p><p>Kind. He wasn\u2019t usually kind, but this human had helped him.</p><p>In return for luring, she\u2019d wanted immortality.</p><p>Too bad.</p><p>Turning, he glanced at the Taken in the doorway. \u201cWhen?\u201d He\u2019d known this day would come. But just because the little hunter had finally turned didn\u2019t mean she was a threat. Sure he\u2019d hoped to have her head so she wouldn\u2019t become, but failure didn\u2019t mean the end for him.</p><p>There was no end for him.</p><p>\u201cAbout four nights ago.\u201d A pause. \u201cWe had her, but Chase stopped the team. He took her away.\u201d</p><p>Fucking Chase.</p><p>The asshole had been a thorn in his side for too many years. \u201cThe bastard needs to burn.\u201d</p><p>A grim nod.</p><p>\u201cSo does she.\u201d He shoved the body out of his way as he stalked to the window. \u201cTake the bitch out with him.\u201d Because the demon seer he\u2019d used so long ago, another bitch who\u2019d tried to screw him, had told him a great deal about Sandra Dee.</p><p>A new Born breathes on this earth.</p><p>A new Born? He hadn\u2019t believed her, not at first. The youngest Born was over two thousand years old.</p><p>But the demon had been certain. She\u2019d seemed to know so much about Sandra Dee.</p><p>Her strength lies close to her heart.</p><p>So when he\u2019d attacked, his first move had been to cut her heart out. He\u2019d killed her family. Let her walk in their blood.</p><p>And later, when he couldn\u2019t kill her, he\u2019d set plans in motion to separate her from the friends she\u2019d come to know so well.</p><p>The killing of the human in Baton Rouge had been the first step. He\u2019d planned to force Dee into solitude. To make the others turn on her. Alone, Dee would be weak. The demon had said so.</p><p>He\u2019d made the seer tell him about Dee\u2019s weaknesses. Torture was so easy for him. He\u2019d learned at the foot of a master so many centuries before. He knew exactly how to make prey break.</p><p>The demon had broken for him. Two days, and she\u2019d broken. But the whore had made one last prediction, right before he used his fangs to slice her throat wide open. \u201cShe\u2019ll kill you when she rises. Drain you. Make you see the fires of hell.\u201d</p><p>Fear.</p><p>As the demon had bled out, fear had trickled through him because the woman had been so certain.</p><p>Death wasn\u2019t an option for him. He knew what waited after this world. No, death wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>He rolled his neck and shoved away the past. \u201cBurn her,\u201d he said again. Fire was always the easiest way to kill his kind. \u201cMake sure Chase dies with her.\u201d Simon Chase. A stupid mistake made by one of his blood.</p><p>Some just weren\u2019t meant for the darkness.</p><p>A soft muffle reached him. Glancing back, he saw the new girl who\u2019d been brought to him. Young, maybe eighteen. With bright red cheeks. A smile curved his lips. He could hear the fast drum of her heart.</p><p>Some weren\u2019t meant for the darkness.</p><p>And some were.</p><p>\u201cYou know where they are?\u201d he asked, eyes on the girl. She stared back at him. No fear in her light gaze. Excitement. She knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cWe followed her the instant she left Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He licked his lips, already tasting his pleasure. \u201cThen have her dead by dawn.\u201d</p><p>Simon raised a hand to his throat, and touched the blood that dripped down his neck. His pants were open, his cock out, and rising by the moment.</p><p>Dee stared back at him, her eyes slowly changing from black to that deep chocolate he loved.</p><p>Her mouth hung open. The tips of her fangs peeked at him.</p><p>A vampire. A Born. The witch he\u2019d sought had been right about her.</p><p>He should probably lower his head. Do some dumbass bow or head incline like all the vamps did whenever a Born was close. A sign of subservience. Of submission.</p><p>Because Borns could rip apart the Taken if they wanted.</p><p>But he\u2019d just let her take his throat and his body. And he\u2019d taken her.</p><p>Simon wasn\u2019t exactly feeling real submissive right then.</p><p>So he held her stare and knew that she felt the new link between them. A link she\u2019d forged. Not him.</p><p>Already, the call that had haunted his mind for weeks had begun to soften. It will work. He\u2019d been right to think she was the key. Dee would be able to change the game, to give him back his life.</p><p>Well, what was left of it, anyway.</p><p>She stumbled to her feet. Grabbed her jeans. Jerked them up. No panties. He\u2019d remember that. Her curls disappeared beneath the denim. Pity.</p><p>Setting his shoulders, he began to rise.</p><p>But fell right back on his ass.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>Weak, in front of her. Because of her. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her footsteps creaked across the wood. \u201cI took too much.\u201d Not a question.</p><p>But he managed a nod anyway.</p><p>She edged closer to him. \u201cI-I\u2014didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t. The woman had given him one hell of a rush with her mouth and then the tight clasp of her creamy sex had driven him close to begging.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her. Standing over him, blond hair mussed, always mussed, eyes so steady and...afraid? Dee? Since when did that woman fear anything? She\u2019d stared straight at death with her eyes wide open and never flinched.</p><p>While he\u2019d been so scared he\u2019d almost bitten her. Because what if the witch had been wrong? Losing Dee hadn\u2019t been an option for him. The woman wasn\u2019t a pawn anymore. Hadn\u2019t been, maybe from that first night.</p><p>She was...everything.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d believe him. Not when she found out the secrets he\u2019d kept.</p><p>His eyes began to drift closed.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d</p><p>The crack in her voice had his lashes lifting. So beautiful. Had he seen the beauty the first moment? Or the strength?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d She asked again.</p><p>The last part of the puzzle. Careful. Had to be so careful here. \u201cBlood.\u201d</p><p>Her delicate jaw worked.</p><p>He let his shoulders slump. Not really hard with the weakness spreading through him, weighing down his limbs.</p><p>\u201cYou drink, then you explain, got me? Everything, everything.\u201d She held out her arm, turned it, and exposed her wrist with the thin line of blue veins visible just beneath the surface.</p><p>He\u2019d be her first.</p><p>His hands shook when he reached for her wrist. The shaking was from the blood loss, of course, just that. His fingers curled around her flesh and brought her offering close. Eyes on her, he opened his mouth and sank his teeth deep.</p><p>Fuck. His tongue slid along her wrist and the blood flowed into his mouth. Sweet, so damn sweet. A wild rush poured through him at her taste. His cock jerked, his muscles strained, and power, wild, rich power, heated his body.</p><p>Nothing like a Born\u2019s blood. That was the whisper. The rumor. Blood straight from a Born was power. Pure power.</p><p>Her breath caught and her eyes began to darken once again. The scent of blood hung in the air between them, but Simon\u2019s nostrils widened and he caught the heavier aroma of her slick cream.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Her whisper.</p><p>One more swipe of his tongue, then a press of his lips, and Simon pulled back.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell quickly. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing?\u201d</p><p>Getting ready to change the world.</p><p>Simon rose, too easily this time. He righted his clothes, hard that, with his dick bobbing toward her. But he\u2019d promised Dee answers, and from here on out, he\u2019d be keeping his word to her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t change you in that alley.\u201d Her chin tipped back as she stared up at him. His neck throbbed from her bite and his body burned for her. Always, for her. \u201cAnd I damn well didn\u2019t let any of those other bastards touch you.\u201d</p><p>The understanding was in her eyes, but Dee shook her head.</p><p>Time for some brutal truth. \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been since a new Born came into the world?\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. \u201cBorns are ancient. There haven\u2019t been any for thousands of years. They were some kind of genetic mutation. A messed-up mutation that gave rise to the vamps.\u201d</p><p>To us. \u201cWhat all do you know about Borns?\u201d</p><p>The fingers of her right hand rubbed the wrist he\u2019d bitten. Slow, steady strokes that she didn\u2019t even seem to be aware of making. \u201cI hunt vampires. I know everything there is to know\u2014both about the Born and the Taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d he said, voice soft.</p><p>Eyes narrowing, she snapped, \u201cThey\u2019re young. I mean the Born change young. They\u2019re strong. Stronger physically and psychically than the Taken. They can\u2014they can control other vampires. Summon those in the line they create.\u201d</p><p>Points for her. Time for hell. \u201cThose vampires came to your home all those years ago for a reason, Dee. It wasn\u2019t some random attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they wanted blood. They didn\u2019t care who they hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came for you.\u201d</p><p>She paled. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that about sixteen years ago, a level-nine demon made a prediction.\u201d She\u2019d been the strongest precognitive alive. Of course, after her prediction, the demon\u2019s body had been found, minus her head.</p><p>One less precog demon around.</p><p>\u201cThe demon said a new Born was in the world, and that one day, she\u2019d change, just like the others had changed so long ago.\u201d Not so subtle emphasis on the she.</p><p>Dee\u2019s lips parted. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>No sympathy. No remorse. \u201cThe vampires came to your home because you were the predicted Born. They had to kill you while you were young, before you could change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The air seemed to thicken around him. \u201cThey were under orders not to drain you. They were supposed to cut your head off.\u201d No chance of her changing that way. \u201cThey weren\u2019t sure when you\u2019d transform, and the bastard leading them didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She backed up a step. \u201cStop this!

Why let me keep living all these years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt first, because you disappeared.\u201d And because Grim had killed his all-seeing demon. No one had been around to tell him where to find a missing girl. \u201cThen Pak took you in.\u201d Most vamps knew better than to cross him. \u201cOthers did come for you, but by then, it was too late. You\u2019d learned to kill, and you were ready for the change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady? Ready how? Simon, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now he did lift his hand. His fingers brushed over her face. The clean, smooth lines of her face. She should have seen this for herself. \u201cYou stopped aging.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>In her thirties, but she looked like she was in her early twenties. The woman hadn\u2019t even realized it. She\u2019d been too busy fighting. He cleared his throat. \u201cYou probably began to heal faster from your injuries, too, didn\u2019t you? And killing, I bet it became easier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo much easier.\u201d A bit of sadness.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t transform fully because you were still alive.\u201d Tricky part here. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t become a vampire until your human self died.\u201d A little rule not everyone knew.</p><p>Her lashes fell. \u201cLike I did in that alley.\u201d</p><p>No denial now. She just sounded tired. Sick.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She swiped away the tear and left a smudge of red on her cheek. \u201cWhy should I believe this crap? Why should I believe you? You\u2019ve been lying to me from the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Again, a simple response.</p><p>She growled at him. He shouldn\u2019t have, really shouldn\u2019t have, but Simon found that small growl sexy.</p><p>\u201cThis could be some kind of sickass mind game you\u2019re playing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be, but it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to her narrow hips. \u201cThen how do you know all this? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>His gaze drifted over her face. He suspected she knew this, but he\u2019d tell her anyway. If she wanted the words, he\u2019d give them to her, and he\u2019d brace for her attack. \u201cBecause I\u2019m blood linked to the Born Master who killed your family. And from the moment I became a vampire, I\u2019ve known there was a bounty on your head.\u201d</p><p>The hunter\u2014she didn\u2019t know it, but all along, she\u2019d been the prey. Prey who\u2019d taken down every vamp who\u2019d come for her.</p><p>And who\u2019d made the Born bastard afraid.</p> <p>Dee drew back her fist, and Simon knew the punch would be hard. He probably deserved it, though, all things considered.</p><p>Before the blow could land, a long, loud whistle split the night.</p><p>Dee spun toward the front of the house. \u201cThis is not my night\u2014\u201d She froze. \u201cTell me that\u2019s not gasoline.\u201d</p><p>But it was. The scent was thick and heavy in the air, because some bastards were out there, getting ready to torch the house, to torch them. \u201cThey followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her claws were out. Not as long or deadly as a shifter\u2019s, but still able to do a whole lot of damage. \u201cNo way, I\u2019m always careful.\u201d</p><p>He shoved past her and headed into the small den. The gasoline scent was stronger here. Not much time. \u201cYou weren\u2019t careful enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something flew through the already broken front window. A Molotov cocktail. Shit. \u201cDee! Get the hell out!\u201d</p><p>More burning bottles. They slammed into the floor. Into the walls. Into the broken remains of his prized TV.</p><p>Then the flames sprang up like greedy bitches, racing across the floor and devouring everything in their path.</p><p>Trying to burn us out. No, just trying to burn them. He grabbed Dee and shoved her back into the bedroom. The flames chased them. The smoke thickened the air and he tasted ash on his tongue. He could see flames through the blinds on his window. Tall, dancing, red flames. They\u2019d surrounded the house. Smart assholes. They\u2019d circled the house with a ring of fire before sending the flames inside.</p><p>The better to trap them.</p><p>Vampires and fire didn\u2019t mix. He\u2019d seen too many of his brethren fall to the flames.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t happen to them. Not to Dee. He grabbed the tangled covers from the bed.</p><p>Dee jumped up and kicked the glass from his window. No fresh air came in, just more billowing smoke.</p><p>She hurtled through the broken glass and Simon lunged right on her heels.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t see the sky. No stars. No moon. Only that hungry circle of flames, burning closer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re surrounded.\u201d Dee\u2019s tight voice. And they were. The vamps had planned well, and he\u2019d been so distracted by Dee that he\u2019d let them get killing close.</p><p>Won\u2019t make that mistake again.</p><p>They\u2019d fed the flames, poured so much gas on the area that the air tasted rancid on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cBurn, bitch, burn.\u201d The words echoed in the night, crackling above the flames.</p><p>Not on his watch. He threw the covers over Dee, heard her grunt as he grabbed her and tossed her over his shoulder.</p><p>Then he jumped through the flames.</p><p>The fire bit his arms and licked across the side of his face. Touching hell. The white-hot pain seared him, singeing skin and lancing flash in the seconds it took to leap through the fire.</p><p>They hit the ground. His arms were burning. The cover surrounding Dee blazed with fire. He rolled her, pounding at the fire, and the dirt flew around them.</p><p>The pain\u2014aw, fuck. He sucked in a breath, choked on smoke, and took the hot agony. Used it.</p><p>Dee shoved out of the cover. \u201cSimon, what the hell were you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking bitch,\u201d a snarl, too close.</p><p>Simon\u2019s head jerked up and he saw the vamps closing in. Four of them. The survivors from the alley.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t have let them live. But his priority had been getting Dee the hell away from that place before any of the vamps had been able to make her death permanent.</p><p>Mateo came in first. The big, thick Italian was at least a century old, and he had one serious addiction to pain\u2014giving it and hearing the screams of his prey.</p><p>He came at Dee, the claws of his left hand swinging toward her neck even as he brought up his right hand, a hand that Simon knew would be clutching a stake in that bulging fist.</p><p>\u201cNo! Dee, watch out!\u201d</p><p>She twisted, her legs still partially trapped in the smoking covers as she fought to rise.</p><p>Simon jumped in front of her, and Mateo\u2019s claws sank into his chest.</p><p>Shit. His teeth snapped together. Oh, but the bastard had been begging for a killing for far too long.</p><p>He slammed his head into the vamp\u2019s. Handy little trick he\u2019d learned from Dee.</p><p>But Mateo just laughed and that stake came up even as the claws twisted in Simon\u2019s chest.</p><p>Okay, a little help would be good right then. \u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Mateo\u2019s eyes widened. His lips opened, a high keening cry gurgling up in his throat.</p><p>Then he slumped forward.</p><p>Simon looked over the stiff man\u2019s body. Saw Dee. Saw her jerk the wooden stake from Mateo\u2019s back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I got the heart.\u201d</p><p>Uh, yeah, he bet she had.</p><p>He wrenched the vamp\u2019s hand and the claws ripped from his chest.</p><p>Pain blasted through him.</p><p>Take it. Use it.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t look down at his body. Couldn\u2019t. Not then. If he saw the damage...</p><p>\u201cWhat are they waiting on?\u201d Dee whispered.</p><p>His head shot up. The other three vampires stood less than five feet away. Their claws were out, their fangs glinting in the firelight.</p><p>He knew them all, just as he\u2019d known Mateo.</p><p>Katya, the Russian vampiress, an ex-mob boss\u2019s lover. She\u2019d gutted the fool who\u2019d loved her.</p><p>Vince, the newbie who\u2019d turned less than a year before. So much bloodlust there, burning in his eyes.</p><p>And Leo, tall and dark, standing and waiting with that damn twisted grin on his face.</p><p>Waiting, all of them, just waiting.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are you assholes?\u201d Dee demanded and damn if the woman didn\u2019t put herself in front of him.</p><p>Aw, well, wasn\u2019t that sweet. But, considering the way he was starting to waver on his feet, maybe it was necessary, too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the welcome wagon, sweetheart.\u201d From Leo. He crossed his arms, raked his gaze over her, and seemed to ignore the flames.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah? Well, here\u2019s a tip. Flowers work well. They say, \u2018Hi, here\u2019s a present.\u2019 Fire, ummm, not so much.\u201d The stake was in her hand. Dripping blood.</p><p>Leo\u2019s black stare drifted to Simon. \u201cYou sure this is the side you want to choose, buddy?\u201d</p><p>Before he could speak, Dee growled. \u201cBuddy? Hell, Simon, tell me you don\u2019t know these freaks.\u201d</p><p>A laugh from Leo. Should have been a warning. It was. \u201cI\u2019m the one who changed Simon, and Katya\u2014\u201d</p><p>Katya smiled. Don\u2019t go there. Don\u2019t!</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one who gave him his first vampire fuck.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. Like he needed this shit. \u201cLet\u2019s just kill \u2019em, okay?\u201d The talk was part of Leo\u2019s technique. The way to distract. To weaken.</p><p>Dee glanced at the redhead. \u201cHow about that.\u201d She fired Simon a hot stare. \u201cBad taste. You go for killers? Cause Katya, I\u2019ve heard about you.\u201d The Russian liked her bloodbaths, so that was no surprise.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t screw her, Dee.\u201d The bloodlust had been riding him hard when Leo had brought him in to the pack. But he\u2019d fought the dark temptation and Katya.</p><p>Katya wasn\u2019t the kind of vampire he wanted. Dee was. \u201cI\u2019m not like them.\u201d Could she see that?</p><p>Her eyes held his a second longer. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d Katya pulled two knives from the sheaths on her hips. \u201cI\u2019m going to cut your head off.\u201d Fifty years and the woman\u2019s accent still rolled Russian.</p><p>A sigh from Dee. \u201cBring it.\u201d</p><p>Katya lunged forward, knives up, fangs bared, she went in quick for a brutal attack and\u2014</p><p>Dee drove her stake into the vampiress\u2019s heart.</p><p>Katya fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. No, she hadn\u2019t just said\u2014</p><p>Vince screamed and barreled toward her. Oh, right, rumors said Vince and Katya had been an item since his change.</p><p>Dee scooped up Katya\u2019s knives. Sliced fast and deep.</p><p>Another body hit the ground. This one, um, minus a head.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Dee asked a no-longer grinning Leo. \u201cOr do you want to make things interesting and try to run?\u201d</p><p>Yes. He\u2019d been right about her. She\u2019d be more than strong enough to kick Grim\u2019s ass. The Born Master would go down.</p><p>This nightmare could end. Finally.</p><p>Sirens wailed in the distance. The cops were coming. So someone had finally noticed the giant ball of fire that was eating its way into the night?</p><p>\u201cMore will come for you.\u201d Leo spat on the ground.</p><p>One shoulder lifted. \u201cLet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the traitor\u2014you\u2019ll both die, screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, wait, let me guess.\u201d A pause as she held up her hand. \u201cBegging for death? For mercy?\u201d A hard shake of her head. \u201cNot my style. Didn\u2019t do it the first time, won\u2019t be doing it the second.\u201d</p><p>Bright red lights filtered through the smoke. The loud blare of a fire truck\u2019s horn had Leo jerking. \u201cIt\u2019s not over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you, it is.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s knees hit the dirt. \u201cDee...\u201d Too much pain. Too much. Mateo\u2019s claws had dug too deeply into his chest. He glanced down now, finally, and\u2014bastard almost took my heart.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t good. \u201cD-Dee...\u201d He tried to call her again.</p><p>But Dee, with her slightly scorched hair, shot forward and slammed her fist into Leo\u2019s face.</p><p>Then Simon slammed face first into the ground.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>He woke on a gurney. A mask covered half of his face and some crazy woman had her hand pressed hard to his heart. Simon\u2019s hands jerked, snapping through the binds that held his wrists in place.</p><p>\u201cWow, easy!\u201d That hand pressed harder. The woman stared at him, hazel eyes steady. \u201cYou go jumping up, you\u2019ll ruin all my fine work.\u201d</p><p>He heaved up anyway, and winced at the pull of\u2014stitches? Yeah, she\u2019d sewn up his chest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything for the burns.\u201d No, he didn\u2019t want to look at those, but the woman, an EMT, trailed her fingers down his arm.</p><p>Pain pulsed through him and Simon sucked in a hard breath.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at the swarming cops and the firefighters with their blasting hoses. Then her eyes came back to him. \u201cI stitched you up to stop the blood loss. I figured the burns would heal either before or on your next rising.\u201d</p><p>Rising. A vampire term. So the lady with the curly brown hair knew what he was.</p><p>\u201cI gave you blood,\u201d she said, leaning in close and pointing to a bag that dangled near his head. \u201cIt took four bags to wake you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mind giving him some room, Samuels?\u201d Dee\u2019s annoyed voice.</p><p>Simon almost smiled. Almost.</p><p>The EMT did.</p><p>\u201cJeez, I swear, if I didn\u2019t know you were screwing that charmer, I\u2019d think you were hitting on my vamp.\u201d</p><p>Her vamp? Since when?</p><p>Serious progress.</p><p>Samuels eased back and Simon got a good look at his Born.</p><p>Soot marked the right side of her face. The ends of her hair had been scorched, so the cut was even more screwed than normal. Her lips were red. Her eyes big and dark. And when those eyes landed on him, horror filled them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, hell, Simon, I didn\u2019t know it was this bad.\u201d She jumped into the back of the ambulance and hurried to his side. \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? Vamps can\u2019t jump through fire. You know the skin of a vamp burns too fast.\u201d</p><p>A weakness. One of only a few his kind possessed.</p><p>Her breath came out in a long hiss. Her fingers hovered over the red, raw flesh.</p> <p>He caught her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t look at it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze rose. \u201cYour face...\u201d</p><p>Then he remembered the flash of agony along his cheek.</p><p>But her eyes only flickered for a moment, then held his. \u201cTough guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Like this was the worst that had ever happened to him.</p> <p>Not even close.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop trying to protect me.\u201d Her fingers lifted and brushed back his hair. Simon knew his hair had to be singed like hers. That, too, would vanish with the next rising. \u201cYou know I\u2019m stronger than I look,\u201d she said.</p><p>A hell of a lot stronger. \u201cYou killed them all?\u201d A guy could hope, because those assholes were trouble.</p><p>Her hand fell away. \u201cNo, your sire\u2019s still breathing. Kinda, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He flinched. This was the last thing he wanted. \u201cWhat? Why? And where the hell is he? Humans are here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Why was everyone telling him that?</p> <p>She glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cTony has him. He\u2019s taking him to a private holding cell.\u201d Her eyes returned to his. \u201cCan\u2019t really have him blending with the general population in jail, now, can we?\u201d</p><p>Not unless they wanted a slaughter.</p><p>Someone slammed the ambulance doors. The siren shrieked on, wailing over his head. \u201cI can\u2019t go to a hospital! You know what will happen once they get a good look at me.\u201d</p><p>She crouched and locked her fingers with his as the ambulance took off. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to the hospital.\u201d Her eyes didn\u2019t waver. Didn\u2019t look at the skin on his face that he knew had to look like it had been touched by hell.</p><p>\u201cThen where?\u201d</p><p>A faint curve lifted her lips. Samuels watched them, but said nothing as she fiddled with the bags of blood, one of which still drained into Simon\u2019s veins. \u201cWe\u2019re goin\u2019 to that private holding cell. Tony still needs his proof that I\u2019m innocent, and before the sun rises, Leo will give him that proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Leo will turn on Grim?\u201d He managed a hard shake of his head. Pain knifed through his body, white-hot agony snaked up his arms, but he was getting stronger. Every second, he was getting stronger. \u201cNever gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, but you don\u2019t know just how persuasive I can be.\u201d A bigger smile, one that showed the tips of her fangs.</p> <p>He swallowed.</p><p>\u201cGrim,\u201d she repeated the name, as if tasting it. \u201cThat the name of the freak after us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d One of his names, anyway. When you lived as long as Grim had, the names changed over the centuries. \u201cHe\u2019s not an easy mark. You\u2019ve never come across another like him.\u201d He had to warn her. The fight wouldn\u2019t go down like others had in her past.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d A pause, too long, then, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been bullshitting me, and I\u2019m really a Born\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Christ,\u201d the whispered exclamation came from a suddenly wide-eyed Samuels.</p><p>\u201c\u2014then I can make that bastard Leo talk. One way or another.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she could.</p><p>He fell back against the gurney. \u201cIt\u2019s not bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d soft, thoughtful. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is.\u201d Her fingers traced up the edge of his arm, carefully skirting the bright red blisters. \u201cWhere do you fit into all of this? Their side? Mine?\u201d</p><p>His gaze darted to Samuels. He didn\u2019t know her. Didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>He caught Dee\u2019s fingers. Brought them to his lips. \u201cI\u2019m with you, babe.\u201d That simple\u2014he fit with her.</p><p>She hesitated. He knew she didn\u2019t trust him yet. But she would. Soon. Even if he had to step through fire for her once more.</p><p>Simon closed his eyes, pushed back the pain, and wondered who Grim would send after them next.</p><p>\u201cYou burned for me,\u201d she said, her voice barely reaching his sensitive ears.</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m with you.\u201d Hers. If she only knew.</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t speak again. Neither did he.</p><p>The ambulance stopped at an old factory on the outskirts of Baton Rouge. A train whistle echoed in the distance and the scent of rain carried on the wind.</p><p>When Simon climbed out of the ambulance, Dee tried really, really hard not to wince. The wounds were healing, almost right before her eyes, but, oh, damn, they were vicious.</p><p>And the man was standing. No, walking, as if he hadn\u2019t just been comatose, with second-degree burns covering a good portion of his body.</p><p>Vampires.</p><p>He saved me. Again.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d Tony\u2019s voice. Demanding and a little nervous. Since he was human, he should be nervous. Very nervous.</p><p>She walked toward him, with Simon at her side.</p><p>I\u2019m with you, babe.</p><p>If only things were that simple. If only she didn\u2019t think the man still had secrets that could come back to bite.</p><p>Tony shoved open the doors to the factory. Rats squeaked and Dee was pretty sure about six roaches ran over her feet.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>\u201cGot him chained in there.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward a room on the left. \u201cHe\u2019s waking up, and even the blood loss isn\u2019t going to slow him down for long.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. She\u2019d managed to get some good swipes in before the cops pulled up, and she\u2019d managed to knock out Leo just in time. She\u2019d been the only one left conscious when the uniforms swarmed with their guns, so she\u2019d been able to make some bullshit explanations, fast.</p><p>Lucky for her, Tony had been on the scene, barking orders and getting the cops he trusted\u2014two charmers\u2014to take the bleeding Leo into custody.</p><p>She\u2019d leaned in close to Tony at that scene. Too many ears had been there, so she\u2019d had to be careful, and she\u2019d told him, simply, \u201cMy proof.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done the rest. Cleared the area. Taken Leo to the new \u201cinterrogation\u201d room that had been cleared for supernaturals. Made sure that Samuels was there to treat Simon.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>Tony eyed him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you took up with a vampire. I mean, seriously, Dee, a bloodsucker? Come on, I thought you had standards. You know that you and I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her stare shut him up. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with, okay? I want my name cleared and I want to find out if more jerkoffs are gonna be coming to attack.\u201d He didn\u2019t know. Tony thought she\u2019d just had one really kick-ass fighting night because she\u2019d had those before.</p><p>You were getting stronger.</p><p>What would Tony do, when he saw what she\u2019d become?</p><p>Growling, she shoved by him and went after her prey.</p><p>Leo stood in the middle of the room, his arms lifted and held in thick chains so that he dangled a good foot off the ground. The chains were hooked up to some kind of pulley, and one of the charmers stood near the master machine, sweat coating his brow.</p><p>\u201cBitch.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted as she faced Leo. \u201cAw, you\u2019re trying to sweet-talk me.\u201d</p><p>He snarled and tried to lunge for her.</p><p>Stupid move. Even he wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to break those chains.</p><p>He spun a bit, looking like a fish on two big hooks.</p><p>Leo\u2019s teeth snapped together. \u201cYou should have killed me. I\u2019m gonna get free\u2014gonna come after you! You should have killed me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll die.\u201d From Simon. Hard. Cold. Ice.</p><p>\u201cYou. You fucking bastard! You think you found your damn golden ticket, don\u2019t you? Think you can get away just because you\u2019re screwing the new queen bitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen bitch?\u201d Tony asked softly. \u201cThat\u2019s...ah...different for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bloodlust will get her,\u201d Leo screamed. \u201cOnly a matter of time, then she\u2019ll fuck like crazy and she\u2019ll drink from any fool she wants. Drink, drain, and fuck\u2014and you\u2019ll be just as screwed as before!\u201d</p><p>Dee flew at him. Not deliberate. Not really. She\u2019d just seen the stiffening of Tony\u2019s body and\u2014</p><p>And, shit.</p><p>She launched at the vampire and slashed her claws down his chest. He howled and the blood flowed.</p><p>And the scent tempted.</p><p>Dee began to shake.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Dee? Dee, you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned toward Tony and knew that her fangs were out. Fangs, claws. Bloodlust.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Tony scrambled for his gun.</p><p>Simon punched him, a driving, brutal punch right in the jaw. Tony staggered back, hit the wall, then the ground.</p><p>Snick.</p><p>The two charmers had their weapons out and aimed.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t do you any good,\u201d Simon told them, coming forward and\u2014what? The guy was blocking her. Shielding her. Again. Kind of sweet. Kind of\u2014\u201cYou know bullets won\u2019t stop us.\u201d</p><p>No, but Dee wasn\u2019t exactly excited about testing that idea. She\u2019d been shot as a human, could still remember the fiery blast, and didn\u2019t want to go through that again, thank you very much. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about firing at me,\u201d she told the charmers, aware of Leo laughing softly behind her. Laughing\u2014freak.</p><p>\u201cHold your fire.\u201d Tony rose slowly, rubbing his jaw. His gaze traveled over her. \u201cDee?\u201d His dark eyes snapped to Simon and fury hardened his face. \u201cYou did this to her.\u201d He had his gun out and aimed in an instant.</p><p>Simon, bastard, spread his arms wide as if to say, yeah, I can take it, so\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot to her!\u201d Tony roared.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Dee grabbed Simon\u2019s arm and shoved him.</p><p>The bullet tore into her shoulder.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. Still hurt like a bi\u2014</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes cracked open. Tony ran toward her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon caught him, lifted him by the throat. \u201cYou. Never. Shoot. Her.\u201d</p><p>Um, he just did.</p><p>\u201cI was aiming for you, asshole!\u201d</p><p>More wild, loud laughter from Leo.</p><p>Screw this. \u201cLower the bastard,\u201d she ordered. The charmer near the switch hesitated. \u201cLower him.\u201d</p><p>A choked gasp. Tony\u2019s face began to purple and the whir of the pulley filled the room.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d Dee kept her voice soft. Too much tension. Too much rage. Simon walked a fine edge, and one push...\u201cSimon, I want you to let him go.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the cop.</p><p>Tony heaved, trying to suck in air.</p><p>Dee licked her lips and fought to ignore the throbbing in her shoulder. The bullet had gone straight through, she\u2019d heard it clang against one of the metal pipes behind her. At least she didn\u2019t have to worry about digging the thing out.</p><p>Just the blood loss. She had to stop that.</p><p>And she had to forget the pain. If Simon could stand there, with the hell he had to be feeling, then, somehow, so could she.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice, hoarse. Sad.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deal with him then.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll all turn from you now,\u201d Leo taunted. She faced him. His feet touched the ground. \u201cEvery one you care about\u2014they\u2019ll turn away. They\u2019ll see what you are, and they\u2019ll come to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the one hunted now. You\u2019ll be the one who\u2019s scared and desperate and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. Smiled a bit. Then sank her teeth into his throat.</p><p>There was an instant of revulsion. Of horror. Of what-the-hell-am-I-doing.</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t want his blood. Not like she\u2019d wanted Simon\u2019s. Didn\u2019t want his taste in her mouth.</p><p>She\u2019d longed for Simon. No revulsion. No fear. She\u2019d been desperate to take from him.</p><p>This\u2014this was just business.</p><p>And the woman inside, the woman who\u2019d feared and hated vampires for so long, she shuddered and a scream rose in her throat.</p><p>Can\u2019t do this. Can\u2019t live like this. No. No.</p><p>Images came to her then. Flashing one right after the other.</p><p>Leo, covered in blood and grime, standing on an old battlefield. A sword lay cradled in his hands. The dead surrounded him and a wild smile stretched his face.</p><p>Dee forced herself to take more. Keep. It. Down.</p><p>Leo, drinking a woman dry as she screamed and screamed\u2014a woman in a long, flowing white dress, with her hair so long and loose around them. A tall man with bright blond hair, braided on the sides, watched, a smile on his lips. \u201cThe first blood taste is always the sweetest.\u201d</p><p>Leo lifted his head.</p><p>\u201cWant more?\u201d the blond man asked.</p><p>A quick nod, but a tear leaked down Leo\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your wife doesn\u2019t even feel the pain now.\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>Madness.</p><p>Rage.</p><p>Pain.</p><p>She ripped her mouth away from his flesh. Her lips were wet. Blood trickled down Leo\u2019s neck. His eyes had gone glassy and the guy had stopped laughing. Finally.</p><p>\u201cThe voice is quiet...\u201d Leo spoke, a whisper.</p><p>Okay, so he seemed to be calming down, always a nice bonus and\u2014</p><p>He lunged forward and sank his teeth into her shoulder. Dee howled and shoved him back. He shot away from her, but the chains groaned and jerked him up short.</p><p>Leo licked his lips. \u201cGot you.\u201d</p><p>Her teeth snapped together. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>A shake of his dark head. \u201cI-I can remember her...now.\u201d</p><p>Dee rubbed her throbbing shoulder, then she punched him, because that shit hurt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDee.\u201d Simon\u2019s voice. Steady and too controlled. Where was her big, bad protector when she\u2019d actually needed his butt? She fired a glare at him, then nearly winced. Still damaged.</p><p>\u201cDee, he needed your blood, just like I did.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Tony shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a vampire, you just tried to kill me, and I\u2019m having one real pisser of a night.\u201d Good sum-up. Dee narrowed her eyes on Leo. \u201cAnd if you come at me again, I\u2019ll take your head.\u201d</p><p>A tear leaked from his left eye. \u201cI can see my Sonja again.\u201d</p><p>Uh, great.</p><p>\u201cYour bite and blood diluted Grim\u2019s control,\u201d Simon said. \u201cAsk him now, he\u2019ll tell you everything you want to know.\u201d</p> <p>Really? That easy? Well, not really easy considering she\u2019d had to bleed for her answers. \u201cAre you one of Grim\u2019s Taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed me.\u201d Whispered. \u201cBound by his blood.\u201d</p><p>Vampires. Couldn\u2019t they ever just say things simply? \u201cOkay, you\u2019re one of his goons. Were you in on the setup? Did you kill that woman and leave me in her blood?\u201d</p><p>His eyes squeezed shut, then flew open. Midnight black. \u201cShe was easy to kill. She thought I\u2019d give her forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Forever in a pine box somewhere.</p><p>\u201cIt was quick.\u201d A shrug. \u201cShe didn\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure there were plenty more who suffered over the years because of you.\u201d</p><p>His lips trembled. \u201cNot what I wanted. Never wanted.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cListen, buddy, you were the one killing. The one biting and draining\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201d His gaze darted to Simon. \u201cYou know what it\u2019s like. When he gets inside...\u201d</p><p>He. Grim. The big badass that Simon had warned her about.</p><p>\u201cHe takes control,\u201d Leo said, giving a slow shake of his head. \u201cHis needs became mine. You have no idea how strong he can be.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps shuffled closer behind her. \u201cTell me this freak Grim isn\u2019t in my town.\u201d Tony\u2019s voice cracked a bit. Fear would do that to a guy.</p><p>Leo didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>Dee grabbed his bloody shirt front. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed on her. \u201cFled. Knows what you will do.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so now his voice was getting a bit sing-songy. Was she doing that? Or was it his blood loss? Maybe both.</p><p>\u201cUh, what\u2019s she gonna do?\u201d Tony asked.</p><p>Simon and Leo answered in unison. \u201cKill him.\u201d</p><p>Simon caught her hand. \u201cOr at least, I hope to hell that she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not,\u201d Leo breathed, staring straight at her with his hunting black eyes, \u201cthen he\u2019ll tear you apart, Born. Rip your world away and tear you apart.\u201d</p><p>Ah, nice visual.</p><p>A shrill beep cut through the air. Tony swore and jerked out his phone. Leo sagged back against his chains. \u201cDeath,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>This was the tough SOB who\u2019d nearly taken her out earlier? He looked...beaten.</p><p>No, broken.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your blood,\u201d Simon said, his voice carrying only to her ears. \u201cIt\u2019s diluting Grim\u2019s hold on him, making him remember who he was and everything he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Tony let out a hard expulsion of air. \u201cWhat? When? Christ. How many dead?\u201d</p><p>Dee ran a hand over her face. \u201cIf Grim has this much power, why weren\u2019t you like\u201d\u2014she shot her thumb toward the trembling vampire\u2014\u201chim?\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s face had begun to heal. The blisters were starting to vanish, the skin lightening to pink instead of the fiery red. \u201cGrim didn\u2019t change me directly. Leo did. So the bond was weaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar, liar...\u201d A weak chant from Leo. \u201cI know what you did, Simon. I know, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>She jerked at Tony\u2019s snapped call. She eased away from Leo. He looked like he was down for the count, but she didn\u2019t trust him.</p><p>Tony lifted a hand, reaching for her. Then he hesitated.</p><p>Dee\u2019s chin lifted. I\u2019m still the same.</p><p>Maybe. She hoped.</p><p>Tony\u2019s hand shot out and he snagged her wrist.</p><p>A growl built in Simon\u2019s throat.</p><p>Tony didn\u2019t glance his way. \u201cThere\u2019s been an attack.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, sadly, in this city, someone was attacked every day.</p><p>\u201cLess than half an hour ago, vampires took out two hunters at Night Watch and they killed one of the assistants, a woman named Grace.\u201d</p><p>Her face iced. \u201cWhat?\u201d Not Night Watch. No one would dare to go into headquarters and attack the hunters there.</p><p>Not unless they wanted hell on their trail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fingers clamped tighter around her flesh. \u201cI can\u2019t have you at the scene. Not...with the way you are.\u201d</p><p>Fangs and claws. Bloodlust. Her jaw locked. \u201cWho\u2014who are the hunters?\u201d Not Jude. Not Zane. No, not them, please.</p><p>\u201cSpade and Gomez.\u201d</p><p>Bile rose. The taste of blood\u2014way too strong in her mouth. Monster. I\u2019ve become just like them.</p><p>\u201cSpade was DOA, his throat had been ripped open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d A snarl from Simon and suddenly he was there, wrapping his uninjured arm around her, holding her close.</p><p>\u201cGomez is en route to the hospital, but he\u2019s bad. Real bad.\u201d Tony inhaled. His fingers brushed over her wrist, over the pulse that raced too fast. \u201cLooks like the vamps jumped them all right after they left Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>There would have been too many hunters inside. The vamps wouldn\u2019t have been stupid enough to risk a fight like that. So they\u2019d hid in the shadows. Struck in a weak moment.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Simon told her, voice roughening. But even before Tony\u2019s lips parted, she knew he\u2019d prove Simon\u2019s words a lie.</p><p>\u201cThey left Gomez alive so that he could deliver a message.\u201d</p><p>She kept her chin up. Kept her shoulders back.</p><p>Leo, crazy screwed-up bastard, started to laugh again. So much for her blood helping him. \u201cWhat message?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tony\u2019s lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re next, baby. The blood will keep pouring in the streets, and they\u2019re coming after you.\u201d</p><p>She took the blow. Took it, even as her stare darted to Simon\u2019s tense face. \u201cThey knew the first hit wasn\u2019t successful.\u201d Knew she\u2019d still been living while the vamps hit the ground. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>His fangs were out. \u201cBecause word travels fast in this town and his men\u2014\u201d He spared a hard glance at Tony. \u201cKnow more about this city than he thinks.\u201d</p><p>A leak. No, a spy. One who reported to Grim\u2019s vampires.</p><p>One who wanted that sweet promise of immortality?</p><p>Why did everyone want to live forever?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the scene,\u201d Tony said, \u201cand I\u2019ll see if I can figure out just what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>Easy. A Born Master and his gang of bloodsuckers. Guys who liked to drink, drain, and torture for fun.</p><p>\u201cHarper, Post,\u201d he fired at the two charmers. \u201cWatch this freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun, little vampire,\u201d Leo murmured. \u201cRun fast. Grim\u2019s coming for you, and he won\u2019t stop until he has your head.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at the prick.</p><p>But found sadness in his eyes. Gray eyes now, not black. \u201cEven being Born won\u2019t save you,\u201d he told her. \u201cRun, while you can.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>They needed sanctuary, and they needed it fast.</p><p>Simon and Dee ran down the deserted streets in the heart of the city. Pink strands of light crept across the sky. Dawn, bitch that she was, would be there soon.</p><p>He needed to crash. Needed the healing sleep that would come.</p><p>So did Dee. And with her fresh wound, she\u2019d need blood. Mine.</p><p>The cop bastard had gone off to investigate the attack, ordering them to stay away.</p><p>Not much choice. For now.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Dee said, and Simon stopped in front of an all-too familiar bar. No, no way were they going to seek shelter from\u2014</p><p>The glass doors swung open. \u201cDee?\u201d A woman with long, pale blond hair stood just inside. Her eyes glittered, and her hands, bare and small, fluttered in the air. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d come to me.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2014the witch\u2014lifted her eyes and met his stare. \u201cAnd when I\u2019d be seeing you again, Chase.\u201d</p><p>Hell. He had such shitty luck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even want to know right now,\u201d Dee muttered and shoved past Catalina. \u201cCat, I\u2019m calling in my favor. I need a roof, a bed, and protection for the day.\u201d</p><p>Catalina smiled at Simon and motioned for him to enter the bar. \u201cI see you found your key, and you thought I was just bullshitting you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019ll be all that you need.</p><p>But there\u2019s a price for her. One you may not want to pay.</p><p>He\u2019d agreed to pay everything. To trade everything, for the chance to have full control of his soul once more.</p><p>And for revenge. Sweet, sweet revenge.</p><p>Catalina closed the door behind them. She flipped the lock, then whispered a fast spell. \u201cOne day,\u201d she said, turning back to face them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in the middle of your war.\u201d</p><p>A broken laugh slipped past Dee\u2019s lips. \u201cA war? Is that what I\u2019m in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been in a war for years.\u201d Sad. \u201cYou just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did?\u201d Snapped fast. \u201cThanks a hell of a lot for telling me, Cat.\u201d</p><p>The witch\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cSome things you weren\u2019t ready to know.\u201d She swallowed, then pointed to the back of her empty bar, to the door with the gold EMPLOYEES ONLY sign. \u201cTake the second room at the top of the stairs. Chase can have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll stay with me.\u201d Flat.</p><p>Simon\u2019s brows shot up.</p><p>\u201cAh, like that, hmm? Fair enough.\u201d Catalina tossed him a smile, one brittle around the edges. \u201cTold you what would happen, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d Not flat now, furious. Dee\u2019s hands slapped down on the bar. \u201cI trusted you, Catalina. Watched your back for years. I never came in your bar. I respected your surface rules, never tried to push your spell\u2014\u201d</p><p>The spell that made all the humans walk right past Delaney\u2019s. The spell that only let supernaturals gain entrance to the bar.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but you and me\u2014I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d Soft.</p><p>Simon knew better than to get between two fighting women.</p><p>\u201cFriends don\u2019t keep secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to know this.\u201d Catalina\u2019s long hair floated behind her as she walked around the bar, poured a whiskey, and drank it in two gulps. \u201cWhen I scryed and found out\u2014you didn\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy choice.\u201d Dee threw this over her shoulder as she marched toward the marked door. \u201cYou took it away.\u201d</p><p>Catalina\u2019s fingers clenched around the glass. Dee shoved open the door. Simon followed, slower.</p><p>Glass shattered. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it away.\u201d He caught the whisper of the witch\u2019s voice. \u201cI gave him to you, and I gave you a fighting chance.\u201d</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t glance back. Maybe she heard the witch. Maybe she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Right then, he guessed it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She awoke to hands on her flesh. Slow, stroking fingers that pushed up her shirt, skated over her stomach. Gentle. So gentle.</p><p>Her lashes lifted. Darkness surrounded her, but she could see so well.</p><p>See him.</p><p>Healed now. Not even a scar to mar his face or the bare flesh of his arms. He leaned over her, eyes intent, fangs gleaming.</p><p>Dee reached up and touched his chest. \u201cI dreamed about you.\u201d Yeah, vampires dreamed. Or, in her case, had nightmares.</p><p>The flames, burning Simon\u2019s flesh. Killing him.</p><p>He\u2019d walked through the fire for her. Whatever agenda the guy was working, he\u2019d sacrificed for her, again.</p><p>His gaze held hers. His fingers were a warm weight on her flesh. No aches troubled her body. No pains. Healed, just as he was.</p><p>But...hungry.</p><p>The bloodlust, rising again.</p><p>She\u2019ll drink from any fool she wants. Drink, drain, and fuck\u2014and you\u2019ll be just as screwed as before.</p><p>No, Leo had been wrong about her. She would have control and she would have Simon. \u201cStop risking death for me,\u201d she whispered and the words stuck in her throat.</p><p>A sad smile twisted his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? I\u2019d risk any damn thing for you.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Still gentle. Still soft.</p><p>And the hunger grew.</p><p>Her hands clamped around his shoulders and she pulled him closer.</p><p>His tongue thrust into her mouth. She moaned, eager, and arched toward him.</p><p>Taste.</p><p>His hands eased up, sliding under the shirt that still covered her breasts. His fingers skimmed over her bra, over the nipples that were pebbled and hard, thrusting up against the cotton.</p><p>She could smell her own need in the air. Feel him all around her.</p><p>Simon\u2019s head lifted. \u201cI want your throat.\u201d</p><p>Drink.</p><p>Asking, not taking.

Her nails dug into his skin. \u201cSimon!\u201d A bolt of pleasure shot straight to her core. Her belly quivered, her knees shook, and she wanted.</p> <p>Dee\u2019s hands pushed between them. Fumbled with the snap of his jeans.</p><p>Dee wanted his flesh beneath her fingers. She needed more. So much more.</p><p>Her hands shoved inside and she found his cock. Fully erect, thick, so hot to the touch.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d she managed to gasp, \u201cInside, Simon, I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>His tongue swiped over her neck and he lifted his head. \u201cTake from me.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips parted and her tongue pressed against a fang. Sweet blood.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>She rose, and her hands pressed him back against the mattress. He went willingly, letting her have the control she needed then.</p><p>Power.</p><p>No, not about power.</p><p>The hunger. The lust.</p> <p>Craving.</p><p>She didn\u2019t take his neck, though he offered his throat to her. Dee yanked off her shirt. Tossed her bra aside, then straddled him, her legs resting over his powerful thighs.</p><p>Her fingers trailed down his chest and she leaned forward. A dull thudding filled her ears. Her heartbeat? His? Her mouth pressed against his flesh. Not in a bite. A kiss.</p><p>Pleasure.</p><p>She closed her lips around his nipple. Swirled her tongue over the hard nub. His cock pushed up between her thighs, rubbing at the crotch of her jeans, and the pressure had her rocking back and forth.</p><p>More.</p><p>\u201cTake, Dee. Take from me.\u201d Guttural. A demand.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t in control anymore.</p> <p>Her tongue swiped over him and she let him feel the press of her teeth. Not a bite. Not yet.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d beg for that.</p><p>His hands clamped over her hips and he ground her against his cock. Oh, damn, but that was good. Just not\u2014</p><p>Enough. Not even close.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play.\u201d An order given as her fingers crept down the hard plane of stomach. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to push me, you don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>She looked up at that and knew her eyes would be black. \u201cI want everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll get it,\u201d a harsh whisper. \u201cHope you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>So did she.</p><p>But she had the power, she\u2019d be in control.</p><p>Her teeth sank into his chest. His growl filled her ears even as the hot warmth of his blood slipped over her tongue.</p><p>Life.</p><p>Power. So much power.</p><p>Her hips lifted and her fingers curled around his cock. She pumped him, once, twice, felt his length swell even more in her grasp. Felt\u2014</p><p>Dee stood in an alley. One hand on her hip. A vampire hissed at her, and that preppy fool holding the vamp blinked his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust how long do you think it\u2019s gonna take me to shove this into your heart? A minute? Less?\u201d</p><p>She pulled back from him. Her memory, seen from his eyes. No, his memory. \u201cSimon, why do I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d he gritted. \u201cDitch the jeans or I\u2019ll rip them off.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any backup clothes then and\u2014</p><p>\u201cFucking rip them off.\u201d</p><p>Dee rolled off him. She shimmied out of her jeans and panties even as she licked her lips and tasted him.</p><p>His hands, warm, strong, closed around her thighs. He pushed her legs apart and his breath blew against her damp curls.</p><p>\u201cYour smell.\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cI could devour you.\u201d</p><p>Um, now, since he was a vamp that could\u2014Oh, damn.</p><p>His mouth took her sex. Lips, tongue. Tasting, claiming. Her hands fisted in the sheets. Dee heard a hard rip. Didn\u2019t care.</p><p>That mouth.</p><p>His tongue swiped over her clit and Dee nearly came off the bed. She squirmed, trying to get away, no, get closer, but his hold stayed tight and strong.</p><p>And he took. His tongue drove into her sex.</p><p>She climaxed against his mouth. A long, hard wave that trembled through her body.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t stop. That tongue tasted and licked and stroked and Dee realized she was calling his name.</p><p>Nearly freaking begging. Her.</p><p>She swallowed and her nails dug into his back. \u201cSimon!\u201d Demand there.</p><p>Command.</p><p>One more swipe of that tongue. Her calves stiffened. Oh, sweet hell.</p><p>Then he rose above her. Positioned his cock and drove into her.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Her legs clamped around him and when he began to thrust and retreat, she shoved right back at him. Harder. Harder.</p><p>The bed banged against the wall. Simon\u2019s gaze burned hers. So much fire there. So much need.</p><p>He lifted her hips higher, plunged deeper even as his fingers bit into her flesh.</p><p>Marking her.</p><p>She\u2019d marked him.</p><p>Another climax bore down on her. Her sex trembled, tightened, and she tossed back her head.</p><p>Simon came, pouring into her.</p><p>She watched him. Watched the pleasure, the near-pain of it sweeping over his face.</p><p>Then she came, pulsing, throbbing, breaking, beneath him.</p><p>Pleasure. So much pleasure.</p><p>Enough to nearly die from.</p><p>Good thing they were both already dead.</p><p>Zane Wynter didn\u2019t glance to the left when he exited the Night Watch building. He didn\u2019t need to look to know that blood still stained the sidewalk.</p><p>The blood of hunters.</p><p>The scent teased his nose and a growl built in his throat.</p><p>Vampires. Hitting here.</p><p>Come and get me.</p><p>The stakes he\u2019d taken from Dee\u2019s stash were slung in a pack that dangled from one shoulder. He hadn\u2019t needed to sharpen them. Dee always kept her babies in such fine form.</p><p>He\u2019d find the assholes, all right.</p><p>An eye for an eye. He\u2019d always thought that way.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d</p><p>He swore at the call. Not one from another Night Watch hunter, but from the cop he sometimes called friend.</p><p>A mistake that. Taking humans for friends just led to trouble.</p><p>Tony hurried to his side. The guy\u2019s badge flashed. It hung from Tony\u2019s hip. All official-looking. The cop had to be on the clock.</p><p>Or hunting, just like he was. Pity they didn\u2019t always play by the same rules.</p><p>\u201cI need to find Dee,\u201d Tony said the minute he reached him.</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t stiffen. Just stared back at him. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Dee. Pak hadn\u2019t called him in when she\u2019d been hurt. Hadn\u2019t told him about what happened, not until the bastard had given Dee a running start.</p><p>Pak had always had a soft spot for her. He wouldn\u2019t do what needed to be done. The guy just didn\u2019t understand...</p><p>\u201cI\u2014if something ever happens, you\u2019ll come for me, won\u2019t you, Zane?\u201d He could see her so clearly. One hand tight around a stake as she stared down at the still body of a teen, a young girl with blond hair and blood all around her. A girl who\u2019d gone on a killing spree and attacked her two younger sisters. \u201cI\u2019d never want to be like them.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s nightmare. One some bastard had made come true.</p><p>Pak said she\u2019d adjusted. That she\u2019d maintained control. And that she had a pack of vampires after her ass.</p><p>But could any vampire maintain real control? What happened when the bloodlust grew too strong? What happened when Dee turned on an innocent?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come for me, won\u2019t you, Zane?\u201d</p><p>Good thing they\u2019d never fucked. If they had, knowing what was to come would have made the job so much harder.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Tony grabbed him and shoved Zane back against the side of the building. The bricks bit through his shirt. \u201cI need to find her!\u201d</p><p>Tony had slept with her. There was pain there. In his eyes. On his face. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen her.\u201d Truth. Though he had a good idea where to start looking.</p><p>Dee would be licking her wounds. She\u2019d need shelter. Someone she could trust.</p><p>Mistake.</p><p>Tony\u2019s face mottled. The guy had always been so in control. So restrained. One of the reasons why he and Dee hadn\u2019t lasted.</p><p>She\u2019d needed a guy who didn\u2019t understand control.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard Leo bit his own wrists open and the fucking guards didn\u2019t check on him. He was in a padded cell, they thought he was safe. The vamp bled out, bled out!\u201d</p><p>Zane blinked at that. Yeah, vamps could die from blood loss, but he\u2019d never heard of a vamp taking his own life that way.</p><p>You had to want death pretty badly to take that route.</p><p>\u201cLast night, he said some SOB named Grim was after Dee. She needs help. I\u2019ve got to find her, help her\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that, Zane knocked the cop back. Tony staggered, nearly fell to the cement. \u201cAnd how are you gonna help her?\u201d He demanded. \u201cOffer to be her snack?\u201d</p><p>A muscle flexed along Tony\u2019s jaw. \u201cShe\u2019s not like that. She wasn\u2019t crazy, she was just...Dee.\u201d Sadness again.</p><p>Fucking shame.</p><p>Tony\u2019s chin jerked up. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to wind up like Gomez or Grace. I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. Okay, yeah, this was one of those moments in life that sucked. \u201cGrace was working with the vamps. She lured the hunters out, got them to lower their guards.\u201d Then served them right up to the vampires.</p><p>A woman he\u2019d known for years. He\u2019d laughed with her. Talked with her about her dumbass dog. Stolen her coffee more days than he could count.</p><p>And she\u2019d set them up.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, man, she was a vic, same as the others, Grace wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hacked into her hard drive today. Did interviews with family, friends, and we got her doctor to talk.\u201d Patient confidentiality, his ass. That old rule stopped the moment the patient got zipped up in a body bag. \u201cShe was dying. Cancer. She had about six months left to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know humans,\u201d Zane said softly, watching the cop carefully. \u201cOnce the clock starts running out, they get desperate. They\u2019ll try anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell!\u201d His throat worked. \u201cGrace saw Dee.\u201d He ran his hands over his face. \u201cShe was here. She saw Dee change, survive\u2014live.\u201d</p><p>Vampire. \u201cGuess it was too much temptation for her. The bastards sent her an e-mail. Told her to bring a trade outside to them. The vamps promised her a new life.\u201d</p><p>But just gave her death.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going after Dee. You know they won\u2019t stop until she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>No, they wouldn\u2019t. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to step back, Tony. You\u2019re not strong enough to handle the hell that\u2019s coming.\u201d Not with a Born Master playing in the game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving her alone.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up. \u201cWho says she\u2019s alone? Word I have is that Dee\u2019s got a new lover, a vamp who risked the fire for her.\u201d Interesting. In his experience, vamps really didn\u2019t like to burn.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust that bastard.\u201d</p><p>Neither did he. \u201cYou think he\u2019s setting her up to die?\u201d Grim. That was the Born\u2019s name. Old as frigging dirt. And the older the vamps were, the stronger they were and the harder to kill.</p><p>Dee was a newbie. So easy for her to die.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tony gritted out. \u201cI think he\u2019s setting her up to kill for him.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps shuffled and a woman with short, red hair appeared, rounding the corner. She drew up when she saw them, her eyes widening.</p><p>The scent of smoke teased Zane\u2019s nose.</p><p>She hurried past them, and he caught a whiff of...blood?</p><p>Hell of a combination.</p><p>\u201cZane. Shit man, forget about your dick right now, okay?\u201d</p><p>He yanked his gaze off the woman\u2019s ass and zeroed his stare back on Tony. \u201cGo home. Leave Dee to me.\u201d</p><p>But the cop\u2019s head started shaking, hard. \u201cI\u2019m not abandoning her, I\u2019m not just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to be her prey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, she\u2019s not like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery vamp is \u2018like that\u2019 when they get hungry enough.\u201d He jerked his thumb over his shoulder. \u201cYou want to find her? Go inside and talk to Pak. You know that guy always has info about this city.\u201d</p><p>Tony\u2019s dark stare measured him. \u201cAnd where the hell are you going?\u201d</p><p>He brushed by him. Didn\u2019t meet his stare. \u201cHunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you hunting?\u201d</p><p>Zane ignored the question and kicked up the stand on his new motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cWho are you hunting?\u201d</p><p>A flick of his fingers, a press of his foot, and the engine roared to life.</p><p>\u201cNot her, you got me? Not. Her!\u201d</p><p>The motorcycle shot away from the corner, racing right in front of an old, gray truck.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your change.\u201d They probably didn\u2019t have time for this. She should be getting dressed. Finding weapons. Figuring out what the hell they should do next.</p><p>But she needed to know more about Simon. Wanted to know and she didn\u2019t want the blood link to tell her. She wanted him to talk. \u201cYour parents, the vampires attacked them.\u201d Killed them. Just like they\u2019d killed her family. \u201cIs that when you changed? Did they trans\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from her.</p><p>A chill rose on her flesh. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed, giving her a view of his strong, powerful back. \u201cDon\u2019t make me into something I\u2019m not, babe.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the covers up to her chest and waited.</p><p>\u201cI was already a vampire before my parents were killed. I\u2019d been a vamp for a year before the attack.\u201d He glanced back at her. \u201cYou thought I was forced to turn?\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>His lips twisted. \u201cNo. I was one of the ones who chose to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The word came out husky, rough. To choose to be a vamp, to drink blood, to kill?</p><p>He rose, gave her a fine view of his ass and stalked to the jeans they\u2019d tossed aside at some point. He yanked them up. \u201cI was working in the Middle East. The shittiest and hottest place the world ever forgot.\u201d Simon turned toward her. \u201cOne night, my men were ambushed. Cut down in the road by bullets and bombs.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee didn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThey died around me, their screams in my ears.\u201d His fingers brushed over his stomach. \u201cI bled out on the ground. My leg was shot to hell. My chest torn open. Every breath I took tasted of fire, and I knew, I knew I\u2019d wouldn\u2019t make it off that road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes darkened to black. \u201cA man came out of the rubble. He walked straight to me. Asked me if I wanted to live or die.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d chosen to live, as a vampire. Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cI heard the thump of a helicopter\u2019s blades then. Whirring in the air. They were coming to help us, but I was the only man still living.\u201d</p><p>So he could have made it without the change? He could have kept being human?</p><p>\u201cI knew about the Other.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cI\u2019d been to so many places, seen things people wanted to pretend didn\u2019t exist. War brings out the monsters, Dee. It brings them out like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d believe almost anything.\u201d Sad and true.</p><p>\u201cI knew looking up at him\u2014I could see his fangs, see his eyes changing. I knew what he was, and I knew I wanted to be like him.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cThe medics could have tried patching me up. Could have saved my ass\u2014and maybe, maybe I would have pulled through. But my job was to fight. I had to be strong. He could make me strong. Stronger than I\u2019d ever been, and I\u2019d never have to worry about choking on my own blood as bullets and hellfire took me down on a dirty road ever again.\u201d</p><p>No, he\u2019d just have to worry about getting his head chopped off and having a wooden stake driven through his beating heart.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, do you?\u201d His voice was grim. \u201cVampires are always young, always strong. That\u2019s a deal a man dying on a battlefield isn\u2019t gonna refuse. I wanted the bite. I would have done just about anything to keep living right then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the helicopter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted the bite,\u201d he said again. \u201cI wanted forever.\u201d His shoulders lifted, fell. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie to you. Not gonna say the change was forced on me. I chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you choose the same thing now?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t choose this, I didn\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting out is easy, Dee. Bleed out. Let the fire take you. Every single moment you live, you\u2019re choosing.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was right. She was choosing this life because for her, there was no alternative. \u201cI\u2019m not killing myself. That\u2019s not me.\u201d Too easy. Fight. Survive. Pak had taught her that. You survived, no matter what. You lived.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, either.\u201d Soft. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2014didn\u2019t understand about the Borns when I was brought over. After the exchange, I woke up, strong, thirsty, so thirsty, and I didn\u2019t even feel the Born\u2019s power at first.\u201d</p> <p>Ah, key phrase there. At first.</p><p>\u201cThen the prick started trying to worm his way into my mind.\u201d His chin lifted. \u201cThat link gets weaker the farther you are from the Born, so my tactic was to stay as far away from Grim as I could.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers knotted around the sheets. \u201cGuess that tactic didn\u2019t work so well, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew what I was doing. Sometimes, it seems like Grim knows everything.\u201d He exhaled heavily. \u201cTo teach me a lesson, he went after my family. They didn\u2019t know. They had no idea what I\u2019d become and when the vampires came for them...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cThey suffered. Grim and Leo made sure of it. All so they could bring \u2018my ass in line.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201cI buried them, and I heard Grim\u2019s call in my head every fucking second.\u201d He unballed his fists, stared down at his palms. \u201cHe wanted me to come to him. Wanted me to kill. Wanted me to be part of his twisted vampire family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe alpha,\u201d she managed. \u201cControlling his pack.\u201d And sensing a challenge from within. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cMade a deal with the devil.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good. Dee rose, fumbled with her clothes, and managed to dress.</p><p>The silence in the room thickened.</p><p>She shoved on her shoes.</p><p>Simon just stood there, bare feet, bare chest. Watching her.</p><p>Dressed, armored, she finally asked, \u201cWhat kind of deal?\u201d No, not for me. Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019re\u2014</p><p>\u201cI found a warlock in Vegas. Asshole named Skye. He has magic\u2014dark magic\u2014and he used it on me, for a price.\u201d</p><p>Dee licked her lips. His gaze darted to her mouth. \u201cWhat price?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bled for him. Thirty days straight. Skye drained me nearly to death before each sunrise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d Blood loss like that\u2014</p><p>\u201cIn return, he put a spell shield in place for me. One strong enough to weaken Grim\u2019s call. Not block it completely, but to mute it so I could turn away from the Born.\u201d He stalked toward her. Lifted his hand and ran his fingers down her cheek. \u201cAnd find you.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers lifted and curled around his wrist. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me all this at the beginning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you would have run from me. No.\u201d A slow shake of his head. \u201cYou would have tried to kill me, and I needed you too much to have you turn away. You\u2019re my shot at freedom, Dee. Real freedom. This shield won\u2019t last forever. I\u2019ll be lucky if it lasts a few more months. Grim\u2019s too strong to keep out. I know it. Skye knows it. Grim knows it.\u201d His eyes blazed darkness as he told her, \u201cI don\u2019t want to become what he\u2019ll make me.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around his. \u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He wasn\u2019t like the others. He\u2019d fought too hard. Held on to his sanity by going right into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cOver the years, there have been others who were changed and didn\u2019t become\u2014\u201d His lips flattened. \u201cVamps don\u2019t have to be killing machines. It\u2019s the Borns, they\u2019re in control. The Taken just dance like puppets on freaking strings. The Borns who have been tainted by the power\u2014\u201d</p><p>Or curse, depending on who you asked.</p><p>\u201c\u2014they\u2019re the ones who want the blood on the streets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what Grim wants?\u201d</p><p>A bitter laugh. \u201cGrim wants the world. And if he can, he\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>Not while she was around. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep coming for me, won\u2019t he?\u201d Keep attacking those she cared for, just as he\u2019d attacked Simon\u2019s family.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his way. He separates his prey. Makes you suffer, tries to break you.\u201d</p><p>His flesh was warm against her. \u201cI don\u2019t break easily.\u201d Never had. Never would.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d He leaned down, brushed his lips over hers. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I love about you.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, now, what was that\u2014</p><p>\u201cDee, I know this thing between us\u2014shit, I know I wasn\u2019t honest with you at the start, but you and me, what we\u2019ve got between us, it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lust,\u201d she told him, fighting to keep her voice even. Couldn\u2019t be more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that.\u201d One brow rose. \u201cBut if it was just me wanting to fuck you, things wouldn\u2019t be so damn complicated.\u201d</p><p>Ah, okay.</p><p>\u201cWe want the same thing, Dee. We want to stop Grim.\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>\u201cPartners?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d need him. No doubt. But when hell came calling, would she be able to trust him in those last minutes? Or would Grim take control?</p><p>His lips thinned at her hesitation. \u201cWhen you drink from me, what happens?\u201d</p><p>Pleasure. Need. Fire. Dee swallowed. \u201cI get stronger.\u201d The revulsion wasn\u2019t there. Not with him. It had never been there with him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stepped back from her, putting a few feet between their bodies. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI thought so. You see my life, don\u2019t you? Flashes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She knew that wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Sure, vampires could use their power to look into the mind of prey, but she hadn\u2019t been focusing, hadn\u2019t been trying, hadn\u2019t even wanted to see\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou saw with Leo, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him kill his wife.\u201d</p><p>Simon blinked.</p><p>\u201cI saw that asshole Grim, standing over them, laughing.\u201d She\u2019d seen Leo cry. If he\u2019d been enjoying the kill, he wouldn\u2019t have shed a tear. Maybe, back then, he\u2019d still had a conscience. A soul.</p><p>But no control.</p><p>\u201cBorns don\u2019t have to focus their power to steal memories.\u201d</p><p>Steal memories. Not her plan.</p><p>\u201cThey have to focus not to do it. Their psychic power is so strong, the images come automatically.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn. She\u2019d been afraid of that. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try and convince me anymore.\u201d Time for her own honesty. She crossed her arms. \u201cI know what I\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing and accepting are two different things, babe.\u201d</p><p>Hit. They were and she was a long way from accepting her new \u201clife.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll hunt him together,\u201d she told him, straightening her spine. \u201cBut if I think you\u2019re turning on me...\u201d</p><p>He marched to the bag she\u2019d thrown to the floor last night. Pulled a stake out. \u201cYou\u2019ll shove this into my heart?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell to the stake.</p><p>No. Not that easy. Not anymore.</p><p>Because the vampire had gotten to her. Made her care. Made her feel.</p><p>He tossed the stake into the air, then caught it easily with his left hand. \u201cI\u2019ll prove that you can count on me. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. If only she could.</p><p>She turned away from him, unnerved by his stare.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t glance back because she was too worried about what he\u2019d see in her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the lust. I\u2019ll take anything you can give me.\u201d His fingers brushed her shoulders. He\u2019d moved fast and soundlessly. She should have heard him, with her enhanced hearing, she should have\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd one day, I\u2019ll take everything.\u201d His breath blew over her nape. \u201cJust like you\u2019ll take everything I have.\u201d</p><p>Dee shivered.</p><p>His mouth closed over her skin.</p><p>She leaned back against him, strength and power, surrounding her, seducing her.</p><p>Someone rapped against their door. Her nose twitched.</p><p>Timing, timing, timing. \u201cCatalina, chill, all right? I\u2019ll be down in five.\u201d No way was she leaving right then. No, she wanted a moment, okay, more than a moment, to just stay in the quiet and pretend the big, bad eternal monster wasn\u2019t after her.</p><p>To pretend that she was just an ordinary woman wrapped in her lover\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Catalina.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s nostrils twitched. She smelled Catalina\u2019s scent. The light mix of incense and roses. She turned in his arms. \u201cYeah, it is\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door flew open and the light scent vanished. A spell? A trick? What\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Zane Wynter stood in the doorway, filling the frame, and his eyes glittered demon black.</p><p>Her time had run out. She knew he\u2019d come for her. Come to keep the promise he\u2019d given a year ago.</p><p>Zane had come to kill her.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, she wasn\u2019t ready to die yet.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cZane, no!\u201d Dee\u2019s cry echoed in Simon\u2019s ears. Fear. Fury. So the demon had tracked them? Big damn deal. He\u2019d never been afraid of a demon, and he sure wasn\u2019t about to start fearing one now.</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze scanned over them. Froze on the stake that Simon still gripped in his hands. \u201cWere you planning to take her out, too?\u201d</p><p>What? His brow furrowed and then the words registered. No, one word. Too. \u201cThe fuck you say.\u201d He shoved Dee fully behind him. No way was a demon coming after his woman with death in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what she wants.\u201d The demon crossed the threshold. Strolled in and swung a blue bag from his shoulders. He shoved his hand inside the unzipped top and drew out a stake of his own. \u201cWhat she\u2019s always wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not touching her.\u201d Killing the demon would be easy.</p><p>The only problem? He didn\u2019t want to rip the man\u2019s heart out, not in front of Dee. This demon had been her friend once.</p><p>A friend who was about to kill her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hide from him,\u201d Dee said and her voice was clear. Strong. She stepped to Simon\u2019s side, her chin up, her head back. The charred ends of her hair had vanished while she slept. Her blond mane was tousled around her face. Her cheeks were flushed, her lips bright red.</p><p>Sexy. The woman always looked so sexy to him.</p><p>\u201cDee.\u201d The demon\u2019s eyes swept her body once more. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good for a dead woman.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI take it that this asshole is the one who changed you?\u201d Rage slipped past the ice in Zane\u2019s voice. Cracked through.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her hand brushed over Simon\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who saved my life. More than once.\u201d</p><p>A sad shake of Zane\u2019s head. \u201cSo you\u2019ve already gone to his side, huh, Dee? Already forsaken\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Born.\u201d</p><p>The guy\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the reason my parents were killed. The reason the vamps came after me again and again. I\u2019m Born and I\u2019m going to take out the bastard\u2014Grim\u2014who is on my tail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn. The woman sure had one hell of a bite.</p><p>Sexy. If there wasn\u2019t a demon standing there, glaring and threatening death, he\u2019d lick that long column of her throat once more.</p><p>If.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, Dee, that\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d Zane glanced down at the floor, then back at her. \u201cI got a promise to keep.\u201d</p><p>Then he lunged forward, the stake up, ready, moving faster than a human ever could and flying straight at Dee.</p><p>Simon tried to jump in front of her, but Dee shoved him to the side. Then her left hand shot out and she snatched the stake, ripped it right out of the demon\u2019s hand and snapped the wood in two.</p><p>The broken stake thudded onto the carpet.</p><p>She grabbed Zane, bunched his shirt in her fist, and jerked him close to her face.</p> <p>He smiled at her. \u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>\u201cYou gonna bite me now? Gonna sink those, um, really long and what looks like freakishly sharp teeth in my neck? Gonna drain me dry?\u201d</p><p>The demon didn\u2019t seem particularly worried.</p><p>Dee rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me, asshole. Don\u2019t tempt me.\u201d</p><p>The smile that had curled his lips faded. \u201cYou\u2019re still in there, aren\u2019t you, Dee? All this...\u201d His hand lifted, traced her lips, and Simon had to bite back a growl. \u201cIt\u2019s just surface.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked and her head cocked.</p><p>Surface.</p><p>Being a vampire was a hell of a lot more than that.</p><p>\u201cNot a cold-blooded killer, are you?\u201d</p><p>Dee freed him.</p><p>\u201cIf you were, you would have drained me by now.\u201d He straightened his shirt, then raised a brow. \u201cBorn, huh? Never saw that one coming.\u201d</p><p>She shoved a hand through her hair. \u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>Zane grunted and looked his way. \u201cSo what\u2019s your story?\u201d</p> <p>Simon just stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cMan, you need to bring that down a notch. Dee and I weren\u2019t lovers. You want to get all territorial and kick-ass, save that crap for Tony.\u201d</p><p>Simon locked his jaw and gritted, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Another fleeting smile. \u201cI\u2019m here because if Dee really had become some soul-less bloodsucker, I would have kept my promise.\u201d His stare slanted to a watchful Dee. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweet, I would have made it fast and as painless as possible.\u201d A shrug. \u201cBut the minute I saw you, I knew you were still my Dee\u2014\u201d</p><p>A woman screamed. Loud, high. Terrified.</p><p>The scent hit Simon then. Thick and cloying. Smoke.</p><p>Fire.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Zane spun around and ran for the door. Dee and Simon raced after him.</p><p>Not another damn fire. Not again. Grim\u2019s pack, they just weren\u2019t going to stop, not until they killed Dee.</p><p>Not on his watch.</p><p>Zane shoved open the door at the bottom of the stairs and they walked into\u2014</p><p>An inferno.</p><p>It should have been impossible. Fire couldn\u2019t spread this fast. With their senses, they would have known but\u2014</p><p>But Delaney\u2019s burned. The flames crackled and licked at the ceiling, growing bigger, hungrier, and giving them a glimpse of sweet hell.</p><p>\u201cCatalina!\u201d Dee\u2019s scream.</p><p>The witch stood behind the bar, seemingly frozen. Her eyes were on the flames that surrounded her. Bright, dancing flames.</p><p>The demon swore and charged for her. He waved his hand and the flames dimmed around the witch.</p><p>He flew over the fire and grabbed her.</p><p>\u201cBurn,\u201d she whispered, but Simon could hear her over the flames. \u201cBurn so fast.\u201d She closed her eyes and turned her head against Zane\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>The flames shot higher. The smoke thickened, but the fire didn\u2019t race back toward the witch. Instead, it headed right for Dee.</p><p>\u201cWynter!\u201d Simon yelled. The demon could control fire. He didn\u2019t know what kind of power scale the guy had, but right then, as long as the guy could stop the fire, he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Zane hoisted the witch over his shoulder, then made a fast movement with his hand.</p><p>The flames flickered, faded.</p><p>Only to start rising once again.</p><p>\u201cMagic!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d figured that out. Dee had a tablecloth in her hands and she was fighting the flames.</p><p>\u201cNo, forget it, Dee! Get out of here!\u201d Zane ordered.</p><p>Good plan. Simon grabbed her arm.</p><p>The demon led the way, using his power to push back the fire that just kept rising, rising...</p><p>\u201cHer!\u201d The demon\u2019s snarl. He froze before the door. Simon barreled into him. So not the time for this\u2014</p><p>But then Zane ran forward. The glass doors exploded around them. Smoke billowed up into the night. Simon sucked in sharp, clean air, choking as his lungs began to clear.</p><p>\u201cStop her!\u201d He glanced up at the yell. He saw Zane struggling with the witch, and Simon glimpsed a woman with curly red hair running down the street.</p><p>He blinked and Dee took off. Fast, so fast, his little vampire. She caught the woman in two seconds and tackled her, sending her prey slamming into the pavement.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The woman\u2019s cry. Afraid. Furious. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you die?\u201d</p><p>Oh, so not what she needed to be saying to Dee.</p><p>He bounded after them.</p><p>Dee flipped the woman over and pinned her wrists to the ground.</p><p>Simon saw the tears on the woman\u2019s cheeks. Long, thin trickles that slipped over her skin, fell into her hair.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Nina.\u201d The whisper was on the wind. He froze. \u201cKill her or they die.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cWhat the hell? Hey, jerkoff\u2014come out and face me!\u201d</p><p>Another vamp. One of Grim\u2019s men. Had to be. But he was telling the woman to kill Dee? How was she supposed to do\u2014</p><p>\u201cIgnitor!\u201d Zane\u2019s scream of fear.</p><p>No, no. Simon\u2019s gaze snapped back to the woman\u2019s, and he finally saw her eyes, the bleed of red.</p><p>Grim wasn\u2019t screwing around anymore. He\u2019d pulled out the big guns.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Ignitor\u2014a human. A very, very rare human gifted with the power of fire. She\u2019d burn Dee, burn her with just a thought and kill her in an instant. She\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Dee growled when her T-shirt began to smoke. Then she slammed the woman\u2019s head back against the cement. Hard.</p><p>The Ignitor\u2019s eyes fell closed, hiding that deadly red, and she lay, limp, beneath Dee.</p><p>He could love that vampire.</p><p>Already did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d Dee called. \u201cYou get that other bastard!\u201d</p><p>Done. Simon took off, legs pumping fast. He flew down the dark street, snaked into the alley. His nose twitched as he caught the scent of blood. A woman stood, weaving slightly, her hand on the grimy wall. Alcohol fumed off her but she\u2019d been prey, too.</p><p>Close.</p><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d</p><p>The woman flinched. She looked over at him with bleary eyes. \u201cRun,\u201d he told her quietly, flashing fangs.</p><p>She did.</p><p>That left him all alone in the alley with his prey. A Dumpster squeaked. A shoe scraped over the asphalt. Simon licked his lips. \u201cHiding with the garbage?\u201d</p><p>The vamp came out, claws ready, a bit of blood still dripping down his mouth. \u201cYou picked the wrong side in this fight.\u201d</p><p>Simon lifted his brows. He caught the whisper of footsteps behind him. His backup. No way would he ever mistake Dee\u2019s rich scent. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>The vamp\u2019s eyes darted behind Simon, and for an instant, fear flashed on his thin face. Then he spun around, and leapt up, clearing the brick wall behind him in one bound.</p><p>Simon lunged after him. No way was this scum getting away from him.</p><p>The man knew how to leap over a wall. Really kinda sexy the way he could move so fast.</p><p>Dee exhaled, watched a bit longer, admiring her view, then she eyed the wall. Um, yeah, she could take that. She hoped.</p><p>Dee ran\u2014a running start never hurt anything\u2014then leapt. She cleared the wall, but slammed into the ground below. The impact jarred every bone in her body, but Dee rolled, and came back up on her feet and took off.</p><p>A park. A big, dark, yeah, things-could-be-hiding-here park. Overgrown grass. Too tall trees. Too thick brush. Great.</p><p>The vamp with the ferret face was fast; she\u2019d give him that. Her heart raced in her ears and her legs kicked beneath her as she charged after him and Simon. No way was this guy getting away, not after he\u2019d set a freaking Ignitor on her.</p><p>An Ignitor. A vampire\u2019s nightmare. A being that could raise and control fire.</p><p>Not a good way for a vampire to die.</p><p>She\u2019d watched vamps burn before. Dee just hadn\u2019t thought that would ever be the way she\u2019d go out.</p><p>Of course, she hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d be a vamp, either.</p><p>Simon lunged forward and launched his body at the vampire. Even from the distance that separated them, she could hear the thud when their bodies crashed into the earth.</p><p>She pushed forward with a burst of speed.</p><p>Simon flipped the vampire over\u2014and the ferret bastard started laughing.</p><p>That\u2019s when the hair rose on Dee\u2019s nape. When she realized that the shadows were too dark.</p><p>And that vampires didn\u2019t always rely on their first course of attack.</p><p>Backup plans. She wasn\u2019t the only one who had them. Dee let her claws out. \u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>His head jerked up.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s leading us by the balls. It\u2019s a trap.\u201d One they\u2019d walked, no, ran, straight into. The Ignitor hadn\u2019t been the only threat.</p><p>Not by a long shot.</p><p>The vamps came from the shadows. Four. No, five. Oh, damn, six.</p><p>Simon rose slowly, no fear flickering in his eyes or showing on the hard planes of his face. His shoulders rolled and he smiled. \u201cGuess you\u2019re all ready for an ass kicking, huh?\u201d</p><p>The man might be insane. This many vamps? No, hell, no. Dee was very much afraid they would be the ones getting the ass kicking. She still didn\u2019t even understand all her Born powers. No way could she take on this many vamps at once.</p><p>Laughter. The wild, crazy kind you usually only heard in B-movies. Ferret-face rose to his feet. He spat at Simon. Blood hit the ground near his feet. \u201cI-I knew they h-had a hole here.\u201d More laughter. What was the deal with Mr. Giggles? \u201cCan\u2019t take us all, c-can you?\u201d His back straightened and that grin nearly split his face.</p><p>Simon\u2019s arm brushed hers.</p><p>Dee sighed and pulled out a stake. Some habits just couldn\u2019t be broken. Maybe they shouldn\u2019t be broken. She eyed the closing circle of vamps, looking for the head of the snake. Because there was always a head, one with dripping fangs. The alpha. The vamp who wielded the most power and who had to be taken down first, because otherwise, he\u2019d take you down. Fast, hard, and dirty.</p><p>Just because she liked her sex that way, it didn\u2019t mean she wanted her second death to be like that.</p><p>There. The guy with the long, dreaded red hair. The one with green eyes that glinted and stared too hard at her. The one with his claws out and his hands up. He stood before the others, just by about a foot or two. Not toss-away prey.</p><p>Threat number one.</p><p>\u201cGot him,\u201d Simon whispered.</p><p>Hey, if he wanted to go first. \u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d she whispered and her gaze dipped to the woman on the alpha\u2019s right. Asian. Exotic eyes too dark and deadly, red, red lips, pale, smooth skin and\u2014</p><p>The woman lunged forward.</p><p>What?</p><p>Dee snarled and brought her stake up. Fight. Survive. Her mantra. Always.</p><p>But the woman didn\u2019t come for her. Instead, her claws ripped into the still laughing vampire\u2019s back. Dug deep.</p><p>He screamed.</p><p>\u201cHold him tight, Jun.\u201d</p><p>The vamp screamed even louder when the woman dug her claws in deeper.</p><p>The alpha stalked toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Simon muttered.</p><p>Dee just shook her head and kept her stake up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know us. You come down here, smelling of fresh blood, bringing the risen Born, and you think we\u2019re gonna do your bidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrim\u2014\u201d Spittle flew. \u201cGrim\u2019s gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>The alpha shook his head. \u201cGrim\u2019s gonna die, and so are you.\u201d</p><p>A whimper now, not a scream.</p><p>The alpha vampire jerked his head. \u201cMake it fast, Jun. But make it hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no, no, Grim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrim can rot. I\u2019m not his bitch.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Now that wasn\u2019t a statement she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Two other vampires rushed to Jun\u2019s side. They hauled the now begging vamp away and Big Red turned to face her.</p><p>A sliver of wood bit into her palm.</p><p>His nostrils widened, flaring a bit. \u201cGoing to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was considering it,\u201d she told him honestly. \u201cBut I thought I might see your plans first.\u201d</p><p>A short, shrill cry burst from the darkness.</p><p>Make it fast, Jun. But make it hurt.</p><p>Looked like Jun had done both.</p><p>So killing was obviously on the agenda for him. Fair enough. It had been on hers, too, but she\u2019d hoped to force answers out of the now dead vamp first.</p><p>\u201cYou going after Grim?\u201d</p><p>If she survived the next five minutes, yes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you...\u201d Big Red turned his green stare\u2014green, when it should have been black, definitely a time for a vamp to switch to the hunting mode\u2014on Simon. \u201cThat spell still working for you?\u201d</p><p>Simon tensed. \u201cHow do you know about\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hard laugh. \u201cI know about a hell of a lot.\u201d His gaze trekked back to Dee and he smiled.</p><p>Okay, that smile had goose bumps rising on her arms. Because while his eyes hadn\u2019t so much as flickered in color, his fangs were out and Dee could feel his power in the air. Pressing around her. No, surrounding her. He hadn\u2019t gotten his little gang of vamps to attack them, yet, but Dee had the very distinct impression that the order could come at any moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jun came back to his side, her steps sure and steady. Her hands reached for the lead vampire, her hold possessive.</p><p>\u201cI felt you\u2014\u201d he murmured, \u201cthe moment you rose.\u201d</p><p>Jun\u2019s nails lengthened into claws. Blood trickled down the male vamp\u2019s arm when those claws slashed his skin.</p> <p>Dee braced her legs and got ready for the attack that had to be coming. As far as she knew, there was no way this guy should be feeling anything about her. \u201cDid you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm. Been waiting a long time on you.\u201d</p><p>If Jun\u2019s glare got any hotter, Dee figured she might start to burn a second time that night. \u201cJust how long have you been in this game, Red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cName\u2019s Tore,\u201d he said, \u201cand baby, I\u2019ve been in this game longer than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Born.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I can imagine an awful lot.\u201d She caught the slight hitch in Simon\u2019s breath and knew he\u2019d just realized they were dealing with a Born. Out of one fire, into another. \u201cSo are you some screwed-up prick like Grim? And what the hell are you doing in my town?\u201d Cause no way, no way had this guy been in the city long. Word traveled too fast about the Borns, and Pak hadn\u2019t said anything about two of the super vamps being around.</p><p>Pak wouldn\u2019t have kept that Intel from her, would he?</p><p>The faint smile wiped from Tore\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nothing like Grim,\u201d Jun rasped and Dee knew the chick was walking a pretty short anger leash. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Simon\u2019s body was in the same false relaxed stance as hers, and she knew if she so much as inched forward, he\u2019d jump to attack.</p><p>\u201cBut we still don\u2019t know why the hell he\u2019s here, and yeah, Tore, I do know exactly who you are.\u201d Banked fury rumbled in Simon\u2019s voice.</p> <p>Someone let me in on the party. Dee darted a quick glance at Simon.</p><p>His black eyes burned. \u201cHe\u2019s Grim\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>What? Damn, talk about one powerful bloodline. Two Borns?</p><p>\u201cAn unfortunate circumstance of birth,\u201d Tore murmured. \u201cCan\u2019t really choose family now, can we?\u201d</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d You couldn\u2019t always save them either.</p><p>But you could avenge them.</p><p>\u201cI thought death would finally let me escape the bastard.\u201d Tore shook his head. His dreads brushed over his shoulders. \u201cShould have known things wouldn\u2019t be that easy.\u201d His eyes raked over her. \u201cI really thought you\u2019d be...bigger.\u201d</p><p>Dee shook her head, fed up. \u201cLook, are we gonna stand around here pissing and moaning all night, or are we gonna fight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Simon growled. \u201cWe need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t kill him,\u201d Tore told her, patting Jun\u2019s hand with a soft, \u201cEasy, love.\u201d One red brow rose. \u201cBut according to the seer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you want to kill Grim?\u201d But, then, didn\u2019t everybody?</p><p>\u201cHe killed me once. Payback should be...acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Dee shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, why can\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him?\u201d Simon fired at the same time.</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re linked. Grim can\u2019t control me, but he can feel me. He can slip into my thoughts, no matter how hard I try to shield my mind, and he knows when I\u2019m coming for him. He runs, always runs, and leaves a bloodbath for me to clean up.\u201d His teeth snapped together. \u201cBlood bonds, you know? There was no bite between us, but we shared a mother and the bond linking us has always held.\u201d</p><p>This guy didn\u2019t sound like a raving lunatic. He didn\u2019t act like a power mad vamp, either.</p><p>He\u2019d come into town, without raising a stir, without leaving a river of blood in her streets.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t get it, can you?\u201d Jun asked, voice sharp. \u201cEven now that you\u2019re one of us\u2014\u201d</p><p>Uh, no. Not quite.</p><p>\u201c\u2014you still think we all deserve to rot, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>No. Her eyes went to Simon again. No, all vampires weren\u2019t evil. Some fought like mad to keep their souls. Their spirits. Some of them, well, they just got stuck in a curse or a war they didn\u2019t understand. \u201cI\u2019ve never gone after every vampire,\u201d Dee said slowly and she kept her focus on Simon. He glanced at her. Their eyes held. \u201cOnly those with bounties on their heads.\u201d The killers. Those who loved to torture and raise hell.</p><p>\u201cLike the bounty that\u2019s on your head?\u201d Jun pressed.</p><p>Simon\u2019s jaw locked. \u201cDon\u2019t push me,\u201d he growled at the chatty chick.</p><p>Her hero. So sweet. Her fingers lifted and brushed against his cheek. His head turned, just a bit, and his lips pressed against her palm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Tore said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t trust him. Take him, screw him all you like, but don\u2019t let your feelings blind you. You\u2019ll die if you do.\u201d</p><p>Simon attacked. He lunged at the other vampire, wrapped his left hand around Tore\u2019s throat and lifted the stake he\u2019d snatched from Dee\u2014</p><p>Jun raked her claws down Simon\u2019s side.</p><p>The vampires closed in.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Dee screamed. No, Simon wasn\u2019t going out in front of her. No. Way.</p><p>At her cry, every vampire froze. Some of them\u2014wait, did a few of those guys just lower their heads?</p><p>A vampire celebrity. That\u2019s what she was now. Hell. \u201cLet. Him. Go.\u201d But nobody moved. \u201cJun, chick\u2014I\u2019m talking to you.\u201d She could take that vampiress down, no doubt about it.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t kill my chosen mate!\u201d Jun didn\u2019t ease her hold, but she didn\u2019t go in for another attack, either.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, he won\u2019t insult mi\u2014\u201d Whoa. What was that? No way she\u2019d been about to say mine. \u201cHe won\u2019t insult the guy that\u2019s had my back this whole time. I know Simon\u2019s linked to Grim. I know the spell won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d Her shoulders squared. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d</p><p>Tore whistled, or well, kinda gurgled.</p><p>\u201cSimon...\u201d</p><p>His hand fell away from Tore\u2019s neck, but the stake remained pressed right over the other vampire\u2019s heart. \u201cI\u2019d die to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll probably have to do just that.\u201d Tore\u2019s gaze dropped to the stake. \u201cLesson for you, little vampiress. When you get to be as old as I am\u2014as old as Grim\u2014killing us is hard.\u201d His fingers rose, curled around the stake. \u201cIt\u2019ll take more than a stake through the heart to keep Grim down.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d heard a rumor like that years before. Talk of another Born who\u2019d been staked and nearly decapitated, but the guy had gone to ground and risen again. \u201cSo what\u2019s your killing tip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurn him. Burn him until there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done.</p><p>Simon swore and stepped back, yanking the stake with him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell us where to find the asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back for your charred witch. She knows.\u201d</p><p>The vamps began to retreat into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d Dee demanded.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to see you and to figure out if you were up to the task before you.\u201d A somewhat sad shake of his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Now he was going to insult her? \u201cI could\u2019ve had you dead on this ground in the first minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I could have taken your heart in the first thirty seconds.\u201d A taunt. One that had her hands clenching. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate on your kills. Stop thinking like a human.\u201d</p><p>Impossible. Inside, she still was human.</p><p>Deep inside, and she always would be.</p><p>Surface. Maybe Zane had been right about that. Maybe rage had been blinding her for too long.</p><p>\u201cWhen you face Grim, strike fast and strike first. Because you won\u2019t get a second shot.\u201d He turned away.</p><p>So did Jun. Protecting his back. Good girl. She could admire that.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d He stopped, looked back. \u201cTell the Ignitor they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><p>But the knot in Dee\u2019s gut had just gotten bigger.</p><p>Spells were powerful things. A few words, charms, a wisp of magic, and the world could change.</p><p>Dee and Simon rushed back to Delaney\u2019s. Simon half-expected to find the street swarming with fire trucks and neck-craning bystanders, eager for a glimpse of tragedy or heroism.</p><p>But Catalina\u2019s spell held, and though smoke curled lightly from the shattered windows, no humans were near the bar. If a human came by and glanced at Delaney\u2019s, they\u2019d see no damage. No wreckage. Not while the spell was in place.</p><p>But Simon saw it all.</p><p>Catalina stood in front of the broken doors, her shoulders slumped, her clothes stained with soot.</p><p>The demon wasn\u2019t near her. He\u2019d positioned himself next to a parked truck. A beat-up, older, gray pickup. When he caught sight of them, his head jerked. \u201cYou get the bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d Not by his hand. Tore. Who would have thought that vamp would come calling? Simon had known he was looking at the Viking, even before Tore had opened his mouth and started talking about Grim.</p><p>The guy\u2019s reputation definitely proceeded him.</p><p>He jerked his thumb toward the truck. Even with the tinted windows, he could see the slumped figure of the woman. \u201cShe still out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dee hits hard.\u201d</p><p>Dee grunted at that. \u201cWhen someone is trying to fry me, I do.\u201d She stalked toward the bar. \u201cCatalina?\u201d</p><p>The witch didn\u2019t turn.</p><p>Dee touched her shoulder. She flinched. \u201cCatalina, I-I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Finally, the woman turned. Her face had bleached of color, and her lips quivered when she asked, \u201cDo I get to kill her?\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Simon saw the sudden stiffness of Zane\u2019s body. \u201cCat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dee\u2019s hand fell away. \u201cShe was looking for me. This wasn\u2019t a hunt, Cat. She wasn\u2019t here to bind or destroy you.\u201d</p><p>A hunt. Simon\u2019s brows rose. Witch hunts were supposed to be nightmares from the past. Burning and screaming and hell.</p><p>From the past.</p><p>Then why did they keep happening so often in the present?</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter why.\u201d Catalina\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cShe would have burned us all.\u201d</p><p>Simon remembered the tears he\u2019d seen streaking down the woman\u2019s cheeks. And she was right. The fire could have destroyed the building in one fast fury. But, lucky for them, they\u2019d all had time to leave before the fire burned their flesh away.</p><p>With an Ignitor, they could have been destroyed in seconds. An Ignitor always had perfect control over the fire.</p><p>The woman had hesitated with her flames. Why? Slowly, he said, \u201cI think there\u2019s more going on here than we know.\u201d Tell the Ignitor they\u2019re dead. His gut knotted. Couldn\u2019t be good. \u201cLet her talk. Let\u2019s find out what she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her dead.\u201d Fury and fear talking from Cat.</p><p>He knew \u2019em both when he heard \u2019em.</p><p>\u201cStand down, Cat. Stand. Down.\u201d A demand from Zane. One that came just as\u2014</p><p>The Ignitor blew out the back window of the truck. She hurled herself through the flames, crashed into the cement. Stumbled, but managed to get to her feet.</p><p>Zane took her down. Hard. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think of burning me because, baby, I control the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Simon said, the words ripping from him. Probably the wrong time. Should have used some tact, but the witch was looking twitchy and with her magic\u2014no way could they take chances. They needed someone left alive to question, and he didn\u2019t want to lose another link to Grim.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d Dee\u2019s soft and shocked voice.</p><p>The Ignitor stopped thrashing beneath the demon. \u201cWh-what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead.\u201d Who was he talking about? Didn\u2019t know. Had to be someone close to her. \u201cA vamp told us.\u201d</p><p>A sob broke from her. Not one of those soft sniffles that some women could do, but a hard, chest-shaking eruption of agony. Pain.</p><p>Her face reddened and the tears leaked from her eyes. She tried to curl into herself, but Zane held her fast. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Then Dee was there. Staring down at the other woman with recognition. Understanding. One who\u2019d been there, and seen the darkness. \u201cHer family. It\u2019s...Christ. They\u2019re gone.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI-I cried like that, too. Zane, l-let her go.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at the woman, the struggle on his face.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t hurt us,\u201d Dee said.</p><p>The woman\u2019s breath gasped out. She shuddered and cried as if the world were ending.</p><p>For her, maybe it was.</p><p>Simon\u2019s hands clenched. What if the vampire was wrong? Lying wouldn\u2019t be something new for his kind.</p><p>For any kind.</p><p>How many times had he lied? Tricked? To further his own plans\u2014too many times to count. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the bodies,\u201d Simon said. The words slipped out, an effort to comfort. That agony\u2014no, he couldn\u2019t see it. Couldn\u2019t hear it. Because when he looked at her, he saw Dee\u2019s hell too easily.</p><p>And remembered his own.</p><p>No, Mom! Mom! Dad! So much blood.</p><p>Her watery eyes turned to him. Hope, faint, flickering, shined through the pain.</p><p>He locked his jaw and Simon gritted, \u201cA Born vampire named Tore wanted us to deliver a message to you. He\u2019s the one who said they were dead. We have no proof and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWh-what about Greg?\u201d</p><p>Greg? \u201cThe vampire who brought you here to kill us?\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s hands were tight around her wrists. Too tight. When the demon suddenly freed her, Simon saw the red imprints on her flesh. Zane swore when he caught sight of the marks.</p> <p>\u201cY-yes, h-he\u2019s the one\u2014\u201d She pushed herself up.</p><p>\u201cGreg\u2019s dead.\u201d Dee put her hands on her hips. \u201cVery dead.\u201d</p><p>Hope again, brighter this time. \u201cThen there might be a-a chance.

Freaking false\u2014</p> <p>\u201cThe vampires drained the man first. The one with streaks of silver in his hair.\u201d Catalina\u2019s voice. Calm and cool. Simon\u2019s gaze found her huddled on the ground, leaning over a thick shard of broken glass.</p><p>Her eyes were fixed on that glass. No, on what she could see in the glass.</p><p>Scrying. A witch\u2019s talent.</p><p>The human\u2019s heartbeat raced in his ears. Pounding, fast, too fast. Dangerous that.</p><p>\u201cThey held the woman, made her watch. Then it was her turn.\u201d Catalina picked up the glass and blood dripped from her fingertips when the sharp edges cut her. \u201cDeath waits in that house near the water. Only death.\u201d</p><p>The Ignitor didn\u2019t cry out again. The tears came silently, long, pouring streams, and Dee snarled.</p> <p>Her fangs were out, her claws glinting, and when she rounded on the witch, her eyes were perfect midnight black. \u201cSee him.\u201d Grim.</p><p>The blood drops splattered onto the ground. The scent drew him and power pulsed in the air.</p><p>Simon crossed to the witch.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s eyes had been glassy with her magic. A dazed blink seemed to bring her back to them. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean\u2014I haven\u2019t even cast my circle\u2014\u201d</p><p>No time. The bodies were piling up. The evil closing in.</p><p>No more attacks.</p><p>Our turn.</p><p>Simon swiped his claws over his forearm. He lifted his hand and let the blood drop onto the darkened glass. \u201cSee him through me.\u201d</p> <p>A glow lit her eyes, then she stared down at the glass once more. He couldn\u2019t see a damn thing. Soot. Ash. The red smear of his blood. Darkness. But Catalina stared and stared, and the silence thickened around them.</p><p>\u201cWhere.\u201d A demand from Dee. He should have known her patience would break first.</p><p>\u201cTexas.\u201d Soft, tired. \u201cWaiting, in a place called Heuco, near the Mexican border.\u201d</p><p>Hueco. Hollow.</p><p>Excitement burned through him. \u201cCut the link.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look too long. With Grim, there was no telling who he\u2019d forced onto his side. An Ignitor was just the start. He could have a witch or even a warlock. Probably a warlock. When choosing his weapons, Grim would go right for someone who\u2019d stepped onto the dark side of magic. A warlock would be able to sense Catalina\u2019s power if she stayed tuned in too long.</p><p>The glass shattered in her hands. \u201cCan\u2019t find me now,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I found you.\u201d</p><p>Hot damn. They\u2019d done it. His gaze met Dee\u2019s. Her lips began to curl, just a bit.</p><p>He hurried to her. Kissed her hard and deep. Tasted her.</p><p>The end was coming.</p><p>Not for them, oh, no. For them, it would be a beginning. They\u2019d have forever.</p><p>But for Grim, hell waited.</p><p>Simon would get his freedom. Dee would have her revenge, then they\u2019d have each other.</p><p>Pretty fucking perfect.</p><p>\u201cIs the trap set?\u201d Grim asked, his eyes on the woman who danced before him. Human. He liked the human dancers best. This one\u2014her eyes smiled, flirted. Her heart raced and all that sweet blood pumped with every sway of her body.</p><p>\u201cGreg didn\u2019t report in.\u201d</p><p>At that, Grim pulled his stare away from the woman. Music beat, a sensual rhythm, and he knew the woman kept on slithering. \u201cHow long has he been missing?\u201d He didn\u2019t worry about guarding his words with the dancer. No need with her.</p><p>\u201cAn hour.\u201d Malik, a vampire who\u2019d been with him since the guy\u2019s first Taken breath five hundred years before, met Grim\u2019s gaze directly.</p><p>An hour was plenty of time to die. Grim rubbed his hand over his chin. \u201cThe parents are dead?\u201d His Ignitor was such a useful tool. Weak package, but an incredible power inside.</p><p>\u201cTheir bodies should be found tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>A quick tip to the cops, yes, that would do just fine. \u201cAnd my brother?\u201d Like he didn\u2019t know the asshole was around. The instant Tore had crossed the ocean, he\u2019d felt the fool. He\u2019d taken steps to prepare for him. Tore wouldn\u2019t have an advantage in this hunt.</p><p>\u201cNo word yet.\u201d</p><p>There wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cHe won\u2019t come for me.\u201d Tore had learned his lesson the last time when Grim had left the dead children for him to find.</p><p>His brother had always had a soft spot for the kiddies.</p><p>When you knew someone so well, it was easy to work their weak spots. He knew just how to make Tore suffer.</p><p>His brother had begged him for death over twelve hundred years ago. When he\u2019d seen what Grim had become. When he\u2019d found the bodies and known that he\u2019d be the next to feel Grim\u2019s fangs on his throat.</p><p>There\u2019d been no controlling the bloodlust. No stopping the vicious thirst. But he hadn\u2019t wanted to stop it. He\u2019d just wanted to kill.</p><p>He\u2019d granted his little brother\u2019s wish. Too bad Tore hadn\u2019t stayed down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be our next project,\u201d Grim said, giving a nod. \u201cIt\u2019s time we freed him from his torment.\u201d A gift.</p><p>The music ended. He glanced over at the woman. Heaving chest. Glistening lips.</p><p>He\u2019d screw her first.</p><p>Then kill her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pity. I always loved my brother.\u201d</p><p>Malik didn\u2019t speak. Didn\u2019t call him a liar. Or a fool.</p><p>And Grim was both. After all, he\u2019d let Tore survive for this long. He should have taken his head long ago.</p><p>But when his brother had woken\u2014just like me.</p><p>Sentiment. Attachment. So yes, he had a soft spot for the man he\u2019d known as his brother. Tore had tried to save him once, right before his father\u2019s bitch of a new wife had betrayed them all.</p><p>Tore had come to him, worked to free him from the chains, but there hadn\u2019t been enough time.</p><p>Too many warriors around them. Too much rage.</p><p>Blood eagle.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut but the memory of agony seared his flesh. His hands reached behind him automatically, touching his back.</p><p>No wings.</p><p>But he\u2019d never forget, never. The snap of his ribs, the jerk backward\u2014</p><p>Death had not come fast enough as his blood spilled onto the ground.</p><p>The silence hit him then. Thick and complete. His arms still behind him, he looked up at the dancer. Dark skin. Long, supple limbs. Her eyes were on him. Studying. Watching.</p><p>Watching like all those others. Watching and laughing as he fell to the ground.</p><p>No one had helped him then. No one.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll kill the Born bitch.\u201d Grim\u2019s voice came out hoarse. He\u2019d screamed that long ago night. Screamed until they took his breath and ripped his lungs out.</p><p>Blood eagle. No myth of Viking torture. Real. Real.</p><p>He would not die again. The vampiress coming would know the agony. Not him. Not again.</p><p>She\u2019d die. He stepped forward. The dancer lifted her chin and asked, \u201cKill me...or change me?\u201d</p><p>Humans were always wanting to live forever. He reached for her and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Because he\u2019d never wanted to be a liar.</p><p>Or a killer.</p><p>Such a pity he was both.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>That day Simon dreamed of agony. Of a snow-covered battlefield that turned from white to red beneath him. Simon twisted on the bed, jerking and shuddering, but he couldn\u2019t make his eyes open. Couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>Hands caught his body. Held too tight. Two men. One on each side. Long braids surrounded their faces. Thick helmets sat on top of their heads and some kind of cape or cloak billowed behind them.</p><p>A scream burst from him as fiery pain pierced his back. Simon choked, struggling for breath. He heard a snap, as if a bone were breaking. Again\u2014</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>Pain, so much pain. Death would come. Death had to come. I will die with honor, I will not\u2014</p><p>\u201cWake up, vampire.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew open at the soft voice and he sprang up, breath heaving. His hands flew to his back. He expected to find the flesh torn open, his ribs ripped out and broken, to look like\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou dream of him.\u201d Catalina eyed him and shook her head. \u201cHis link to you is growing once again.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, no. Simon ran a trembling hand over his face.</p><p>She glanced toward the door. A cheap motel room door. They were on the Louisiana/Texas border. She\u2019d come with him and Dee. Come with the demon and the Ignitor\u2014the woman who could only sit and cry.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t kill him soon, he\u2019ll start to control you again.\u201d No censure there. Catalina just seemed to be stating a fact.</p><p>Okay, she was stating a fact.</p><p>Simon climbed from the bed. When had the witch come in? \u201cWhere\u2019s Dee?\u201d He reached for his shirt. Good thing he still had his jeans on or Catalina would\u2019ve gotten a show.</p><p>\u201cWith Zane. She wants him to take the human away.\u201d Catalina blew out a hard breath. \u201cHe wants to stay by Dee\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>He yanked the shirt over his head. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d He\u2019d first gone to Catalina weeks before. He\u2019d known she was close to the hunters at Night Watch. He\u2019d told her about Grim and asked if she understood what would be coming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d Her first response. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s come for Dee.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders rolled and she glanced back at him. \u201cI know if I go with you, I die.\u201d</p><p>He blinked at that. \u201cYou been looking into the future?\u201d There was a price for that. A heavy one. And looking forward took dark magic.</p><p>She gave him a weak nod and rubbed her right hand over her forehead. \u201cIt was the fire. I had to make sure I wasn\u2019t going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. \u201cWell, that guy is a pure asshole.\u201d Dee stormed inside. \u201cWon\u2019t listen to a thing I say, and the woman\u2014Nina\u2014she\u2019s doesn\u2019t even seem to know where she is.\u201d She stopped, blinked. \u201cUh, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Catalina\u2019s spine straightened. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Dee gave a fast smile. \u201cGood. I knew you\u2019d see reason, at least. I mean, you could have stayed in the city, you didn\u2019t even have to come this far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone is going to die, Dee.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. She hesitated. \u201cWh-what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked.\u201d Catalina shook her head. \u201cI saw death. Zane was surrounded by flames. I burned. Nina\u2014her throat was cut.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cAnd you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>Catalina\u2019s eyes darted to Simon.</p><p>Shit. Not good.</p><p>\u201cYou die, Dee.\u201d Said again, softly. Sadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already died once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t come back this time.\u201d Catalina looked back at her. \u201cYou can\u2019t win against Grim. I saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d Dee\u2019s arms crossed over her chest. \u201cI know you are. Hell, I\u2019m scared, too, okay?\u201d</p><p>Had Dee just admitted that? No way. Simon stepped toward her but she threw up a quick hand. \u201cJust...hold on. When you touch me, it\u2019s hard to think.\u201d</p><p>Well, damn.</p><p>She turned that hand and pointed at Catalina. \u201cYou can\u2019t look into the future when you have fear in your heart. Even I know that.\u201d</p><p>Catalina didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cYou mess with the Dark, and it\u2019ll show you the things that scare you the most, not what will be.\u201d Dee gave a hard sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing these games for a while, and I know about witches. And what you can and can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw death.\u201d Catalina\u2019s hands clenched. \u201cI\u2019m not going to a slaughter for a fight that can\u2019t be won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed my family. Simon\u2019s family. Nina\u2019s family. He won\u2019t stop.\u201d Dee paused, then said, \u201cWe have to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d kill us all for vengeance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, witch,\u201d Simon warned. The fear in Catalina was new. The fire had ignited the terror and the strong woman he\u2019d met now seemed to have vanished. Fear could do that. Twist you. Change you. \u201cWalk away if you want. This fight isn\u2019t yours.\u201d It was his. There\u2019d be no stopping for him. No choice.</p><p>Her gaze held his. Sadness there. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill her,\u201d Catalina whispered.</p><p>Simon\u2019s heart shuddered in his chest. No, no, he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019ll start to control you once again.</p><p>His vision dimmed. Fear, his own, licked at his gut and rose to his throat as\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf you send her after him, you\u2019re as good as killing her,\u201d the witch finished and Simon\u2019s breath came back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stand by her. Grim\u2019s afraid of her. He knows she can kill him.\u201d Or else he wouldn\u2019t want her dead so badly.</p><p>\u201cCan.\u201d Catalina\u2019s eyes closed. \u201cJust because she can doesn\u2019t mean she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Absolute certainty in Dee\u2019s voice.</p><p>He\u2019d back her any day.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s lashes lifted. \u201cYou\u2019re always so sure of yourself. From the first moment I met you, you were so strong\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when that idiot warlock came and tried to bind you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A warlock like Skye. A former wizard who\u2019d turned to the dark.</p><p>\u201cWe kicked his ass, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Dee murmured and Simon wished he could have seen that.</p><p>Wished he could have known Dee, before hell came calling at both of their doors.</p> <p>The witch licked her lips. \u201cWe did.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd I thought\u2014I thought we\u2019d be able to kick ass again. When he\u201d\u2014a weak flutter of her hand toward Simon\u2014\u201ccame to me, asking me for the promised Born, I thought we could make everything all right. Thought we\u2019d be strong enough to face what\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be,\u201d Dee said. Her voice was sure and confident but Simon happened to glance down, and he saw that her fingers shook.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Simple and as certain as Dee sounded. \u201cI\u2019m leaving tonight. I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m heading,\u201d Catalina said, lips curving down, \u201cI just have to get away from here. The fire\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fire. The one thing that could scare a strong witch. Grim had known exactly what he was doing. Separate. Yank Dee away from the friends who could help her.</p><p>Grim could have gotten the Ignitor to attack Dee at any time. But, no, he\u2019d waited until Dee sought shelter with Catalina.</p> <p>He\u2019d sent his other goons with fire the first time. But the second time, he hadn\u2019t been playing. Grim had brought out the big guns. Ignitor.</p><p>Burned around her.</p><p>One down. Grim was working his twisted magic.</p><p>Dee stepped away from him and crept close to Catalina. She pushed a hand through her short hair and stared in silence for a moment. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>No pleas to stay. No guilt trips that they could use the witch\u2019s magic.</p><p>Dee\u2019s arms wrapped around the other woman. \u201cJust be safe.\u201d</p> <p>He caught a glimpse of Catalina\u2019s face. Simon saw the tear that leaked down her cheek. Her arms clamped tight around Dee. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>Friends.</p><p>But Catalina was still walking away.</p><p>And Dee was trying to force the demon to leave her side.</p><p>Friends.</p><p>She wanted them safe and being safe meant that she didn\u2019t want them anywhere near Grim.</p><p>Catalina eased back and swiped her hand over her cheek.</p><p>Then she walked away. The door shut behind her with the softest of clicks.</p> <p>Dee\u2019s shoulders straightened. \u201cYou want to tell me...\u201d she began slowly, then glanced back at him, \u201cwhy I had a vision of you, dying, in some freaking blizzard right before I stormed in here?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. How had she\u2014</p><p>She rubbed her eyes. \u201cDamn, Simon, that was bad. One minute, I was talking to Zane\u2014idiot won\u2019t listen to me. The next, all I could see was you and you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d He could give her that much, at least. It had to be their blood link. Grim was trying to tune back to him, but Dee was slipping inside his mind, without even trying.</p><p>Her body turned fully toward him. Her gaze dipped over his chest and she crossed to him. \u201cUh, yeah, it was.\u201d She walked behind him. Her fingers trailed down his back and Simon stiffened at the light touch. \u201cWhat they did to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me,\u201d he said again, his breath sucking in. Her scent always got to him. Sensual and rich.</p><p>\u201cI saw you.\u201d</p><p>Because she\u2019d been in his mind, and the images had taken hold of his consciousness and hadn\u2019t let go. \u201cGrim.\u201d Her palms pressed into his back, seeming to burn his flesh even through the T-shirt. \u201cWhat you saw\u2014it was him.\u201d</p><p>Her breath feathered over his flesh. Warm. His eyes closed. She lifted the back of the shirt and her lips pressed into his skin.</p><p>Simon swallowed. \u201cThey called it the blood eagle.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers slipped down the skin of his back and he knew she\u2019d remember the image from the dream. Vision. Whatever the hell it had been.</p><p>Torn, broken, ribs spread to look like an eagle\u2019s wings. \u201cAn old Viking torture.\u201d One he knew had been used on Grim. Their link had shown him that before.</p><p>Her lips rose and he missed the touch of her mouth. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, he met her stare. \u201cNot all monsters are born, Dee, some are made.\u201d Once upon a time, a very long-ass time ago, Grim hadn\u2019t been the sick twisted bastard of today. He\u2019d just been a man. One who\u2019d been broken. Savaged.</p><p>\u201cIf the stories are true,\u201d Simon said, watching her carefully, \u201cthe first thing he did on rising was to find every man who\u2019d participated in his torture, and he ripped them apart.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze held his. \u201cRevenge.\u201d The same thing she sought.</p><p>He gave a nod. \u201cThere\u2019s a price, you know.\u201d Why hadn\u2019t he realized how heavy the price would be for her? Why had he only thought of himself? Of the way he wanted his life to be?</p><p>He\u2019d pulled Dee into this war, yanked her into the blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known there was a price.\u201d A mirthless smile tilted her lips. \u201cWhy do you think I put a kill order on myself?\u201d</p><p>His hands knotted at that. No way. No damn way would that demon Zane ever come at her with death in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen death for the last sixteen years,\u201d Dee said. \u201cI\u2019ve always known I was living on borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>Not borrowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is why me?\u201d Pain there, breaking beneath the surface. \u201cWhy the hell am I one of the Born? I\u2019m nobody. Nobody. I was a freaking clueless kid when the vamps came after my family. I wasn\u2019t special. I\u2019m not special.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hands. Held her tight. \u201cYou\u2019re the strongest woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d True. He\u2019d never seen her back down. A fighter, straight to the soul.</p><p>Her gaze fell. \u201cWhen I was a kid, my family used to go to church together every Sunday.\u201d</p><p>He waited. Dee\u2019s life, before the nightmares.</p><p>Her stare didn\u2019t meet his. \u201cA lot of people think God cursed vampires. Cursed the Borns and they spread the virus\u2014\u201d</p><p>Was that what people were calling it these days? A virus?</p><p>\u201c\u2014like a plague. That\u2019s why the holy water works on vampires.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d been burned by that once. Holy water and vamps didn\u2019t mix\u2014that one wasn\u2019t a myth.</p><p>\u201cSo what did I do, Simon, that would have condemned me at fifteen?\u201d Her eyes rose. \u201cWhat did I do that was so bad, I was cursed, too? I lost my whole family\u2014what did I do?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re a Born.\u201d He\u2019d chosen this path. For her, fate had chosen. \u201cI know the stories, too. That the first Born committed a betrayal, that all vamps were punished for his crimes.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Nothing, got me?\u201d</p><p>Her face was as blank as a doll\u2019s. \u201cBut I\u2019ll still wind up like Grim, won\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019ll never be like him.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a bitter smile. \u201cI think I already am.\u201d A pause. Then, quietly, \u201cAnd deep down, so do you.\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cDee, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d A snarl from outside. \u201cDee!\u201d Zane\u2019s voice. His fist thudded against the door. Half a second later, the door came crashing open. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d His chest heaved and his eyes glinted back.</p><p>Dee nodded. \u201cI know. I told Catalina that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot her!\u201d He shook his head and snarled, \u201cWe both knew the witch would cut and run. Cat can\u2019t handle fire. That shit just brought up too many bad memories for her and she\u2019s too afraid of burning.\u201d He slammed a hand against the door frame. \u201cNina\u2019s bolted.\u201d</p><p>A curse erupted from Simon\u2019s lips. Her family killed\u2014yeah, they\u2019d had that confirmed by a quick call to Dee\u2019s friendly cop contact.</p><p>A massacred family.</p><p>An Ignitor who knew the location of the Born vampire behind the slaughter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone after him,\u201d Dee said, and it was what they all knew. \u201cHow long of a head start?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched, Zane gritted, \u201cAt least three hours. I thought she was sleeping in her room. She\u2019d been crying so much, I didn\u2019t even think to go in there and check.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Three hours.</p><p>Hell of a lead she had on them. With that much time, she\u2019d definitely get to Grim first.</p><p>Ignitors were so strong psychically. Strong enough to create and control fire with their minds. But nature was a sly bitch. For all their psychic strength, Ignitors were so very weak physically.</p><p>A careless touch could bruise them, like when Zane had wrapped his fingers around the Ignitor\u2019s wrists.</p><p>And killing them would only take one blow.</p><p>If Grim saw her coming, if he felt her, Nina would be dead.</p><p>But if he didn\u2019t...</p><p>Burn, bastard.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d Dee\u2019s voice, vibrating with tension. \u201cLet\u2019s get on the road, now.\u201d</p><p>He was already moving. He grabbed his bag. This was it. Final match.</p><p>Should have never brought Dee in on this.</p><p>He\u2019d thought they would make the perfect team. Same enemy. Same goal.</p><p>But if anything happened to Dee...</p><p>Can\u2019t lose her.</p><p>Won\u2019t lose her.</p><p>How had his master plan gotten so screwed up?</p><p>Zane braced his legs apart. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna kill her. We have to get there before\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee marched up to him, that weird, faint smile on her face. Her hand pressed against his chest. \u201cI told you before, this fight\u2019s not yours. Not yours. Not Cat\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stared down at her. \u201cYou think I\u2019m walking away from you? You\u2019re not going out on a death fight. I\u2019ve had your back before, I\u2019ll have it again. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Her right hand snaked up his neck. \u201cSorry.\u201d Her left hand came up, and delivered a hard, fast hit to his chin. The demon went down. \u201cAfter all the times with Tony, you should have seen that coming.\u201d She stared down at him, her body taut.</p><p>Simon approached her slowly and very, very cautiously. \u201cWanna tell me what that was about?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up. The demon lay sprawled across the threshold. \u201cIn case Cat\u2019s vision wasn\u2019t pure shit, no way am I gonna risk him.\u201d Emotion there. Affection. Love.</p><p>The fist that slugged his gut told Simon that he was jealous. Had been jealous of the demon from the very first. A bond existed between Dee and Zane. One born from time and struggle. Trust.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give for Dee to care enough to punch the crap out of him.</p><p>Trust.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. \u201cI pulled the punch, you know. I used my left hand.\u201d Still, she had vampire strength now, so the punch wouldn\u2019t have been anywhere near soft. She bent, ran her fingers over Zane\u2019s jaw. \u201cBut demons are strong and he won\u2019t be out long.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t be. And when he woke, Simon knew Zane would come after them. Because the demon cared for Dee, too. Cared enough to come on his own with a kill-order.</p><p>If you cared enough to kill...</p><p>Simon lifted his gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d Not lovers. Dee and the demon had never been together sexually, so he shouldn\u2019t even think about attacking the guy while he was out.</p><p>But he\u2019ll be there for Dee when this hell is over. When she doesn\u2019t have to fight the nightmares of her past any longer, the demon will be there.</p><p>And where will I be?</p><p>Would Dee even want him in her life once Grim\u2019s threat was gone?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead.</p><p>Dee dragged Zane inside the room. Simon grabbed Zane\u2019s legs, and they hoisted the demon onto the bed. Dee shoved a pillow under his head. \u201cDon\u2019t come after me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Zane wouldn\u2019t be able to hear her.</p><p>She reached for his hand. Turned his wrist over. \u201cI-I have to know where you\u2019ll be. I can\u2019t risk you. Won\u2019t. Not for my revenge.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d kill us all for vengeance? The witch\u2019s question.</p><p>No, Dee wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She stared at the demon, swallowed, and bit him.</p><p>Simon froze. No, no\u2014he didn\u2019t like to see her mouth on the demon. Not one bit. Taking his blood. A growl rumbled in Simon\u2019s throat. Not her. Not him. No\u2014</p><p>Dee wrenched her mouth away. Her eyes met Simon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot...another.\u201d His snarl was a guttural demand.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arms and hauled her away from the bed. No time. His jaw locked. \u201cGet in the car.\u201d</p><p>And away from the demon.</p><p>A demon now forever linked to her. Just what he needed. More competition.</p><p>As if he didn\u2019t have enough shit going on.</p><p>Simon hauled her out, left the demon, and didn\u2019t look back. As far as he was concerned, there had never been any use in looking back.</p><p>They climbed into Dee\u2019s SUV. Zane\u2019s motorcycle was gone. Either courtesy of Nina or the witch. Either way, he knew the demon wouldn\u2019t be slowed down for long.</p><p>Backup would come, whether they wanted it to or not.</p><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s my vehicle, you know, I should be the one to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He floored the accelerator and they shot out of the parking lot, leaving a trail of spewing gravel behind them.</p><p>The black SUV fishtailed out of the lot. The two in the vehicle were so intent on their prey that they didn\u2019t glance around. Didn\u2019t take notice of the one watching.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>Another mistake.</p><p>The key turned and the ignition kicked to life. Trailing them would be too easy.</p><p>Killing them\u2014harder. But not impossible. Nothing was impossible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The slow twang of country music filled the car\u2019s interior, and the vehicle pulled from the concealing shadows.</p><p>\u201cHow long until we reach Hueco?\u201d Dee\u2019s voice was steady. The words were the first she\u2019d spoken in the last hour.</p><p>Simon kept his foot stomped all the way onto the accelerator. Even burning up the black interstate road, it would still be \u201cafter dawn.\u201d A piss-poor time to go riding into the town. He\u2019d be weak. All the vamps would be.</p> <p>He and Dee would be outnumbered. Grim would have a guard force. Lots of vamps and who knew what else.</p><p>\u201cThen if we\u2019ve got nothing to do for the next six hours\u2014\u201d</p><p>Probably longer.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s got your butt in such a twist?\u201d</p><p>His knuckles whitened around the wheel. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to drink from him,\u201d he bit out. Your butt in such a twist. Nice.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to know if he was coming after me. Us.\u201d</p><p>He could still see her mouth on the other man\u2019s wrist. Her lips so red against his dark flesh. Tasting him. Taking him.</p><p>The SUV swerved onto the median and Simon yanked the wheel so the vehicle slipped back into the right lane. \u201cYou took his blood. You linked with him.\u201d Wasn\u2019t it enough that the two of them already had some kind of bond he didn\u2019t understand?</p><p>Trust. Yeah, Dee trusted her demon.</p><p>\u201cI linked with you, too. I didn\u2019t hear you complaining about it.\u201d</p><p>No, that was the problem. He\u2019d all but begged for more. The feel of her lips. That tongue\u2014</p> <p>Good fucking thing the demon had been knocked out.</p><p>\u201cI-I thought I had to do it. After what Cat said, I didn\u2019t want him following us.\u201d Quiet, subdued.</p><p>Since when was she subdued? What the hell? He slanted her a quick glance and tried to get the crazy bat-shit jealousy under control.</p><p>Fear. That\u2019s what it really was. Fear about facing Grim. Because what if the bastard was too strong? And then...cold-eat-your-soul fear that when the battle was over, he\u2019d lose Dee.</p><p>One way or another.</p><p>When did she become more important than freedom? He cleared his throat and tried to unclench his fingers before he broke the steering wheel. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t believe the witch.\u201d</p><p>A sound, could have been a strained laugh or just a long sigh, came from her lips. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019m not sure what I believe anymore. I shouldn\u2019t have let them leave the city with us. I knew the whole time that was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>But the demon had been adamant, and he\u2019d herded the shattered Ignitor and the still-dazed witch with him.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to sleep at the motel, but I just\u2014I just kept seeing Catalina, surrounded by the fire.\u201d</p><p>But the fire surrounded you, too. Why wasn\u2019t Dee scared for herself? Didn\u2019t she care?</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t make her face the flames again. And Zane\u2014oh, hell, after what I saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped to her. \u201cWhat you saw?\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted, then fell limply back in her lap. \u201cEvery time I bite someone, I\u2019m going to see the person\u2019s life, right?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, that was the way of the Born. Most saw that as a strength. A way to get into the minds of prey and control them.</p><p>Not Dee. He could tell she saw it as some kind of punishment. Another one, for her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been through enough. I\u2019m not going to have him dying for my fight.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hand and linked his fingers through hers. \u201cOur fight.\u201d She wasn\u2019t in this alone. She wasn\u2019t going to ditch him the way she\u2019d done the others.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t leave her side. No matter what. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna turn on you, babe. I don\u2019t care what the witch saw, I won\u2019t turn.\u201d The spell might be weakening. Grim might be starting to find a link again, but it wouldn\u2019t matter. Grim would be dead long before the spell wore off completely.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around his. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Simple. Certain.</p><p>Trust?</p><p>His breath expelled in a hard rush and his heart thundered against his chest.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know.\u201d The leather groaned beneath her as she shifted to stare at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to bite Zane. Didn\u2019t want to bite that freak vamp Leo. Since turning, I\u2019ve needed to bite. The bloodlust has been there, no denying it. When I first opened my eyes and saw Jude...\u201d He heard the click of her swallow. \u201cI thought I might even lose control.\u201d</p><p>The first cravings were the strongest. The most dangerous. That was why he\u2019d taken her to Pak. Pak knew how to care for vampires. He\u2019d guarded dozens of Taken over the years. Guarded them, and had to put some down.</p><p>Simon knew if he\u2019d stayed with Dee, her bloodlust would have flared and instead of calming her, his own control would have broken.</p><p>They would have broken.</p><p>But now they were stronger. Together, they were stronger.</p><p>Not. Gonna. Break.</p><p>\u201cYou are different. I wanted you. I wanted to bite, and I wanted you to bite me.\u201d</p><p>A confession like that, from a hunter...from her.</p><p>His gums burned as his teeth grew and the crotch of his pants got way too tight around his expanding cock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one I want, Simon. Only you.\u201d</p><p>Their joined hands rested on her soft, jean-clad thigh. \u201cWhen this is over,\u201d he managed to say, the words coming out hoarse and hard, \u201cyou\u2019re not getting away from me.\u201d He\u2019d have to explain, have to tell her everything\u2014</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t escape him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He caught her faint smile. \u201cBecause you\u2019d better not even think that you\u2019re getting away from me.\u201d</p><p>Ah, damn.</p><p>She\u2019d done it to him again. A sucker punch. Tony would never let him hear the end of this one. Zane jerked up in bed. His gaze flew around the room. Gone. Of course. What else?</p><p>He jumped up, automatically checking the clock. How long had he been out? An hour? Two? Judging by the faint light trickling through the blinds, a hell of a lot longer.</p><p>Dee had used that vamp strength on him.</p><p>He almost smiled. Almost.</p><p>Then he caught sight of the marks on his wrist. Faint. Small. Two circles.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>She\u2019d taken his blood. Gotten a lock on him.</p><p>\u201cFine, princess\u2014so you know I\u2019m coming. What else did you expect me to do?\u201d</p><p>He stormed to the door. Car. He\u2019d steal one from the lot, get on the road, and call for backup. Pak might even have some other hunters in Texas that he could send in for them. Easy deal.</p><p>Dee wouldn\u2019t get rid of him this easily.</p><p>He wrenched open the door and caught the scents too late.</p><p>Three vampires. Tall, thick, with teeth ready and claws out. They stood just past his door, smiling.</p><p>\u201cKnew we\u2019d find someone waiting,\u201d the one in the middle said, and his fanged smile widened. \u201cLet\u2019s see how long it takes to make the demon scream.\u201d</p><p>A really, really long time.</p><p>Zane lifted his hands and tossed out a smile of his own. \u201cWho\u2019s first?\u201d</p><p>They all attacked at once. Figured.</p><p>Dee sucked in a sharp breath and lunged forward. The seat belt cut into her chest. In the distance, the faint purple light of dawn streaked across the horizon.</p><p>Weakness.</p><p>\u201cDee? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cZane. For a minute there, I thought\u2014\u201d She\u2019d thought he called her name.</p><p>\u201cYou should try to get some sleep,\u201d Simon told her. \u201cSave your strength.\u201d</p><p>What strength? She could already feel the pull of the sun. The tiredness, the weakness. \u201cYou should sleep.\u201d He\u2019d been driving all night. Even outrun two troopers. Impressive. \u201cLet me take the wheel for a while.\u201d</p><p>He glanced her way. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t gonna get into a pissing match with him. \u201cSlow down and let me take the wheel.\u201d The guy was sexy as hell, but bossy.</p><p>Good thing she liked him. Okay, more than liked him.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there, not now.</p><p>Later there would be plenty of time to sort out the sick, tangled mess of her emotions. To see if there was anything between her and the vampire other than the thick, hot need.</p><p>A need she felt even now. Had felt since his fingers pressed against the top of her thigh hours before.</p><p>She knew he had to smell her arousal. Just as she\u2019d caught his thickening scent.</p><p>And the big bulge in his jeans\u2014yeah, another dead giveaway. But he\u2019d ignored it. She was trying to do the same. Trying.</p><p>The car slowed. Finally. The speedometer eased back down, down...eighty, seventy...</p><p>They\u2019d turned off the Interstate an hour ago. The SUV snaked down some lonely, twisting road that seemed to head nowhere.</p><p>But to death.</p><p>To Hueco.</p><p>The flash of headlights filled the SUV\u2019s interior. Ah, after all this time on empty roads, they had company.</p><p>A motor roared and Dee tensed.</p><p>The lights behind them burned brighter, filling the SUV\u2019s interior with a hot glow. The motor roared louder\u2014coming for us. Not the friendly kind of company. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Dee jerked around. Someone was coming, all right, bearing down on them fast. Too fast. \u201cSimon!\u201d</p><p>The SUV raced forward, but, too late\u2014</p><p>Never noticed the other car. Should have looked back sooner. Too worried about what waited ahead.</p><p>The car hit them. A jarring, brutal hit. Once. Twice.</p><p>The SUV flipped. Metal screamed. Glass shattered. The vehicle rolled across the road.</p><p>The air bags exploded. The world in front of Dee became a cloudy white.</p><p>Her claws ripped into the bags, cut them out of her way. She shoved the broken glass aside, managed to peer out the window\u2014</p><p>And saw that another car had come from the waning darkness. No, not a car this time. A truck\u2014coming right at them. At her.</p><p>Ambush. Fucking ambush.</p><p>Dee shoved against the metal, but the sun had already weakened her. Trapped. Pinned by the twisted door. \u201cSimon!\u201d</p><p>No answer. She turned to look at him. Not moving, slumped over the seat. \u201cSimon?\u201d A whisper now, not a scream.</p><p>No, no, this couldn\u2019t happen to him.</p><p>Blood loss, the easiest way to kill a vamp.</p><p>The car slammed into them again. Then the truck hit.</p><p>Metal tore into her flesh, cutting past the skin, driving into the muscle and all the way down to the bone.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>This time, before the darkness came, this time, he was her last thought.</p><p>And her regret.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>It was the pain that woke him. The sharp stabs of agony and the nauseating throbs that shuddered through his body. Simon forced his eyelids to lift.</p><p>Bright.</p><p>Too fucking bright.</p><p>His eyes closed. What the hell had happened? He and Dee had been driving down one long, lonely ass stretch of road. They\u2019d long since abandoned the Interstate. He\u2019d had her sweet scent in his nose. He\u2019d wondered when he\u2019d have her again, then\u2014</p><p>Lights.</p><p>The crunch of metal.</p><p>A scream.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>His eyes flew open. \u201cDee!\u201d Should have been a roar, but it came out more like a weak growl.</p><p>The SUV twisted around him. Bent, broken. Metal dug into his side, cut into his legs and held him pinned in the seat. The steering wheel\u2014shit, it felt like the thing was trying to go through his chest.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see Dee. The way he was trapped, Simon couldn\u2019t even turn enough to see her.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t hear her. Not the rasp of her breath. Not the thud of her heart.</p><p>But he could smell\u2014gasoline, rubber, and blood.</p><p>So much blood.</p><p>His. Hers.</p><p>Not Dee. No, not her.</p><p>The rays from the sun poured through the shattered windshield. He could feel the sun\u2019s powerful drain on his strength. Human. That\u2019s what he was right then.</p><p>And a human couldn\u2019t get out of this metal trap.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d His cry was louder now, but there was still no sound from her side of the car.</p><p>A long sliver of glass had shot through his right arm and embedded in the seat. Gritting his teeth, tasting blood, Simon wrenched his arm up.</p><p>Fire.</p><p>\u201cDee? Babe?\u201d He barely glanced at the mess he\u2019d made of his arm. He grabbed what looked like part of the hood and heaved it back toward the broken windshield. He managed to shove it about four inches. I hate the damn sun. But those inches were enough for him to see. \u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>Blood matted her blond hair. Her head hung limply from her neck, and blood dripped slowly, slowly, down her face and onto her lap.</p><p>\u201cBabe?\u201d</p><p>He should be able to hear her heartbeat. Yeah, damn it, his strength was low, but he should be able to hear\u2014</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Weak. So very weak. His breath caught, and he waited for another beat. Waited. Waited.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>\u201cLook at me!\u201d A scream. Fury, fear.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>But her eyes didn\u2019t open and he could see why. There was so much blood around her. So many wounds. So much pain. Shit\u2014it looked like someone had ran right into her. But they\u2019d been hit from behind, not from the side, hadn\u2019t they?</p><p>He shoved the broken metal again, freeing up more desperate inches. He could reach her now. Simon slid his fingers through that precious space and managed to brush her cheek.</p><p>Ice cold.</p><p>No throb from her heart.</p><p>Dying.</p><p>Dead?</p><p>The easiest way to kill a vampire...Everyone knew\u2014make \u2019em bleed.</p><p>The bastard that had come after them, no doubt one of Grim\u2019s Taken, had known just what he was doing.</p><p>He\u2019d struck at dawn, when the sun would keep them weak. He\u2019d left them trapped. Bleeding.</p><p>Not an easy death.</p><p>Slow.</p><p>Painful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grim would want them to die like this.</p><p>Sick fuck.</p><p>\u201cNot the way for you,\u201d Simon whispered and his fingers trembled as they feathered over Dee\u2019s bloodstained cheek. He took a breath, tried to catch her sweet scent, just once more.</p> <p>But he only scented blood now.</p><p>A soft tremble reached his ears, a small vibration. Her heart? Please, it had to be.</p><p>He caught the nape of Dee\u2019s neck and managed to tip back her head.</p><p>No moan came from her lips. No whisper of life.</p><p>Too late.</p> <p>No, no\u2014he wouldn\u2019t be too late. If she was gone\u2014</p><p>Stay, Dee. Stay.</p><p>He wrenched his shoulder but managed to position his wrist over her mouth. He wouldn\u2019t have much longer. He could feel the lick of cold in his own body. Not much longer.</p><p>But he\u2019d give her all that he had.</p><p>His wrist pushed between her lips. \u201cBite me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t. Her fangs weren\u2019t out. Her lips didn\u2019t move.</p> <p>\u201cBite me!\u201d A snarl of fury. She wouldn\u2019t die while he watched.</p><p>Thud.</p><p>The slightest press from her teeth.</p><p>Dee. Do it, babe. Bite me.</p><p>\u201cLive,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Vampire instinct took over. He\u2019d seen it happen before. Seen a vampire on the brink of death. His teeth had shot out and he\u2019d latched onto his food without conscious thought.</p><p>Dee\u2019s teeth sank into his flesh. His blood trickled into her mouth.</p><p>Take. \u201cTake.\u201d Everything.</p> <p>Her mouth tightened around him and she began to feed in earnest, greedy gulps as the bloodlust rose.</p><p>He would not watch her die.</p><p>Her lashes began to flutter.</p><p>But fate would make her watch him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done?\u201d Grim asked as his hunter stalked into the room.</p><p>A smile stretched the hunter\u2019s lips. Slow. Satisfied. \u201cBoth of them are bleeding out now. With the sun up, they\u2019ll never get out of that damn metal.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood.\u201d Fire had never been the best way to go. He saw that now. Blood, the slow drain, the agony of knowing what would come and being helpless to stop it\u2014</p><p>As I had been helpless.</p><p>\u2014that was the end for his enemies.</p><p>Grim turned away and stalked to his bed. The dancer lay there. Still alive, but low on blood. He\u2019d let her keep living a while longer. He\u2019d rather enjoyed her. \u201cWhich one do you think will die first?\u201d Not that it mattered. But the one left behind would have the greater torment. If there was an attachment there, and his vamps had told him the woman and Chase were close.</p><p>Lovers.</p><p>The body\u2019s needs and desires could make the soul weak.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch will go first.\u201d</p><p>Anger there. His brows drew together. \u201cDid something to piss you off, did she?\u201d Not surprising. Dee had earned her reputation for a reason.</p><p>In another life, he might have admired her.</p><p>In this life, he just needed her dead.</p><p>\u201cShe took the hardest hits. She\u2019ll die long before dusk. They both will.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d better.</p><p>\u201cDo you still feel him?\u201d his perfect hunter asked.</p><p>Him. Chase. The guy Leo had turned years before. Grim closed his eyes, tried to focus and find the ungrateful bastard but\u2014</p><p>Nothing. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s already dead.\u201d Maybe. But the truth was that he hadn\u2019t felt a connection to Chase since the Taken had traded with the warlock.</p><p>So Chase could still be alive, or he could be dead. Again.</p><p>He glanced over at the bed. The dancer was awake. She\u2019d been awake the whole time they talked, but she\u2019d kept her eyes closed. Like a good little girl, pretending to sleep.</p><p>Maybe because she didn\u2019t want to see. Maybe she wanted to pretend she wasn\u2019t involved in this.</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>His tongue slipped over the edge of his sharp teeth.</p><p>The dancer wasn\u2019t getting out of his den alive, but maybe he\u2019d Take her. Maybe.</p><p>She drank greedily, desperate, hungry, needing the blood that spilled onto her tongue. More. More.</p><p>Dee felt the ice rising in her body. The numbing cold, and she fought it, drinking as much of the warm liquid as she could.</p><p>Drinking.</p><p>Her eyes opened when the blood flow began to ease, and she squinted, staring at the bright light. The broken glass.</p><p>Attack. Two vehicles. One from behind, one from the side.</p><p>Right at dawn, when we were the weakest.</p><p>Smart bastards, she\u2019d give them that, she\u2019d give them\u2014</p><p>Simon\u2019s hand dropped.</p><p>Dee sucked in a sharp breath. What\u2014 \u201cSimon!\u201d The blood on her tongue, the warmth in her veins.</p><p>His.</p><p>All his.</p><p>She turned her head to the left, craning to see him. \u201cSimon!\u201d</p><p>A weak smile curved his lips. Such pale lips. Such tired eyes. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she whispered. Stupid to ask, she knew. She fumbled, managed to grab his hand and hold tight.</p><p>\u201cYou...had to live.\u201d</p><p>So did he. Dammit, so did he.</p><p>His eyes began to close. \u201cDon\u2019t...watch me...\u201d</p><p>Her fingers clenched around his. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get out of here.\u201d They were trapped in a damn tin can, but she\u2019d get them out.</p><p>Crushed. Smashed in by the two vehicles and left trapped. The bastards would pay.</p><p>\u201cPromise...don\u2019t watch...me\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed as he finished, \u201cDie.\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cSimon?\u201d The chill was back, raising the hairs on her arms and numbing her flesh. \u201cSimon?\u201d She squeezed his hand and realized what he\u2019d done.</p><p>His life, for her. Bastard.</p><p>Dee dropped his hand and shoved against the metal. Shoved and pushed and jerked and twisted and\u2014</p><p>Tears trekked down her cheeks as the sunlight poured onto her. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me!\u201d A scream.</p><p>Not like her father.</p><p>Her sister.</p><p>Her mother.</p><p>No one else would die for her. No one.</p><p>Dee screamed her fury into the light and kicked up with her knees. Bones snapped, flesh tore, but she fought through the pain and tried to tear her way out of the hell that held them in its hungry grasp.</p><p>When he saw the SUV, saw the metal tossed away on the side of the road, Zane\u2019s heart seemed to stop.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck.\u201d From Jude. The shifter had found him at the motel and helped him to kick the shit out of those vampires.</p><p>You won\u2019t find her. The bitch\u2019ll be dead before you even get close. Last words from one of the vamps.</p><p>Zane slammed on the brakes.</p><p>\u201cShe could still be alive!\u201d The fierce whisper came from Erin Jerome, Jude\u2019s lover. Of course, the woman had been at Jude\u2019s side when he\u2019d stormed up to the motel. Not like she was ever going to miss a good fight.</p><p>Zane jumped from the car, ran as fast as he could, and heard the thunder of Jude and Erin\u2019s footsteps behind them. Be alive. She had to be. Dee couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cFuck! Fuck! Fuck!\u201d Her scream. Dee.</p><p>His heart started beating again. He hurried around the side of the beaten metal pile, ready to rip and fight his way to her.</p><p>The passenger door flew at him.</p><p>Zane hit the ground. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cSimon! You open those eyes, you understand me? Open them!\u201d Then he saw Dee, crawling out of the car and dragging her vampire with her. Blood covered her, him, and the woman was snarling and swearing as she jerked out her man.</p><p>She stumbled, slipping, and Simon\u2019s weight hit her, knocking her flat.</p><p>Zane shoved up to his knees. \u201cDee!\u201d He should have known the woman wasn\u2019t dead. The ambush the vamps had set on her\u2014yeah, he\u2019d gotten the full details on that one, courtesy of some threats and the skillful use of Jude\u2019s claws\u2014hadn\u2019t succeeded. She was still alive, still fighting and\u2014</p><p>She rolled her vampire until he lay on the ground. Her hand smoothed over his cheek. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>And Zane realized she didn\u2019t know he was there.</p><p>Didn\u2019t know any of them were there.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out,\u201d she whispered and her fingers left a bloody trail on Simon\u2019s cheek. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay now, we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet hell.\u201d Erin tried to shove past him, but Jude caught her arms and held tight.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her softly, \u201cnot when she\u2019s like this. The bloodlust\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s head snapped toward them. Zane expected to see the black stare of a vampire driven to desperation, instead, he saw Dee\u2019s warm brown eyes, swimming with tears. \u201cHelp him.\u201d A demand, a plea. \u201cHelp him.\u201d</p><p>Zane reached a hand out to her.</p><p>She grabbed him. Damn, but the woman was fast, even with the sun out.</p><p>And strong.</p><p>Stronger than she should have been.</p><p>Her fingers clamped around his wrist. \u201cHe needs blood.\u201d</p><p>Clenching his jaw, Zane gave a nod. Not what he\u2019d ever do for anyone but her.</p><p>Dee used her claws to cut a thin line on his wrist. He held his hand over Simon\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou need blood, too,\u201d Erin said, her voice steady and strong. Zane\u2019s stare jumped to her and he saw that she had her wrist up. \u201cTake what you need.\u201d</p><p>Shifters didn\u2019t normally offer up their blood to vamps, but Zane knew there was a friendship between the two women. More than that.</p><p>Dee had risked death for Erin on one of the Night Watch cases. When you went to the line for someone like that, a bond formed.</p><p>Dee hesitated, but her fangs were already out.</p><p>Too much blood loss for both of them.</p><p>Chase\u2019s fangs weren\u2019t out yet, a bad sign. With the blood at his mouth, he should have responded by now.</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Erin reminded her. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>Dee took Erin\u2019s wrist. Bit.</p><p>Another link. Zane\u2019s attention moved to Jude. He already had his wrist up. The first time that the shifter had ever offered blood to a vamp.</p><p>But Dee wasn\u2019t just any vamp. She was one of their own.</p><p>After this day, they\u2019d be tied to one another, through Dee, forever.</p><p>His breath hissed out as a hot pain sliced his wrist. A quick glance showed that Simon\u2019s fangs were out now.</p><p>He just had to make sure the guy didn\u2019t take too much. After all, they had one hell of a fight waiting on them all.</p><p>A real bloodbath.</p><p>Simon awoke to darkness. Quiet, total darkness. No pain wracked his body. No cold chilled his soul.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>Or as alive as he could be.</p><p>\u201cYou scared the hell out of me.\u201d Dee\u2019s voice. Soft, shaking, and coming from right next to him.</p><p>His nostrils flared and he inhaled her scent. Rich, sensual. His Dee.</p><p>When he concentrated, he heard the drum of her heart. Strong and steady.</p><p>He rolled and realized he was in a bed. In a bed with Dee. Don\u2019t need anything else. Simon reached for her and touched warm flesh.</p><p>Her lips crushed down on his. A hard, angry kiss. Fury and passion. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again,\u201d she ordered and kissed him again. Harder.</p><p>His mouth opened beneath hers and her tongue swiped inside. Yes. His arms rose and locked around her body.</p><p>Her nipples stabbed into his chest. Naked. He felt every inch of her sweet flesh against him. Every single inch.</p><p>She shifted against him, straddling his thighs, and she rose above him. \u201cYou nearly died.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had adjusted perfectly to the darkness so that he could see that fierce tilt of her jaw. \u201cYou were going to live.\u201d The choice had been easy for him.</p><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d Her nails raked down his chest. He didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d both gotten naked, but he sure wasn\u2019t going to complain about it right then. \u201cWhat the hell gives you the right to make that kind of choice?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He caught her hand. Brought it to his mouth and pressed a kiss to her palm. Because I love you.</p><p>Monsters could love. Vampires who stalked the night could feel.</p><p>They weren\u2019t soul-less devils. They yearned. They wanted.</p><p>They loved.</p><p>The woman had worked her way right under his skin and into his soul. He hadn\u2019t even seen the threat coming until it was too late.</p><p>But then her heart had trembled and he\u2019d known she was slipping away\u2014my life for hers, in an instant.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Hell, he knew he\u2019d really fallen for her long before. When he\u2019d first started to watch her. To see how bravely she fought. How fiercely she protected the ones she thought were Innocents.</p><p>He blew lightly against her fingers and saw the shiver that worked the length of her body. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let you die, not when I could save you.\u201d And she would have died. One look at her injuries and he\u2019d known they were much, much worse than his.</p><p>\u201cYou do that again...\u201d She lifted onto her knees and glared at him, but had to swallow before she could mumble, \u201cI-I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><p>Sweet. He almost smiled. Almost. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fuck me instead?\u201d His cock was up, so stiff it hurt, and the memory of her cold flesh seared his mind.</p><p>Warmth.</p><p>Life.</p><p>Sex.</p><p>He wanted it, her\u2014and he wanted to claim her right then.</p><p>Where they were, what the hell had happened to them, how they\u2019d both survived\u2014those details could come later.</p><p>Now, he just needed her.</p><p>Her fingers wrapped around his cock. Her grip, warm and strong, tightened around him. Simon\u2019s breath hissed out as she guided him to her sex.</p><p>Wet\u2014warmer. Hot.</p><p>Flesh to flesh. Sex to sex.</p><p>His cock pushed past the quivering lips that guarded her core. He felt the brief resistance of her inner muscles, the strain to accommodate his length. With a flex of his hips, he drove deep in a long, steady glide.</p><p>Her eyes held his. The brown bled away until only darkness remained.</p><p>A darkness to match his own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rose above him, slowly at first, letting him feel the wet retreat of her sex, the soft silk of her body. His fingers clenched around her hips and he pushed her back, arching up with a hard thrust.</p><p>Still her eyes stayed on his.</p><p>He could see the edge of her fangs, but she made no move to drink from him.</p> <p>Her sex squeezed him, and she rose again. A long-torture-him move. Sweat beaded his brow as he watched her. The heat and fury of their previous lovemaking was gone. This was different.</p><p>He pushed up and his mouth closed over her nipple. He sucked her, licked, laving with his tongue. Such tender flesh.</p><p>Her fingers sank into his hair and she held him close as she rose again, then sank back down, taking his cock balls-deep in her slick heat.</p><p>The need to thrust, to shove deep and take control, pounded through him, but he yanked the lust back on its leash.</p><p>She needed this. So did he.</p> <p>Softness, restraint. Control.</p><p>For once.</p><p>Because death had been too close.</p><p>Her fingers tugged at his hair and his mouth freed her breast. He looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Like he had to be asked.</p> <p>Her head lowered and her mouth took his. No fury this time. Only need.</p><p>Only need.</p><p>Her hips rocked against him, the slow motions driving him out of his mind.</p><p>Not yet. Can\u2019t come yet.</p><p>Her tongue licked across his lips. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>Rise. Fall.</p><p>The hot fist of her sex milking his cock.</p><p>His thighs clenched beneath her and his spine stiffened.</p> <p>\u201cI thought...\u201d She drove down on him, a bit harder now, a little more desperate. \u201cTh-that you\u2019d die on me.\u201d</p><p>That had been the plan.</p><p>Her fingers slipped down his neck. Caught his shoulder and her nails dug into the skin. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d stilled on him. Her sex was so tight and hot and she\u2019d stilled.</p><p>His breath heaved out. All he could smell was her. All he could taste was her. Feel\u2014her. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d he gritted, his cock ready to burst. One more glide, just one.</p><p>Her nails dug deeper and her slender hips didn\u2019t move. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her. Nowhere to hide. \u201cBecause I would fucking die for you. I nearly did.\u201d</p><p>The bloodlust, no the lust for her, only her, broke free. He grabbed her hips and shoved up, deep and hard, and she came around him, choking out a cry as her eyes widened and the ripples of her release contracted around his cock.</p><p>He climaxed on a long, hot wave of pleasure and he held her, as tight as he could, and knew that no way, no fucking way, was he gonna let Sandra Dee go.</p><p>He\u2019d die for her, and, hell, yeah, he\u2019d kill for her. In a heartbeat.</p><p>Because the truth was the woman held his heart in her hand. In the same hand that she usually held her beloved stakes.</p><p>When her heartbeat slowed down and the tremors finally left her body, Dee sucked in a deep breath. Probably shouldn\u2019t have jumped him right away.</p><p>But she\u2019d needed him. Too close to death.</p><p>Her nails raked down his chest. Paused over the heart that raced beneath her touch. He watched her, with eyes gone smoky again.</p><p>\u201cWe were out for two days,\u201d she told him, aware that her voice was too husky. A good orgasm did that to her, though, and with Simon, the orgasms were always good.</p><p>Her sex clenched with a little aftershock of pleasure and she saw his pupils flare.</p><p>Move. Before she took him again. No, before he took her. His cock was swelling again, growing and stretching and pressing just where she needed him to\u2014</p><p>Dee pushed up on her knees and carefully separated their bodies. They\u2019d have company soon, and as much as she\u2019d like another ride, the pleasure would have to wait.</p><p>Dealing with the psychotic undead came first.</p><p>Simon\u2019s gaze dropped to her sex and he licked his lips.</p><p>Dee swallowed and rolled away from him. \u201cWe\u2019re at a motel, about three hours away from Hueco.\u201d They\u2019d retreated. Well, not them so much as Zane and Jude had retreated for them. Because when the hunters had first found her and Simon, she hadn\u2019t exactly been in a frame of mind to help out and plan much.</p><p>But Jude and Zane had been right. Retreat was the only option. They\u2019d been too weak for anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I feel so good?\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder and saw him staring down at his unmarred chest. No wounds. The horrible gashes were gone now. Grabbing her shirt, she told him quietly, \u201cShifter blood.\u201d Plus a helping of demon blood.</p><p>But it was the shifter blood given freely by Erin and Jude that had really healed them. There was power in a shifter\u2019s blood. Shifters were beings that some believed carried two spirits and with two spirits, the strength influx was double.</p><p>Without that shifter blood, they\u2019d both still be unconscious, their bodies struggling to heal from their wounds.</p><p>\u201cIt was a fucking ambush, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dee found a pair of panties and shimmied into them before yanking up her\u2014</p><p>\u201cI love your ass.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him. Yep, his gaze was on her butt. She hiked up the jeans.</p><p>His gaze rose to her face. \u201cYour Night Watch hunters got us out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured the demon would be coming. I knew he\u2019d get you out of that metal hell. Just had to make sure you survived long enough.\u201d</p><p>The rage stirred then, and she\u2019d tried so hard to keep the fury in check. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how long you survived, huh?\u201d</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou left me in that trap, alone, and I could hear you dying\u2014\u201d Her voice broke at the end. Weak. Hell.</p><p>A muscle flexed in his jaw. \u201cAnd before I forced you to drink, I saw you dying. My choice, Dee. Mine. You can bet that I\u2019ll do anything to save you. Anything.\u201d</p><p>The emotion was there, swimming in his eyes.</p><p>She wanted him again. Wanted his arms around her and his flesh against hers. Clearing her throat, she managed to say, \u201cWhen this is over...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fucking love you forever.\u201d Bald. Flat. No hesitancy. Just stating a fact.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cRemember that, okay? When the shit comes down on us again, or when you learn that my past isn\u2019t nearly as pretty as it should be, just remember. You come first for me, and you always will.\u201d A hard shake of his head. \u201cIt just took me a while to realize it. What can I say? Sometimes, my priorities are shit.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll fucking love you forever.</p><p>No one had ever said that to her before. No one and she\u2014</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she felt. There was no ready response on her tongue. She could only stare at him and realize that the curve of his lips looked sad.</p><p>Because he understood. He knew her better than any of the others ever had.</p><p>A rap sounded at their door. \u201cPlaytime\u2019s over,\u201d Zane called out.</p><p>But Simon\u2019s stare didn\u2019t waver.</p><p>She should say something. Anything. Her hands shook as she pressed the snap of her jeans. Her sex\u2014inside, she could still feel him. \u201cThe plan...\u201d she cleared her throat and tried again. \u201cThe plan\u2019s to attack tonight. We go in under the darkness and we hit them fast and hard. They\u2014they won\u2019t expect us.\u201d Thanks to Erin and some magic strings she\u2019d pulled, the story of their \u201cdeath\u201d had made the local headlines. \u201cIf luck\u2019s on our side, they won\u2019t even know we\u2019re attacking until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrim will know.\u201d Certain.</p><p>Her jaw locked. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll die.\u201d Because this madness was ending. Revenge\u2014hell, why did it seem so empty now? Why, when she looked at Simon, did she just want to run to him and\u2014</p><p>To run away with him.</p><p>No. Grim wouldn\u2019t stop if they fled. If he found out they were alive, he wouldn\u2019t stop until they were dust.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t walk away with a monster like him out there. Because there would be other families. Like hers. Like Nina\u2019s.</p><p>Nina.</p><p>Was she still alive? Where was she? Dee had thought of her when the pain eased and the bloodlust lessened. Zane had gone out scouting, but he\u2019d found no sign of the woman.</p><p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t gone after Grim. Maybe she\u2019d just run.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t blame her. Not a bit.</p><p>A harder knock shook the door. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking Grim out, we need to move.\u201d</p><p>Yet Simon stood, as still as a statue before her.</p><p>Because he was waiting on her to say something.</p><p>I\u2019ll fucking love you forever.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t know what to say. Her throat was tight. Her heart nearly ripping through her chest.</p><p>And she was afraid.</p><p>When she loved, people got hurt.</p><p>So Dee swallowed back the words that wanted to rise up and she held his stare, so scared of what he made her feel.</p><p>Simon finally turned away, and grabbed the clothes she\u2019d lain out for him.</p><p>Her shoulders fell. Emotion. She\u2019d never been good with feelings. Never understood them, not the good ones, anyway.</p><p>Rage. Hate. Vengeance. Her life. Those she understood.</p><p>Love? That scared her. Love led to pain. She\u2019d had enough pain.</p><p>But when Simon had said he loved her...</p><p>Her heart had stopped. Her breath had died.</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t know what she felt for him. She wanted him, needed him, and if anyone tried to hurt him, she\u2019d kick some ass.</p><p>Love\u2014what was it, really?</p><p>Spending forever with someone? She glanced at Simon. All she could see was his strong, stiff back.</p><p>Her hands still trembled so she balled them into fists. Not now. This wasn\u2019t the time.</p><p>But things weren\u2019t going to end like this.</p><p>Forever? Dee exhaled. Marriage and a picket fence had never been for her, she knew that, even before her change. Her life was too hard. She was too hard for someone to love.</p><p>No, Simon said he loves me.</p><p>She turned away and gave him a few minutes to dress. And she gave herself some time to get herself together. Seriously, she had to get a grip.</p><p>When he was done, she schooled her features, and they marched to the door. With a jerk of her wrist, she opened the door. Zane waited for her, his hands crossed over his chest. The paleness that had drawn his features before\u2014because of the blood he\u2019d lost\u2014was gone.</p><p>His hooded gaze raked her. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re up for this?\u201d</p><p>Of course not. But there were only two options: Kill or die. Dee cleared her throat, then asked, \u201cAre you?\u201d She\u2019d tried to ditch him once, and, in typical Zane style, he\u2019d come through to save her butt.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to risk him, but knew there was no way he\u2019d let her get in another sucker punch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your backup, baby.\u201d</p><p>A snarl sounded behind her and one black brow rose. \u201cGuess lover boy\u2019s awake, huh?\u201d Zane asked.</p><p>The floor creaked. \u201cYeah, he is.\u201d Simon came to her side. She glanced back and forth between the two men. Simon\u2019s jaw worked and then he managed, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A crooked smile twisted Zane\u2019s lips. \u201cHard, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like Dee.\u201d The smile vanished. \u201cGiving you my blood was harder.\u201d</p><p>A grim nod. \u201cI won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd believe me, I call in my debts.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did.</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze turned back to Dee. \u201cWhat are our odds?\u201d</p><p>She forced a shrug. \u201cI figure about forty-sixty.\u201d</p><p>A low whistle. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>Dead right. Dee squared her shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d Before more vamps came hunting for her. She didn\u2019t want to be caught off-guard again. Three recent, brutal attacks. When Grim wanted you dead, the guy just didn\u2019t stop. Now that she was Born, he was desperate to stop that \u201cprophecy\u201d from coming true.</p><p>Grim didn\u2019t fuck around.</p><p>He was about to learn that neither did she.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>He\u2019d pay his debt to the demon, one way or another. Simon stalked across the barren earth, keeping his head low as he followed the male shifter to Grim\u2019s lair.</p><p>Jude Donovan moved easily over the rough terrain, never taking a misstep, and his woman, the deceptively delicate ADA Erin Jerome, kept perfect pace with him. Another shifter. The guy\u2019s mate.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t know much about her, other than that she worked in the Baton Rouge prosecutor\u2019s office and that the tiger was very, very possessive of her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given him blood, something else he knew. Probably because the tiger wouldn\u2019t allow her to link with a male vampire.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Jude\u2019s nearly soundless voice had the group pausing.</p><p>Simon glanced over at Dee. Heavily armed, eyes shining in the darkness, she was one fine sight to behold.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Erin asked, casting a quick glance at the ramshackle buildings that waited in the distance. They couldn\u2019t get much closer or the vamps would catch the distinct scent of the shifters. They\u2019d have to hang back for now, with the demon. \u201cJust walking right up to him, um, that doesn\u2019t seem like the best plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the best plan. But it\u2019s all we\u2019ve got now.\u201d Dee\u2019s eyes narrowed on the line of buildings. \u201cHow many, Jude?\u201d</p><p>His head cocked. \u201cTen vamps. Two humans, but\u2014\u201d His nose twitched. \u201cSomebody\u2019s dying in there.\u201d</p><p>Simon stiffened. Of course, Grim would be having one of his parties.</p><p>\u201cNina?\u201d Dee whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Erin asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Ignitor I told you about,\u201d Zane said, his voice emotionless.</p><p>Erin shook her head. \u201cIgnitors make me nervous. Anyone who can burn the flesh from me with just a look...\u201d She shuddered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon tossed her a long, level stare. \u201cTrust me, the vamps in there are a hell of lot scarier than she is.\u201d They could be killing her while they stood outside, shooting the damn shit. He stepped forward and heard Erin\u2019s mocking laugh.</p><p>Her claws flashed before his eyes. Wickedly sharp and very, very long. \u201cThe day I\u2019m afraid of a vamp is the day, well, hell, it\u2019s the day that\u2019ll never come.\u201d</p><p>He could only shake his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll come, trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She jerked her thumb toward a watchful Dee. \u201cIt\u2019s her I trust.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Did he have to worry about an attack from her, too?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s hurt, Jude?\u201d Dee demanded, seeming to ignore the byplay.</p><p>Jude\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cHuman. That\u2019s all I know. So much blood in the air.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say for certain.\u201d</p><p>Dee inhaled deeply. \u201cYeah, I can smell it.\u201d</p> <p>So could Simon. A scent that had once repelled him but now slipped inside and tempted him closer. \u201cLet\u2019s go join the party,\u201d Simon muttered. Before the party joined them. Every second they stood out there, they risked exposure.</p><p>If they were slipping in, now was the time.</p><p>Dee gave a curt nod. \u201cStay back,\u201d she told the others. \u201cIf this goes to hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be there to pull you out,\u201d Zane finished quietly.</p><p>Her eyes shifted, became black to match the darkness. \u201cNo, if I die, you get out of here, fast, because, Zane, you might be a badass, but no way can a demon take down a Born. Especially not one who\u2019s been around for so long.\u201d</p><p>At least a thousand years. Plenty of time to amass power. A whole freaking army.</p> <p>One that he hadn\u2019t called to his side. Why not?</p><p>\u201cYou guys should go now,\u201d Dee said, voice rising a bit. Her hands balled to rest on her hips. \u201cI can feel\u2014there\u2019s really not much time left.\u201d</p><p>What? Not much time, she\u2014</p><p>Jude\u2019s head jerked. \u201cShit. They\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>A faint, sad smile from Dee. \u201cNot they. He.\u201d Her gaze tracked to Simon. \u201cI really thought he\u2019d find us sooner.\u201d</p><p>Simon blinked. Grim? The bastard knew\u2014</p><p>Jude swore and grabbed his mate\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Dee said again. \u201cCome dawn, this will be over.\u201d</p> <p>One way or another.</p><p>The shifters vanished into the shadows. They had to move fast or the vampires would find them. Then they\u2019d drain all that powerful blood.</p><p>Zane held his ground.</p><p>\u201cI need you as backup,\u201d she told him, but didn\u2019t look the demon\u2019s way. No, her eyes were on the shadows that crept ever closer. So close now. \u201cZane, go.\u201d</p><p>The demon left. Disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>Grim is coming.</p><p>Simon gave his head a hard shake. \u201cHow does he know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her broken laugh carried on the wind. \u201cOh, Simon, did you really think he wouldn\u2019t be able to feel you? This close?\u201d</p><p>He tested the spell. No, it was still there, still\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe knows, Simon, and he\u2019s coming.\u201d Calm. He realized he was part of her plan. The lure to draw out Grim.</p><p>She stepped toward him and reached for his hand. \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been waiting for. We\u2019ll end this tonight.\u201d</p><p>They had the weapons. She had the promised strength. And he wouldn\u2019t turn on her.</p><p>A streak of fire lit up the night. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNina!\u201d Dee spun away. \u201cNo! She\u2019s here and she\u2019s going after Grim!\u201d</p><p>His vampiress ran toward the flames.</p><p>And he went after her. Walking into the fire. No, running into it.</p><p>As his legs thundered across that barren Texas soil, he felt a brush in his mind, then the soft echo of a voice.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, bastard.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head jerked up when he saw the flash of flames. Oh, shit. Not good.</p><p>The human\u2014Nina\u2014she\u2019d get her ass killed.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s what she wanted. To die so she could join her family.</p><p>He\u2019d wondered about Dee once. Wondered if she didn\u2019t take the toughest cases because she wanted out, too.</p><p>Humans didn\u2019t understand. Getting out was the easy part.</p><p>He slid a stake out of his bag. One of Dee\u2019s, of course. A tiger\u2019s roar echoed in the distance and he knew that Jude and Erin were scouting the area, eliminating guards and doing their best to make sure the coming bloodbath didn\u2019t take out the good guys.</p><p>Not that any of them were really that good.</p><p>He watched the flames a moment. They were racing across the roof of the building on the far left. The building that looked like some old stable.</p><p>The fury of an Ignitor. Something to see.</p><p>His fingers clenched around the stake.</p><p>A scream pierced the air. A long, tortured scream\u2014a cry that was ripped from a woman\u2019s throat.</p><p>The flames flickered. Began to die.</p><p>Because Nina was dying?</p><p>No. Not another death on her hands. Dee raced forward with a fierce burst of speed. Two vamps came out at her, but she knocked them back, swiping her claws over one\u2019s throat and burying a stake in another\u2019s flesh. She missed his heart, but he hit the ground, shrieking loud enough to make a girl think he was dying.</p><p>So much for a quiet entry.</p><p>But being quiet didn\u2019t really matter now. Grim knew they were out there.</p><p>She turned, following the woman\u2019s scream and the thickening scent of blood. A house, ranch-style, waited. Dee didn\u2019t bother with the door. She hurtled through the big picture window, Simon\u2019s curse following her.</p><p>Rolling, she jumped to her feet, claws up, ready for anything, ready for\u2014</p><p>Death. A woman, with long, dark hair twisted over her face, lay on the bed. The white sheets beneath her were stained red.</p><p>More glass shattered behind her as Simon fought his way into the room.</p><p>Her gaze searched over the area. The odors of sex and blood were everywhere. But that woman wasn\u2019t Nina.</p><p>The hair on her nape rose and Dee spun around.</p><p>He stood in the doorway. The bastard who had haunted her nightmares. Tall and lean, his hair streaked with gold and his eyes pitch black. \u201cBeen a long time, little Sandra Dee.\u201d Grim paused. \u201cI knew the fools hadn\u2019t managed to take you out.\u201d His dark stare swept over her body, slowly. Not sexually. No interest there. Just an assessment. Thorough. He shrugged. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be easier to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re not the first person to make that mistake.\u201d She\u2019d never forgotten his face and his soul-less eyes.</p><p>Beside her, Simon stood as still as freaking stone. The bastard was trying to get back in his head. She didn\u2019t have to be a mind-reader to know that was coming.</p><p>Even though she was a mind reader now.</p><p>Deliberately, Dee stepped in front of Simon. Her turn.</p><p>Grim\u2019s lips quirked, but he made no move to attack. \u201cYou\u2019re too late to save her.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s gaze darted to the bed.</p><p>A cold laugh. \u201cNot her. She doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He smirked. \u201cThe witch.\u201d</p><p>Her blood iced. No, no, he was just screwing with her. Catalina was long gone. She\u2019d run so she wouldn\u2019t face the fire.</p><p>\u201cShe had her uses, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d He lifted his hand, then pointed right over Dee\u2019s shoulder. Straight at Simon. \u201cAfter all, with just a little fire, she gave me...you.\u201d</p><p>Her gut knotted. Why had the fire been in that old stable? If Nina were attacking, why hadn\u2019t she set her fire here in the main house?</p><p>\u201cCan you feel me, asshole?\u201d Grim snarled at Simon, and the smile left his face. \u201cBecause I can damn well feel you.\u201d</p><p>Dee glanced back. Sweat coated Simon\u2019s face and his eyes flickered back and forth, back and forth, from black to gray. Torment etched deep lines onto his face. \u201cGet...out,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He\u2019ll turn on you.</p><p>Screw this.</p><p>\u201cWitches can burn so fast,\u201d Grim murmured, \u201cbut your witch, I made sure she\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dee leapt forward.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to kill them all?\u201d Grim shook his head and lunged to meet her. One hand ripped the stake from her fingers and her wrist cracked beneath his hold. His right hand grabbed her neck, held tight, and he lifted her off the ground. \u201cDo you? Because I can kill every one of those bastards you brought to my land. Your demon, your stinking animals\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane. Jude. Hell, Erin.</p><p>\u201cThe witch let me back in.\u201d He brought his face close to hers. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to touch the dark magic, not at first, but when the fire started, she was all too eager.\u201d</p><p>Dee couldn\u2019t breathe. If he snapped her neck, she\u2019d be helpless. Paralyzed, but still living, until her body could heal. He wouldn\u2019t give her the time to heal. He\u2019d stake her. Behead her. Burn her\u2014</p><p>Like he\u2019d burned Catalina?</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t Simon helping her? Attack. Get the bastard! Her mental cry blasted out, and she tried to reach him desperately on their blood link.</p><p>And she slammed into a brick wall. A wall that hadn\u2019t been between their minds before.</p><p>Grim.</p><p>He yanked her close to his face. \u201cI had him first, and I have him again.\u201d He threw her against the wall. Dee hit, hard, and her body shuddered at the impact.</p><p>She glanced up to see Grim studying Simon with raised brows. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who caused all this trouble for me.\u201d</p><p>A fine tremble worked down Simon\u2019s stiff length.</p><p>Grim shook his head. \u201cUsually, the willing are the easiest to control. And you were willing, weren\u2019t you, Chase? So ready to live forever.\u201d</p><p>His choice. Dee shoved up to her knees. Simon?</p><p>Damn brick wall. She couldn\u2019t see it, but she knew it was there and she wanted to smash her fist right through it.</p><p>Simon\u2019s eyes jerked toward her. A flash of smoky gray. He lifted his leg, as if he were going to take a step.</p><p>\u201cA puppet on a string.\u201d</p><p>He froze.</p><p>Grim laughed again. \u201cToo damn easy.\u201d He turned his head toward her. \u201cI can make him do anything, you know. Anything.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s fingers brushed against her ankle holster. Not packing a gun. Old faithful.</p><p>\u201cI wonder...\u201d His gaze rose to the broken window. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s still alive? The flames should have taken the stable by now.\u201d</p><p>But the flames had flickered. She\u2019d seen them waver right before she\u2019d heard the scream. The scream had brought her here, instead of to the fire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking liar.\u201d Dee rose to her feet, keeping her hands close to her sides. \u201cCatalina is nowhere near here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy men caught her right after she left the motel.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI knew where you were, every minute. I knew.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d gotten his vamps to follow and attack her and Simon. Then to attack Zane. Yeah, he\u2019d told her all about his run-in with the vamp crew.</p><p>Had Grim gotten to Catalina, too? Her heart kicked up in her chest. If I go with you, I\u2019ll burn.</p><p>Maybe Cat had been seeing her future after all.</p><p>Dee\u2019s gaze jerked to the flames she could see in the distance. Was Cat still alive?</p><p>The flames danced.</p><p>Sweat began to slick her palms. Couldn\u2019t afford that, not now. \u201cSimon.\u201d She said his name deliberately, injecting fury into the word.</p><p>His head jerked.</p><p>Grim\u2019s brows pulled together. \u201cYou know, I was going to kill you...but it\u2019ll be more fun if he does the deed for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cI\u2019m all about fun.\u201d Time\u2019s running out. The fire.</p><p>Grim\u2019s attention shifted totally to Simon. \u201cKill the bitch.\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s lips peeled back, revealing his fangs. \u201cFuck...off.\u201d He shuddered, shaking so hard it looked like he was convulsing.</p><p>Or fighting one very strong compulsion.</p><p>Fighting for me.</p><p>Just like she\u2019d fight for him.</p><p>When Grim\u2019s jaw dropped, Dee attacked. She jumped at him, ready for his attack this time, and when he went to grab her, she drove her right hand into his side. Her claws dug deep, and the broken bones throbbed in a sickening wave. She rammed her head into him and her left hand came up, the stake ready.</p><p>She drove it right at his heart. It plunged into his flesh, but he twisted and she knew she\u2019d missed her mark. Dee wrenched the stake, jerking it to the left, and Grim snarled.</p><p>Then she took him down. Her right leg hooked under his and she tripped him, knocking him flat like Pak had taught her so long ago.</p><p>She kept that stake in him, because she would finish him, one way or another.</p><p>Hold on, Catalina.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s gaze jerked up just as Nina came barreling through the door. Blood covered her shirt, reddened her hands and face.</p><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t! He\u2019s mine!\u201d Nina yelled.</p><p>It was a fury Dee understood, but, really, dead was dead. It didn\u2019t matter to her who made the kill. They\u2019d all have their vengeance.</p><p>Fire raced across the carpet, coming straight at Dee. \u201cMine!\u201d Nina screamed again.</p><p>Dee sprang back, slipped, and fell to the floor. If the Ignitor wanted her justice, fine, then she could have it.</p><p>Nina\u2019s hands dug into the door frame and her breath shuddered out. \u201cHad to...leave...witch alive...couldn\u2019t let...\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>The fire drifted into smoke.</p><p>Grim sat up. His fingers curled around the stake, and he yanked it out. Blood spattered onto the floor, the wall. \u201cNice try.\u201d His teeth snapped together. \u201cLast try.\u201d</p><p>Nina sobbed behind him.</p><p>And color her fucking stupid. Dee\u2019s jaw dropped. What had he told her just moments before? \u201cI knew where you were, every minute. I knew.\u201d Not because he\u2019d linked with Simon. No, that link hadn\u2019t kicked in until\u2014until he\u2019d broken Catalina. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That meant\u2014hell. Her eyes lifted to meet Nina\u2019s glittering and teary stare.</p><p>So blind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past time for you to die,\u201d the Ignitor said, not to Grim, but to Dee. Nina\u2019s skin was so pale. The blood looked like bright red clown makeup on her flesh.</p> <p>\u201cHe killed your family!\u201d Dee snarled.</p><p>The Ignitor smiled. \u201cThat was the price.\u201d</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t dare look Simon\u2019s way. If she could keep their focus, he might be able to break free of Grim. Maybe. \u201cThe price of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy services.\u201d She waved her hand and fire snaked out to circle Dee.</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>\u201cFor my fire, he had to kill my family.\u201d</p><p>Dee surged to her feet. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just do it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they knew what I was.\u201d Spoken with sadness.</p><p>Dee stared into her eyes and knew, too. It wasn\u2019t that Nina was an Ignitor.</p><p>She was a monster. Down to the soul.</p><p>\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let me get close enough to kill them. They left me\u2014I was sixteen and they left me.\u201d Nina\u2019s lips flattened. \u201cIt took me so long to track them.\u201d</p> <p>And longer to find a vamp willing to take them out.</p><p>Grim\u2019s hard laugh filled the room. \u201cTore didn\u2019t know. For once, the bastard didn\u2019t know the game.\u201d</p><p>Dee swallowed back the sick rage that boiled in her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re one fine actress, Nina.\u201d She\u2019d known just how to act. Just what to do. From the corner of her eye, Dee saw that Grim had risen to his feet. He had her stake gripped in his hand. The only thing that separated the two of them was Nina\u2019s small line of flames.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I owe you for that bit,\u201d Nina said.</p><p>Dee\u2019s breath caught. What?</p><p>\u201cI saw you. That night, when your family burned...\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been dead long before the fire.</p><p>\u201cI was there, watching.\u201d A cold smile. \u201cAnd making those flames dance. Grim wanted a sample of my power, and I gave it to him.\u201d</p> <p>But she would have been\u2014</p><p>Around sixteen. Close to Dee\u2019s own age.</p><p>Guess it hadn\u2019t taken her that long to find her vamp. He\u2019d just taken his sweet time killing for her.</p><p>The better to control his weapon.</p><p>\u201cI had a sister, too,\u201d Nina murmured. \u201cI wonder\u2014Grim, did she beg like hers?\u201d</p><p>Dee snapped. She raced right through the fire, barely feeling the lick of the flames as she went after that burning bitch.</p><p>She punched Nina. A hard hit right in the jaw and down, down she went, those eyes closing, the flames dying and\u2014</p><p>\u201cKill her. Fucking kill her,\u201d Grim ordered.</p><p>Arms grabbed her, held tight. Her claws raked against flesh that was warm and strong and familiar.</p><p>Her heart stopped as his scent filled her nostrils. Simon.</p><p>\u201cS-sorry...\u201d His gasped whisper, right in her ear.</p><p>Then his fangs sank into her throat.</p><p>The flames drew him closer. Zane moved easily, keeping low to the ground and staying in the shadows. He\u2019d expected to see more vamps around the place. He\u2019d taken out two, had found the signs to indicate Dee and Simon had eliminated at least two others.</p><p>The fire flared higher and he caught the faintest of sounds beneath the crackle. A whimper.</p><p>His blood seemed to ice. He rushed through the open stable doors, heading through the thick curtain of smoke.</p><p>A broken, twisted doll lay on the ground. She\u2019d curled into a ball and the flames were closing in on her. He\u2019d know that long mane of white-blond hair any place. Hell, no.</p><p>He ripped off his shirt and began beating at the fire. Trying to shove it back as best he could.</p><p>Too big. Too strong.</p><p>Zane sucked in a sharp breath and tried to focus his energy. He was strong enough for this. He had to be.</p><p>The whisper of wind blew across his face. Wind he\u2019d stirred. With a push, he sent the wind against the fire and the flames shifted, chasing to the left with the force of the wind.</p><p>There, just enough. He jumped through the flames. Zane grabbed Catalina and threw her over his shoulder. She was so stiff, so still.</p><p>He covered his mouth with her shirt and ran back through the fire. Can\u2019t keep it down. Can\u2019t stop it.</p><p>The smoke, a thick wall of gray, blocked his vision but he shoved forward. If he couldn\u2019t find the doors, he\u2019d just tear down a wall. He\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d A vamp loomed from the smoke, teeth bared, claws out.</p><p>No time for this shit.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard Catalina draw a breath. Hadn\u2019t heard a sound from her since that faint whimper.</p><p>Keeping one arm secured around Catalina, he grabbed the vamp and heaved him back into the fire.</p><p>Then he took out a wall and got his witch to safety.</p><p>It\u2019s all right, Cat. I won\u2019t let the flames get you.</p><p>Her worst fear. One that had come true too many times for her.</p><p>And for him.</p><p>The fresh air slapped him in the face and a shout broke from the line of houses. More vampires, coming fast.</p><p>He ran for the woods and really hoped Jude would appear to cover his ass.</p><p>In the distance, a tiger roared.</p><p>About fucking time. Jude had better have his sexy little lady by his side, because they were going to need her to take out these bloodsuckers.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Dee\u2019s body trembled against his and Simon tightened his hold around her slender form.</p><p>Her blood flowed onto his tongue and with it, their link strengthened. The voice that had been shouting in his mind since he\u2019d followed Dee inside this hell finally quieted, and his focus shifted back to\u2014</p><p>Her.</p><p>Kill Dee?</p><p>No fucking way.</p><p>His eyes closed for just a moment and his teeth eased from her neck. His tongue swept over her flesh. The sensual caress was the only reassurance he could offer her then.</p><p>\u201cI said to kill the bitch!\u201d Grim\u2019s fierce shout.</p><p>Simon\u2019s head lifted and he stared at the Born he\u2019d fought to keep out of his head for so long. The man who\u2019d ordered the hit on his family. On Dee\u2019s.</p><p>The Ignitor lay on the floor. Still unconscious because his Dee didn\u2019t screw around.</p><p>Neither did he.</p><p>Dee laughed. \u201cThe man might die for me, nearly has, but no way would he ever kill me.\u201d</p><p>Damn but he loved her.</p><p>He met Grim\u2019s dark gaze. The bastard\u2019s hold had all but vanished now. Whether from Dee\u2019s touch, her blood, or just her, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>But the end had come. Not for them, but for Grim. \u201cYour brother sends his greetings, Grim. I think he really hopes you enjoy hell.\u201d</p><p>The Born\u2019s face changed then, went slack with surprise and a flash of pain. Grim\u2019s gaze leapt to the bed. To the still form of the woman. \u201cI\u2019m not...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cTore can\u2019t kill me, he\u2019s not here, I\u2019d know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not killing you.\u201d Dee\u2019s body vibrated in his grasp. \u201cWe are.\u201d</p><p>Grim\u2019s stare snapped to them and his lips rose. \u201cStill on that, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we are.\u201d So fierce, his Dee.</p><p>\u201cA fresh vamp and a fool who couldn\u2019t appreciate the new life he\u2019d been given?\u201d</p><p>Enough talk. Time to end\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour knight, is he?\u201d Grim sneered at that. \u201cDon\u2019t you know, dear Dee, he\u2019s been luring you in\u2014for me\u2014from the beginning?\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s hands dug into her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThat attack in the alley. The near hit with the gunshot. Your lover arranged that. He almost got you killed.\u201d</p><p>Dee glanced up at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd that woman, the one who died so well for my men. Grace, wasn\u2019t it, Simon?\u201d</p><p>Grace. Dee\u2019s friend. The one he\u2019d used to manipulate her.</p><p>\u201cShe gave you all that wonderfully wrong Intel on Simon, didn\u2019t she? I wonder...how could she have made a mistake like that?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. He should have explained all of this to her before. Should have made her understand\u2014</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Soft. \u201cI know everything he did,\u201d she said.</p><p>His jaw dropped. She knew and she was letting him touch her? Not screaming? Not staking him?</p><p>\u201cAnd I know he wasn\u2019t doing it for you, asshole.\u201d Her dark stare turned back to Grim. \u201cHe was working to kill you, not to set me up.\u201d</p><p>She knew? How\u2014</p><p>\u201cI knew from the first bite. I\u2019m Born, remember? I knew.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit.</p><p>Hate twisted Grim\u2019s face. \u201cYou should have run while you had the chance.\u201d</p><p>A ripple of her shoulders. \u201cNot really the running type. More the kick-your-ass type.\u201d</p><p>Flames raced across the floor.</p><p>Grim\u2019s laughter filled his ears. And Nina\u2014dammit, she jumped up.</p><p>\u201cBurn, bitch!\u201d Her scream of fury, directed right at Dee.</p><p>Grim slipped through the doorway, his laughter following him.</p><p>The flames rose too high, too fast. Nina\u2019s eyes flashed red, the vessels near bursting as she pumped all her power right at them.</p><p>Dee stumbled back against him. \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>They charged toward the window. The fire chased after them.</p><p>\u201cBurn, burn, burn.\u201d A chant from Nina. Fucking insane. The flames caught Simon\u2019s back and legs, biting at the flesh, and he clenched his teeth at the agony. He fell, the fire rising around him as\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo! Not without you!\u201d Dee grabbed his arms and yanked him out the window with her. The broken glass cut his stomach and chest and then Dee was hitting him, pounding on his body. No\u2014striking at the flames and putting out the fire.</p><p>Burning her flesh, to save him.</p><p>A shriek echoed from the house. The flames came at them again.</p><p>\u201cGrim has himself one hell of a guard dog,\u201d Dee growled, breath heaving out.</p><p>Simon\u2019s gaze scanned the yard. Three vamps came out, claws and teeth ready, but they didn\u2019t attack. They just watched.</p><p>Ready to watch us die.</p><p>\u201cThis is the way it ends for you.\u201d Grim\u2019s taunting voice. He walked from the shadows of the house. Blood dripped down his chest. \u201cFor both of you.\u201d</p><p>Simon caught Dee\u2019s hand, held tight. Surrounded by fire and vampires.</p><p>He looked at Dee. Shoulders back, chin up. Eyes blazing black. Not afraid. Not his Dee. Never afraid.</p><p>No, not her and she was\u2014</p><p>Smiling?</p><p>\u201cI know what happens next,\u201d Dee said, and her soft voice carried easily over the crackle of flames.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Grim snapped. \u201cYou burn. And you scream. Then you die. Right in your lover\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe in prophets, don\u2019t you, Grim?\u201d The flames were so close that the heat seemed to graze his flesh, but Nina was holding back now, watching Dee. Why?</p><p>Because Grim had his hand up, and like the good lapdog that she was, Nina wouldn\u2019t strike without his order.</p><p>\u201cAfter all, you set all this into motion.\u201d Dee\u2019s right hand\u2014which looked broken\u2014lifted to indicate the flames and vampires. \u201cBecause a demon had a vision and told you that I would be your killer.\u201d</p><p>Grim\u2019s lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cYou killed my family,\u201d she continued. \u201cEveryone I ever loved because you thought a fifteen-year-old human girl would one day kill an all-powerful Born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demon was right! You would have come for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came now for vengeance. Because of you. You are the one who set this in motion. You.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, no, I wasn\u2019t dying again. Those bastards, they betrayed me before. I wasn\u2019t going to die like that again!\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted to the vampires who stood so still and silent. \u201cMy men won\u2019t turn this time. They\u2019ll stand by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about them.\u201d Simon had no idea where she was going with this, but he caught movement from the corner of his eye. Slow, careful movement. His nostrils flared, just a bit, but he couldn\u2019t smell anything but the smoke and blood.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stand by you,\u201d Simon called out. \u201cI won\u2019t be your fucking puppet anymore.\u201d</p><p>A muscle jerked in Grim\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Simon turned his stare on the line of vamps. \u201cSure you\u2019re on the right team?\u201d</p><p>One of the vamps cut his eyes toward Grim. Hesitation there. And anger in the man\u2019s eyes.</p><p>He hates that control, just as much as I did. \u201cWhat did he make you do?\u201d Simon demanded, aware of that shadow slipping ever closer. \u201cKill your lovers? Your family? How did you prove your loyalty to him?\u201d</p><p>Because that was Grim\u2019s way. Loyalty could only be shown in blood.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you didn\u2019t kill them, he did, right?\u201d Like the bastard had taken out his family. \u201cNone of us signed on for this shit, but we can get out. He just has to die!\u201d</p><p>Grim took a step back. His hand rose again to trace the side of his back. Always checking for the wounds he\u2019d had so long ago. Now, Simon understood.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Dee said and she was so close to the flames. He wanted to haul her back, to force her behind him, but this time, this moment was hers. And he\u2019d follow wherever she took him.</p><p>\u201cYou believe in your prophets.\u201d She lifted her hands high. \u201cI believe in my witch.\u201d</p><p>Unease flickered over Grim\u2019s face and the vampires began to move in closer. Not closer to the fire, but closer to Grim. For his protection? Or\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe scryed to see how this fight would end.\u201d</p><p>Uh, yeah, and that shit hadn\u2019t been so positive. Simon swallowed and ignored the fierce throbbing in the back of his legs. The blisters would heal, eventually, if they survived this night.</p><p>\u201cCatalina knew she would die in the fire. That\u2019s why she was running when your men caught her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grim\u2019s eyes widened, just a bit.</p><p>\u201cGrim!\u201d Nina\u2019s voice screeched. \u201cLet\u2019s just kill them, now, let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saw you die.\u201d Dee\u2019s finger lifted and pointed at the Ignitor.</p> <p>\u201cThe hell you say! You die, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The shadows seemed to grab her. Nina\u2019s words choked off and a thin line of red appeared on her neck.</p><p>\u201cYour throat gets cut,\u201d Dee said, just as Nina\u2019s body fell to the ground.</p><p>The flames sputtered away.</p><p>The shadow\u2014it was Zane. Standing there, body trembling as he stared down at the woman.</p> <p>\u201cI saw death. Zane was surrounded by flames. I burned. Nina\u2014her throat was cut.\u201d Catalina\u2019s sad voice drifted through his mind.</p><p>But no, after that, she\u2019d said\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou die, Dee.\u201d The whisper of her words filled his head even as Dee sprang forward and said\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou die, Grim. You. Die!\u201d</p><p>Grim came at her with fury, meeting her armed with the stake she\u2019d used on him.</p><p>He drove that stake right at her chest.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>But Dee was ready. She spun away from the vamp, and the stake grazed her side, not her heart.</p><p>Simon grabbed Grim and wrestled the bastard to the ground. He ignored the claws and teeth and fought to hold the Born when he buckled, struggling to keep him pinned as\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou die,\u201d Dee whispered again and she had a stake in her hands. The stake she\u2019d taken from Simon when his arms were locked around her and no one could see. The stake had been hidden near his waist, just waiting for her.</p><p>Grim lurched up.</p><p>She shoved the stake into his chest.</p><p>Grim\u2019s eyes flared wide and he sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Then he smiled. \u201cTrue,\u201d he whispered, and blood spilled from his lips. \u201cBoth...right...\u201d</p> <p>The bastard smiled, and died.</p><p>Grim\u2019s vampires inched forward.</p><p>Simon glared at them. \u201cYour choice. Die with him or get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>They stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cMy mother...\u201d One whispered. \u201cHe made me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife...\u201d From another.</p><p>\u201cMy son.\u201d Grief. Fury. \u201cI begged him, but I couldn\u2019t stop him!\u201d</p><p>Not born monsters. We are what we become.</p><p>Simon stared back down at Grim\u2019s still face. Once, Grim had just been a man, too. A man betrayed who\u2019d woken to the power of a near god.</p><p>Dee\u2019s fingers slowly loosened their death grip on the stake. Her breath exhaled on a hard sigh. She trembled.</p><p>Grim\u2019s lashes were closed. His lips unmoving. No heartbeat. No breath.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Simon took Dee\u2019s shoulders and pulled her away from the vampire. Over. Finally.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>He caught a scent then. A wild, fierce scent in the night. Animal.</p><p>No, shifter. Jude had to be close. More of the cavalry, but coming too late this time.</p><p>The vampires stilled, and he saw their eyes dart to the shadows. They knew when they were being hunted. Fear trickled into their dark gazes.</p><p>Then they bolted.</p><p>Not as dumb as he\u2019d thought. Just lost, like he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Zane wasn\u2019t looking at them. His eyes stayed on Nina\u2019s body and his shoulders hunched.</p><p>The stake was buried in Grim\u2019s heart. The bastard wasn\u2019t so much as twitching. Yep, looked dead.</p><p>He pulled Dee toward him. \u201cSonofabitch, woman, you scared me! Catalina didn\u2019t tell us Grim would die, she said you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her knees buckled and Simon saw her chest\u2014saw the blood that covered her. \u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>A stake. A fucking stake. She\u2019d gotten the Born, but he\u2019d taken his death blow.</p><p>Both...right.</p><p>Because they were both dying.</p><p>Her lashes fell closed. No, no, screw that. Simon grabbed the stake and yanked it from her chest. She was still breathing. Her heart still beating. The stake had missed its mark, it had missed! She wasn\u2019t going to die, no, she wasn\u2019t going to\u2014</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Zane\u2019s hoarse voice ordered and Simon realized he\u2019d been screaming. Begging.</p><p>\u201cLive,\u201d Simon whispered now.</p><p>Grim had missed her heart. He could hear Dee\u2019s heart beating. She\u2019d be all right. She just needed blood. She just needed\u2014</p><p>Her lashes lifted. Such dark eyes. Weak, but, still Dee.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she promised. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He crushed his lips onto hers and kissed the woman as hard and deep as he could.</p><p>Surrounded by death, but she was alive.</p><p>He leaned his forehead against hers and just held her.</p><p>\u201cMissed...heart...barely...\u201d she breathed the words.</p><p>\u201cYou just scared the hell out of me,\u201d Zane snapped.</p><p>And she\u2019d nearly killed him.</p><p>\u201cOver,\u201d she said, whisper soft. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt us anymore.\u201d</p><p>The voice was gone from his mind. The link cut. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Away from the death and back to the life that waited for them.</p><p>But Dee shook her head and glanced toward Grim. \u201cAlways come back...\u201d Her hand lifted to her shoulder. Pressed hard. \u201cThey always...come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d Catalina\u2019s certain voice.</p><p>She came from the darkness. Soot and blood covered her clothes. Jude walked at her side, clad in a pair of jeans, and his woman held the witch\u2019s arm, helping her to walk. \u201cThis time,\u201d Catalina said again, \u201che\u2019ll stay down.\u201d</p><p>She stopped near his body. Catalina stepped away from the shifters and lifted her arms. Her chant came, quick but soft, and the wind stirred.</p><p>Power. Licking in the air. So much power.</p><p>And not all of it was from the positive source a witch should use. Simon felt the taint of darkness, saw it reflected in Catalina\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Changed.</p><p>Grim had left his mark on another victim.</p><p>A ball of fire exploded\u2014no, Grim\u2019s body exploded into flames. Burned and burned until nothing was left.</p><p>Not even ash.</p><p>\u201cGuess he won\u2019t be coming back from...that,\u201d Dee managed and they watched the fire sputter.</p><p>No, he damn well wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>A reminder never to piss off a witch.</p><p>Bye, asshole. Have fun in hell.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t die.\u201d Dee felt like she\u2019d been hit by a bus or a stake. But then, she had. She winced as she lowered her body onto the chair that Simon had pulled out from who the hell knew where.</p><p>Catalina stood a few feet away, rocking back and forth, her eyes on the ashes that fluttered up into the sky.</p><p>A cleanup team was en route. Pak\u2019s teams always moved fast. Soon, nothing would be left of this place.</p><p>Just the memories of what had been.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me, Cat?\u201d Yeah, good, her voice was getting stronger because the blood flow had finally stopped. \u201cYour future was wrong. I didn\u2019t die. I\u2019m sitting right here, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Catalina finally looked her way. \u201cThe night\u2019s not over.\u201d</p><p>Well, shit. Wasn\u2019t she a ball of sunshine? Not that Cat really liked sunshine these days. Dee blinked. \u201cUh, you\u2019re still alive, too.\u201d</p><p>A shiver worked over Cat\u2019s body. \u201cDoesn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Softer now as she thought about exactly what Catalina might have gone through. How long she\u2019d been with Grim and his little fire-loving friend. \u201cI guess it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Catalina\u2019s shoulders squared. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to Baton Rouge.\u201d</p><p>Not what she\u2019d expected. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slanted over to the stable. Smoke drifted from the roof. \u201cSomewhere I can forget.\u201d</p><p>Forgetting wasn\u2019t always the answer.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you,\u201d Catalina said. \u201cYou needed me. I-I shouldn\u2019t have run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fight.\u201d</p><p>A steady stare. \u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dee swallowed. \u201cHow long\u2014\u201d She had to ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just left the parking lot. They got me\u2014\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cIt was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the spells? What all did Grim want?\u201d</p><p>Catalina\u2019s eyes darted to the men. Zane and Simon were standing in front of the house. Simon\u2019s gaze kept coming back to Dee. Checking her. Watching.</p><p>He\u2019d forced her to drink from him. A good thing because without the blood, she\u2019d have fallen on her face.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted Simon to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Dee met Simon\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cGrim wanted me to send out a command spell. One that would force Simon to act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t.\u201d Catalina might not have stayed to fight, but the woman had guts. She\u2019d held out against Grim and she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd I did.\u201d Dee\u2019s stare came back to her just as Catalina\u2019s head sank.</p><p>Wow. Hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cThen why am I still breathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he loves you.\u201d</p><p>It felt like another stake had been plunged into her chest. Only this time, it found its mark in her heart. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have killed you. He should have turned on you and joined Grim. You would have died. I would have died. Everything I saw would have come true.\u201d A hard rasp of breath. \u201cBut he fought my spell and he fought Grim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted his vengeance. His freedom.\u201d That was why he\u2019d fought so hard. Not for\u2014</p><p>I\u2019ll fucking love you forever. The words she\u2019d never forget.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at him.</p><p>His gaze bored into her. So much heat. Need.</p><p>Was her own stare like that?</p><p>\u201cFor you, he\u2019d fight magic and monsters.\u201d</p><p>He had.</p><p>Catalina turned away. \u201cI-I\u2019m going...tell Zane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell him.\u201d Those two had some complicated crap going on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not what he needs. Or what he wants.\u201d Sadness there. An ache. \u201cI saw his future. She\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been wrong once already,\u201d Dee reminded her, and she tore her gaze from Simon. Catalina couldn\u2019t just leave. She belonged with them.</p><p>But Catalina didn\u2019t look back and her head shook once, slowly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me, Dee? The night\u2019s not over yet.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but Dee had no idea what to say. What more could happen?</p><p>\u201cI saw you.\u201d Catalina\u2019s voice drifted back to her. \u201cSurrounded by vampires. No way out. No. Way. Out.\u201d</p><p>Understanding finally hit. Catalina had never said that Grim took her out.</p><p>The others\u2014they were the ones she needed to fear.</p><p>They went back to the same seedy motel. They could have stayed at the scene, made sure Pak\u2019s team arrived, but screw that. Dee was about to fall on her face and taking care of her was Simon\u2019s priority.</p><p>She\u2019d taken blood from him at the scene. Not too much. Just enough to kick-start her healing, and then she\u2019d stared around at the darkness, worry in her eyes.</p><p>The big, bad bastard was dead. What did she have to worry about?</p><p>She shuffled into the room before him, wrinkling her nose. \u201cI smell like death.\u201d Common, for many vampires, but not for her.</p><p>Never her.</p><p>She stripped, right there, even before he\u2019d slammed the motel room door shut, and Simon just took a minute to enjoy the view. World class, really.</p><p>Then she headed for the bathroom and his gaze followed her ass. Dimples. Nice, lick-me dimples right at the top of that curve.</p><p>He took a step to follow her.</p><p>The lady kicked the door closed.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>The shower blasted on, the roar of the water easily penetrating through the thin door.</p><p>Simon hesitated, his eyes on that door. She\u2019d shut him out, so that clearly said she didn\u2019t want him stripping and joining her for some water fun.</p><p>But there\u2019d been something in her eyes since Grim\u2019s death. Not fear. Yeah, worry, but\u2014</p><p>Pain. More than just the physical wounds.</p><p>He locked the motel room door and strode toward the bathroom. His knuckles rapped against the door. \u201cDee?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>His hand dropped to the doorknob. If she told him to fuck off, he\u2019d leave her in peace. But if she was in there, hurting, he wasn\u2019t going to walk away.</p><p>He turned the knob and stepped inside. Steam had begun to rise and to drift lazily in the air, but Dee hadn\u2019t entered the shower yet. She stood near the tub, head bowed, shoulders hunched.</p><p>\u201cDee?\u201d He said her name again, softer.</p><p>She glanced back at him and the sight of tears on her face was a punch right in his gut. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p><p>What? Fuck, but now he hurt. He grabbed her arms and yanked her against his chest. \u201cBabe, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought killing him would make some of the pain stop. That it would give me some peace.\u201d A hard swallow. \u201cBut when I close my eyes, I still see them.\u201d</p><p>Them. Her family. Simon blew out a breath and held her even tighter. \u201cI know.\u201d He did. Because there was still a hole in his heart for his family. A hole that vengeance hadn\u2019t healed.</p><p>\u201cMy fault.\u201d A whisper. Stark.</p><p>The water fell in a hard stream.</p><p>\u201cNothing that happened was your fault. Not then. Not now.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her face up to look at him. \u201cThey died because of what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Absolutely certain. \u201cThey died because some sick freak believed he was going to change the future.\u201d</p><p>She paled a bit at that. \u201cYou really think the future\u2019s set? That the prophets out there aren\u2019t bullshitting?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Careful now, because he\u2019d heard Catalina\u2019s last words to her. Not that he\u2019d let that come to pass. \u201cI think Grim sealed his fate a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Her hand pressed against his chest. \u201cAnd what about your parents? Did killing Grim bring you peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot peace.\u201d Never that. \u201cBut justice.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a slow nod. \u201cJustice. It still feels empty.\u201d Her lip began to tremble then. Tough Dee, who could face down a Born and send him to the devil with a grin. \u201cI\u2019d rather have just had...them.\u201d</p><p>The woman was breaking his heart. He tucked her head against his chest and held her as the water poured. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He let her cry. The tears she\u2019d kept inside over the years. The tears she\u2019d stopped shedding once she began fighting.</p><p>When the tears finally stopped, he lifted her and carried her to the shower. It was time to wash away the pain and the past.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, it was time for them to begin again.</p> <p>They didn\u2019t talk in the shower. Simon stripped and joined her. The water beat on them and washed away the blood and the battle.</p><p>And they didn\u2019t talk.</p><p>He carried her to the bedroom, put her in the middle of the bed.</p><p>The water glistened on her skin and her eyes, so very dark, met his.</p><p>Then she parted her legs.</p><p>He came down beside her, putting a stranglehold on his need. This time wouldn\u2019t be about heat and desperation.</p> <p>This time, he\u2019d give her something more.</p><p>Because that\u2019s what she\u2019d given him.</p><p>His lips touched hers. A light, fleeting kiss. Simple. Soft.</p><p>His fingers trailed over her body. Caressed her breasts, the nipples that hardened beneath his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI want to forget.\u201d Her whisper.</p><p>The first thing she\u2019d said.</p><p>His cock, fully swollen and thick with need, pressed against her leg. Forgetting\u2014fleeting. The memories would come back. They always did. But he\u2019d give her this.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d give her anything she wanted.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t rush. Because he needed, too. Her taste...</p><p>He kissed his way down her neck. Licked the scars from her past battle. Tasted her nipples and sucked her flesh into his mouth. She twisted beneath him, rising and pulling in a quick breath.</p><p>And, finally, finally, the scent of her arousal began to fill the air.</p><p>Because he\u2019d never take her when she didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>His fingers slipped between her parted thighs, found the hot flesh, and eased into her.</p><p>This was what he wanted.</p><p>Her eyes turned to black.</p><p>He licked a path down her stomach. Blew lightly over the blond curls that hid her pink flesh.</p><p>\u201cSimon...\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always liked the way she said his name, especially when she wanted him. That hitch, the way the end of his name sounded like a moan on her lips.</p><p>He put his mouth against her. Took her cream on his tongue and tasted her flesh.</p><p>Her hips arched against him, a helpless jerk of her body. His tongue slipped over her clit. Her gasp filled his ears.</p><p>When her fingers sank into his hair, he knew she wanted more. Wanted harder. Faster.</p><p>Wanted to come.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He said the words against her sex and she shuddered. The pleasure wouldn\u2019t be fleeting. Not for either of them. It was time she learned that.</p><p>His lips closed around the swollen button of her desire, and he sucked, using lips and tongue to give and to take.</p><p>Her moan broke.</p><p>He gave to her, slowly. Learning every curve. Exploring her flesh. His tongue drove into her and her legs shook. He licked her. Lapped at her and wanted more.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>\u201cSimon, I\u2019m going to come!\u201d</p><p>No. Not yet.</p><p>He eased back and his fingers worked her flesh. Drawing out the release, making the desire build with soft strokes and deep plunges of his fingers.</p><p>His cock twitched. The need for her was so fierce he burned.</p><p>Bite.</p><p>The bloodlust was there, as it always was, because he didn\u2019t just want her body. He wanted her blood. Her heart.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>And he would have it.</p><p>She twisted against the sheets. The water had dried from her skin and her breasts thrust up against him.</p><p>So pretty. So perfect.</p><p>He caught her nipple with his mouth. Sucked deep and hard.</p><p>She squirmed beneath him.</p><p>Not about forgetting any longer. About them.</p><p>She\u2019d remember that.</p><p>One last lick, and he lifted his head. Her eyes had gone blind with need and black with desire.</p><p>He positioned his cock against her slick heat. Pushed the head inside, just a few inches.</p><p>Waited.</p><p>Her gaze met his.</p><p>Simon caught her hands. He threaded his fingers through hers and pinned her against the mattress.</p><p>He took her then. Thrust deep and sure and felt the sensual heat of her sex around him.</p><p>His teeth clenched and he reined in the beast\u2014tried to, anyway.</p><p>Her legs wrapped around him, and her ankles dug into his ass.</p><p>More. There, in her eyes. What she wanted\u2014</p><p>He withdrew. Thrust deep. Again and again. The bed rocked. Their bodies trembled, but he took his time and he took his pleasure.</p><p>And made damn sure she took hers.</p><p>Bite.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her neck. Didn\u2019t take his gaze from hers. This time would be different. It had to be.</p><p>Her sex squeezed him and the telltale ripple had his spine tingling.</p><p>He thrust harder. Faster. The control began to disappear, and the need, that blind, consuming need, had his breath heaving and his hips surging.</p><p>She came, the contractions of her sex making his own climax erupt as he pumped into her. The long, hot wave blasted through him, into her, and the pleasure stole his breath.</p><p>Still he thrust. Even as his cock jerked and he climaxed inside her, he thrust.</p><p>Harder, but slower. Deeper.</p><p>His fingers tightened around hers.</p><p>She whispered his name.</p><p>And came again.</p><p>Sweet fucking hell.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d die for this woman. In a heartbeat.</p><p>They began to gather in the darkness. First, just a few. Two. Then three. They came together silently as they felt the psychic snap of the old connection.</p><p>The bond was gone. The Born dead.</p><p>One there knew his killer. A vampire who\u2019d seen the woman kill Grim.</p><p>Vengeance?</p><p>A life for a life?</p><p>Slowly, the others came. Humans once. Killers, monsters now.</p><p>They waited.</p><p>More would come.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask me about the asshole in the alley?\u201d Dee forced her head to lift at Simon\u2019s question. Really, she just wanted to lay there, her head pillowed on his chest, and listen to the steady beat of his heart. But maybe they needed to go ahead and have this, um, little talk.</p><p>She met his stare and her shoulders tensed a bit as she asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I thought you\u2019d run from me or try to stake me if you knew the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d One eyebrow rose. \u201cYou mean the fact that you paid a killer to shoot me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI paid him to miss.\u201d</p><p>She knew that, but...\u201cCan\u2019t really trust guys like that, you know. Sometimes, they\u2019ll take your money and shoot whoever they want.\u201d</p><p>His fingers trailed down her back and rested at the base of her spine. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made sure I was between you and the gun, every single moment.\u201d His jaw hardened. \u201cYou know what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>Actually, no, she didn\u2019t know that part. She wasn\u2019t some kind of all seeing, walking, talking crystal ball. All she\u2019d had were glimpses. Snatches of conversation. His memories. The few that had filtered through the blood link. What became of Mr. Trigger Happy, she had no idea. So she just stared back at Simon and waited.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a choice, Dee. He forced my hand.\u201d</p><p>Ah, one of those stories that wasn\u2019t going to end well.</p><p>\u201cFrankie came after me, okay? He shot me in the back and would have killed me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cFrankie?\u201d The guy\u2019s face flashed before her eyes. Broad features. Balding hair. \u201cFrankie Lee?\u201d She should have put those pieces together sooner.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She whistled and drummed her fingers on his chest. \u201cWent big-time slumming, huh?\u201d Word on the street was that Frankie would shoot his own mother\u2014and, actually, had\u2014for a quick grand.</p><p>\u201cHe came after me,\u201d Simon repeated, his face tense. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a choice.\u201d</p><p>Silence for a moment, then Dee ventured, \u201cI\u2019m guessing old Frankie won\u2019t be taking any more hits.\u201d</p><p>His palm pressed harder against her back. \u201cI swear I didn\u2019t pay him to kill you. I wouldn\u2019t have done that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t even know me then. I was just a hunter to you, another\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were everything.\u201d Rasped. His eyes blazed at her. \u201cYou still are.\u201d</p><p>What did a woman say to that? Dee pulled away from him and reached for the sheet. She just needed to cover up, to take a second to think.</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear about how I feel, do you? Too damn bad, babe.\u201d His thumb rubbed over her pulse point. \u201cYou know I came after you because I thought you\u2019d take down Grim.\u201d</p><p>And she had. A point for the good guys. Well, semi\u2013good guys, anyway. \u201cI know you wanted to be free, you\u2019ve already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you. Want you.\u201d Simon shook his head. \u201cFrom the moment I saw you, I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. She\u2019d wanted to jump him, too. He\u2019d tackled her; she\u2019d wanted to return the favor.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was just lust, Dee. That I could take you, enjoy you, and walk away.\u201d</p><p>Kind of hard not to flinch at that one. With her left hand, she jerked the sheet up to her chin. Simon held tight to her right wrist. \u201cSo you were using me for sex and death?\u201d Grim\u2019s death. No getting around she\u2019d been a means to an end there. But she\u2019d thought there might be more. He\u2019d made her think that.</p><p>I\u2019ll fucking love you forever.</p><p>Say it again.</p><p>But now the guy wasn\u2019t talking rose petals and sunsets.</p><p>\u201cI knew I was lost.\u201d He brought her hand to his mouth and kissed the flesh of her palm. \u201cWhen you died in my arms.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she definitely flinched. Not her best memory.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to change you. You were dying in front of me, and I knew you were supposed to be a Born. Catalina had told me about you.\u201d</p><p>Had she really thanked the witch properly for that? Nah. She hadn\u2019t let Cat know how much she appreciated the woman\u2019s secrecy. Payback, um, gratitude would come eventually.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to stay dead.\u201d</p><p>Who did these days?</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to stay dead,\u201d he amended. \u201cBut I was shit-scared and when your eyes closed, I wanted to change you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stilled at that.</p><p>\u201cI wanted it so fucking much.\u201d Another hot kiss against her palm.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t try.\u201d No bite. No exchange of blood.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His breath blew against her flesh. \u201cBecause if I was wrong about you, if the witch and that damn seer were wrong, I wasn\u2019t about to make you into the thing you hated.\u201d</p><p>And she had hated the idea of vampirism. Becoming a vampire had once been her worst nightmare. Strange, because now, things all seemed so different.</p><p>\u201cIf you were dying, I wasn\u2019t going to make you come back to me. That was the hardest thing I ever did.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cWatching you die and not knowing if you\u2019d ever open your eyes again.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she\u2019d seen had been him. \u201cYou left me.\u201d The words came out as an accusation and she realized that, yeah, that had bothered her. No matter what was going on between them, no matter what secrets he\u2019d kept\u2014and she\u2019d known there were secrets even then\u2014she\u2019d expected him to stay with her.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was the last person you\u2019d want to see.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been the one she wanted the most.</p><p>\u201cI knew you needed time to adjust. Seeing me...I was afraid it would push you too much.\u201d His gaze held hers. \u201cBut then you came to me.\u201d</p><p>Sex.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>So much hunger.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t afraid of me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of myself.\u201d A stark confession, one she should have given sooner. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to become\u2014\u201d</p><p>Like Grim.</p><p>Like Leo.</p><p>Like so many of the others she\u2019d taken down over the years.</p><p>Not a monster. She hadn\u2019t wanted to be a woman ruled by the bloodlust and lost to humanity.</p><p>\u201cYou have the control, Dee. You\u2019re not going to turn and start killing innocents.\u201d He freed her hand and rose, moving slowly away from her. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen with you. There\u2019s no Born to take over your mind. No one to force you. There\u2019s just...you.\u201d</p><p>It had been just her for years. Maybe she was tired of that. She wrapped the sheet around her body. \u201cSo what happens now?\u201d Did she go back to Night Watch? Keep hunting? While he\u2014what? Got the hell out of town as fast as he could?</p><p>Just...you.</p><p>She\u2019d be left alone? Again?</p><p>Only this time, she wouldn\u2019t be looking at a few empty years before her. She\u2019d be looking at forever.</p><p>Without him.</p><p>Shit. When had the vampire started to mean so much? Because she couldn\u2019t breathe without tasting him. She wanted his touch, his mouth, his blood. Him. Always him.</p><p>\u201cPity we didn\u2019t meet before,\u201d she whispered. What would life have been like?</p><p>She glanced over, saw him hauling on a pair of jeans. He froze at her words, then gritted, \u201cI wish to hell we had.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So did she. \u201cSimon...\u201d What could she say?

Man.</p> <p>Hers.</p><p>Dee\u2019s breath caught. \u201cYou\u2014you came to me because you thought I\u2019d stop Grim.\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>\u201cBut if you just wanted to be free of him, why did you keep putting yourself between me and\u2014\u201d Everything. Everyone. \u201cI can take care of myself, you know. You don\u2019t have to jump in front of me every time things get a little dicey.\u201d A very bad habit he seemed to have there.</p><p>He snapped the button on the jeans. Yanked up the zipper. Denied her the too pleasing sight of his still aroused flesh. \u201cI was protecting you because you\u2019re mine to protect.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, now she was nearly cutting the sheet with her death grip.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he stalked around the edge of the bed. \u201cYou want to clear the air about what\u2019s happening here? Okay. Fine.\u201d</p><p>Uh, maybe she should yank on some clothes, too. She reached for her shirt. He grabbed her arms and pulled her against him. \u201cThis is a fuck-off talk, isn\u2019t it? One dressed up in some kind of nice, polite chitchat.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned to black.</p><p>\u201cI never told you to fuck off,\u201d she managed, voice quiet.</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d His fingers tightened around her. \u201cI protected you because you were mine to protect, got it? I knew I wanted you from the beginning.\u201d He kissed her, hard, deep, and had her nipples tightening, her sex clenching, and her toes curling. Oh, yeah. \u201cMine,\u201d he gritted again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let anyone\u2014Grim, your demon friend, or even your witch\u2014stand between us.\u201d</p> <p>No one was between them now. Only the thin sheet.</p><p>\u201cThe start was screwed-up.\u201d His chin lifted. \u201cI\u2019m not denying that. Yeah, I lied. Yeah, I tricked you. But I\u2019m also the man who was ready to die for you. I\u2019m the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you loved me.\u201d She threw out the words.</p><p>His eyes glittered down at her.</p><p>Dee took a deep breath and tasted him. I\u2019ll fucking love you forever.</p><p>Until Simon, no man had ever said that to her and meant it. Sure, guys would claim love all the time if they thought a quick lay was coming.</p><p>He licked his lips. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou meant it?\u201d And she meant for her words to come out as a statement, not a question.</p> <p>His hand rose, the strong fingers curling around her jaw. \u201cI meant it.\u201d</p><p>Not a lie. Not some trick to get her help. The pressure on her chest eased and warmth spilled inside her. \u201cI want to hear you say the words again.\u201d Because she could be stubborn, too. Neither one of them was perfect. Far, far from it.</p><p>\u201cI. Love. You.\u201d Almost angry.</p><p>Her heart slammed into her ribs. Standing so close, having his vamp powers, he had to feel the sudden kick. She swallowed. \u201cTh-that\u2019s good\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Definitely angry. \u201cIt\u2019s shit. It\u2019s me, thinking about you, all the time. Me, wanting you, every damn minute. Me, not being able to even breathe without tasting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make you smile. Want to make you laugh. Because you know what, Dee? You don\u2019t laugh. You don\u2019t. And you should, babe. Cause you\u2019re beautiful when you smile and when you laugh, I bet you\u2019d take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just taken hers.</p><p>\u201cI want you naked, yeah. Hell yeah. But I want to hold you in the morning. Want to talk to you in the darkness. I want to look at all the days that are coming and know I\u2019ll be spending them with you. Because if I know that, then forever sure doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad deal.\u201d</p><p>Not bad at all.</p><p>He glared down at her. \u201cI want all that. I want you. Right now, I\u2019m scared because I think you\u2019re about to tell me to get out because from the moment that I came into your life, I\u2019ve just brought you trouble, while you\u2019ve brought me...everything.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He sucked in a breath, and stepped back, releasing her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to force you to stay with me. I couldn\u2019t, even if you weren\u2019t strong enough to kick my ass.\u201d</p><p>Her lips wanted to curl. No, she wanted to laugh. For him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to walk out that door and go back to the life you had before me, then do it.\u201d Simon moved aside. \u201cBut know this\u2014you won\u2019t find another man who loves you like I do. And if you do, I might just have to show up and kick his ass.\u201d He yanked a hand through his hair. \u201cIf you wind up with that demon bastard, ah, Dee\u2014just don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Zane.</p><p>\u201cWe almost slept together once.\u201d The admission came out, probably at the wrong time. She always said the wrong thing.</p><p>His eyes closed in a slow blink and his face hardened.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends. Thought maybe we could be more.\u201d</p><p>His fangs were coming out. A jealous vampire was a dangerous one.</p><p>\u201cBut we were better friends than anything else. Zane understood me, the anger and pain inside.\u201d Because he had the same brew stirring in him.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you sleep with the prick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted a friend. Needed one, and I never let my lovers get close.\u201d Not even Tony. \u201cUntil you.\u201d</p><p>That had his eyes widening. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>So hard. Dee inhaled and took a risk. About time for one. \u201cI\u2019m saying I didn\u2019t count on falling for you, vampire. I knew you were using me. I thought I\u2019d use you, too.\u201d Brutal truth time. They should have that, now. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hurt you physically. You could handle my strength and my bloodlust and me.\u201d</p><p>He just watched her. Dark gaze so steady.</p><p>\u201cI never counted on falling for you,\u201d she said again, softer now. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of my plan.\u201d But she\u2019d gone and fallen anyway. \u201cI taste you, too. I want you, always. I want to protect you. Fight for you. I want you in the dark. Even in the light.\u201d Though it seemed like she\u2019d had little light in her life. Maybe that would change now. Who would have thought? It might have taken becoming a vampire to see the sunlight.</p><p>And to see that sometimes, the best things could be hiding in the darkness.</p><p>Not just monsters.</p><p>Men.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the way things were before.\u201d Cold. Hollow. Pain shadowing her. \u201cI want to try living this time. Really living, and I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted. \u201cDon\u2019t tease, babe, just don\u2019t fuckin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not perfect, Simon Chase. We both know you\u2019re a liar and a dirty fighter.\u201d She smiled now. A big, wide smile. For her. For him. \u201cGood thing for you, I am, too.\u201d</p><p>Hope lit his face.</p><p>When was the last time she\u2019d felt hope? Right now. \u201cI think I love you, vampire.\u201d Loving what she\u2019d feared most.</p><p>Had Catalina seen this one coming?</p><p>No, she\u2019d just seen death.</p><p>Dee shoved that thought from her mind. The sun would rise in less than an hour\u2019s time. The witch had been wrong.</p><p>Life. Love\u2014that was what waited for her. Not death.</p><p>Not again.</p><p>It was time for her to be happy. With her vampire.</p><p>Dee let the sheet fall. \u201cYou want forever?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slipped over her body. Heated.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with right here, this moment, and we\u2019ll let forever come later.\u201d Right now, she wanted him.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Scary. But she could handle scary. She\u2019d proven that, and she could handle him.</p><p>She lifted her hand and offered her palm. \u201cStay with me?\u201d Love me?</p><p>His fingers curled around hers, warm and strong. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>She had to blink because her eyes were tearing. Silly. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed hers. A tender caress. She knew he could be tender, with her.</p><p>When the knock came at the door, she didn\u2019t turn from him. Dee pulled him closer.</p><p>But Simon tensed against her. His tongue slipped over her lips and his head lifted. \u201cIs that...\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. Dawn hadn\u2019t come.</p><p>She knew the instant he caught the scent. The same scent that already filled her nose.</p><p>Catalina is wrong. Wrong.</p><p>But Simon was already spinning away from her. Grabbing her jeans and a shirt and tossing them to her before he turned to the door, fangs bared.</p><p>\u201cSince when does evil knock?\u201d She asked him, only half-kidding because a knot was tightening in her belly. This close. She\u2019d come so close to being happy.</p><p>Should have known fate would screw her over again.</p><p>Dee pulled the shirt over her head and shimmied into the jeans. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they kicking the door down?\u201d And it was them. She could smell \u2019em. At least five vampires. Six?</p><p>You were surrounded. Catalina\u2019s stupid words wouldn\u2019t stop playing in her mind.</p><p>Simon shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Not like vampires were into playing nice.</p><p>He grabbed their weapons, tossed her a stake, then reached for the door knob.</p><p>\u201cSimon!\u201d</p><p>A pause, then he glanced back at her. Dee wet her lips and said, \u201cI really do love you.\u201d That regret wouldn\u2019t be with her, no matter what was waiting out there. She\u2019d tell him how she felt.</p><p>Like she hadn\u2019t been able to tell her family.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I still feel like you\u2019re saying good-bye?\u201d His fingers hesitated over the knob.</p><p>Because I could be.</p><p>No, no, Catalina was wrong. \u201cDo you think our futures are set? That what witches and demons see, those images are the only future we can have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d Simon said immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what they see. I know my future.\u201d His stare could have burned a lesser woman. It just made her blood heat. \u201cI\u2019m looking right at her.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward the door. \u201cOnce these assholes out here are gone, I\u2019ll be taking her again, too.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like one fine plan. Now if the fear in her belly would just go away.</p><p>\u201cForever, Dee. Forever starts now.\u201d</p><p>He yanked open the door.</p><p>No one waited outside. Just the odor of the vamps, drifting on the wind. A warning? Had they been trying to scare her?</p><p>She stalked to Simon\u2019s side. In the distance, she could just make out the faint pink rays of dawn.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to die tonight. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>Simon crept out of the room. The parking lot waited to the right. It looked deserted.</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t know how very deceiving looks could be.</p><p>\u201cGrim\u2019s men?\u201d she asked. He\u2019d know. He had a better lock on them than she did. Sure, the link to the master was severed, but there was still a connection between his Taken.</p><p>And the guy had grown a whole freaking army.</p><p>Will they all come after me? Is this just the beginning?</p><p>The men stepped from the waning shadows. Two. Three.</p><p>A woman rose from the darkness. Another stalked to her side.</p><p>Or is this the end?</p><p>A hot wind blew against Dee\u2019s face as she stood in the doorway. These weren\u2019t Born vampires. All were Taken. She was stronger, even if she was newer to the Undead world. She could handle them.</p><p>Simon\u2019s shoulder brushed hers. No, they could handle them.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the stake.</p><p>Two more vampires appeared.</p><p>What the hell was this? Some kind of vamp convention? A human was going to look out one of those dirty windows and see them, and the local deputies would swarm this place.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t so easy to keep things quiet when the sirens started blaring.</p><p>\u201cYou came after the wrong woman,\u201d Dee told them, letting her voice ring out. I was so close to being happy.</p><p>Stupid. She couldn\u2019t even have a minute\u2019s worth of happiness. They were always going to hunt her, just as she\u2019d hunted them. Always.</p><p>The vampires bowed their heads and turned their hands out, showing her their empty palms. Right, like vamps needed weapons to kill.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to fight you,\u201d one of the women called out, not lifting her head.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re just here to wish me a good freaking morning.\u201d Hurry up, sun, rise. Stupid prediction.</p><p>\u201cBorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlayed Grim.\u201d</p><p>The whispers drifted to her.</p><p>Dee inched forward. Simon stayed right beside her.</p><p>\u201cYour good old leader Grim deserved the death he got.\u201d Actually, he\u2019d probably deserved a much more painful death, but she didn\u2019t exactly have the do-over option. \u201cHe was a sick freak and he needed to be put down.\u201d Probably not what these vamps were looking to hear.</p><p>Tough. She wasn\u2019t going to sugarcoat. Her eyes scanned the lot. Okay, that made seven total. She and Simon could take them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to kill you.\u201d The vampire still didn\u2019t look up. Dee realized the vamps had formed a semicircle around her room. She tensed.</p><p>Simon has my back. And he did. He stood with her, strong and steady.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she told them, determination firing her blood. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not dying today.\u201d No, she wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d just found something to live for and she wasn\u2019t about to give it up.</p><p>Screw off, Catalina.</p><p>\u201cAre we?\u201d The quiet question floated in the air.</p><p>Her brows snapped together and Dee glanced at Simon. A quick, fast glance.</p><p>Surrounded. It hit her then. Vampires surrounded her.</p><p>But Simon was one of those vamps, and she trusted him. With her life and her heart.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill us?\u201d the woman asked, still not looking Dee\u2019s way. Her long blond hair covered her face. Dee stared at her, a chill skating its way down her spine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d Let\u2019s try for some honesty. \u201cIf you\u2019re twisted like Grim and you get off on hurting humans, then, yeah, I\u2019ll come after you. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d That wouldn\u2019t change. She\u2019d seen too many innocents die. No way would she let a killer walk.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think some vampires can live...without hurting others?\u201d</p><p>Before, she hadn\u2019t. But she\u2019d been blinded by her own rage then. She was finally starting to see straight now; it had just taken dying to open her eyes. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Her fingers were wrapped so tightly around the stake that the wood bit into her flesh.</p> <p>She stared at the line of bodies and wondered who would move first. Who would attack.</p><p>Dee wouldn\u2019t draw first blood, but she would make sure she drew the last drops.</p><p>\u201cWe waited for you.\u201d The woman looked at her then. A long scar cut across her cheek. A scar she must have gotten long ago. In another life. \u201cWaiting was so hard...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you, Sandra Dee...\u201d Words from that terrible night. Grim\u2019s men. Waiting for her death.</p><p>But these vampires had been waiting, too\u2014for what? Her eyes narrowed as she watched them.</p> <p>Born.</p><p>They\u2019d been waiting for her to free them.</p><p>The vampires began to drift away.</p><p>Simon\u2019s hands settled on her shoulders. \u201cI told you, Dee. Sometimes, monsters are made.\u201d</p><p>And sometimes they were Taken.</p><p>A tear tracked down the woman\u2019s cheek. \u201cMy son...\u201d</p> <p>That was all she had to say. Dee understood. Grim had played his twisted games with everyone.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t see me again,\u201d the vampiress told her. \u201cNot any of us.\u201d Her chin lifted. Pride there. Strength. \u201cWe\u2019re more than the evil that people think.\u201d</p><p>But people had been fearing vampires for centuries.</p><p>And forgetting that once upon a time, vampires were people, too. She\u2019d forgotten that. No, she hadn\u2019t wanted to remember.</p><p>The vampires faded as the sun rose. Dee watched them, silent.</p><p>Simon stood with her as the sun inched across the sky. Dawn was such a beautiful thing. Pity she hadn\u2019t enjoyed the sunrises more.</p><p>\u201cWe should go inside. Get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Because another night would come. Another. Always another.</p> <p>With more darkness to fight.</p><p>Dee reached for him and rubbed her fingers over the hard line of his jaw. She wouldn\u2019t be fighting alone anymore. No, her vamp would be at her side.</p><p>She\u2019d be at his.</p><p>The darkness could come. They\u2019d be ready.</p><p>They\u2019d kick ass.</p><p>Make love.</p><p>And live for-damn-ever.</p><p>Death hadn\u2019t come for her. Catalina had been wrong.</p><p>No, maybe she\u2019d been right. As she stared at Simon in the growing morning light, Dee knew her old life had ended. But a new life...</p><p>It waited for her.</p><p>All she had to do was reach out and take it.</p><p>She kept the stake in her right hand and curled her arm around Simon\u2019s neck.</p><p>Then she kissed him in the sunlight. Just as she\u2019d kiss him in the moonlight.</p><p>Sometimes, a woman had to make her own happy ending.</p><p>And, sometimes, she had to leave room for a little bit of hunting on the side.</p><p>Because you had to keep life interesting, and after all, someone had to stop the bad guys.</p><p>She\u2019d slay them all, soon enough.</p><p>But first, she\u2019d take her vampire and, as he\u2019d promised, he\u2019d take her.</p><p>For-damn-ever. </p> </body></html>"]
