Maybe that was the reason\u2014off the beaten path, surrounded by wilderness, a place to hide from the harsh realities of the forced marriage, safe from Bruin\u2019s retaliation should he ever have located her. But she hadn\u2019t been safe. And now she was dead.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Lelandi Wildhaven thought she saw her cousin, Ural, slink into the woods in his wolf form, but she had to be mistaken. He wouldn\u2019t be angry enough with her to shapeshift this close to Silver Town and risk alerting the gray lupus garou pack that a couple of reds had slipped into their territory.</p><p>Ignoring her gut instinct telling her this was a very bad idea, she pushed open the Silver Town Tavern\u2019s heavy door, the squealing of the rusty hinges jarring her taut nerves.</p> <p>Five bearded men sitting at a table turned to stare at her, and at once she feared the worst\u2014they saw straight through her disguise.</p><p>She shoved the faux eyeglasses back into place, hating the way they kept sliding down the bridge of her nose. The weather-beaten cowboy hat she\u2019d picked up at a resale shop half swallowed her head, making her look like a little kid wearing her dad\u2019s Stetson.</p><p>Amber glass lights hanging from brass rods high above softly illuminated dark oak tables and a long, polished bar. Slow-spinning wooden fan blades circulated the air, impregnated with the smell of gray lupus garou. Her nerve endings prickled with fresh awareness. Dingy antique mirrors covering the back wall behind the bar bore mute witness to the goings-on in the place, as she suspected they had for decades. If they had captured all the images of the bar\u2019s existence what a story those mirrors could tell.</p><p>Another bearded man crouching beneath the lip of the bar suddenly stood to his full six-foot-four height. The glass and dish towel he held nearly slipped from his grasp as his appraising glance took in every inch of her. His lips turned up at the corners slightly. Deep laugh lines were etched in his tanned skin and shaggy black hair extended to his shoulders, giving him the appearance of a rugged mountain man, unused to civilized trappings. What disturbed her most was that he was a gray, like the men drinking at the table. She\u2019d anticipated it would be a human-run establishment frequented by lupus garous, like the bar back home.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you have, miss?\u201d he asked, his voice warm and welcoming.</p> <p>Expecting a chilly greeting\u2014their kind didn\u2019t welcome strangers venturing into their midst, especially if she were human and this was an exclusively gray lupus garou tavern\u2014she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottled water, please.\u201d She\u2019d meant to sound tough, to match the look of the place. She\u2019d intended to be someone different, with her red hair dyed black and the high-heeled boots giving the impression she stood taller, more like them. The blue contacts she wore hid her green eyes sufficiently, but she still felt like Lelandi, triplet to Larissa, with barely any visible difference in appearance, except her eyes were greener and her hair more red and less golden than her sister\u2019s had been. Had her voice betrayed her?</p><p>The small smile on the bartender\u2019s face was more likely because she was a stranger who\u2019d walked into a wolves\u2019 den without protection than because she\u2019d given herself away. She cursed herself for not disguising her voice better, but the barkeep\u2019s warm demeanor gave her a false sense of security, which could be the death of her if she wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>The bartender handed her a chilled bottle of water and tall green glass. \u201cNew in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust passing through,\u201d she said, paying for the water.</p> <p>\u201cSam\u2019s the name, miss. If you need anything, just holler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Hollering for a drink was definitely not her style.</p><p>She chose a table in the farthermost corner of the room, half-hidden in shadows. Although any of them could see in the dark as well as she could, this location would keep her out of the main flow of traffic. She hoped she\u2019d seem inconspicuous, not worthy of anyone\u2019s scrutiny, and most of all, human.</p><p>Lelandi glanced at the door. According to her information, Darien Silver\u2014Larissa\u2019s widowed mate\u2014should be here soon.</p><p>One of the men got up from his seat and gave Sam some cash. The man cast Lelandi a hint of a smile, then returned to his chair. Small for a gray, stocky, hair a bland brown, eyes amber, his clothes carrying a coating of dust, he had a soft, round baby face. Looked sweet, a beta-wolf type. Smudges of dirt colored his cheeks, and he wiped them off with the back of his denim shirtsleeve. His eyes never straying from her, he smoothed out his raggedy hair and took another swig of his beer.</p><p>Sam joined Lelandi and handed her the cash. \u201cJoe Kelly paid for your drink, miss. He works at the silver mine, which explains his slightly rough appearance. But he cleans up good.\u201d Sam gave her a wink, and returned to the bar.</p><p>Should she turn down Joe\u2019s offer? On the other hand, if he was interested in her, maybe she could discover the truth quicker.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she mouthed to Joe Kelly and his chest swelled.</p> <p>The other guys started ribbing him in low voices. The tips of Joe\u2019s ears turned crimson.</p><p>Her stomach clenched with the notion that Larissa had had the audacity to mate with a gray, especially when she had a mate already. She\u2019d said she wanted to find herself, and she did. Six feet under. Yet, Lelandi couldn\u2019t help feeling it was her own fault, that if she\u2019d taken Larissa\u2019s place back home, or even run away with her, she might have kept her safe. But what about their parents? She couldn\u2019t have left them behind\u2014not with her dad so incapacitated\u2014but hell, she hadn\u2019t been able to protect them either. They had been murdered anyway.</p><p>She tamped down a shudder, hating that she hadn\u2019t stopped any of it. But once she learned what had happened to Larissa and put the murderer in his grave, Lelandi was going to locate her brother and their uncle\u2014damn both of them for leaving the family behind.</p><p>The barkeep clinked some glasses, his gaze taking her in like a crafty old wolf\u2019s. He probably was on the younger side of middle age but due to the beard, he seemed older. The smile still percolated on his lips. Trying to figure her out? Or did he realize what a phony she was? Hunting in the wild was nothing new, but hunting like this...</p><p>She twisted the top off her bottled water and glanced down at her watch again. Only four twenty-five.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for someone?\u201d Sam asked, one dark brow cocked.</p><p>She shook her head. Her hat jiggled, her glasses slipped, and the annoying earrings danced.</p><p>Two men appeared in front of one of the dingy tavern windows and then the door jerked open. Her heart skittered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sam! Bring us a pitcher of beer,\u201d one of them called.</p><p>About six-foot\u2014as tall as her brother\u2014with windswept shoulder-length dark hair and a newly started beard, his amber eyes hinted at cheerfulness and good-humor rang in his words. Both men wore leather jackets, plaid shirts, denims, cowboy hats, and boots, and they appeared to be twins. Multiple births abounded among lupus garous, so no surprise there. They looked like they were mid- to late-twenties and walked into the place like they owned the joint. \u201cJake, Tom.\u201d Sam glanced in her direction, alerting them to the presence of a stranger.</p><p>She stiffened her back and gripped her glass tighter.</p><p>Tom\u2014his hair the lighter of the two, longer, curling around his broad shoulders, his face smooth as silk\u2014fastened his gaze on her and raised his brows, tipped back his Stetson, and grinned.</p><p>Self-conscious, her whole body heated and alarm bells rang. Keep a low profile!</p><p>Tom took a deep breath as if he were love-struck. \u201cThe place looks a might better tonight, Sam. Done some nice redecorating.\u201d</p><p>The bearded one furrowed his dark brows. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell her it\u2019s a private club and no matter what, that table is reserved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBending the rules today. First come, first served.\u201d Sam grinned and winked at Lelandi.</p><p>Damn. Was this where Darien normally sat? She thought he\u2019d sit in the center, so everyone could see their leader. That\u2019s the way Bruin did it back home.</p><p>Now what? Move? To where? If she moved to the table across from Darien\u2019s, she feared she\u2019d draw too much attention. Not that she expected anyone to hurt her here, but she had thought she\u2019d be able to keep a low profile. The tables situated on the other side of the bar sat in front of the restrooms. Anywhere else was too near the front door or in the middle of the floor, and no matter what, she wanted to have her back to the wall. She wasn\u2019t leaving until she\u2019d had a chance to observe the leader and as many of his pack members as she could, any one of whom might have murdered Larissa.</p><p>Tom grabbed the pitcher of beer and a glass. \u201cCome on, Jake. Change is good for the soul.\u201d He stalked over to the table opposite her and sat where he could see both the front door and, most of all, her.</p><p>Immersed in a goldfish bowl, she wondered what had made her think she could enter the wolves\u2019 lair without arousing suspicion.</p><p>Jake sat with his back to the wall to have a better view of the door. If he wanted to look her over, he\u2019d have to turn his head and be pretty obvious about it. He did. The expression on his face was dark and foreboding. Gone was the humor his features had held when he first walked into the place.</p><p>Laughing and boisterous, three more men barged into the tavern, glanced to where Jake and Tom sat, then shifted their attention to Lelandi. Which meant what? That Jake and Tom normally sat with Darien at the table where she was now sitting?</p><p>Terrific!</p><p>\u201cHowdy, boys,\u201d the older bearded man of the group said, nodding a greeting. The other two were nearly as old, gray streaking their brown beards, their gazes pinned on her. \u201cBring us the usual, Sam.\u201d He turned to Jake and pointed his head at her. \u201cHe know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill giving orders at the factory, Mason,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>The bearded man grumbled, \u201cFourth of July\u2019s coming for a second time this year.\u201d</p><p>Figuring she\u2019d be better off sitting next to the restrooms to lessen the chance of creating fireworks, Lelandi grabbed her purse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door banged open again. The chatter died.</p><p>As soon as she saw him, she knew it was him\u2014not only because silence instantly cloaked the room and every eye in the place watched Darien Silver\u2019s reaction. His sable hair curled at the top edge of his collar. Brooding dark eyes, grim lips, features handsomely rugged, but definitely hard, defined him. Wearing a leather jacket, western shirt, jeans, and boots, everything was as black as his somber mood. He looked so much like Tom and Jake, she figured they must be triplets, and he was the leader of the gray lupus garou in the area. Had to be, the way everyone watched him, waiting for the fireworks.</p><p>Something about him stirred her blood, something akin to recognition, yet she\u2019d never seen him before in her life. It wasn\u2019t his face, or clothes, or body that stimulated some deep memory\u2014but the way he moved\u2014commanding, powerful, with an effortless grace.</p> <p>He glanced at the barkeep and gave a nod of greeting\u2014sullen, silent, still in mourning for his mate? If he discovered why Lelandi was here, he\u2019d be pissed.</p><p>A shiver trickled down her spine. She released her purse and kept her seat, for the moment. Everyone was acting so oddly, she imagined that was the reason he quickly surveyed the current seating arrangement. When his eyes lit on her, incredulity registered.</p><p>Crap! He recognized her; she just knew it. Didn\u2019t matter that she had dyed her hair this horrible color that didn\u2019t do anything for her fair skin, or that her eyes were now blue. Didn\u2019t matter that the heavy padded leather jacket gave her broader shoulders and made her appear heavier, or that she wore her hair straight as blades of uncut grass, compliments of a hair straightening iron, when her sister\u2019s and hers was naturally curly. She couldn\u2019t hide the shape of her face or eyes or mouth. All of them mirrored her sister\u2019s looks.</p><p>Then again, his look was puzzled. The hat and glasses appeared to confuse him. Maybe the fact that she wore the faux pierced earrings that looked like the real thing did too.</p><p>She broke eye contact first, her skin sweaty, her hands trembling. God, he was more wolf than she was used to dealing with\u2014broader-shouldered and taller. His eyes locked onto hers with sinful determination, no backing down, no compromise. No wonder Larissa had fallen for the attention-grabbing gray. Lelandi couldn\u2019t help wondering how a romp with a virile wolf like him would feel. But damn if it hadn\u2019t gotten Larissa killed. Stick with your own kind, that\u2019s what her father would have said. No humans, lupus garou only... the red variety.</p> <p>Everyone remained deathly quiet\u2014no one lifted a mug to take a sip of a drink, no one moved a muscle. Swallowing hard, she forced herself to look at Darien, to see what he was doing now.</p><p>Still staring at her. She wanted to sink into the floor like mop water on a hot day. She gritted her teeth, lifted her glass of water, and took another swig, hoping she wouldn\u2019t inadvertently choke on the icy drink out of nervousness. But she wasn\u2019t leaving Silver Town until she avenged Larissa\u2019s death.</p><p>Darien glanced at Sam, who shrugged a shoulder and handed him an empty glass. If Darien wanted her out of his chair, he would have to move her.</p><p>Macho gang leaders had to show they were in charge, particularly when it came to their territory, and no one, especially women, upstaged them. There were none more notorious for this than lupus garous. No one challenged them and got away with it, unless another lupus garou was trying to take over the pack, and won.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t part of his pack. She wasn\u2019t a male. And she wasn\u2019t a gray. What\u2019s worse, she looked like his dead mate. On the other hand, it appeared he wasn\u2019t sure of what he was seeing.</p><p>The eyes that latched onto her again were cold, yet sorrow was reflected in them, too. He jerked the glass off the counter and headed to where Jake and Tom sat. He forced Tom to move to the chair with his back to the door, giving Darien a better view of both her and the entrance. How could she observe the pack members if the leader kept an eye on her? Even now, she was certain he could smell her fear. She told herself she wasn\u2019t afraid of him, but any lupus garou who was worth his pelt would take heed when confronting a pack leader.</p> <p>Frozen with indecision, she remained seated. What the hell, let him think she was too afraid to move from her chair\u2014his chair, whatever.</p><p>The first woman she\u2019d seen tonight entered the tavern dressed in short shorts and a turtleneck shirt, with leather boots mid-thigh, her sable hair piled on top of her head in whirls of dark curls.</p><p>\u201cHey, Silva,\u201d one of the four men seated at the bar said and whistled. \u201cLooking hot.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a flashy bright red-lipped grin, then glanced in Lelandi\u2019s direction. Astonishment was reflected in her expression. Silva\u2019s gaze shifted and she spied Darien nearby. Bending over the bar to give the guys a better look at her ass, she whispered something to Sam. He looked over at Lelandi. Yep, she was sure to be the topic of conversation tonight.</p><p>Sam shrugged. \u201cDrawing a real crowd tonight, Silva. Why don\u2019t you see if the boss needs some more beer?\u201d</p><p>Tom lifted the empty pitcher. \u201cNeed a refill. Looks like the lady could use another drink.\u201d</p><p>Desperately wanting out of the limelight, Lelandi melted into her seat.</p><p>Silva gave her a simpering smile. \u201cWell, well, looks like the word has gotten out to some far-reaching places. Guess it won\u2019t be long before the place will be crawling with\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Sam slammed a pitcher of beer on the counter. \u201cTake care of the customers, Silva, and play nice.\u201d</p><p>She sneered at him, then grabbed the pitcher. \u201cYes siree, boss, that\u2019s what you pay me for.\u201d Swinging her hips, she carried the beer to Darien\u2019s table, and then gave him a big smile. \u201cHere ya go, boss. Just whistle if you need more.\u201d</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t say a word, just leaned back in his chair and looked over at Lelandi.</p><p>Silva made a face and headed for Lelandi\u2019s table. \u201cNeed another... bottled water?\u201d</p><p>Time for a drink. \u201cGot margaritas?\u201d Lelandi spoke low, only it wasn\u2019t low enough.</p><p>Tom choked on his beer. A couple of the men at the bar chuckled. Sam smiled and poured whiskey for one of the men.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, sugar.\u201d Silva turned to Sam. \u201cHey, Sam, we got fancy drinks for an out-of-towner? Like a margarita?\u201d She said the word as if she was speaking of a woman\u2019s cute name.</p><p>More chuckles ensued.</p><p>\u201cI can whip up anything the little lady would like.\u201d</p><p>Little. That described her all right. Five-four, and the size of a red lupus garou female. She sat taller.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you would like, Miss...?\u201d Silva asked, drawing it out, searching for a name.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Tough, damn it. Lelandi wanted to present a tougher image in front of the grays. She\u2019d practiced and practiced and so what did she do? Acted like a squeaky damned mouse. Used to being around her own kind, she\u2019d never felt intimidated\u2014much. Having earned double black belts in jujitsu and kung fu helped boost her confidence around human brutes. But these people were neither human nor her own kind, and a whole pack of them could devour her alive if she gave them the opportunity.</p><p>The woman leaned closer and Lelandi was again sure she was about to be found out. Silva breathed in the air, and her brown eyes narrowed. Despite wearing a ton of fancy human perfumes, and of course the stench from the fresh dye job\u2014although Lelandi had washed her hair in strawberry shampoo trying to cover up that odor\u2014she hoped no one could smell that she was a lupus garou, and not one of their own kind, either. Looked like it didn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well.\u201d Silva straightened her back. \u201cMake the lady a margarita, Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the first on my tab,\u201d Tom piped up. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want the lady to think we\u2019re a bunch of unfriendly old coots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe second one\u2019s on me,\u201d Silva said.</p><p>The miner, Joe Kelly, looked disappointed that he hadn\u2019t spoken up first, but as much of a beta wolf as he appeared, he probably wouldn\u2019t say anything to tick Darien off. Darien\u2019s brothers would be the exceptions, and Silva seemed able to do as she pleased.</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t say a word. He exuded control with just a look\u2014dangerous, not the kind of man to rile. His actions, or lack thereof, spoke louder than any words. Bruin would have blustered all over the tavern in Darien\u2019s place. Proving he was the pack leader and no one would disobey him, Bruin would have taken her to task immediately, belittled her, thrown her out of the joint bodily if she\u2019d taken his seat. But just a glower from Darien conveyed a world of threat, and she\u2019d do well to heed it.</p><p>Everyone seemed fascinated with the reason Silva had taken an interest in Lelandi. They had to figure Silva had discovered something about her. Silva seemed amused Lelandi was a red lupus garou masquerading as a human. At least Lelandi assumed the woman had found her out.</p><p>\u201cWhere ya staying, darlin\u2019?\u201d Silva\u2019s tone was much more appeasing, the sweetness faked.</p><p>Lelandi cleared the sudden frog in her throat. \u201cJust passing through.\u201d</p><p>Silence. The woman\u2019s eyes darkened, and she quickly glanced at Darien. His eyes had widened, and he was staring at Lelandi. Shit. Her voice must have sounded similar to Larissa\u2019s this time, the way she spoke, the inflection, something.</p><p>Low conversation took place at the table next to Darien\u2019s and among the grays at the bar while Sam whipped up Lelandi\u2019s margarita, but no one at Darien\u2019s table spoke a word.</p><p>More patrons entered the tavern, all looking to greet their leader, then, finding a dead ringer for his dead mate sitting at his regular table, turned to see Darien, and the scenario repeated itself until the place was crowded and noisy. But no one dared sit at her table. Thank god. The more important conversations were conducted low so she couldn\u2019t hear the gist of them, but she only had to guess what was being said. Dead sister\u2019s clone arrives at grays\u2019 hangout, seeking revenge. They\u2019d all be shaking in their boots. Right.</p><p>After finishing her margarita, Lelandi was dying to go to the bathroom, and the place had grown so warm, she shrugged out of her jacket. Big mistake. As soon as they saw how petite she was, the whole room grew quiet again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silva hurried over with another margarita for Lelandi, although she intended to get another bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cOn me, sweetie,\u201d the woman said, this time with real affection. Standing nearly five-foot-ten, in her four-inch heels, she was small for a female gray.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Lelandi stood, and the woman\u2019s face dropped, probably thinking Lelandi meant to leave, snubbing her for the drink. \u201cGot to use the little girls\u2019 room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Silva\u2019s lips turned up slightly. \u201cBack that way.\u201d She motioned with her hand.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Lelandi hadn\u2019t considered what it would feel like to walk through the tavern to the ladies\u2019 room, until everyone acted so interested in her. With her shoulders straight back, her chin tilted up, and her body ten degrees hotter than normal, she made her way to the restroom.</p><p>Several men nodded their heads in greeting. Respectfully, a couple of them took their cowboy hats off. None smiled though, not even Joe this time, which would be typical. Until their pack leader made her welcome, most would look her over, but wouldn\u2019t make any move to be overtly friendly. Darien would probably take Joe to task if Sam told him the miner had paid for her first drink.</p><p>Sitting with some men at one of the larger tables, three women glowered at her as if they wished her dead. Had any of them wanted Larissa eliminated and carried out the threat?</p><p>Ignoring them, Lelandi walked into the restroom, but after entering a stall, she heard the outer door squeak open. Her skin chilled. Too late to circumvent the trouble headed her way.</p> <p>When she exited the stall, the three women were waiting for her, their expressions slightly amused in a sinister manner. All brown-haired, around mid-twenties like her\u2014probably each vying to be Darien\u2019s new mate and fearing she was new competition.</p><p>When she\u2019d come up with this scheme of looking for her Larissa\u2019s murderer, Lelandi had never considered anyone would think she\u2019d be interested in pursuing the pack\u2019s leader. The idea of mating with a bigger gray for real... She mentally shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d the woman in denims and a cowl-neck sweater asked, her voice softly threatening, her western boot tapping on the tile floor. Her amber eyes narrowed, she took in a deep breath\u2014trying to smell who or what Lelandi was\u2014and curled her orange-painted lips up in a nasty way. The notion her face could hideously freeze that way briefly crossed Lelandi\u2019s mind. \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, and you\u2019re not one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ritka, what say we give her a nice send-off?\u201d the shortest one asked, still towering over Lelandi by several inches.</p><p>Lelandi brushed past her to wash her hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t plan on staying, bitch,\u201d a meatier one snarled, whipping her waist-length, muddy-colored hair about as she spoke, crowding Lelandi. Bulkier than the other two, she would make a hefty wolf and hard to beat if she craved being Darien\u2019s bitch and fought the others to have that role. But no female lupus garou\u2014well, of the red variety\u2014crowded Lelandi anymore and got away with it, and she was having a devil of a time maintaining her cool.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t intend to stay long. Just taking care of a little family business, if it\u2019s any of your concern.\u201d</p><p>Ritka whispered close to her ear, her whiskey breath invading Lelandi\u2019s breathing space, \u201cWe know who you are, and you can\u2019t have him, Red. You know what happened to the other one. Get out of Dodge, honey, before it happens to you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her blood sizzling, Lelandi attempted to wash her hands as if the women didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>The short one yanked at her purse and the leather strap bit into Lelandi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTell us who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if the bitch would say, Angelina, when she\u2019s wearing this fool disguise,\u201d Ritka snarled.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s temple pounded with frustration, but she rinsed the soap off her hands and bit back the feral part of her wolf nature clawing to get out. Beating up three female grays wouldn\u2019t help her cause.</p><p>Ritka bumped into her, probably triggered by the other pulling at her purse, each leading the other on, escalating the situation. Lelandi clenched her teeth against retaliating. Nothing they did was important enough to provoke her, she reminded herself.</p><p>The heavy one grabbed a handful of Lelandi\u2019s hair and yanked hard. \u201cGuys don\u2019t like dyed hair, didn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p> <p>The pain ripped across Lelandi\u2019s scalp, and she counted slowly to ten, hoping to avoid physical contact, but planning swift retaliation if anyone did anything else.</p><p>\u201cYou got that right, Hosstene,\u201d Ritka said with a sharp laugh and reached for a handful of Lelandi\u2019s hair.</p><p>Enough! With a quick well-placed jab, Lelandi elbowed Angelina in the gut, judo-chopped Hosstene in the throat, then swung around and slammed her fist into Ritka\u2019s eye. While they were choking and cursing, Lelandi grabbed a paper towel, dried her hands, and left the restroom, her heart racing.</p><p>She\u2019d asked for trouble now.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>NO, DAMN IT. THE BITCHES HAD ASKED FOR TROUBLE AND as much as told Lelandi that someone had murdered Larissa for being a red.</p><p>She opened the restroom door and slammed it behind her, shutting out the women\u2019s curses. The men who were sitting with the women looked from Lelandi to the ladies\u2019 room. Sorry, boys, the girls need to tidy up a bit.</p><p>Lelandi retook her seat and when the women still didn\u2019t emerge from the restroom, Sam motioned for Silva to check it out.</p><p>Maybe now would be a good time for Lelandi to go in search of her rogue brother and uncle. Forget that Larissa had run away and gotten herself killed, leaving Lelandi to deal with Bruin\u2019s pack alone. Or, she could stay and face the wrath of a bunch of angry grays.</p><p>As a matter of pride and a good deal of stubbornness, she stayed. All eyes remained on the restroom while Lelandi coolly drank her second margarita. No one spoke. No doubt the whole lot of them would murder Lelandi in her sleep tonight. She hoped her time here wasn\u2019t totally wasted. But she wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><p>Silva came out of the restroom, her lips turned up, her eyes sparkling with amusement, head shaking. She raised her brows at the guys who were with the women and strolled past. Her attention turned to Darien, waiting for a report. Her smile broadened, then she spoke to Sam.</p><p>\u201cNext margarita\u2019s on me, Silva, for the young lady.\u201d Tom offered Lelandi a grin and a wink.</p><p>Lelandi shook her head. \u201cWater will be fine.\u201d</p><p>The three women crowded out of the bathroom, Ritka scowling, her swollen right eye already turning black and blue. Angelina was still clutching her stomach, and Hosstene\u2019s face was dark with anger\u2014Lelandi was pretty sure her jab to the gray\u2019s throat would preclude her talking much for a while.</p><p>Everyone looked the women over, then Lelandi. No, she wasn\u2019t fighting to be the pack leader\u2019s new bitch.</p><p>She guessed it was time to come up with a new plan. This one damn sure wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Darien Silver watched the defiant young lady who had to be his mate\u2019s twin. Had to be. The voice clinched it. At first, he thought she was some ditsy human sitting in his chair at his table, and he couldn\u2019t understand why Sam hadn\u2019t thrown her out of the place. At least he\u2019d thought she was human. Lupus garous had exceptional visual acuity. Only humans wore glasses. And the pierced earrings. No lupus garou would get caught dead with pierced earlobes in their wolf form. Or wear a watch, for that matter. The straight black hair looked nothing like his dead mate\u2019s, and the blue eyes had stopped him cold. The perfume she\u2019d drowned herself in, he figured, was some ploy to get all the guys in the tavern hot and bothered, but for lupus garous, the smell was overwhelming, burned their eyes, and had the opposite effect.</p><p>Her voice was all it took to send shivers exploding across his skin.</p><p>He swore he was seeing his late wife sipping margaritas, which she never would have done. A wine lady was what she was. And the way this woman had handled the ladies from his pack? His mate would never have managed.</p><p>Taking a steadying breath, he reminded himself the woman wasn\u2019t his mate. She only looked like her when he scrutinized her closely, her small face dominated by the oversized Stetson and the bug-eyed, rose-colored glasses, but personality-wise she couldn\u2019t be more different from his beloved Lelandi. Except his people already seemed to make up their minds. Lelandi had returned, and he would have a go at her again.</p><p>Not in a million years. She\u2019d killed herself, unstable, unable to deal with the stress of being a pack leader\u2019s mate, and not being one of them in the first place... Nope, wouldn\u2019t happen again. Next one would be a gray, except not from his pack. Except for Silva, the eligible women had resented Lelandi, and he couldn\u2019t forgive them.</p><p>He finished his third beer and set his glass aside. He tried to watch his people to take his mind off his dead mate, but the woman sitting at his table distracted him something fierce. What the hell was she doing here anyway? Come to claim her sister\u2019s body? Scream at him for pushing her sister over the edge? Condemning himself enough for her death for the past three weeks, he didn\u2019t need anyone else\u2019s help. Not enough beers in the world could make him forget the look on Lelandi\u2019s face, at peace finally in death.</p><p>He shook his head. Although he usually stayed until closing, tonight he wanted to get away. How would it look if the pack leader couldn\u2019t deal with the image of his late wife sitting at the next table?</p><p>Growling deep inside, he poured himself another beer.</p><p>\u201cTwin sister, don\u2019t you think, Darien?\u201d Tom, his youngest triplet asked, his brows raised.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Lelandi said she didn\u2019t have any family left. Apparently she lied.\u201d Which didn\u2019t set well with Darien, but it was too late to be angered about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019s doing here?\u201d Tom rubbed his hand over the sweating glass.</p><p>\u201cSomething to do with her sister, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink the woman suspects Lelandi was murdered?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Darien looked sharply at him. \u201cWhat the hell makes you say that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake shrugged. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she meet with you and state what her business is here? Why try to conceal her identity? The only conclusion I can come up with is she doesn\u2019t think Lelandi\u2019s death was an accident. And she\u2019s looking into it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d Darien glowered at the red, wondering what her hair would look like if it wasn\u2019t that hideous black color, way too harsh for her light creamy skin.</p><p>\u201cLooks like she gave the ladies hell who meant to mess with her.\u201d Tom grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhich means there\u2019ll be more trouble.\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was as dark as Darien felt.</p> <p>Darien turned to Tom. \u201cI want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jake interrupted, \u201cShe\u2019s leaving.\u201d</p><p>All conversation in the tavern instantly died.</p><p>Her boots clicked on the wood floor as she walked toward the door, her back stiff, her hands clenched in fists\u2014her whole body language saying, Don\u2019t mess with me.</p><p>As much as he didn\u2019t want to admit it, he craved chasing after her and laying claim to her, just like he\u2019d done with her sister. He felt an overwhelming urge to kiss those pursed lips, feel her soft skin naked beneath his, make love to her like he\u2019d made love to her sister. He was definitely losing it.</p> <p>With the utmost restraint, he remained seated and observed her open the door. \u201cFollow her, Tom. Watch where she goes, and... hell, stick to her for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? You really mean it?\u201d Tom asked, his voice too hopeful.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t let anyone get to her, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe means,\u201d Jake interjected, \u201cdon\u2019t let anyone screw with her and that includes you.\u201d</p><p>Tom looked at Darien for confirmation. If his brother wanted her and the woman was agreeable, who was he to say no? Their kind wasn\u2019t into casual sex, so if she wanted a mate and Tom was interested, fine. Darien wasn\u2019t about to go down that road again. \u201cDo whatever it takes to make sure none of our people bother her.\u201d</p><p>Tom gave Jake a look like he had him there. \u201cThanks, Darien. I\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d He hurried after Lelandi\u2019s sister as the door slammed behind her.</p> <p>Sending Tom after the woman signaled to the rest of his people in the tavern, and the word would quickly spread to the others, Darien wanted her left alone. If any stepped over the line, he\u2019d hold them accountable.</p><p>Jake moved his glass over the wooden table, scraping it back and forth.</p><p>Darien glowered at him. \u201cWhat, Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should talk with the woman? Find out what she\u2019s doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Lelandi was murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve buried your head in the sand on this one, brother. Several believe someone murdered her, but when they spy me, the talking stops. No one will tell me or Tom what they suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA conspiracy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. At least I don\u2019t think so. Unless they\u2019re protecting someone, or are afraid you\u2019d be too mad if you learned the truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of the pack believes I\u2019d be happier thinking she committed suicide?\u201d</p><p>Jake twisted his head to the side. \u201cYeah. If we have a murderer in our midst, it could shake up the whole pack. If she committed suicide, everything would be a lot cleaner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left a suicide note in her own handwriting. She killed herself. End of story.\u201d Darien took another swig of his beer, but this time it tasted sour.</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you tell her sister the truth? Why send Tom, who\u2019s bound to botch the whole thing?\u201d Jake\u2019s mouth curved up, the first truly evil smile Darien had seen him offer in a while. \u201cIf he gets fresh, he\u2019s liable to look like Ritka with a colorful new eye.\u201d</p><p>Darien ignored his comment. \u201cIf a twin sister is looking into what happened, Lelandi must not have had any brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know she had any family, period.\u201d</p><p>Darien rubbed his forehead, trying to ease the tension pooling there. The gnawing pain of her death would never fade away, but now seeing her look-alike sister brought it all crashing back tenfold. Yet, he was furious with his mate for killing herself. Doc said it was part of the grief process, but Darien hated himself for not controlling his feelings better. Remorse, that\u2019s the only feeling he should allow himself. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to assume I didn\u2019t know a lot about my mate.\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced back at their usual table. \u201cIf it were me, I\u2019d tell the woman what I thought and send her packing. Things could get out of hand if she hangs around. It appears the other women think she wants to be your mate to replace her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be the damned day,\u201d Darien growled, yet a twinge of need wreaked havoc with his feelings, and his brother looked like he didn\u2019t believe him one bit.</p><p>Not far from the tavern, Lelandi heard the door creak open and shut. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw Tom taking great strides to reach her, his eyes and mouth lit in a smile.</p><p>Great. Just great. How in the hell was she going to put Plan B into effect and break into Darien\u2019s house to search for clues about Larissa\u2019s death while he was drinking at the tavern if one of his brothers shadowed her?</p><p>She cast him an annoyed look. His lips curved up even more and his eyes sparkled with way too much interest. She headed for the Hastings Bed and Breakfast, figuring she\u2019d slip out the window of her room if Tom took up residence in the lobby.</p><p>Before she reached the brick building, Tom joined her, standing so close that the heat of his body reached out to her. \u201cYou\u2019re Lelandi\u2019s sister, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarissa\u2019s,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>He bowed his head slightly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t certain until I heard you speak. You sure shook Darien up. But he needed to be rousted from the pit of hell he\u2019s been wallowing\u2014\u201d</p><p>The familiar sound of danger, a clicking sound made when someone switched the safety off on a gun, caught her ear, and she whipped her head around. In a heartbeat, she wished she\u2019d brought her gun in her purse. But it was hidden under the mattress until she needed it. And she was afraid she needed it now.</p><p>Tom seized her arm. \u201cWait,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her skin prickled with fresh concern. He\u2019d heard it, too. She\u2019d hoped she\u2019d been mistaken.</p><p>\u201cNine-millimeter,\u201d he warned, his voice hushed.</p><p>Before they could move, a shot rang out, Tom yelled and shoved Lelandi behind him, but collapsed to his knees. \u201cRun! Go back to the tavern!\u201d</p><p>Ohmigod, the bastard had shot Tom! Seizing his arm, she tried to move him, but he was dead weight as he slipped to the asphalt, passed out. Blood streaked down his face. The bullet had struck him in the temple.</p><p>The shooter moved out of the shadows, blocking her path to the tavern. A pleasant face to look at if the murdering bastard weren\u2019t wearing such a scowl. His scruffy black beard, unkempt hair, and rumpled clothes made it appear he\u2019d been living on the run for a few days. Amber eyes looked almost wolflike, but being upwind of him, she couldn\u2019t tell if he was human or lupus garou.</p><p>He aimed his gun at her. Silver bullets or regular?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Her heart racing, she tried to buy herself time.</p><p>Had anyone in the noisy tavern heard the shooting? She couldn\u2019t tackle the gunman from this distance. If she dashed for the inn, he might shoot Mrs. Hastings, or the twin girls who kept hanging around the lobby, although Lelandi sure wanted to get her gun.</p><p>Where the hell was Ural, now that she could use his help? If he was in his wolf form like she suspected, his wicked canines could take care of the menace. Taking time to strip and shapeshift into the wolf herself wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>Out of choices, she did the only thing she could think of to rouse help for Tom and maybe scare off the hesitant gunman. She screamed.</p><p>The shooter\u2019s eyes widened, his lips curved down, and he pulled the trigger, firing once, twice, three times. The impact of the bullets ripped into her chest, throwing her against the brick building, and she nearly collapsed. At first, no pain registered as she struggled to stay on her feet. When she didn\u2019t immediately expire on the spot, he stared at her as if she was the devil incarnate.</p><p>Then the pain struck hard and for an instant, her thought processes threatened to shut down. When he raised his gun, her brain caught hold.</p><p>She dashed toward the forest skirting the town, intending to double back as soon as she could and get help for Tom. She\u2019d give the shooter a real run for his blood money. Thank god the bullets didn\u2019t burn like silver ones would. She\u2019d live, if she could find refuge and allow her body time to heal.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Her assailant took chase.</p><p>Stabbing pain streaked through every inch of her now, and she could feel the hot blood seeping from the wounds. Every second her heart pumped more blood out, and she felt her legs weakening.</p><p>Run, damn you, Lelandi. If ever she had to push herself, this was the time.</p><p>Branches broke several yards behind her as she dove around trees, scrambled over fallen, rotting trunks, clawed through thick brush. As much noise as the gunman was making, she again assumed he was human. Good. He couldn\u2019t see the trail of blood she was leaving, nor could he smell her scent. Then again, the breeze was shifting so much, it would help to disguise her location. Oh hell, as much perfume as she was wearing, probably even a human could follow her. She tried to remain downwind of him.</p><p>Tried\u2014was the key word, because her senses were failing\u2014one by one.</p><p>She no longer heard the birds singing in the trees, or the wind whistling through the firs, just her heavy breathing and the blood roaring in her ears. Her eyes blurred and she misjudged the lay of the land. The ground seemed to give way. And she fell.</p><p>Striking branches and brambles, she grabbed for anything to stop her tumble down the steep incline, skinning and cutting her hands. She lost her hat first, her glasses next. A branch scraped off one earring, then the other. Her hair tangled on every branch in her path, yanking at her scalp, the branches and twigs giving up their hold as she rolled. Downward... downward, banging against rocks and stumps, her whole body bruised and battered, she gritted her teeth against the pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a second, she worried about the damned disguise and the trail she\u2019d left behind for the attempted murderer. Then her back struck something rock hard, unforgiving, massive. The pain shot straight up her spine, all the way to her brain, short-circuiting it.</p><p>Blackness enveloped her as her night vision and all her senses shut down.</p><p>Chapter 3</p> <p>REACHING A DULL ROAR, THE CONVERSATION AT THE TAVERN centered around Lelandi\u2019s sister\u2019s appearance in town when Darien\u2019s cell phone rang. He wasn\u2019t surprised to see Tom\u2019s cell number and assumed Lelandi\u2019s sister was causing trouble. He sure as hell hoped she hadn\u2019t slipped away from him. \u201cYeah, Tom? What\u2019s up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to come quick!\u201d Tom yelled into the phone, his voice breathy.</p><p>\u201cTom?\u201d Darien leapt from his chair. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunshots fired. Hastings Bed\u2014\u201d The phone died.</p><p>\u201cGunfire at Hastings!\u201d Darien\u2019s heart hammered his ribs as he and Jake bolted for the tavern door.</p> <p>From the thunderous roar of boots tromping down the street behind him, everyone from the tavern must be on his heels. While he raced toward the hotel, his muscles tensed for battle, concern for the woman and his brother\u2019s safety swamped him.</p><p>Although the insidious thought flashed across his mind that she might have shot Tom.</p><p>\u201cHastings Bed and Breakfast,\u201d he hollered to Jake, clarifying it wasn\u2019t Hastings Hardware.</p><p>\u201cCrap, Darien, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunshots were fired. Hell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Darien berated himself that he\u2019d put Tom\u2019s life in danger, when he should have gone instead.</p><p>His cell phone rang, and he jerked it off his belt.</p> <p>\u201cTom, what the hell\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBehind...\u201d Tom quit speaking.</p><p>In the eerie silence, Darien held his breath in anticipation as he and Jake stopped dead. \u201cTom? Tom!\u201d Silence.</p><p>\u201cArmed gunman somewhere near Hastings. Get Doc Oliver. Tom\u2019s been shot,\u201d Darien shouted to his men.</p><p>Gray-haired and bearded Mason, still wearing his gray suit\u2014the usual attire for Silver Town\u2019s bank owner\u2014yanked out his cell phone. \u201cGot it, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver bullets or regular?\u201d Jake asked.</p> <p>\u201cPhone went dead.\u201d</p><p>More shots sounded in the woods farther away. Darien cursed and quickened his run toward Hastings.</p><p>\u201cCareful, men. Not sure what kind of bullets the shooter\u2019s using.\u201d</p><p>He motioned for some to skirt around the front of the B&amp;B. Then he, Jake, and several others headed around back.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Tom?\u201d Jake asked under his breath.</p><p>\u201cPassed out maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill whoever the son of a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Groans came from behind a Dumpster. Anger blazed through Darien\u2019s veins as he and Jake bolted around the green trash bin.</p><p>Tom lay on his back, holding his bloodied head, his eyes dazed. \u201cWhere\u2019d she go? Odin\u2019s beard, my head hurts like a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell the others we found Tom!\u201d Darien shouted to some of the men as they drew closer. One of them handed him a handkerchief. Crouching next to his brother, Darien lifted his head in his lap, then tied the handkerchief around the bleeding wound. \u201cSilver or regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot silver. My body\u2019s rejecting the bullet, but it hurts like hell.\u201d Tom closed his eyes. \u201cWhere\u2019s Larissa?\u201d</p><p>Two more men came running toward them.</p><p>\u201cDoc Oliver\u2019s on his way.\u201d Mason shoved his phone into his pocket. \u201cNo sign of the girl or the gunman.\u201d He arched a gray brow in question. \u201cSure they aren\u2019t one and the same?\u201d</p><p>Hoping it wasn\u2019t so, Darien looked at Tom for an answer.</p><p>\u201cThor\u2019s thunder.\u201d Tom\u2019s gaze drifted and he squinted his eyes closed. \u201cHe shot Larissa, too.\u201d</p><p>Darien swore under his breath. The notion the maniac threatened Lelandi\u2019s sister\u2019s life twisted his gut. Issuing the next order took all his strength, when he wanted more than anything to take care of the matter himself. \u201cFind her, and get that damned gunman.\u201d</p><p>Any other decision would sound like he cared more for the red\u2019s safety than his own brother, or a pack member\u2014not a leadership quality. Applying pressure to the wound, he hoped Doc Oliver would hurry, because no matter how much he told himself otherwise, the woman looked too much like his dead mate to deny his feelings for her. Even in death, she held his heart captive.</p><p>Unable to contain his impatience he shouted, \u201cWhere the hell is Doc Oliver?\u201d</p><p>Three more shots rang out, reverberating through the forest, and Lelandi cringed. The gunman must be shooting at shadows. She hoped.</p><p>Survival of the fittest. That\u2019s what ran through her mind as she lay in the underbrush nestled at the base of a stand of spruce, her back wedged up against a moss-blanketed boulder. Her mind drifted when the pain from the three bullets lodged in her heart intensified. Her back didn\u2019t feel too swift either. She\u2019d survived worse. Hunter\u2019s wounds when she was a wolf, an attempted rape, a near drowning, now this. Her guardian angel sure worked overtime for her.</p><p>The pain grew hot, but the perspiration on her skin, refrigerated by the cool breeze and the blood soaking her turtleneck chilled her further. Something moved toward her. Intently, she listened to the sound of its scurrying and smelled the scents. Cold, crisp autumn, a hint of moisture in the air, a time when she baked apple pies, made special soups and hot spicy chili, decorated with pumpkins, squash, and colorful mums, the colors complementary to her fiery red hair and green eyes. Autumn, her special time of year.</p><p>Darien was a winter, sable hair, dark eyes, cold, brooding. North wind chilled. Winter.</p><p>The scurrying stopped, bringing her drifting mind back to her current set of circumstances. The creature\u2019s blood rushed through its small heart and veins, and she got a whiff of its unique smell. A rabbit. She closed her eyes and hoped Darien had found his brother and was easing his pain, like she wished someone could do for her.</p><p>A wolf howled. I\u2019m here, where are you?</p><p>Ural? He\u2019d find her, come for her, eliminate her assailant.</p><p>The gunman couldn\u2019t kill her with regular bullets, but she had to heal up some before she could move again. Getting the gunman away from Tom had helped him, but now she didn\u2019t have the strength to move an inch in the direction of Hastings Bed and Breakfast. Worse, she had no idea where she was.</p><p>Footsteps crunched on fallen leaves maybe a half mile away. The gunman\u2019s or Darien\u2019s and his men? She made out only one set of footfalls, most likely the gunman\u2019s.</p><p>Her chest hurt like it was on fire, and she stifled another groan. Don\u2019t pass out! If the gunman found her, she\u2019d make a horrendous racket, but if she passed out, he could move her somewhere else and kill her. Snapping her neck would do the trick, when regular bullets wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her thoughts shifted to the tavern, and she could imagine Darien racing out with half his people or more in hot pursuit if Tom had been able to call for help. Too late, she\u2019d seen the gunman hiding in the shadows of Hastings, and she berated herself again for not being more alert.</p><p>Would the grays waste their time searching for her if they discovered Tom was hurt? Maybe not, but they\u2019d continue to look for the gunman who\u2019d shot Tom.</p><p>She tried to concentrate on the bullets seated in her heart. Tried to envision her body working miracles to expel the foreign substances, stop the bleeding, and seal the wounds. But she\u2019d lost too much blood and felt weak, nauseous, disoriented. It would take some time to rebuild her blood. She groaned again.</p><p>Footsteps trudged closer, stopped, moved again.</p><p>No one spoke any words. Friend or foe?</p><p>She looked up through the tree branches shuddering in the wind. A sprinkling of twinkling stars littered the dark night sky. Star light, star bright... Sharp pains coursed through her body, down her arms and legs, and up again, sending blinding pain into her skull. Her vision blurring, she clenched her teeth to keep from fading away.</p><p>Where was Ural? Originating from one of the purest lines of the first lupus garou, she was a royal like him and could change into the wolf despite it being a moonless night. Being a wolf in this condition wouldn\u2019t help, however. Except the gunman wasn\u2019t looking for one. Yes! Then she could howl and return Ural\u2019s call. He\u2019d come to her then and protect her.</p><p>She fumbled with her jacket buttons, but didn\u2019t have the strength to unbutton even the first one. As weak as she was, she wasn\u2019t sure she could even shapeshift.</p><p>Where the hell was Ural? He could rip away the gunman\u2019s life in a flash. She\u2019d be safe\u2014or safer. But she didn\u2019t trust Ural\u2019s motives either. If he found her weak and unable to resist, he could return her to the pack. Damn him.</p><p>Wincing, she closed her eyes, trying to will away the pain.</p><p>Had the shooter targeted Lelandi because she looked like Larissa? Or did he assume she was here, trying to discover who had killed Larissa?</p><p>She swore a gray had murdered Larissa, angry that the leader of the grays had mated with a red. Or had her ruthless pack leader Bruin located Larissa, pretending that he hadn\u2019t? Now Lelandi wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>Then she thought she smelled Ural. Please, Ural, come and bite the bastard! But he didn\u2019t show himself, didn\u2019t attack the gunman. Maybe it was powerful wishful thinking.</p><p>\u201cLarissa!\u201d Darien shouted from a good half mile away.</p><p>Here! No, not Larissa... Larissa was dead. Lelandi! Here.</p><p>Lelandi closed her eyes. A whisper of a breeze caressed her face and strands of hair tickled her cheek, but she couldn\u2019t gather the strength to shove them away. And the pain. Oh, god, the pain.</p><p>Someone shuffled only feet from her. She squeezed her eyes tighter and barely breathed. How had he gotten so close without her hearing? Her mind drifted. Keep alert! If he was wolf and downwind of her, he could smell her spilled blood. He could hear her heart pumping at a furious rate.</p><p>She heard his beating rapidly, his heavy breathing, the grinding of his teeth, his fingernail scraping the metal of the gun. Then he moved farther away from where she curled up in a fetal position, trying to conserve energy and the heat of her body, trying to make herself smaller and unnoticeable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Others took up the call, shouting Lelandi\u2019s name as they spread out and drew closer. She frowned. How would they know her name? Larissa would have kept her family a secret so the grays wouldn\u2019t learn she already had a pack\u2014and a mate.</p><p>The gunman tromped farther away, stealing her attention, but he was still too close.</p><p>The breeze suddenly shifted and Darien\u2019s brooding brother Jake shouted, \u201cThis way!\u201d</p> <p>She watched for them, nearly quit breathing in anticipation, not to mention the pain grew so sharp she could barely focus on anything else.</p><p>But her rescuers didn\u2019t come.</p><p>Darien paced back and forth in the thick of the woods in front of thirty of his men, every one of them now armed. Although normally they hunted in their wolf coats, the pack had always kept guns\u2014their way of dealing with human troublemakers over the last one hundred and fifty years in the area.</p><p>\u201cWe thought we smelled her perfume several times, but the damned wind isn\u2019t cooperating! So where the hell is she?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cWe need to turn wolf,\u201d Jake said.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t for three more days,\u201d Sam reminded him.</p><p>\u201cHell, I know that, Sam. I was just saying...\u201d Jake didn\u2019t say anything more, just poked the toe of his boot in the pine needle\u2013covered dirt, his hands shoved in his pockets, his face dark with a mixture of concern and annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve searched for hours. Where the hell is she?\u201d Darien asked again, voicing his own irritation.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t found anything\u2014her hat, glasses, nothing\u2014as if she\u2019d vanished in thin air like a puff of mist on a hot, sunny day. He rubbed the pounding in his temples, the thought stirring his blood that she was Lelandi, wounded, hurting, waiting for him to come to her aid, and not her sister. For now, she was one and the same, and he\u2019d protect her with his own life. For now. Once he found her and she\u2019d healed, he\u2019d send her home to her pack and out of his life for good.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know these woods. She could easily get lost without her wolf senses,\u201d Jake warned.</p><p>Darien stared into the wilderness, remembering a time when he dashed with his mate through the woods as wolves, running until they were exhausted, mating, then collapsing like two half-spent dogs. He shook free of the immobilizing memories.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if he got her?\u201d Jake asked, a question Darien was sure everyone else was thinking. \u201cWhat if he took her body in a vehicle and planned to dispose of her somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>Darien wouldn\u2019t consider that scenario.</p><p>Mason rubbed his bearded cheek, his hair whipping in the breeze. \u201cWe\u2019ve searched all night. We\u2019re dog-tired. If they\u2019re just regular bullets, she can\u2019t die from them. Why don\u2019t we get some rest and try again in a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saved Tom\u2019s life.\u201d The muscle ticked in Jake\u2019s jaw like it did when he was on the verge of striking someone. \u201cI\u2019ll keep looking until some of you get rest and relieve me.\u201d</p><p>Having every intention of hunting for her until he dropped from exhaustion, Darien slapped his brother\u2019s shoulder with approval. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d been one of the pack, his men would have continued searching for her. Without her being one of them, he couldn\u2019t ask them to give up any more of their energy without getting some rest. He was glad his brother had offered, despite the fact he had distanced himself from Darien the last couple of weeks. Probably because of the foul mood Darien had been in since his mate died.</p><p>The smell of Silva\u2019s feminine scent wafted in the air, and the men turned to see her stalking toward them dressed in tight jeans, hiking boots, gloves, and a short-waisted corduroy jacket. \u201cI\u2019ll help ya.\u201d Her expression and tone of voice were as determined as Darien felt.</p><p>\u201cNo women,\u201d Darien said, his voice harsh, annoyed she\u2019d offer to join them.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Think I might want to kill her, too? Or maybe you\u2019re a tad worried about little ol\u2019 me? But I can handle myself.\u201d Silva smirked. \u201cThe woman\u2019s got spunk and she deserves our help.\u201d</p><p>Considering his options, another body that would fill the gap couldn\u2019t hurt. \u201cStay with one of the men at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Darien, I would almost think you have a thing for me.\u201d She blew him a kiss and sidled up to Sam.</p><p>\u201cWant to be my team mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, those who want to continue the search, do so. The rest get some sleep. Let\u2019s get moving.\u201d Darien took off with a lengthened stride, determined to find her before the night was over.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think is going on?\u201d Jake ducked under the branch of a spruce.</p><p>\u201cGunman\u2019s human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy go after our brother? Why go after the red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d Darien stopped to sample the breeze. The scent of other grays, a deer, a rabbit, pinesap, fall, nothing else. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t after Tom, I suspect. Just the red. Except Tom was following her and would have protected her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still think your mate committed suicide?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and it was his damned fault. Whirlwind romance, although she\u2019d seemed uncertain about becoming his mate, worried his people would revolt over her being a red, but anxious about something deeper that he could never get her to reveal. Maybe if he hadn\u2019t pushed her to be his mate. But hell, she was his soul mate, the one he\u2019d dreamed about for months. And she\u2019d finally revealed she\u2019d had the dreams about him, too. How could he let her go?</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think.\u201d Darien still harbored the same deep-seated feelings\u2014that she\u2019d committed suicide. He finally admitted, \u201cShe\u2019d tried before.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s mouth dropped. \u201cWhen? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was sorry. Told me she wouldn\u2019t try again and begged me not to tell the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pack leader has to have a strong mate, Darien, pack rules. You should have at least told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised her.\u201d</p><p>And it got her killed. Maybe if he\u2019d deep down listened to what was bothering her. Sleepless nights, medicine to aid her sleep, but still she kept waking, fearful, exhausted, out-of-sorts. Hell, when she managed to kill herself this time, he never doubted it was for real.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she try before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t say. She was a private person. She was overly tired, distraught\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s face heated, anger and regret warring with his emotions. Yeah, pregnant with their triplets. Which made the whole damned thing even more of a travesty. But if she couldn\u2019t deal with life before the triplets were born, how would she have been able to handle the stress afterward?</p><p>\u201cI understand why you think she might have committed suicide then, but don\u2019t you think this business with her sister sheds a different light on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Although he couldn\u2019t see that it did. Unless someone coerced Lelandi to write the suicide note. She hadn\u2019t been enthusiastic about having the babies, in fact seemed even more depressed about it. If anyone had coerced her, he didn\u2019t think it took much convincing, yet if anyone had, they\u2019d die at his hand.</p><p>Shots rang out a mile away, and Darien cursed under his breath. He charged in the direction, but Jake quickly caught up to him and grabbed his arm. Darien whirled around in fury, but saw Jake\u2019s concerned expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d</p><p>He stood as silent as a frozen lake in winter and listened with his wolf\u2019s hearing.</p><p>A heart beating farther away, slow, too slow, and then a groan.</p><p>\u201cLelandi!\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced at him.</p><p>Darien gave him a feral look and yelled, \u201cLarissa!\u201d</p><p>They searched the area again, Darien and his brother in closer proximity to each other this time, trying not to miss her. He paused. \u201cLarissa!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>THROUGH A FOG-FILLED HAZE, LELANDI FELT PRESSURE ON her throat as if a snake encircled her neck, squeezing tight. She struggled for breath, her mind blackening. She tried to smell the snake, but all she sensed was the strong odor of decaying leaves.</p><p>Then a gruff, impatient male voice shouted for Larissa, nearer now.</p><p>A low, threatening growl sounded.</p><p>Ural?</p><p>The pressure on her throat ceased, and she gasped for air, unable to catch her breath. She couldn\u2019t focus on anything, where she was, who he was, what had happened to Larissa. The snake moved quickly away, slithering through the brush, hiding from imminent danger. The pungent odor of humus departed with it. But a new scent drifted in the air. Her cousin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cUral,\u201d she tried to say, but his name stuck in her throat.</p><p>He slunk close to her, licked her cheek\u2014warm, wet, welcome. She wanted to hug his neck, but she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cLarissa!\u201d the male voice shouted, growing closer, his footsteps sending a sliver of a tremor through the ground, and another, not far away.</p><p>Lelandi, she corrected him silently. Even her parents, her brother, and the pack members constantly mixed up their names, to her utter annoyance. She swallowed hard, her throat sore, the pain in her chest radiating throughout her body, agonizing, punishing. Where was she?</p><p>Ural nudged her face, then backed away.</p><p>Was he behind her? Protecting her?</p><p>Cold numbed her joints, her skin, her bones. She couldn\u2019t sit or lift her head. But the darkness was beginning to grow light.</p><p>\u201cLarissa!\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, but the snake had stolen her voice. She squeaked out something inaudible. Taking a deep breath, she shut her gaping mouth, and stared in the direction of the footsteps.</p><p>Small rocks, twigs, and leaves slid down the hill in advance of the marauders, hurrying down the steep incline toward her, nearer and nearer. They\u2019d found her! But the elation was overshadowed by what they\u2019d want to do with her next.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Darien\u2019s rich baritone voice sent shivers of expectation through her torn-up body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hair was tangled by the wind, his brown eyes nearly black, his mouth grim and set.</p><p>Then she remembered. Larissa\u2014she was... was dead. And Tom\u2014shot. Was he all right? And Ural! If the grays catch him...</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Darien shouted again, and soon another man crashed through the thick brush. Darien jerked his leather coat off and wrapped her in it.</p> <p>Jake appeared, yanked a phone off his belt, shouted coordinates into the phone, and gave orders to keep searching for the gunman. \u201cShit.\u201d Jake paused as whoever he spoke to must have finally got a word in edgewise. \u201cSam was shot.\u201d</p><p>Darien stopped unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cIs he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit in the arm. He\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Silva?\u201d Darien removed his shirt and started to unbutton Lelandi\u2019s jacket.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s shook up, but fine. The gunman\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>Darien looked up at Jake. \u201cAnyone question him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Jake, I know that. But did anyone question him before he died?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head and hung up the phone, then he lifted his nose and sniffed. \u201cDo you smell a hint of a red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t as much perfume as she\u2019s wearing.\u201d Darien pulled up her turtleneck.</p><p>The cold air chilled her already frozen skin. He muttered an ancient wolf curse, then tucked his body-warmed flannel shirt against her wounds\u2014smelling of him\u2014all hot and spicy male.</p> <p>Her mind drifted until he spoke again. \u201cWho killed him?\u201d</p><p>She stared at his bare chest, lightly haired, muscled, bronzed, beautiful. Who said men\u2019s bodies couldn\u2019t be beautiful? Every inch of him looked incredibly lickable, kissable, real.</p><p>\u201cNot sure who killed him, Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. The gunman should have been questioned.\u201d</p><p>Darien pulled her shirt down with tenderness, warming her, and then he used the same gentleness to close her jacket. \u201cFirst off, who the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>So much for the tenderness.</p><p>Through clenched teeth, she tried to growl, \u201cLelandi, and you know who the hell I am,\u201d but her voice was too hoarse. Her eyes were so heavily lidded, she could barely keep them open, except to stare at his magnificent chest.</p><p>But why was the rest of him dressed? Naked, that\u2019s the way he appeared to her in the dreams, his corded muscles rippling as he moved, every part of his sculpted anatomy ready to pleasure her. And why was she dressed? When she was always bared to the skin, waiting for his hungry touch?</p> <p>He cursed. \u201cGod of thunder! My mate\u2019s dead, so what the hell do you think you\u2019re trying to pull?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze from his chest. Darien\u2019s stern face shook her loose of her fantasy. Unable to fathom what he was talking about, she knew his mate\u2014Larissa\u2014was dead. She choked on a sob.</p><p>He lifted her off the cold ground and the sight of his naked chest, square set jaw, darkened eyes\u2014everything\u2014faded away.</p><p>\u201cWoman,\u201d Darien called out to her from a million miles away, his steely voice cloaked in concern.</p><p>She heard him, but couldn\u2019t focus, couldn\u2019t open her eyes. Her body floated, jostled over the rough terrain while the big gray carried her.</p><p>\u201cHow many times did he shoot you?\u201d</p><p>Too, too many.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>Who?Her eyes fluttered open briefly, then slammed shut.</p><p>\u201cSpeak to me. At the tavern when you went to the restroom, what did the ladies do to upset you?\u201d</p><p>Crowded me. Not since she had martial arts training had anyone messed with her. Took a near human rape to convince her she needed a way to protect herself as a human. Too bad she couldn\u2019t have used it to disarm the gunman. But he hadn\u2019t been close enough. If only she\u2019d had her gun.</p><p>With a ragged sigh, she soaked in the heat of Darien\u2019s body, the strength of his arms wrapped securely around her, the smell of his masculinity, the smell of his sex. No matter how harshly he acted toward her, no matter how disinterested he pretended to be, he couldn\u2019t restrain that part of himself. He couldn\u2019t hide the telltale signals that he wanted her, like any alpha male lupus garou craved a female. The sexual chemistry between them sizzled, sending a volley of heat sliding through her. She moaned and he tightened his grip on her. Larissa must have delighted in mating with such a rugged figure of a man, much, much bigger than a red.</p><p>\u201cLarissa,\u201d he said, commanding her to respond.</p><p>She frowned and opened her eyes. Jake gave her a look as grave as Darien\u2019s as they climbed up the side of the ridge.</p><p>\u201cLelandi,\u201d she said on edge, with barely the breath to breathe.</p><p>Darien\u2019s grim lips scowled further.</p><p>She wrinkled her brows in concentration. \u201cThree.\u201d</p><p>Darien stared at her. \u201cThree what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s answering your previous question, how many times had she been shot?\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head limply.</p><p>Jake ran his hand over his scruffy whiskers. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to keep her talking. Ask her something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was as demanding as his brother\u2019s.</p><p>She swallowed hard, tamped down the pain in her heart, in her brain. Dead.</p><p>\u201cWe need to send her to her own people, let them take care of this,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cWhoever tried to kill her came into our territory. It\u2019s our jurisdiction, our matter to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if this had nothing to do with Lelandi?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cLarissa,\u201d she said, correcting him, this time angry. Couldn\u2019t they get their names straight?</p><p>Darien ducked with her underneath the branch of an oak. \u201cWhat if this does have to do with Lelandi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarissa,\u201d she said again, her voice becoming unduly agitated.</p><p>Hugging her closer, Darien climbed over a fallen log. \u201cShe\u2019s sure not following the gist of our conversation.\u201d</p><p>The aroma of bacon, sausage, and ham cooking in houses at the edge of town wafted in the air, and a rush of voices and footsteps headed her way. A hawk glided on the wind in search of its own breakfast that morning, and clouds were building. A hint of an early snow on the breeze added to the chill in her bones, while the pain in her chest and back spiraled out of control.</p><p>Coveting the heat of the gray, she wanted to lean further into him, but she felt as limp as a rag doll, unable to control her destiny. Taking another deep breath, she tried to smell his sex again. Every man\u2019s was different and most she never paid much attention to, but his was driving her mad. Virile, strong, musky, hot as a heated oven in summer, tantalizing. Had his special scent caught Larissa\u2019s attention?</p><p>Lelandi never figured she\u2019d be drawn to the same male as Larissa. Must be the gunshot wounds screwing up her sense of smell.</p><p>\u201cHold on, Larissa,\u201d Darien said, his voice darkly soothing. \u201cDoc will fix you up.\u201d</p><p>The look he shared with his brother cast doubt on his words.</p><p>\u201cGet Doctor Weber,\u201d she managed to croak out.</p><p>The silent glance that passed between Darien and Jake meant they had other plans. But Doctor Weber was one of the reds. He\u2019d know what to do. He\u2019d removed bullets from her flank when hunters had shot her as a wolf, resuscitated her when she\u2019d nearly drowned.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bringing Sam in,\u201d a guy said, crowding in with several others, hurrying to join Darien.</p><p>Sam? Oh, the bartender, devious smile, rugged, mountain-man type.</p><p>\u201cIs he wounded badly?\u201d Darien sounded gloomy.</p><p>\u201cNot as bad as the little lady appears to be.\u201d The man\u2019s beer breath made her wince when he squeezed in close to get a look.</p><p>\u201cSam was shot in the arm, nothing vital struck,\u201d another said. \u201cBut you know him, he\u2019ll be serving drinks by this evening, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLupus,\u201d she whispered and Darien\u2019s eyes grew wide.</p><p>Before she uttered another sound, he leaned down and kissed her, but the kiss didn\u2019t stop at silencing her words. His lips pressed deeper, promising more, willing her to agree, and then his warm mouth tantalizing hers faded away.</p><p>\u201cLarissa,\u201d he called out, drawing her forth from the darkness.</p><p>Darien\u2019s dark eyes gazed at her, pensive, pained.</p><p>Several of the men chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThe ladies will be clamoring for a kiss that would make \u2019em pass right out.\u201d Silva\u2019s voice was silky soft, dreamy, wistful.</p><p>Vehicle doors creaked open, and Lelandi closed her eyes, wanting to say something more to force the gray to kiss her again, but she couldn\u2019t come up with anything, her mind focusing on the way his lips touched hers\u2014hungry, desirous, feral.</p><p>\u201cSure they weren\u2019t a special kind of bullet?\u201d someone asked, his voice hushed.</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019s lost a lot of blood. The cold\u2019s taken a toll on her, too. Riding with her, brother?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Darien released her and she reached out to him, wanting his warmth, his comfort, another of his mind-numbing kisses. He seemed torn about showing any further affection.</p><p>Lying on something long, flat, and hard, she felt the blankets covering her, but the bone-chilling cold renewed after losing the heat of the big gray\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cMeet you over there.\u201d Darien\u2019s voice sounded gruff and unreal, like he was trying to put on a show for his pack, trying to distance himself from her. \u201cGot to check out Silva and Sam\u2019s story.\u201d</p><p>Feeling rejected, she wanted more of his touch, scowling at her, paying attention to her, anything. Yet, on another level, she shouldn\u2019t feel any of these things.</p><p>\u201cI can give you a report,\u201d Jake offered.</p><p>Again, there was a prolonged hesitation. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll check on her later.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s rejection cut deep, and she turned her misty gaze away so she couldn\u2019t see the hardened look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with her, Doc.\u201d Jake climbed in beside her and the vehicle rocked like a boat adrift in turbulent water. He smelled different, not as sexual as Darien. Maybe because he wasn\u2019t attracted to her like she sensed Darien was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Heaven forbid. A gray. Her dead sister\u2019s mate. And torn emotionally because of losing her. Yet, Lelandi couldn\u2019t stop craving his touch.</p><p>\u201cWait up!\u201d Silva said. \u201cI want to ride with her.\u201d</p><p>Darien put a hand on her arm, stopping her. \u201cI need to talk to you first, Silva.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t it wait, boss? Sam saw everything anyway. Uhm, as much as there was to see.\u201d</p><p>Again, there was a long pause before he responded.</p><p>\u201cGot to take care of the little lady,\u201d a white-haired man said.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Doc. But I want to hear what happened out there soonest, Silva.\u201d</p><p>Pack business. Nothing else counted. Certainly not Lelandi. Only the shooter who killed the gunman mattered. She gritted her teeth against the pain in her heart.</p> <p>\u201cYes, siree, boss,\u201d Silva said, her voice like cotton candy.</p><p>The ambulance jiggled some more, and Silva\u2019s slight feminine fragrance scented the air.</p><p>The doors slammed shut and the woman smiled at Lelandi, her expression wistful.</p><p>\u201cYou sure shook that big gray out of his doldrums, sugar.\u201d Silva turned to Jake. \u201cSo what in the world happened out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could ask you the same, Silva. Why the hell did the gunman have to die before he talked?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi croaked out, \u201cHe had to die. No witnesses.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 5</p><p>AS SOON AS LELANDI\u2019S LOOK-ALIKE SISTER HAD INVADED his favorite Friday night getaway since the death of his mate, Darien knew there\u2019d be trouble. His men were sure he wanted her to replace his dead mate. The women were already jealous he\u2019d be interested in another red. Despite the fact he\u2019d made every effort to show no interest in her.</p><p>Except for the kiss. Hell, he\u2019d only done it to silence her words. Yet, the kiss hadn\u2019t just stopped at prohibiting her from speaking, nor had he wanted it to, which was absolute madness. Worse, he made her pass out, not because of his passionate kiss either. She was severely injured for Odin\u2019s sake. What the hell was the matter with him anyway?</p><p>Letting his breath out in exasperation, he stood in front of Hastings Bed and Breakfast and examined Sam\u2019s flesh wound, seeing where the bullet had grazed his upper arm.</p><p>Sam was telling his story again, probably for the fiftieth time, relishing every second of his moment of glory while the townsfolk crowded around, listening in. \u201cThe gunman was following us, but Silva was chattering as usual and must have distracted me. He fired before I could get a shot off. Whoever killed the man hid in the trees on a ridge. Have no idea why he hasn\u2019t joined us to get a pat on the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably worried Darien would be pissed at him for not hitting the gunman somewhere less fatal.\u201d Mason slanted Darien a look.</p><p>Humans, curious about what had happened, mingled with his people, so Sam and the rest of Darien\u2019s people were cautious about what they revealed. Which made Darien think again about the kiss. Hell, he couldn\u2019t have the little red wolf, half out of her head, talking about lupus garous.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you to the hospital,\u201d Darien said, breaking up the show.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take him.\u201d Mervin still wore his old-time barber clothes, vest, red band around the arm of his white long-sleeved shirt, red bow tie, and the straw hat seated on his nearly black hair. \u201cThe sheriff\u2019s cutting his vacation short and headed back here, Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I want a meeting at two this afternoon with my team.\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019d seen the injured transported to the hospital, Darien returned to where the dead gunman lay. Two of his men rifled through the man\u2019s clothes. His black eyes were lifeless, a scraggly two-day growth of black beard covered his face and his long hair was unkempt.</p><p>\u201cNo ID.\u201d Mason removed his hand from the guy\u2019s jacket pocket.</p><p>Not that Darien expected he\u2019d have any. Not a local, but a human, and a good shot with a gun. A hired gun? Or his own job?</p><p>Mason jerked his thumb at the dead man. \u201cThe shooter killed him with one fatal shot to the head. Sure knew what he was doing. This guy used a 9-mm; powder residue on his hands and jacket, proving he fired the gun, silver bullets in his right side pocket.\u201d</p><p>Darien shifted his perusal of the gunman to Mason, who shrugged. \u201cThe bullets in the chamber are regular. The ones in his pocket would have killed your brother and the little lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t believe.\u201d Swamped with relief, Darien realized how lucky the woman and his brother had been.</p><p>Mason handed the bullets to Darien. \u201cSo a lupus garou killed him. How much you want to bet the silver\u2019s from our mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight tie into the missing silver.\u201d Darien\u2019s attention shifted north where two of his men headed in his direction, John Hastings, owner of the hardware store and B&amp;B and one of the founding fathers of the town, and Deputy Peter Jorgenson.</p><p>They both shook their heads, confirming they hadn\u2019t located the other shooter.</p><p>Deputy Jorgenson\u2019s amber eyes were nearly black, although he was never easily riled. \u201cWe found gunpowder residue and took pictures of where he\u2019d stood and tramped down the grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny trace of his scent?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cSo many of us were in the area, it\u2019s hard to tell. Even Sam\u2019s and Silva\u2019s scents were drifting on the breeze up that way.\u201d</p><p>Darien motioned to the gunman. \u201cTake him to the morgue. I want Doc Featherston to conduct an autopsy and give me a report ASAP. Have a ballistic test run on the bullet and a comparison made on every lupus garou\u2019s gun out here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get right on it,\u201d Deputy Jorgenson said.</p><p>Mason walked back to town with Darien, his face scrunched up in thought. \u201cYou think the shooter was a red or a gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was one of us or the shooter would have left a red scent. Easy to detect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled a red scent,\u201d Hastings said, half of his gray hair, loosened from the leather strap, now whipping about his shoulders in the breeze. \u201cFaint, but it was there.\u201d</p><p>Darien glanced in the direction of the dead man and the deputy organizing a party to carry him. \u201cNow that you mention it, Jake said he thought he smelled one near Lelandi. And we heard a couple of howls. Why didn\u2019t Peter mention smelling any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the only one who caught a whiff of it in the breeze. He discounted what I smelled. Said my sniffer wasn\u2019t as keen as it used to be. I\u2019ll give him that, but I know what I smelled.\u201d Hastings shook his head. \u201cYoung whippersnappers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien, wait up, boss!\u201d Deputy Jorgenson shouted, chasing after him. \u201cWe\u2019ve found evidence a red was in the area.\u201d</p><p>Darien gave Hastings a knowing look.</p><p>Hastings snorted. \u201cYeah, my sniffer\u2019s out of whack.\u201d</p><p>Deputy Jorgenson handed a patch of red fur to Darien.</p><p>\u201cFound it stuck to some brambles and definitely smells like a red lupus garou. \u201d</p><p>Darien looked up at his men. \u201cIt\u2019s fresh. Hell, he\u2019s got to be a royal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame one I smelled.\u201d Hastings gave the deputy a pointed glower.</p><p>\u201cPost guards for the woman around the clock,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Deputy Jorgenson took off running toward town.</p><p>\u201cThat young man\u2019s got what it takes to be sheriff some day,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cOnly if he listens to his elders,\u201d Hastings clarified.</p><p>Darien continued toward town. \u201cAnother sixty or so years, I\u2019m sure Uncle Sheridan will give up his job.\u201d</p><p>Hastings shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to retire once he learns all hell broke loose while he was on vacation for the first time in ten years.\u201d</p><p>Mason snorted. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in hog heaven\u2014ordering folks around. We haven\u2019t had this much excitement since that mental patient broke out of a loony bin, killed his family, then hid out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne reason not to allow humans to live in our town,\u201d Hastings said.</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t agree. \u201cKeeps us on our toes. Otherwise, we\u2019d get careless.\u201d</p><p>A large gathering of men at the edge of town were talking about the crimes committed. Most lupus garou societies blended with human-run towns. Silver Town was different\u2014run and controlled by lupus garous since its inception when the first settlers moved west, and Darien\u2019s family had opted to keep it that way.</p><p>When they reached them, Mervin spoke to Darien. \u201cThe red sure stirred up this quiet little town. Don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s going to settle down none for a time, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady\u2019s going home, soon as I explain how her sister died.\u201d</p><p>Several cast sideways glances at each other.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as she\u2019s well enough to travel,\u201d he added.</p><p>Some nodded, but he could tell they didn\u2019t believe him. The only way to prove his word was to send her packing, and he would, just like he said.</p><p>\u201cSee you boys later.\u201d</p><p>Darien stalked up the street to his SUV. Lelandi hadn\u2019t been in her grave three weeks, now this. But another thought puzzled him. If she\u2019d cut ties with her family, how had Larissa learned about her sister\u2019s death?</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been his soul mate, he would never have gotten involved with a red who had family, not without her parents\u2019 and the head of her pack\u2019s permission. He damn well suspected now she hadn\u2019t been a loner, giving up her pack, like she\u2019d said.</p><p>Climbing into the vehicle, he took a deep breath and smelled the new car leather. The vehicle was supposed to be perfect for a family, this one having four doors to accommodate the triplets. He squeezed his eyes shut and gripped the steering wheel hard. Several had warned him not to take the red for his mate, yet he couldn\u2019t get her out of his system, vivacious and spirited as she was. But he should have known she wouldn\u2019t have been strong enough to be a pack leader\u2019s mate.</p><p>When he parked at Silver Town Hospital, he noted the large number of vehicles there. Probably some of Sam\u2019s kin come to check him out. And Uncle Sheridan\u2019s sons, the twenty-four-year-old quadruplets, were there, too, probably looking in on cousin Tom. Darien blew out his breath. Keeping the community calm after the incident was going to be some job. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stalked into the hospital. With some reservation, several of the women and men greeted him in the waiting area. He could see he was going to be in the doghouse until he settled the matter.</p><p>Wearing hearts and flowers\u2013decorated scrubs, Ritka glowered at him with her good eye. The other was half-shut and turning green and yellow. \u201cThat bitch is in room four. If Doc wants someone to take care of her, he\u2019ll have to hire someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cecilia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOff today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her in.\u201d</p><p>Ritka\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall her in, or I will. You don\u2019t want me to have to do it.\u201d</p><p>Snapping her mouth shut, Ritka shoved her brown hair behind her ears. \u201cAll right, but she\u2019s not going to like it.\u201d</p> <p>Ritka grabbed the phone and hit a button, then tapped her long nails on the check-in counter. \u201cCecilia? It\u2019s me, Ritka. Get your butt in here. We\u2019ve got three patients with gunshot wounds, and the boss is calling the shots.\u201d She tilted her head to the side and gave Darien another dirty look. \u201cYeah, no shit. Three gunshot wounds and Darien said to get in here now.\u201d Ritka hung up the phone and folded her arms. \u201cYou can put up with her next, and believe you me, she won\u2019t treat your new fancy any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep a civil tongue where the woman\u2019s concerned, Ritka. She\u2019s a patient under my protection,\u201d Darien growled.</p><p>Her brown brows jerked upward.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said for her ears only. \u201cShe\u2019s one of ours until I can send her home to her own pack, so mind your ps and qs. I won\u2019t have anyone treating her poorly. You can tell your friends I said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Silva said, slipping in on the conversation. Darien swore she had hearing that beat anybody\u2019s. \u201cSo she\u2019s an official member of the pack already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnofficial. And you can spread the word.\u201d If anyone could, it was Silva.</p> <p>\u201cWill do, boss.\u201d Silva winked. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look too good. Been asking for a Doctor Weber. Figure it\u2019s her pack doctor. Kind of out of it. I don\u2019t think she realizes she\u2019s not back home, wherever that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Doc Oliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStitching up Sam.\u201d Silva glanced at Ritka. \u201cDoc says if you want to keep getting a paycheck you\u2019d better get into exam room number three, now.\u201d</p><p>Cursing under her breath, Ritka shoved past her and stalked down the hall.</p><p>Darien shook his head. Silver Town wouldn\u2019t be considered civilized by big town standards. He headed for room number four and glanced over his shoulder when Silva followed behind him. \u201cDon\u2019t need an escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an order?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her, Darien walked into the white room, where the smell of antiseptic was overwhelming. Larissa blinked her eyes. The railings were locked in place to keep her from falling out of the bed. Her wrists were restrained. Her face was ghastly pale in stark contrast to her black hair, stretching down to her waist over the white sheets. How could one little red lupus garou walk into town and turn it upside down?</p><p>\u201cWhy is she restrained?\u201d Darien drew closer to the bed, wanting to touch her, to assure himself she was real and well on the road to recovery.</p> <p>\u201cRitka said she tried to climb out of bed, but she might have restrained her out of spite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Doc Oliver said, walking into the room. \u201cLittle lady tried to leave when I showed up instead of some Doctor Weber.\u201d He folded his arms and observed her. \u201cShe\u2019s Lelandi\u2019s twin, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Darien said. \u201cBy the name of Larissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got tenacity. Even as bad off as she is, four of us had to restrain her. She\u2019s on heavy-duty medication, and even so, she\u2019s fighting it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were no longer blue, not as amber as Lelandi\u2019s but more green. \u201cShe must have been wearing contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook them out,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cCan you do anything about the hair?\u201d Darien asked, half-joking.</p><p>\u201cMelba can strip the color, try to make it more like the color of her eyebrows. She does human hair all the time,\u201d Silva said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not serious.\u201d</p><p>Silva touched Larissa\u2019s hair. \u201cThe dye won\u2019t hold anyway once the change takes place. Hmm, there\u2019s your solution, boss. In three days, she can change into the wolf, and it\u2019ll zap that hideous dye job from her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be here that long, if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days.\u201d Doc stroked his whiskerless chin. \u201cNot sure she\u2019ll be ready to leave that soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s that bad off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty weak. Doc Mitchell gave her some blood. So did Jake. Three days is pushing it.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head. The longer she stayed in Silver Town, the more trouble she\u2019d be.</p><p>Doc cleared his throat. \u201cNo one knows what this is about. Is there another gunman? Just the one? Did someone hire him? Will there be another hit? Lot of folks are pretty angry that the gunman wounded two of ours and no word why or who is behind the whole thing. Sending her away isn\u2019t the solution, until we know what\u2019s going on. What if Lelandi didn\u2019t commit suicide?\u201d</p><p>In disbelief, Darien stared at Doc. \u201cYou said she\u2019d committed suicide, and Doc Featherston certified it. Besides, my uncle said the same thing. As sheriff, he investigated the matter and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd came to the same conclusion. But, Darien, you\u2019re pretty persuasive when you want to be, and you were so hell-bent on believing she\u2019d committed suicide we went along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Odin\u2019s sake, Doc, if the three of you believed it was murder, you would have said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t blame it on me!\u201d Darien glanced at Silva to see her take on it.</p><p>Her dark brows raised a notch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you had reservations, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just the barmaid.\u201d Silva threw her hands up in an exasperated gesture. \u201cNo one listens to anything I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully?\u201d</p><p>He growled.</p><p>\u201cHell, Darien, truthfully, I don\u2019t know. But something\u2019s not right, now that her sister comes along and gets the whole town shot up.\u201d</p><p>His mate\u2019s twin sighed deeply. She blinked a couple of times, but didn\u2019t focus on anything.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got to be here for three more days, then, eh, Doc?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cIn town, yes. She shouldn\u2019t travel a great distance. But she can stay somewhere else for the next couple of days. Tonight, I want to keep an eye on her. She\u2019ll need someone to look after her once she leaves here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss, boss,\u201d Silva said, \u201cbut Sam can do without me a couple of days. I\u2019ll look after her. I\u2019m just about the only female in town who liked Lelandi, so maybe I can do her sister a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if someone\u2019s still aiming to get Larissa?\u201d Doc asked.</p><p>Darien considered her groggy state. \u201cPeter\u2019s making sure she has around-the-clock protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave Trevor do the inside surveillance, won\u2019t you?\u201d Silva winked.</p><p>Uncle Sheridan stormed into the room, looking like a stuck bull. \u201cWhat in the Sam Hill is going on?\u201d His voice boomed, though at six-four, everything about the man seemed overbearing and loud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my hospital now, Sheriff,\u201d Doc said. \u201cKeep your yelling down to a low roar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard yelling, Doc. Gone two days of a ten-day vacation and what happens? Where were those two worthless deputies of mine?\u201d</p><p>Silva cleared her throat. \u201cTrevor was busy overseeing the clearing of a landslide on the highway, Sheriff. Don\u2019t know what Peter was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter was with us,\u201d Jake said, walking into the room. He glanced at Larissa. \u201cShould we be discussing this here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the cause of it, Ritka told me,\u201d the sheriff countered, motioning at Larissa.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d certainly say so.\u201d Silva folded her arms and gave the sheriff a disgruntled look.</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t she? The woman started stirring up trouble at the tavern. Next thing you know, three people are shot. I want to know what the hell\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your job to find out.\u201d Darien didn\u2019t bother to curb the acid in his voice.</p><p>Doc put Larissa\u2019s chart back in the folder. \u201cGot some other patients to see to. Need to speak to you when you can spare a moment, Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy...\u201d Larissa paused. \u201cMy sister... was... murdered,\u201d she stammered, then shut her eyes.</p><p>Everyone stared at her in stunned silence.</p><p>Darien had figured that\u2019s what Lelandi\u2019s sister must have thought. \u201cSince she doesn\u2019t have any family here, I want you to sit with her for a couple of hours, Silva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, and miss out on the fun stuff.\u201d Silva pulled a vinyl-covered chair next to the bed. \u201cHave Trevor run by my place and pick up one of my novels, will ya? Give me something to do while I\u2019m babysitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask him,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>The sheriff yanked off his Stetson and waved it at Jake. \u201cHold on here just a blamed minute. He works for me, and I\u2019ve got an investigation to conduct.\u201d</p><p>Darien raised his brows at his uncle.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s brown eyes darkened and narrowed. \u201cWell, hell, if it only takes a minute, I guess I can spare him.\u201d</p><p>Jake added, \u201cTom\u2019s asking to see you, Darien, and he wants to take a peek at Larissa to see for himself that she\u2019s all right, but Doc says he has to stay put for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Come on, Uncle Sheridan. We\u2019ll fill you in on all we know, though it\u2019s not much.\u201d Darien ushered everyone out of the room.</p><p>Larissa looked small, pale, the spitting image of Lelandi, except for the hideous black hair, now that the contacts, glasses, earrings, and hat were gone. His heart lurched when her eyelids fluttered open, and she caught him gawking at her. He refused to get caught up in the bewitching enchantments of his dead mate\u2019s twin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She closed her eyes and released his gaze.</p><p>Crap, she was as much a lure as her sister. Best to keep distance between himself and the temptress.</p><p>He caught Silva\u2019s smug smile, his body heated to boiling, and he turned on his heel and stalked out of the room.</p> <p>Boots tromped down the hospital hall, then everything grew quiet. The medicine took hold, the tranquility drawing her into another world, and Lelandi\u2019s heart lightened at the scene before her.</p><p>Mist filled her vision, and he came to her.</p><p>Naked. His bronzed body glistening in the brilliant light of the full moon. Proud, determined, his mission\u2014to ravish her\u2014again.</p><p>So what took him so long?</p><p>Tall with broad shoulders, his chest magnificently muscled, moving with the grace and ease of a wolf, he stalked toward her. Whereas most of her kind were shorter and the ones in power, squatter, more bull-like, this man was Adonis reborn.</p> <p>She still couldn\u2019t see his face, doused in shadows, teasing her, making her strain to see his features. Her eyes shifted to his chest. Lower. To his erection. He was ready for her. Always ready, his sex jutting upward surrounded by sable curls.</p><p>She breathed in deeply, trying to smell his unique scent, wishing she could locate him in the real world upon waking, but her keen wolf senses couldn\u2019t pick up his manly scent\u2014not in a dream.</p><p>Reclining on the grass on her side, she watched him as he strode toward her, every hard muscle rippling with his gait. Yet, just the vision of him five months ago had been enough to bring her into her first wolf heat, way long overdue. How could a fantasy lover have brought that about?</p><p>She wanted to call out his name like a lover would her mate, but she couldn\u2019t fathom what it was. The warm summer breeze stirred the Douglas firs, casting dancing moonlight across his body. His lips turned up slightly, bemused. His mouth, his sturdy jawline, his shoulder-length sable hair ruffled by the breeze. Show me more! She wanted to see his eyes, his nose, the rest of his face\u2014but as much as she strained to see them, she couldn\u2019t\u2014the rest of his features remained hidden in the black void.</p><p>He towered over her, took in a deep breath, and tried to smell her. She saw the intake of his breath, knew what he was attempting to do. A queer feeling of unease washed over her. She squashed the unwelcome worry. He was not real. Just the most consummate lover a dream could conjure up.</p><p>He lay down beside her, and she ran her finger over his brow, finding it furrowed. For the first time since their union, he seemed contemplative, unrushed, as if he wanted more than the sex they shared.</p> <p>Leaning over, he nuzzled her lips with his mouth, licking them, smiling. Positioning himself closer, he rested his head on his hand and appeared to study her. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words would never come. He touched her hair, ran his fingers through the strands, held them to his nose and took a deep breath.</p><p>Could he smell her scent when she couldn\u2019t sense his?</p><p>He traced her arm, down to her hip, his heated touch stirring a fire across her sensitive skin. She drew close, pressing her breasts against his chest, took his face in her hands, and moved her lips against his in a searing kiss. She swore she heard him growl this time, but then he glanced over his shoulder, as if something in the woods had distracted him. Danger?</p><p>He shook his head and gave her a lusty smile.Knowingly, she returned the expression, her nipples already taut from touching his lightly furred chest, her short curly hairs damp with need, her core aching for his penetration.</p><p>In a heartbeat, he moved her onto her back, pushed her legs apart with his knee, and thrust his rigid shaft deep inside her. His mouth on hers, he conquered her, and she gave into the rush of heat, the burning desire he stirred within her, the flickering flames consuming her as she climbed toward the ice-white moon.</p><p>Their bodies slick, they slid against each other, panting, thrusting, deepening the bond until she felt the mind-shattering release, the orgasm crashing through her like a heated summer storm.</p><p>Muffled voices farther down the hall invaded Lelandi\u2019s private, scattered thoughts.</p><p>Her dream lover slipped away into the shadows, vanishing, the moon winked out, and the sun took its place, peeking through the blinds. She wished she were back in the woods with her fantasy lover, no cares in the world but of being pleasured by him and pleasuring him in return. Groaning, Lelandi tried to run her hands through her tangled hair, her skin sweaty from her romp with him.</p> <p>But something held her down\u2014him?</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>LELANDI OPENED HER EYES AND BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHTS flooded her vision. Where was the ceiling fan in her bedroom? She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to orient herself. The odor of antiseptics filled the air. Her eyes popped open. White sheets, railings caging her in on an elevated narrow bed. What the...</p><p>She tried to reach up, to rub her temple as her thoughts spun out of control, but she couldn\u2019t. Leather restraints wrapped around her wrists pinned her to the bed\u2014not the man of her dreams.</p><p>Her sister. Oh, God, and her parents, too, were dead.</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and her heart lodged like a lump of stone in her throat. She sobbed with a strangled whimper and a teary haze blurred her vision. Yanking at the restraints, she fought the mounting frustration, her body heating by degrees.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she licked her dry lips. What she wouldn\u2019t give for an icy pink lemonade. Summer heat had returned with a vengeance, and she felt like she\u2019d been burned to a crisp under the broiling sun like she had at the beach in South Padre Island a few years back.</p><p>A rustling noise caught her attention\u2014Silva searching through Lelandi\u2019s purse.</p><p>Silva smiled, her ruby lips glistening with fresh gloss, a coating of brown eye shadow emphasizing the darkness of her coffee-colored eyes. \u201cNo driver\u2019s license. How\u2019d you get to Silver Town? No rental cars unaccounted for. Deputy Sheriff Trevor checked the cars parked around town, and none belong to a Larissa Catterton.\u201d</p><p>It finally dawned on Lelandi. Her sister had switched first names with her. What a mess. \u201cCatterton?\u201d</p><p>Silva tsked. \u201cSo that wasn\u2019t Lelandi\u2019s last name.\u201d</p><p>No, and Lelandi wasn\u2019t her first name either, although no one had listened to her the times she\u2019d corrected them before.</p><p>\u201cSo what is your real last name?\u201d Silva poured a cup of ice water for her, then set it on the table.</p><p>With her wrists secured, Lelandi couldn\u2019t reach the water. \u201cLelandi.\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to reveal her real last name. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m burning up.\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s eyes widened, and she hurried over to the bed. Her long, icy fingers touched Lelandi\u2019s forehead, instantly sending a chill streaking down her heated nerves. \u201cYou\u2019re burning up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already said that,\u201d Lelandi whispered, annoyed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll get some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you unfasten my chains,\u201d Lelandi said sarcastically, \u201chelp me to sit up, and give me some ice water to drink?\u201d</p><p>Silva shifted her worried gaze to the wristbands confining her. \u201cI\u2019ll get the doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Weber,\u201d Lelandi said, firmly.</p><p>\u201cUhm, you\u2019re at the hospital in Silver Town, sugar.</p><p>I\u2019m sure Doctor Weber wouldn\u2019t want to come all the way here from wherever you know him for one little ol\u2019 patient.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi yanked at the leather wrist bracelets to no avail.</p><p>If it had been a regular hospital, they probably would have used Velcro restraints, and those she could have tugged loose. She pulled at the restraints again, rattling the bed railings, but her movements were dulled and of no use, making her skin heat even more.</p><p>Satisfied Lelandi wasn\u2019t getting loose, Silva left the room. Within minutes, her worried voice echoed down the hall while she spoke to someone about the fever. But before she or the doctor returned, a woman wearing blue scrubs walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nurse Grey.\u201d The woman\u2019s face was matronly, with kindly gray eyes and lips that were pale, but slightly turned up. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been rather cantankerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me,\u201d Lelandi mumbled.</p><p>The nurse chuckled, the sound good-hearted, while she read Lelandi\u2019s chart. \u201cBusy girl. Heard some wild rumors. You\u2019re looking into your sister\u2019s death and already stirred up a heap of trouble.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi had made a royal mess of it, but whoever had killed her sister was bound to slip up. When he did, she\u2019d make him suffer for what he\u2019d done. She closed her burning eyes.</p><p>\u201cSeems a lot of trouble for a little red lupus garou to get into first time in Silver Town.\u201d</p><p>Although the woman seemed nice enough, Lelandi didn\u2019t trust her. Lelandi was probably giving their pack leader prime grade heartburn, and she wasn\u2019t going away. Some would be wary, some outright rude, and some, sweet like Sam, Silva, and this Nurse Grey, but only on the surface. Deep down, pack mates stuck up for pack mates, and she was an outsider investigating them. Tom was another story. He definitely indicated he had the hots for her, but she wasn\u2019t biting.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll behave, I\u2019ll remove the restraints.\u201d After Nurse Grey took her temperature, she frowned. \u201cHundred and three.\u201d She changed her antibiotics and removed the restraints.</p><p>Lelandi let out a low growl, and the woman smiled. Yeah, wolves didn\u2019t like confinement, and she was ready to bite anyone who\u2019d helped restrain her, including Ritka and the doctor.</p><p>\u201cDoc wants you to drink fluids, but slowly. You might feel nauseous from the surgery and pain medication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse Grey,\u201d Silva said, walking into the room. \u201cI thought you were off today and tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The nurse shrugged. \u201cI thought so, too. Seems we had some trouble during the night.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi hid a smile, then sipped cold water from a straw, shivered, and slumped back under her covers. If she didn\u2019t get more energy soon, she\u2019d scream.</p><p>\u201cShe sure isn\u2019t like Lelandi.\u201d Silva studied her as if she could see her insides, too.</p><p>Nurse Grey refilled Lelandi\u2019s water cup. \u201cLooks the same, except for the hair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you imagine Lelandi taking on Ritka and her gang?\u201d</p><p>The nurse smiled. \u201cGuess I ought to go to the Silver Town Tavern more often. Sam said when he saw her walk into the joint, he knew it would shake Darien out of the pit of despair he\u2019s been wallowing in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but in a good way, or bad?\u201d Silva raised her brows to punctuate her statement. \u201cYou should have seen the way he kissed her.\u201d</p> <p>Nurse Grey glanced at Lelandi. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, he wanted to kiss her in the tavern, but he was trying to keep up appearances.\u201d Silva pushed her hair back over her shoulders and placed her hands on her hips. \u201cShe started talking about lupus garou, and he had to stop her. But the kiss lasted longer than necessary and made her pass right out. I\u2019m sure when the other eligible bitches hear about it, they\u2019ll be fuming.\u201d</p><p>Nurse Grey\u2019s eyes sparkled with intrigue.</p><p>\u201cSo, is she going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are we not? She\u2019ll be fine. However, the fever makes it more of a setback. I notice on the chart, Doc says he\u2019ll release her tomorrow. Might be too soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe should be in jail for popping Ritka in the eye,\u201d a dark-haired man said as he strode into the room, his eyes black, his police khaki uniform perfectly pressed, a jacket slung over his shoulder. His Stetson shaded his eyes, giving him an even darker-tempered appearance.</p><p>Silva smiled at him. Well, more than smiled at him, nearly melted in his presence.</p><p>Truly smitten. Lelandi wondered if the same love bug had bitten him or if it was only a one-way street. He didn\u2019t show the same kind of moonstruck attraction when he looked at Silva.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Trevor, you done with that mess on the highway?\u201d Silva asked, her voice sweet as spun sugar.</p><p>\u201cSheriff chewed my butt for not taking care of her mess.\u201d He jerked a thumb in Lelandi\u2019s direction. \u201cSaid shootings take priority over mud slides. Hell, they needed someone to reroute traffic. Four accidents out there. Six injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilva stuck up for you when she didn\u2019t need to.\u201d Lelandi glowered back at the deputy. Silva\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cSeems you owe her thanks. No one else bothered to defend your actions.\u201d</p> <p>Trevor shoved his hands in his pockets and continued to glare at Lelandi. \u201cWho was the man who shot you?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. Question the bastard! How would she know who he was?</p><p>\u201cHe shot you in the chest twice\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree times,\u201d she said, her breathing still ragged, \u201cbut who\u2019s counting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of us, well, kinda, and you can see as well as we can in the dark, so who was he?\u201d</p><p>Silva tsked. \u201cCan\u2019t you question her later, when she\u2019s not so bad off?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s face reddened. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d he said, his voice elevating. \u201cWho the hell shot him dead, and why didn\u2019t anyone question him first?\u201d</p><p>Silva cleared her throat. \u201cTrevor, we\u2019ve given the sheriff our statements. Someone shot him from a distance. We never saw who it was, and after he did the deed, he never came down to see if Sam was all right. Unless he did, but just blended with the men who came to investigate the shots fired. The word is Darien might be so mad at whoever the shooter was for not just wounding the gunman, the guy\u2019s not telling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, anyone would be afraid Darien would be pissed, especially the way he\u2019s been acting lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone tell you that you\u2019ll be guarding us at my place?\u201d Silva asked, her tone sweet and innocent.</p><p>Trevor scowled at her. \u201cBabysitting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever know. Trouble seems to follow her. You could be in the thick of it this time.\u201d</p><p>Nurse Grey shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean the young lady will be going to your town house, Silva. She needs to remain here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Doc\u2019s worried the hospital isn\u2019t secure enough for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJail cell will do the job.\u201d Trevor shoved his hat back and crossed his arms over his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cAh, Trevor.\u201d Silva furrowed her brow at him.</p><p>\u201cHell, I saw how she beat up Ritka.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled. The woman couldn\u2019t have been more outraged when paramedics wheeled Lelandi into the hospital. Luckily, the doctor ordered two men to watch over her, making sure Ritka didn\u2019t finish what the gunman had begun.</p><p>\u201cHell, look at the way she\u2019s smiling about it. No remorse or anything. Criminal behavior if I ever saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey started it,\u201d Silva argued. \u201cThree against one, and every one of them is bigger than her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRitka said this one started it to prove she\u2019s after Darien, like her sister had been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Darien did the chasing. Hell, Lelandi didn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s face grew crimson again. \u201cI\u2019ve got work to do, straightening out this mess. Then I guess I\u2019ve got babysitting duty later.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi swore he looked hopeful something bad would happen so he\u2019d get in on the real action this time and be able to prove to his boss how important he was.</p><p>He stalked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to check on Tom, but if she needs anything, just holler,\u201d Nurse Grey said, then left.</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s just you and me, kid.\u201d Silva sat in the vinyl chair against the wall. \u201cYou look like you can barely stay awake. Why don\u2019t you get some sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister didn\u2019t chase Darien?\u201d Lelandi squeaked, hating that her voice was so out of control like the rest of her.</p><p>\u201cHardly. Darien doesn\u2019t like women who chase him. He likes to do the pursuing.\u201d Silva leaned back in the chair and rolled her sun-streaked chestnut hair between two fingers.</p><p>She really was a striking woman and Lelandi wondered why Darien didn\u2019t seem attracted to her.</p><p>Silva smiled. \u201cSo if you\u2019re interested in getting his attention, don\u2019t go hunting him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t think of it.\u201d Lelandi wanted to roll onto her stomach, the way she normally slept, but she couldn\u2019t with the IV in place. Plus, she had a sneaking suspicion her wounds would give her fits if she tried.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand, if you want him to leave you alone...\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stopped struggling with her thin white cotton blanket and looked over at Silva.</p><p>\u201cAct really interested in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening.\u201d This time Lelandi\u2019s words came out loud and clear, to both her surprise and Silva\u2019s amusement.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, well your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d Lelandi\u2019s voice did the raspy, hoarse bit again. \u201cI\u2019m here for one thing only. Finding out who killed my sister and why, and terminating him. I\u2019m not interested in some alpha gray pack leader who just buried his mate who happened to be my triplet. End of story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriplet? Ohmigod, don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s another one of you. The news will put Darien in an early grave for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother, and if he were here, he\u2019d search for our sister\u2019s killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he must be a rogue, an alpha male, and must have left your pack. So, where is he now?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes misted and she shrugged, wishing to hell her brother or even her uncle, who was seven years older than them, would help her.</p><p>Silva chewed on her bottom lip. \u201cWhat if the dead gunman killed your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound so certain. How do you know?\u201d</p><p>Darien walked into the room, making both Silva and Lelandi gasp. How long had he been listening in on their private conversation?</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he wasn\u2019t the one who killed Lelandi, assuming she didn\u2019t commit suicide?\u201d he asked, his voice harsh and accusatory.</p><p>\u201cShe told me.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. You had secret triplet communication.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you mean she sent me a letter, yeah, she did.\u201dLelandi swore he looked sicker than she felt, which had to be pretty hard to do the way she was feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, boss?\u201d Silva asked.</p><p>An alpha male did not faint. But his face had turned paler than her sheets, and she figured he was on the verge.</p><p>He gripped the doorframe for a minute, then growled, \u201cWhere\u2019s the letter?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to fold her arms to prove she wasn\u2019t afraid of his alpha wolf posturing, but she thought better of it when she remembered the IV. Instead, she closed her eyes and listened to the hammering of his heart against his ribs.</p><p>\u201cTell me, damn it! Where\u2019s the letter?\u201d</p><p>His voice grew closer, his breathing hard. She might have been afraid of him if it wasn\u2019t for the medicine making her loopy. Opening her eyes, she tried glaring at him when he gripped her bed railing, glowering at her as if he wished to kill her himself, but she wasn\u2019t sure she was sharing her meanest look with him the way her eyelids kept drooping. She hadn\u2019t an ounce of energy to spare.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a bad way, Darien. Let her rest and you can question her later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, damn it. I want some answers now.\u201d</p><p>As a wolf, she could imagine his teeth would be dangerous, but as a human, they were beautiful, straight, white, clenched, and...</p><p>She yawned and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, speak!\u201d</p><p>A small laugh sounded. It wasn\u2019t from her, but when she opened her eyes, both Silva and Darien were staring at her. She realized that it was from her, after all.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>GOD, SHE WAS EXASPERATING, AND BEAUTIFUL. BEAUTIFULLY exasperating. But Silva was right, the woman was barely out of surgery, pumped full of dope, and scarcely able to keep her eyes open. Yet she could manage a pitiful laugh at Darien\u2019s expense.</p><p>Darien gripped the bar tighter on her bed, then released it and stalked out of the room. Seeing his uncle questioning some others, he motioned to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Darien, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSearch Larissa\u2019s room. She must have been staying at Hastings Bed and Breakfast since she was headed in that direction when the gunman shot her. If she got a letter from Lelandi, bring it to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pack laws ruled, no search warrants needed.</p><p>\u201cAnd, pack up her things. She\u2019s staying at my place when she leaves the hospital. But until then... hell, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot falling for another one of them, are you?\u201d Uncle Sheridan\u2019s voice reflected stormy censure as they walked outside the hospital.</p> <p>Darien rebuffed his comment with humor. \u201cNot this time. Hell, I don\u2019t care for women who chase after me.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan shook his head. \u201cGood thing she doesn\u2019t know any better.\u201d He cocked a dark brow, but his expression was still scornful.</p><p>Darien wasn\u2019t getting involved with the woman!</p><p>When they arrived at the Queen Anne Victorian bed and breakfast, Mrs. Bertha Hastings hurried to greet them, wearing one of her more colorful floral dresses. Didn\u2019t matter the time of year, she always dressed in flowery patterns. Told everyone who would listen she was probably a garden fairy in another life. Even now her lobby and check-in counter were filled with bouquets of flowers, ivies trailing down plant stands, and small ficus trees cuddled next to the big windows, leaning toward the sun, making it appear she\u2019d brought the great outdoors inside.</p><p>\u201cIs the young lady going to be all right?\u201d Mrs. Hastings handed them a key to room five.</p> <p>She shook her head before Darien could respond. \u201cI know, I should have told you right away when she arrived. At first, I didn\u2019t recognize she was Lelandi\u2019s sister. But I caught her without the glasses and hat, and then I could see the obvious resemblance, despite the rest of the disguise. Oh, and her voice of course. Same sweet tone. How\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>Darien cleared his throat. \u201cAfter a couple of days, she should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Tell her I\u2019m saving her room for her.\u201d</p><p>He was going to tell her Larissa was leaving here for good, as soon as he found her pack and they came for her. But Uncle Sheridan beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be going home to her pack as soon as she\u2019s well enough.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hastings\u2019s mouth dropped slightly. She hurried to pluck dead flowers from a vase of mums. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it. I\u2019d hoped...\u201d She quickly glanced at Darien, but didn\u2019t say anything further.</p> <p>That he would take Larissa as his mate? He shook his head. \u201cDid anyone come here looking for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Trevor already asked. Some guy accosted her behind the house. I had my phone ready to call for backup when he grabbed her arm, but she swung her arm down and around, freeing herself. Just as quickly, she kicked up her knee like she was going to hurt him you know where. Looked like kung fu or something. Anyway, before he began to sing soprano, he jumped back, and that was the end of the confrontation. He stalked off toward Mervin\u2019s barbershop, and she headed for the tavern to see you. At least I presumed that\u2019s why she asked where you\u2019d be on a Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan gave a derisive snort, his expression mirroring his response. \u201cChasing after you like you said, Darien.\u201d He pulled out his notepad. \u201cCan you describe what the guy looked like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe five-foot-eight or so, lanky. He was wearing jeans, hiking books, a copper-colored coat. His hood was up, hiding his face.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cCouldn\u2019t see much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopper coat? That should be easy to spot.\u201d Darien hoped they might finally have a lead.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen the guy again since the incident out back. And I don\u2019t recall having seen him before.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou figure Larissa knew him?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was repotting some flowers in the shed out back and heard her squeal. I peeked out the window and saw him draw close to her, and then heard them exchanging angry words. So I assumed they knew each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA red from her pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured. You know, this girl\u2019s as sweet as her sister, but a mite more...\u201d Mrs. Hastings smiled. \u201cSpirited. More of a tigress at heart. Be careful of this one. She may look like her sister, but she\u2019s not the same. Danger seems to follow her.\u201d</p><p>If that wasn\u2019t the understatement of the day. \u201cDid Trevor search her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He talked to one of the twin girls staying here, but that was all. I asked if he wanted to search Lelandi\u2019s sister\u2019s room, but he said he had more important things to do, and he\u2019d return later. He hasn\u2019t come back and that was a couple of hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan swore under his breath. Darien was going to tell his uncle to find out what Trevor\u2019s problem was, but the stormy look on his uncle\u2019s face told him he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cIf you remember anything more, let us know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d She poured water into a pitcher. \u201cShe\u2019s not leaving right away, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until she\u2019s well enough to travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She gave him a sugary smile and went back to watering her plants.</p><p>Darien and his uncle headed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Uncle Sheridan asked.</p><p>\u201cPack member for sure giving her a hard time for entering another pack\u2019s area without permission and getting herself into trouble. Maybe boyfriend. Doubt it\u2019s the brother she mentioned because if he was and suspected Lelandi had been murdered, he would have come instead of Larissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he is her brother and doesn\u2019t believe Lelandi was murdered.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head. \u201cShe indicated she didn\u2019t know where he was.\u201d The way she seemed so tearful, he believed her. \u201cI bet the patch of fur we found in the woods was this guy\u2019s. He\u2019s probably hanging around near the hospital, somewhere out of sight.\u201d</p><p>Darien stuck the key in the door lock, but a window slid open inside. \u201cSomeone\u2019s inside.\u201d He unlocked the door, but something blocked it, and his blood instantly heated. \u201cAround back.\u201d</p><p>They raced through the hallway and Mrs. Hastings scrambled out of the way, spilling the pitcher of water. Darien and his uncle dashed into the kitchen and banged the back door open. No sign of any intruder, but footprints had been left in the manicured lawn shaded by firs that edged the forest. They dashed to the back side of Larissa\u2019s room. The window was now locked and curtains pulled closed so they couldn\u2019t see a thing.</p><p>Uncle Sheridan grabbed a flowerpot and broke the glass with a loud crash, sending dirt, golden mums, and bits of clay pottery flying.</p><p>Mrs. Hastings would have a fit.</p><p>They cleared away enough of the glass, climbed through the window, and found the place neat as if the maid had just cleaned up, except for the dresser shoved against the door blocking it, and the mess his uncle had made.</p><p>Darien shook his head, figuring the intruder had come for the same piece of evidence he was looking for. He and Sheridan searched the lace-covered canopy bed, underneath it, the dressers, and bedside tables, the closet and the small bathroom and found nothing. Not a toothbrush, comb, bag, article of clothing, or anything else.</p><p>Then a slight elevation of the mattress on the right side of the bed caught Darien\u2019s eye. He strode over to the bed and yanked up the coverlet. The mattress rode high in one small spot. Shoving his hand between the mattress and box spring, he felt the grip of a pistol. His heart pounded harder. Pulling the 9mm out, he checked the safety, then removed the bullets and studied them.</p><p>\u201cSilver,\u201d Uncle Sheridan growled as he examined them more closely. \u201cThat\u2019s grounds for throwing her in jail. Possessing a firearm with intent to kill a lupus garou. Hell, Darien, she\u2019s a loose cannon.\u201d</p><p>Darien tucked the gun in his belt and shoved the bullets in his pocket. \u201cShe\u2019s not a threat any longer.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan groused under his breath some more.</p><p>After moving the dresser out of the door\u2019s path, they returned to the lobby to see Mrs. Hastings, her face ashen. She scooted a mop around on the wood floor, soaking up the water she\u2019d spilled when he and his uncle nearly ran her over.</p><p>Darien handed her the key. \u201cSomeone was in the room and had blocked the door. We had to break the window. Just charge it to my account.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hastings took the key and moved around the counter. \u201cThe poor little thing really isn\u2019t safe.\u201d She glanced at the gun tucked in Darien\u2019s belt, and her eyes widened. \u201cShe was packing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there anything else you can recall about her?\u201d he asked, not wanting to get into it with his uncle over the gun again.</p><p>Mrs. Hastings pointed to the stairs winding up to a loft. \u201cYou might check up there. One of my teenaged guests told me a woman was reading a letter and crying.</p><p>When I investigated, it was Lelandi\u2019s sister. She must have wiped away her tears, and I didn\u2019t see any letter.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan hurried up the stairs to the loft.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything else? Nothing was in her room to indicate she\u2019d ever been there,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cEmma cleaned up the rooms after the guests left for the day. She didn\u2019t mention anything.\u201d Mrs. Hastings looked at the gun again.</p><p>Uncle Sheridan stomped down the stairs and rejoined them. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>As Darien suspected. The woman was as much a mystery as her sister. \u201cCome on, Uncle Sheridan. Let\u2019s talk to the little lady again.\u201d</p><p>Tension filling every pore, Darien hovered over Larissa\u2019s hospital bed while Uncle Sheridan stood nearby, his arms folded. Sorely vexed with Trevor, Uncle Sheridan still couldn\u2019t locate him.</p><p>With her face cloaked in sleep, Larissa looked like a sweet, innocent angel. Yet in that petite body, the heart of a warrior beat.</p><p>When she groggily opened her eyes, Darien tried to keep a grip on his temper, but his voice verged on a low, menacing growl. \u201cWhere... is... the... damned... letter?\u201d</p><p>His shock of white hair ruffled, Doc walked into Lelandi\u2019s hospital room. \u201cI ordered bed rest, not constant interrogation of the young lady.\u201d</p><p>Darien gave him a disgruntled look. As much as he hated to admit it, he knew the doctor was right\u2014but when it came to sorting out this situation with Lelandi and her sister, he needed answers and now! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Lelandi had possessed the strength to smile, she would have. The white-haired man looked like a taller, older version of her cherished uncle. Too bad he\u2019d left the pack when she was little and become a rogue, too much of an alpha to put up with the leader, but not strong enough to take over. Yet, Doc looked like he could stand his ground, and had a compassionate side that made him lovable like her uncle.</p><p>His eyes were the same color\u2014dark amber. He had a manly chin and large hands. The same cheerful expression. Except when he confronted Darien. The doctor stared him down. Who would win the confrontation this time?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss, but if you want to be the doctor, too, have at it. Otherwise, let the woman rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need some answers,\u201d Darien growled.</p><p>\u201cGet them in the morning.\u201d Doc stood firm, his hands on his hips.</p><p>Darien motioned for Silva to leave.</p><p>Silva cast him an annoyed look, walked over to the bed, and patted Lelandi\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning, sugar. Don\u2019t let the big bad wolves scare ya none.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi tried to manage a smile, but her body seemed beyond her control.</p> <p>\u201cTalk to you tomorrow, Uncle Sheridan,\u201d Darien said, dismissing him, too.</p><p>\u201cGet with you if I have any late-breaking news.\u201d The sheriff inclined his head and gave the doctor a peeved look, then headed out of the room.</p><p>Darien took the seat where Silva had been sitting.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s sleeping soundly. Finally got Sam to shut up. Think from the way he talks he\u2019d been fighting World War III single-handedly. But she\u2019s been injured the worst of the bunch and needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>Darien glowered at her. \u201cI hear you, Doc. But I have to know what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi was sure she smiled that time, and Darien caught the look. She couldn\u2019t help it. Who\u2019d ever think a gray could make the leader back down?</p> <p>Darien crossed his arms and this time he gave her an evil smile back.</p><p>The doctor took a deep breath. \u201cPeter\u2019s got guard duty. Trevor will follow him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Close the door on your way out, will you?\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded and retired from the room.</p><p>Darien glared at Lelandi, his brown eyes filled with fury.</p><p>She closed her eyes, unable to keep them open any longer. They burned, along with her skin, and the fever created an earth-shattering pounding in her head, like the time she went to a human rock concert\u2014too much noise for a lupus garou\u2019s sensitive hearing.</p><p>An hour later, she woke to rustling. Darien was searching through her purse. Lipstick, hairbrush, wallet loaded with cash, no credit cards, no driver\u2019s license, no name. She could have told him that.</p><p>He caught her eye, dumped her purse on the table and frowned, but he didn\u2019t question her. Man of his word. Good trait for a pack leader.</p> <p>She must have drifted off to sleep again, because his low voice woke her when he spoke to the deputy in the hall. The smell of strong coffee reached her, then everything faded.</p><p>Until someone screamed, something crashed on the floor, and a slew of curses followed.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes popped open. Holy crap! Shapeshifting in her delirious state, the IV jerked out and dangling over the floor, the blasted hospital gown in between her front legs, Lelandi lay on her side in her wolf form. She hoped whoever cleaned bedsheets were lupus garous, because if not, humans would wonder why a patient shed red fur.</p><p>Darien and Trevor rushed into the room, instantly looked at the mess Ritka made on the floor, and then at Lelandi, drowsy red wolf extraordinaire.</p><p>\u201cOdin\u2019s wounds, she\u2019s a royal,\u201d Darien said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cHell, Darien, if the word gets out, she\u2019ll have a whole mess of suitors. But if she\u2019s going to shapeshift without warning, she should be at the vet\u2019s,\u201d Trevor said.</p><p>Silva poked her head in.</p><p>\u201cGet in and shut the door,\u201d Darien barked.</p><p>She scurried in, closed the door, and smiled at Lelandi. \u201cMy, my. She\u2019s a royal. Knocked that dye job right out. Told you so, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShapeshift back,\u201d Darien commanded Lelandi.</p><p>Right. Just as soon as she had the strength. She yawned, stretched her legs, closed her eyes, and fell back to sleep.</p><p>When she managed to open her eyes again, she was in her human form, dressed in the hideous hospital gown, an IV stuck in her arm. Darien was sitting in the chair, his eyes glued to her as if he was waiting for the dawn to break, or maybe to ensure she didn\u2019t shapeshift back.</p><p>He\u2019d grill her about the letter again, although she wondered why he hadn\u2019t found it concealed in her jacket yet. Unless she\u2019d lost it. A deep-seated sadness slipped through her.</p><p>She shut the sight of Darien out and slept, but the squeaking of the door woke her when Nurse Grey entered the room to check her vital signs. The woman held her finger to her smiling lips and pointed to Darien, dead to the world, sitting upright in the chair. The nurse left her alone again, and Lelandi watched the gray. Proud, angry, his stern face almost saintly. In a heartbeat, she wanted to know what being his mate would be like, to feel his impassioned kiss against her mouth again, and so much more. Her heart sank when she realized how futile that notion was.</p><p>In sleep, the woman of Darien\u2019s dreams stood naked in a birch grove, watching him, her green eyes reflecting sadness, her hair stirred by the autumn breeze, dangling past her creamy hips.</p><p>Lelandi, his redheaded goddess.</p><p>He stalked toward her, her face lighting with desire.She twirled a red curl around her finger, tantalizing him all the more, although even without any encouragement, he was ready to take his fill of her.</p><p>Lelandi, he wanted to call out. But he had no control over the speaking part of the dream. He couldn\u2019t hear the birds in the trees or the breeze whistling through the leaves. He couldn\u2019t smell the pine needles or spruce or whether they were due for a shower, although the thunderous clouds building in the night sky indicated they would get a burst of rain soon. All he could do was feast his eyes on the vision before him, touch her, feel her soft as silk skin beneath his, the texture of her satiny hair, her heart beating beneath his... but he couldn\u2019t hear it, as if more than half his wolf senses had lost touch with reality.</p><p>She melted in his arms, her head resting against his chest, her arms clinging to him as if she never wanted to let go. He sensed she needed more, too, as if the dream was the most fragile connection, the tentative bond they shared never enough. How could he still find her here in his fantasy world, when in the real one she was gone? Forever, gone. He stroked her hair, kissed her head, wished he could smell the sweet fragrance cloaking her, smell her aroused state. Her nipples rubbed against his chest, kissable, tight, rose-colored nubs.</p><p>Lelandi, he mouthed against her cheek. Her gaze turned up, focusing on him. Her eyes had grown so big and green\u2014greener than... than Lelandi\u2019s eyes? He combed his fingers through her hair, the strands shimmering in the moonlight. Redder than Lelandi\u2019s?</p><p>No... no, she was Lelandi. She responded to the name. She was the one he\u2019d mated, the one he loved. He\u2019d prove it to her once again, even if she was no more than his fantasy lover. He bent down and kissed her mouth, gently at first\u2014but it wasn\u2019t enough. Touching her like this was never enough. He wanted to bury himself deep inside her, wanted to claim her, wanted to be part of her forever.</p><p>His tongue swept across her lips, and she parted them, inviting him in. He took advantage, deepened thekiss, pressed his mouth harder against her soft, velvet lips, tangoed his tongue with hers. His hands held her shoulders as he felt her falling away, so caught up in the kiss. His mouth smiled against hers, loving how she melted under his simple kisses. Thumbs caressing her shoulders, he let himself go, every molecule absorbing the feel of her, the heat coursing through his veins, the sweet softness of her calling to him.</p><p>Lelandi. But how could she be this real and no longer part of his life?</p><p>She moaned, encouraging him, her body slipping down to the sweet bed of grass beneath their feet. He took control, her eyes and mouth willing him to continue.God, she was so beautiful.</p><p>Pressing her legs apart, he quickly entered her before his fantasy lover vanished. Her fingers swept over his backside, pressuring him to delve deeper. His mouth tackled hers again, and he weighed her breasts, lifting, caressing the hardened nipples, loving the way she responded so promptly to his touch.</p><p>\u201cHow could I have lost you...,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cWhen all I ever wanted was to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>It was him, really him. Lelandi loved the way he made her feel\u2014loved, special, his. She opened her lips to speak, but when she couldn\u2019t say anything, he tongued her mouth again, his erection spearing her deeper and deeper. She arched her pelvis, wanting to reach the moon and back.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she see his face clearly? As if the dark side of the moon cloaked it in blackness. Why couldn\u2019t she hear his name when he knew hers so well? As if he controlled the dream\u2014the alpha male in charge. Why couldn\u2019t she have him in the real world when the night faded and the day renewed?</p><p>\u201cAhh,\u201d she moaned, her body shuddering with climax as he filled her with his seed, and she wanted it to be real. She wanted to find him and be with him forever, not just for fleeting moments in her dream world.</p><p>Then a horrible pain radiated through her chest, and she tried to ignore it, tried to concentrate on her lover\u2019s lips, the only part of his face she could see. They were parted, grim, as if he recognized the pain she felt.</p><p>Lelandi, his lips mouthed.</p><p>She tried closing her eyes and pretending the pain wasn\u2019t shrieking across every nerve ending, her head ready to explode.</p><p>Lelandi, he said again, more vehemently, and his hard body began to fade away.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t lose him. Not now when she needed his comforting touch. But he was fading... fading...</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>DARIEN HOVERED OVER LELANDI, REACHING FOR THE NURSE\u2019S call button, his other hand on hers.

How could her sweet body torment him in his dreams still? Even now as he checked on Jake waiting to speak to him about the silver mine in the hall outside Larissa\u2019s room, he felt distracted, ill at ease, like a part of his soul had been ripped away. She had been a drug he couldn\u2019t get his fill of, and though six eligible females existed in his pack, only one would do\u2014the petite woman of his dreams\u2014and now she was dead.</p><p>Lelandi.</p><p>Jake studied him, then frowned. \u201cAnother bad night?\u201d</p><p>Darien gave him a look like he\u2019d better not go there.</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll get on with the business at the silver mine.\u201d He muttered under his breath as he stalked off, \u201cBetter there than here.

Even when he\u2019d been with Lelandi, the dreams had continued.

But if Darien could find Lelandi in the woods, even if it was only in his dreams... he\u2019d forgo sleep for an eternity.</p><p>The next morning, Lelandi sat up in bed, her head partially cleared, no restraints, although the medication still dulled her senses. Otherwise, she would have sensed the brooding man sitting in the room. Jake\u2019s eyes opened wider when it registered she was awake. Darien must have given up and gone home.</p><p>Jake stroked his whiskered chin for a minute. Finally he spoke, his voice condemning. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you. He sees you as her.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody had to tell her Darien saw her as Larissa. Swallowing hard, Lelandi hoped at least her vocal cords had returned to normal after the snake had strangled them. She still didn\u2019t feel she had any energy, but at least she felt no pain. Her throat dry, she noticed her water cup was empty. The water pitcher was too far away to reach, but she wasn\u2019t asking grumpy to get it for her. The other solution was to hit the nurse call button. If Ritka was manning the desk, she might dump the water on Lelandi, or ignore her completely. Besides, Lelandi was used to fending for herself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already been through the wringer enough over your sister without having to go through the same thing with you. Damn it, woman, he needs to heal.\u201d</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t? Jake was talking about her sister! She\u2019d loved her just as much as Darien had. Why else did they think she was here? To avenge her sister\u2019s death, damn it!</p><p>Lelandi twisted her mouth, her throat feeling drier by the second, probably because of the medication she was taking. Indecision caught hold. Should she try to go back to sleep, or get the water herself?</p><p>\u201cHe should have mated Trevor\u2019s sister. Hell, none of this would have happened if he had.\u201d</p><p>She ground her teeth. Trevor\u2019s sister? No wonder the guy didn\u2019t like her. But she would not give in to Jake\u2019s challenging her. Jake knew she wanted some water, but he made it clear he wasn\u2019t about to help her. Fine, she didn\u2019t need a gray\u2019s help anyway.</p><p>\u201cI told him to leave her alone. That she wasn\u2019t right for him. He doesn\u2019t need you messing with his head, too.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi glowered at Jake. She had no intention of \u201cmessing\u201d with Darien\u2019s head. Leaning over, she reached for the water pitcher. A cold draft sent shivers down her back where her gown opened up. Her head filled with fog, and she paused, nausea filling her belly, dizziness washing over her. Slow. Take it nice and slow.</p><p>The chair scooted back across the industrial-strength carpeting covering the floor and footsteps hurried in the direction of the hall.</p><p>She closed her eyes to shut out the dizziness when Jake said, \u201cGet Ritka. The woman passed out.\u201d</p><p>What woman?</p><p>Lelandi opened her eyes, her thoughts still fuzzy. She had to get off this blasted medicine that made her feel so out of control.</p><p>Jake stalked back into the room. \u201cLie still. Go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, she tried for the water again. As soon as she leaned over the bed railing, her stomach and head started dog paddling, and she felt herself quickly going under.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, woman.\u201d Jake laid his hand on her shoulder and pushed her back, his touch gentle, his stern face anxious.</p><p>Nurse Grey stalked into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs those restraints back on.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi glowered at him. \u201cWater.\u201d She limply lifted her hand and pointed to the container.</p><p>\u201cShe passed out twice and was about to do the same again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to get the water herself?\u201d Nurse Grey asked, her tone annoyed while she took Lelandi\u2019s temperature.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cShe didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t going to offer. Take a seat, and roll up your sleeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, tough guy. The little lady needs more of your blood. That\u2019s why she\u2019s passing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I already gave her a river\u2019s worth.\u201d</p><p>The nurse tsked. \u201cA big alpha male like you can give a little more.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi wished she were feeling more with it, able to respond, as she dearly would love to laugh out loud at the look on Jake\u2019s face. More than disgruntled. Every bit of blood she\u2019d get from him was spitting fire.</p><p>Good. Maybe it would give her some energy.</p><p>After getting some sleep and feeling somewhat better, Darien walked into Larissa\u2019s room, saw his brother giving her blood again, and came to a dead stop. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jake scowled at him. \u201cYou could have given her blood when you were here last. This is the second go around for me.\u201d</p><p>Larissa\u2019s face was still ghostly pale. \u201cFeeling any better?\u201d He sure as hell hoped so or he\u2019d never get the truth out of her.</p><p>She nodded, but she seemed to be nearly as out of it as the night before. He guessed he shouldn\u2019t have insisted she got more pain medicine when she\u2019d objected so strenuously. Still, hearing her groaning in the middle of the night...</p><p>\u201cI gave her some more pain medication about an hour ago. It seems to be kicking in,\u201d Nurse Grey warned.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d he asked Larissa in the most sweet-mannered way he could manage.</p><p>Jake raised a brow.</p><p>Larissa headed off Darien\u2019s question. \u201cRoom broken into.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was clearer, not as raspy, but she sounded weary. \u201cSo Uncle Sheridan came by already and talked to you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour ago,\u201d Jake said as Nurse Grey released him.</p><p>Now he looked a little peaked.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jake. You can lie down in room five until you feel more yourself.\u201d Nurse Grey helped him up.</p><p>\u201cGood thing we can manufacture blood more quickly than humans.\u201d Jake gave Darien another dirty look. \u201cNext time, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong blood type.\u201d The nurse held Jake\u2019s arm as they walked out of the room.</p><p>\u201cGood excuse,\u201d Jake said. \u201cHey, we\u2019re triplets. He\u2019s got the same blood...\u201d His voice trailed off down the hall.</p><p>Darien pulled the chair closer to the bed. \u201cThe guy who broke into your place must have stolen your bag.</p><p>Did Uncle Sheridan tell you that?\u201d</p><p>She took slow, shallow breaths. \u201cGun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found your gun. What had you planned to do? Shoot someone you thought killed your sister? You can\u2019t take matters into your own hands, damn it.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the ceiling for a minute as if trying to remember what had happened. Her eyes drifted to the bed, then she closed them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your family\u2019s name? Where are your parents?\u201d</p><p>She stared straight through him. \u201cLelandi. Parents...\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cKilled, accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear it.\u201d But he hadn\u2019t even known his mate had a family, and he still wasn\u2019t sure Larissa had been telling the truth so he was having a tough time feeling any sympathy. \u201cWhat did the letter say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLupus blackmailing her.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s heart nearly stopped. \u201cWhat, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>She studied the blanket, her fingers twisting the thin fabric.</p><p>\u201cYours or mine?\u201d</p><p>Larissa looked up at him, her eyes revealing confusion.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it was one of my grays or one of your reds?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, which made him suspicious.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone blackmail her?\u201d Darien considered Lelandi\u2019s nightmares, her reluctance to discuss her past with him. It fit. When he opened his mouth to question Larissa, she had shut her eyes again. \u201cLarissa?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t respond and appeared to be sleeping. He growled under his breath, swore he would not tell anyone to give her any more pain medication if she needed it, and took his seat again.</p><p>Two painfully long hours later, Larissa opened her eyes, and immediately Darien launched in with his questioning, determined to get the truth out of her this time. \u201cWhat about the man who accosted you outside of Hastings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGunman?\u201d</p> <p>Being evasive on purpose? Or confused again? \u201cNo, the hooded man in the copper coat.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, her already pale face turned whiter.</p><p>\u201cLarissa?\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his fists. \u201cIf he\u2019s from your pack and he followed you here, angered you\u2019d be investigating this, it might be something.\u201d</p> <p>Closing her eyes, she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cFine, when we catch the bastard, we\u2019ll find out all we want to know.\u201d He paused, waiting for her to give in. When she didn\u2019t, he started in on her again. \u201cHe broke into your room, got physical with you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t think he broke into my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cGot physical with you then.\u201d Darien barely curbed his rage. Why did she protect the bastard?</p> <p>\u201cLittle angry.\u201d</p><p>Darien paced across the floor. \u201cHe was a little angry? I\u2019m a little angry. Who the hell is he? And where is that damned letter? In your bag? Did you even have a bag?\u201d</p><p>Deputy Peter knocked on the door and poked his face in. \u201cA deputy sheriff\u2019s here who picked up a red lupus garou matching the little lady\u2019s description, hitchhiking. He\u2019s from Green Valley. Want to talk to him?\u201d Peter\u2019s expression said there was lots more, but he didn\u2019t want to say in front of the patient.</p><p>Darien cast Larissa a smug smile. \u201cYeah, I sure do.\u201d</p><p>Silva sneaked a peek in the room, waving a bag from Chipper\u2019s Donuts like a white flag, the aroma of glazed icing, chocolate, and pastries filling the air. Silva smiled at Lelandi. \u201cI brought some chocolate iced donuts. Sounds like we need some cheering-up food in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her who the guy was who accosted her behind Hastings before she came chasing after me at the tavern.\u201d He smiled at Larissa when her face reddened, then stalked toward the door. \u201cWhere\u2019s this witness at, Peter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s office. He said you could question him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now maybe we\u2019ll get some answers.\u201d Darien left the room and headed down the hall.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, sugar, you sure have him wrapped around your little finger. I\u2019ve never seen him so out of control when he\u2019s around you. I\u2019d say he can\u2019t decide whether to strangle you or kiss you.\u201d Silva set a donut on Lelandi\u2019s tray. \u201cCoffee?\u201d</p><p>Definitely he wanted to strangle her. And the feeling was mutual. \u201cMilk?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>\u201cSure, darlin.\u2019 Be right back.\u201d Silva walked outside the room. \u201cWant some donuts, Trevor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she done to rile Darien this time?\u201d Trevor grumbled.</p><p>Jeez, couldn\u2019t the guy ever say something nice to Silva?</p><p>\u201cYou know him when he hasn\u2019t had enough sleep.</p><p>He\u2019s always a bear.\u201d</p><p>When wasn\u2019t he a bear?</p><p>Silva waved at Lelandi. \u201cOff to get your milk.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi took a deep breath and allowed herself a self-satisfied smile. Darien could question the deputy sheriff from Green Valley all he wanted, but she didn\u2019t tell him a thing about herself that he could trace back to the pack.</p><p>She lifted her donut off the tray when Ritka walked in, her bruised and swollen eye back to normal\u2014too bad.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be eating the breakfast Doc ordered for you.\u201d She jerked the donut out of Lelandi\u2019s hand and dumped it in the trash.</p><p>Stunned into inaction, Lelandi\u2019s mouth gaped, and she stared at the wastepaper basket.</p><p>Ritka took her temperature. \u201cNinety-nine, point nine. Heard you had a break-in at your room last night. No suitcase. Just a gun\u2014with silver bullets. But the most interesting news? That deputy sheriff who picked you up and gave you a ride here? He took your picture on his cell phone and scanned it through his database. Seems one pissed-off pack leader is looking for you and has offered a reward for your immediate return. A big reward.\u201d Ritka sneered at her. \u201cGuess you won\u2019t be staying here long.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s heart skipped several beats. If that bastard Crassus got hold of her, she\u2019d have to kill him because he wasn\u2019t beating on her again. Ever.</p><p>Ritka got into her face. \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d She straightened and plastered a faux sympathetic expression on her face. \u201cYou look a little pale. Don\u2019t want to go back? Too bad. Now you can\u2019t have Darien, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Silva walked into the room with a glass of milk, her face scowling. \u201cFinished with nursing business, Ritka?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a visitor, so stuff it. I can have your butt kicked out of here just like that.\u201d Ritka snapped her fingers.</p><p>\u201cLarissa, you okay, honey? You don\u2019t look too well.\u201dSilva hurried over to the bed.</p><p>Tears rolled down Lelandi\u2019s cheeks. She couldn\u2019t help it. Probably was the pain medication. Maybe it was the fact she didn\u2019t have the strength to fight or flee. This was so not like her!</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to upset Larissa?\u201d Silva accused Ritka, her voice angry.</p><p>\u201cLelandi,\u201d she sobbed. At least they could get her name right!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a dumb barmaid who reads literary books to try to make yourself feel smarter. Probably don\u2019t understand most of what you read. But you\u2019re a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lelandi yanked the IV out of her arm and gritted her teeth against the pain. The medication had to go. It was making her say things she was sure she shouldn\u2019t. It was making her lethargic, dopey, and now weepy. It was keeping her in bed when she had to run. But most of all she wanted her damned chocolate donut back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Ritka screamed, grabbing Lelandi\u2019s arm.</p><p>Pain stabbed through Lelandi\u2019s arm and chest. She swung her free arm and poked her fist into Ritka\u2019s other eye, then everything faded to black.</p><p>Darien walked into Doc\u2019s office and found Deputy Sheriff Smith, a tall, lean, uniformed man, sitting on the leather love seat, reshaping the brim of his Stetson. He quickly rose and crossed the floor to shake Darien\u2019s hand.</p><p>He motioned for the deputy to take a seat, although Darien remained standing. \u201cTell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>Smith explained how he\u2019d run a trace on her, worried she might be in trouble. Being that she was a pretty red loner lupus garou, he was afraid someone might grab her. \u201cBefore I knew it, here comes this frantic request for any information on the missing girl. The pack leader said his name was Leidolf.\u201d</p><p>Darien should have been pleased to hear that Leidolf was her pack leader and wanted her returned at once. So why the hell did Darien want to dismiss it as a case of mistaken identity?</p><p>\u201cDid Deputy Peter Jorgenson tell you anything about what\u2019s going on here with Larissa?\u201d</p><p>Smith bowed his head once. \u201cI understand one of her own people, or one of yours, might have shot the woman. The assistant mayor of Green Valley, Chester McKinley, was here at the time of the shootings and being that he is also a licensed P.I. and concerned for the lady\u2019s welfare, he asked I keep this just between you and me. By the way, the name the leader gave for her was Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s stomach clenched into knots, and he looked at the floor as the feelings of desolation swamped him again. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not. But I didn\u2019t find a similar request for a girl who looked identical to her. Probably misplaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortland, Oregon.\u201d</p><p>In astonishment, Darien raised his brows. Why in the world had the two women come all the way to Colorado?</p><p>\u201cSurprised me, too. I got the impression she was a local girl. I was trying to find out where she was from and started mentioning some of the wildflowers native to Colorado. She offered me the names of others she\u2019d seen. I asked if she was from down South, but she said, \u2018No, Denver.\u2019 So when I got the notice some guy in Oregon is claiming she\u2019s missing from his pack, I was pretty darned surprised. What do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit on it. I need to find out what\u2019s going on before she goes home.\u201d Darien couldn\u2019t believe he said it. But something didn\u2019t ring true about this Leidolf character. And Darien wasn\u2019t letting her out of his sight until he found the shooter. \u201cIf you hear anything more, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure will.\u201d The deputy gave him a sly smile. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her go either, if I were in your shoes.\u201d</p><p>Darien let the comment slide, figuring the deputy didn\u2019t know the situation well enough to understand. As soon as Smith left, Darien called Peter in. \u201cI know how difficult it is to locate packs or anything about them as secretive as we need to be, but I\u2019ve got a lead. See if you can find a Leidolf out of Portland, Oregon. I want to know everything about him and his pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir, will do.\u201d</p><p>Intent on learning what Doc needed to speak to him about, Darien headed to the lounge where three of his cousins were talking to the doctor. As soon as his cousins spied him, everyone stopped speaking.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I walk into a room it gets awfully damned quiet. Someone planning a hostile takeover?\u201d Darien only half-joked. If enough of his members got fed up with his leadership, one of the bolder males might just feel the need to end his role.</p><p>Before anyone could respond, a petite blonde wearing a black business skirt and jacket leaned over the check-in counter and raised her voice. \u201cListen, Angelina, I\u2019ve given you my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and I just want to talk to the doctor about a job.\u201d</p><p>Angelina gave a snort. \u201cDoc\u2019s not the one you have to convince. Darien Silver\u2019s the most important one on the hospital board, and he\u2019s calling the shots.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now what? Darien sure as hell didn\u2019t need to deal with this right now.</p><p>\u201cCome into my office, Darien. You might want to sit down when I tell you the latest,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d The blonde ran after Darien and Doc and stopped in front of them.</p> <p>Holding out her hand, she gave them a broad smile. Totally faked. Human, pretty, with the biggest and clearest blue eyes Darien had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cHi. You might not know me, but Doctor Oliver set my broken leg when I was ten after a whitewater rafting accident and after that, I always wanted to be a nurse. I earned a nursing degree in Denver, and here I am.\u201d</p><p>Hoping to nip this in the bud from the outset, Darien didn\u2019t shake her hand. She quickly dropped hers to her side, her smile fading. \u201cI\u2019m not new at this. I trained well before I returned home.\u201d Her voice had taken on a tinge of annoyance. \u201cMy parents still live here. Dad\u2019s a carpenter. Mom has a home business and sells pottery crafts. I\u2019ve never wanted to work anywhere else, but the lady at the front desk won\u2019t give my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the doctor.\u201d The blonde shoved her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at Darien. \u201cI\u2019m Carol Wood, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t take the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cCheck with the school. They can use a nurse. Just tell them I sent you.\u201d</p><p>The perky woman\u2019s face fell to the floor. \u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe staff\u2019s full here. We don\u2019t need anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s been a lot of trouble. Gunshot victims. More people moving in.</p><p>You\u2019ll need more staff. At least, try me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApply at the school. If someone quits here...\u201d Darien shrugged. \u201cYou might get lucky.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Doc, but he confirmed Darien\u2019s decision. \u201cMr. Silver is right. We don\u2019t need any more nurses for the time being.\u201d He motioned for Darien to follow him.</p><p>\u201cSee the school principal, Miss Wood.\u201d Darien headed with the doctor down the hall.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s blood pulsed at a quickened pace, and she wasn\u2019t happy with his decision. He highly suspected that wasn\u2019t the last he\u2019d hear of it either.</p><p>Doc led Darien into his office and shut the door.</p><p>The lingering aroma of chocolate donuts filled the air and a paper plate with remnants of chocolate glaze sat in the middle of his otherwise neat oak desk, everything in its place as usual, the heavyweight brass caduceus sitting on a stack of medical notes he\u2019d transcribe later.</p><p>\u201cCarol Wood sent me letters before she finished nursing school. I didn\u2019t mention it to you before because so many of the students drop out before they finish their programs. She\u2019s persistent, if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have a human working in the hospital. Not when our people heal so fast.\u201d</p><p>Doc sat down at his desk. \u201cWhat about assigning her to human cases only?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much of a nightmare to keep up with. What if she checked on a lupus garou patient like Larissa because the rest of the staff was busy? Can you imagine what she\u2019d think if she saw the injuries, then Larissa leaves the hospital so soon after? If Larissa had been human, she would have died from the massive injuries she\u2019d sustained.\u201d Darien shook his head and looked out the window at the majestic mountains. \u201cHaving one of their kind on the hospital staff isn\u2019t feasible.\u201d He took a deep breath and switched topics. \u201cWhat did you want to talk to me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of her injuries, I ran tests to see if she was pregnant. She wasn\u2019t. Then I examined her to see if she was a virgin.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing damn well why he was checking, Darien scowled at him. He wasn\u2019t mating with the red.</p><p>\u201cShe is a virgin. Which means she doesn\u2019t have a mate.\u201d</p><p>Although he fought feeling anything about the situation one way or another, Darien felt relieved. He told himself it was because he didn\u2019t want to have to deal with her irate mate if he came looking for her.</p><p>Doc leaned back in his leather chair. \u201cThe other news is someone tried to strangle Larissa after she\u2019d been shot.\u201d</p><p>Darien felt he\u2019d been kick-dropped off a cliff. \u201cWhy the hell didn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs rest more than anything\u2014not a lot of questioning. I\u2019ve already asked her if she saw who did it. But she was probably unconscious or nearly so and didn\u2019t remember anything. She said a snake strangled her, then slithered away when she heard voices. Yours and Jake\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA snake? We don\u2019t have anacondas or boa constrictors here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer barely conscious imagination. He left bruises on her throat. Since she was wearing a turtleneck, you wouldn\u2019t have seen the marks. She was so battered from her fall, you might not have noticed now that she\u2019s wearing a hospital gown. Either he thought he had finished her or he heard you and Jake approaching and vanished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Doc, I need the area we found her in combed for evidence. I thought only Jake and I had been there with her. If we can find other footprints, size of shoe, scent, anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked your uncle to investigate, but not to tell you until I had a chance to discuss this with you.\u201d</p><p>Darien would not have this insubordination! No one withheld information from him that was this important! He opened his mouth to say so when Ritka shrieked from the direction of Larissa\u2019s hospital room.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>SILVA AND RITKA FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER NEXT TO Lelandi\u2019s bed, as she tried to ignore the yelling. Jake leaned against the doorframe, shaking his head.</p><p>Until Darien and the doctor stalked into the room and Darien shouted, \u201cEnough! What the hell happened?\u201d He appeared somewhat rattled, his face slightly drained of color, and he studied Lelandi a little too closely. Her neck actually.</p><p>She took a deep, settling breath. Good, peace and quiet now that the boss man has arrived.</p><p>\u201cShe hit me!\u201d Ritka screamed.</p><p>Yeah, and if they hadn\u2019t restrained me, I\u2019d do it again!</p><p>\u201cWe can see,\u201d Darien said calmly. \u201cI want to know why.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi fought to find the words, but the IV was hooked up to her arm again, and she figured heavier duty drugs were pouring into her veins because she could barely concentrate on what was being said, let alone keep her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cShe ripped out the IV and when I tried to stop her, the bitch hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou grabbed her sore arm and yanked her back so hard, pain filled her face. That\u2019s why she hit you,\u201d Silva scolded. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of a good bedside manner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Lelandi said, slurring her word.</p><p>Without taking his eyes off Lelandi, Darien said to Ritka, \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>Ritka shrugged. \u201cNothing of consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bet.\u201d Darien glowered at her like she was next on the head-chopping block. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she any better, Doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow-grade fever. She needs to stay until tonight at least. I\u2019ll see then how she\u2019s doing.\u201d The doctor motioned for Ritka to leave.</p><p>She glared at Lelandi, then stomped out of the room.</p><p>\u201cDid Larissa say anything to you, Jake?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalked... \u2018bout... you... an\u2019... me.\u201d Lelandi tried to scowl at Jake.</p><p>Darien shifted his attention to his brother, whose ears immediately tinged crimson. \u201cYou and I\u2019ll speak later. Did she say anything to you, Silva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And whatever Ritka said to her happened before I arrived. She looks pretty glassy-eyed, Darien. Don\u2019t think she\u2019s really with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say to you?\u201d Darien reached his hand out to touch Lelandi\u2019s, but then he seemed to think better of it and shoved his hands in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cAbout... green... dep\u2019ty.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cShe told you about the deputy sheriff from Green Valley?\u201d</p><p>She managed a slow nod.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He looked back at her neck and shook his head. \u201cA snake, huh?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi closed her eyes and hoped she\u2019d be able to keep her mouth shut until they took her off the pain medication. Otherwise, she\u2019d have to make up wild stories to mix in with whatever else she said.</p><p>Then she remembered her damned donut and lifted her finger at the wastepaper basket. \u201cDonut,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>After she fell asleep, Darien motioned to Jake to come with him. \u201cI want to know what the hell you said to Larissa.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s a wildcat. Where Lelandi was too much of an angel, this one has the devil in her.\u201d</p><p>They walked into Doc\u2019s empty office to talk.</p><p>Jake shut the door. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think she should go to our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the safest place for her for the time being. But that\u2019s not what I want to talk about. What did you say to her?\u201d</p><p>Looking defiant, Jake shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cI told her you\u2019ve already been through hell with her sister. You don\u2019t need to have to deal with her, too. As for taking her to the house, you know how the rumors will fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in having her for a mate, but it\u2019s my business, not yours. I\u2019ll deal with her as I see fit. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jake said grudgingly. \u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with this deputy sheriff from Green Valley and snakes?\u201d</p><p>Darien explained everything, and how their uncle was investigating the crime scene where they\u2019d found Larissa. \u201cDid you see or smell anything when we were with her?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cI was concentrating on alerting the rest of our pack that we\u2019d found the lady, and then we learned Sam had been shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the guy who strangled her be the same one who shot the gunman? Distance-wise, do you think he could have made it up there in time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know when he left her.\u201d</p><p>Darien frowned in thought. \u201cProbably when we were drawing close. He heard our voices.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen there must be two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Darien ran his hands through his hair. \u201cNow that I recall, I distinctively smelled the odor of decomposing leaves, but no smell of any lupus garou in human form, just that god-awful perfume Larissa was wearing. Do you think the perpetrator was wearing human\u2019s hunter spray to disguise his scent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Uncle Sheridan check out the location and see if rotting leaves were in the vicinity. Now that you mention it, I smelled it also. But remember the red I got a whiff of?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was in wolf form and couldn\u2019t have strangled her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. What about this Leidolf? Are you sure we shouldn\u2019t contact him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know who he is really. Peter is looking into it. What I want to know is did she have a bag and if so, was it stolen?\u201d</p><p>Jake stared out the window at the mountain view where clouds perched on top in a mist, coating the peaks like whipped topping. \u201cTrevor questioned Mrs. Hastings who said her grandkids were visiting when Larissa checked in, so she was distracted and didn\u2019t see if Larissa had a bag or not. She paid in cash and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat name did she register under?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMelanie Weber.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, Darien thought about the name. \u201cThe name sounds familiar.\u201d He rubbed his chin as he thought back to her earlier comments. \u201cShe kept asking to see a Doctor Weber. He\u2019s got to be real.\u201d Darien glanced at Doc\u2019s medical degrees and other certificates displayed across the wall, updated periodically over the decades to make it appear Doc wasn\u2019t as old as he was. \u201cI want you to find anybody by that name in the state who\u2019s a practicing physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Leidolf says she\u2019s from Portland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Smith said he was sure she was from Colorado. Another thing, Larissa said she received a letter from Lelandi before she died. It wasn\u2019t in her purse. If it was in her bag, it\u2019s gone. Apparently, a lupus was blackmailing Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>Jake swore under his breath. \u201cOne of ours?\u201d</p><p>If it led to her death, whoever had been blackmailing Darien\u2019s mate was a dead lupus garou. \u201cThe letter didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLarissa told you this when she was out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed pretty lucid, but she might not have been. Hell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else could the letter be?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she burned it in the fireplace, or hid it somewhere else at the B&amp;B. Mrs. Hastings mentioned Larissa was holding a letter in her lap in the loft and a teenaged guest said Larissa had been crying. It must have been the letter.\u201d</p><p>The answer struck them at once. \u201cHer clothes,\u201d they said simultaneously.</p><p>They hastened back to her room where Larissa was still sound asleep, and Darien jerked open the metal locker. Empty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out what happened to them,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Apparently eavesdropping from the hallway, Silva walked into the room. \u201cI took them home to wash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilva,\u201d Darien said, annoyed.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSorry, bad habit of mine. Used to overhearing conversations in the bar. Guess because my life is dull at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were bloody so I took them home to wash. Cleaned her jeans. With the bullet holes in it, the shirt was a total loss. She\u2019ll need a new peach lace bra to match her panties, if anyone\u2019s interested.\u201d Silva paused for effect.</p><p>Darien could have wrung her neck, although she got the result she wanted. The image of Larissa\u2019s lace bra and the creamy mounds they had confined came to mind. He knew damn well what she\u2019d looked like beneath the turtleneck, and he didn\u2019t want to be reminded.</p><p>\u201cI cleaned the lining of her leather jacket, too, but it\u2019ll need some patchwork. Oh, and I washed your shirt, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letter?\u201d he asked, too angrily.</p><p>Smiling, Silva pulled an envelope from her pocket. \u201cI had to soak up the blood, so the letter\u2019s a little hard to read in spots. Found it in a hidden pocket inside her leather jacket. It crinkled when I was mopping up the blood on the lining, otherwise I probably would have missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention it before?\u201d He stretched his hand out for the envelope.</p><p>She withheld it. \u201cI was waiting for you to be in a better mood. Appeared that wasn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Darien seized the letter from her.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to sit down when you read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarissa already told me what it said.\u201d He yanked the letter out of the envelope, barely aware Jake stood breathing down his neck to get a glimpse of it.</p><p>\u201cThen you already know your mate had a living husband.\u201d Darien jerked his head up and stared at Silva, not believing her words.</p><p>Silva folded her arms and looked smug.</p><p>Hell, he knew it. His worse nightmare realized. Lupus garous didn\u2019t divorce. They mated for a lifetime and only mated again if they lost their lifemate, if they found someone else they couldn\u2019t live without. That meant a female was a virgin when first mated unless she was widowed, or in rare cases had been with a human. Lelandi hadn\u2019t been a virgin. Too hung up on her to learn anything he didn\u2019t want to know, he hadn\u2019t questioned her.</p><p>He sat down hard on the chair next to Larissa\u2019s bed, hating that Silva knew how horrible the news hit him. So was it a red blackmailing Lelandi for mating a gray when she was already mated to a red? Or a gray who\u2019d learned the truth, blackmailing her so that he wouldn\u2019t tell Darien? But why kill her?</p><p>Staring at the letter, he couldn\u2019t make himself open it. Now he wondered if the man who had accosted Larissa had been Lelandi\u2019s mate.</p><p>Her nightmares were now becoming his own.</p><p>Jake stood next to the chair, waiting.</p><p>Pack leaders had to keep their packs together. No matter what, Darien had to get through whatever life dealt him. Clenching his teeth, he opened the letter and began to read.</p><p>Dear Lelandi,</p><p>He glanced up at Jake.</p><p>\u201cSo the letter\u2019s from her,\u201d Jake said, jerking his thumb at Larissa. \u201cIt\u2019s not from her sister.\u201d</p><p>If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m dead. Might as well say it like it is. You know me, that\u2019s the way I always could be with you. No one else. Just you, sis.</p><p>\u201cHell, no, it can\u2019t be from her,\u201d Darien said, waving his hand at the hospital bed. \u201cNot if the letter is supposed to be from the dead twin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Lelandi was Larissa and Larissa was Lelandi? I\u2019ll never get it straight.\u201d</p><p>Darien felt a colossal pool of tension collecting in his temple. The more he found out about his mate, the more he realized she wasn\u2019t who he thought she was.</p><p>\u201cSeems that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why she kept saying she was Lelandi when we called her Larissa. I thought her confusion was a direct result of her wounds, and then later from the medication.\u201d</p><p>So what else had his mate lied about? Having a family, a pack, a husband, her name. Part of him wanted to know, but part of him wanted the secrets kept buried. What difference did it make to know all the sordid details now?</p><p>I could never be what you thought I should, the good daughter, the perfect wife, but you always forgave me as a sister. You tried to steer me right a million times, but I finally had to find my own way. Who would have ever thought little ol\u2019 me would end up with two husbands living at the same time, eh? Sorry, L. Just like the rest of our family, we don\u2019t exactly go along with pack rules. In our blood, I guess.</p><p>If I could do it all over again, I wouldn\u2019t have been born. Honest.</p><p>I wanted to be just like you. Hope you don\u2019t mind too terribly. Didn\u2019t try to cause you any trouble. Don\u2019t ever get hooked up with the wrong wolf, and then find the right one.</p><p>But if Darien was the right one, why was she so unhappy? None of it made any sense.</p><p>One of the lupus found out. He\u2019s been blackmailing me. Been getting death threats, too. If Darien learns about my other mate, he\u2019ll be wishing I\u2019d died the first time around.</p><p>The fear she\u2019d be found out\u2014that\u2019s what made her so inconsolable.</p><p>I\u2019ve made a real mess of things. Like I usually do with my life.</p><p>Give Mom and Papa my love. I know they\u2019re white-haired by now over all of my shenanigans. Love you, sis. Find the happiness I was never meant to have. Larissa</p><p>He looked at\u2014Lelandi, still sleeping soundly, wondering how the hell Larissa had sent her the letter after she had died.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we ought to let him have some private time?\u201d Silva said to Jake.</p><p>\u201cYou need anything, Darien?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>He shook his head, feeling like his whole body had sifted through a grinder. Leaning back in the chair, he closed his eyes. He\u2019d wanted his mate to tell him what upset her so.</p><p>Now he almost wished he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Later that afternoon, Jake poked his head in the room while Lelandi slept soundly and said to Darien, \u201cWe\u2019ve got problems with one of the leather tanning machines, and I really need help on this one.\u201d</p><p>Darien figured he didn\u2019t, but wanted to get his mind off his troubles. As it turned out, it took more than an hour to fix it and Darien was thankful for the diversion.</p><p>Returning to the hospital, Jake opened the back door. \u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone could screw up the leather tanning machine that badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least no one was injured,\u201d Darien said, \u201clike the last time.\u201d</p><p>Ritka sleeping at the nurse\u2019s station caught his attention. She could be a real bitch, but she always worked hard, never slacking off.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave her arm a rough shake. \u201cShe\u2019s out cold.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s stomach clenched, and he glanced down the hall. A janitor was passed out next to a bucket of mop water, and Deputy Peter lay sprawled on the floor next to his chair in front of Lelandi\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Darien bolted down the hall and slammed Lelandi\u2019s door open, the force banging it against the wall. Lelandi was gasping for air, a black plastic bag covering her face, suffocating her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOdin\u2019s teeth!\u201d In a couple of bounds, he was beside her bed, digging his fingers into the bag, trying to rip it open, his heart thundering.</p><p>Before Lelandi was fully conscious, she felt she was suffocating, the room pitch black, yet with her wolf vision, she should see clearly. She tried to move her hands, but her wrists were bound again. She could barely breathe as something pressed against her face. Something clinging and black. No oxygen. Blacking out. Where were her guards? Inside room? Outside...</p><p>Holes began to appear in the plastic as someone frantically tore at it and finally ripped it away. She gasped for air. Darien\u2019s anxious face and the blinding lights of the hospital room appeared before her, while he continued to tear at the bag.</p> <p>Filling her lungs, she tried to reach out to him. He paused while ripping the tape off around her neck, and took her hand and squeezed tight. \u201cJesus, Lelandi.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything more, just held onto her hand and gazed into her eyes.</p><p>Jake rushed into the room. \u201cWhat the hell.\u201d He grabbed her wrist. \u201cHer pulse is frantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind out who all was at the hospital, who had access to the coffeepot in the common area, whose fingerprints are on it. I want to know how many were drugged and if everyone\u2019s all right.\u201d Darien finished removing the tape and bag from her neck and head.</p><p>Still holding her wrist, Jake remained beside her. \u201cPulse is more normal.\u201d</p><p>Darien seized the leather strap tying her right wrist, and Jake grasped the other and yanked it off.</p> <p>\u201cI want her home with us until we get somewhere with this investigation.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi breathed deeply, unable to comprehend what had happened.</p><p>\u201cDid you see who did this to you?\u201d Darien brushed a strand of hair from her cheek, holding her hand again with a firm but tender touch.</p><p>The nightmare she was living was getting worse. \u201cI must have been sleeping. I was pretty groggy. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears somebody laced the coffee that the staff and visitors drink with heavy-duty sleep medicine.\u201d</p><p>Even Sam was sound asleep in the chair next to the wall.</p> <p>\u201cJust to get to me?\u201d</p><p>Darien ran his hand over hers. \u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc said she could be released?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Check on the others, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Jake rushed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were Lelandi?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI told... you. No one would listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me who she was mated to.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi looked away.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t used to being disobeyed and her actions thoroughly compounded his irritation concerning what her sister had done. But it wasn\u2019t Lelandi\u2019s fault, and he attempted to curb his temper. \u201cI have to know who\u2019s got it in for you. Maybe knowing who she was mated to doesn\u2019t matter at this point, but I can\u2019t help but wonder if he had contracted someone to shoot you. Was that who accosted you behind Hastings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he nodded. Her eyes held his hostage, and he couldn\u2019t believe how much he yearned to have her, like he\u2019d wanted her sister. He looked down at his sweaty hands. She made him feel like a pup vying for a female\u2019s attention the first time around. She wasn\u2019t even in a wolf\u2019s heat, yet he desired her like he had no business wanting her.</p><p>He took another deep breath and looked at her. \u201cUntil I find some answers, you\u2019re staying with my brothers and me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, but she promptly closed them.</p><p>He expected her to object, or say something. But she seemed so withdrawn, he wondered if the attempted murderer had drugged her also. \u201cAll right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSilva cleaned your jacket and jeans, but I\u2019m afraid your shirt and...\u201d He glanced down at her breasts covered in the thin hospital gown, her nipples pressed against the fabric. He raised his brows. \u201cShe picked up a couple of items for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>She gave a tentative nod.</p><p>\u201cDid one of the nurses give you more medicine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Before Darien responded, Silva pushed a wheelchair into the room. \u201cJake\u2019s really uptight about something, but he wouldn\u2019t say what. He told me to hurry this down here. What\u2019s going on?\u201d She glanced at Sam. \u201cBoy, I\u2019ve never seen him sleep on guard duty before.\u201d She lifted the ripped-up black plastic sack off the table next to the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi shuddered.</p><p>\u201cA death mask,\u201d Darien said. \u201cGet her dressed. She\u2019s going to my place, ASAP.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook Sam\u2019s arm and woke him. Blurry-eyed, he glowered at Darien.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get some caffeine into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... what the bloody hell happened?\u201d Sam growled, rubbing his head, his eyes squinting. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve pulled an all-nighter and have a lupus-sized hangover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drugged.\u201d Darien helped Sam out of the room and slammed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d Sam bellowed. \u201cI\u2019ll kill \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world happened?\u201d Silva carefully helped Lelandi to the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cSomeone put something in the coffee and knocked everyone out. Guy tried to suffocate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, it\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t drink coffee. I ran home to get another book to read, thinking you\u2019d be here a while longer. But when I returned, I found Jake trying to wake Ritka and a janitor. Jake yelled at me to get a wheelchair for you and wouldn\u2019t say what was wrong. Was the person who tried to hurt you a guy or a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s got to catch the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Although Lelandi was healing well, considering she\u2019d been shot the night before last, she was sore and weak. Silva took her arm and helped her down from the bed, but Lelandi\u2019s head began to swirl into darkness, and Silva pushed her back onto the mattress.</p><p>Silva\u2019s hands trembled. \u201cSit. Uhm, I\u2019ll get Nurse Grey to help. You\u2019re less stable on your feet than I thought.\u201d</p><p>She hurried out of the room, but Lelandi didn\u2019t need half of the people at the hospital dressing her. She meant to climb off the bed, steady herself for a minute, then get dressed. But as soon as her feet touched the floor, her mind and stomach began floating out to sea and the table started to tilt. Except the table wasn\u2019t tilting, and she grabbed for it when she started to black out, pulling it crashing down on top of her.</p><p>Where the edge of the table landed, dull pain hit her thighs. So much for dressing herself. New bruises for sure, but at least she didn\u2019t hit her tender wounds. If she wasn\u2019t so groggy she would have screamed bloody murder for her ineptness.</p><p>Darien and Jake rushed into the room, their expressions horrified. Crap.</p><p>\u201cOdin\u2019s knees,\u201d Darien said, and Jake echoed his sentiment.</p><p>He and his brother hurried to pull the table off her.</p><p>\u201cWe should leave her in the bed, restrained.\u201d Jake offered her a wry smile.</p><p>Lelandi managed a low, feeble growl.</p><p>Jake raised a brow and Darien had the gall to smile, although she didn\u2019t know what he thought was so damned funny. If his arm wasn\u2019t so far away from her teeth, she\u2019d bite him.</p><p>\u201cOh no... oh no,\u201d Silva said, hurrying into the room. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you alone for a second. Nurse Grey\u2019s coming in a minute. She was trying to revive Doc, who\u2019s passed out in his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d Darien lifted Lelandi off the floor, but one of his hands slipped inside the gown opening at the back. His heated fingers pressing against her naked skin sent her temperature soaring, and the look he gave her made her sure it unsettled him as much as it did her. He set her on the bed and adjusted her hospital gown to draw the skimpy fabric lower, past her knees.</p><p>\u201cLeave, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting her dressed and out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying at your place.\u201d Silva pulled clothes out of a pink bag from Lacy Garments &amp; Accessories.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll need me to help her dress and shower. So, plan on a slumber party, boys.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Silva, you can be a real pain in the ass.\u201d Darien slipped on Lelandi\u2019s sock, his back to her while Silva pulled off her gown.</p><p>\u201cYou love me anyway, boss.\u201d Silva winked at Lelandi. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a pretty lace bra to match your panties. This crummy place isn\u2019t very style conscious, though Lacy Garments &amp; Accessories has some nice see-through nighties. If we wore such a thing. But I thought this white lace bra was pretty and cut a little lower so it wouldn\u2019t touch your wounds and irritate them.\u201d She drew the bra up to cover her.</p><p>Darien paused before he put on her other sock, and she wondered if he wanted to look to see how low-cut the bra was. It was low. Nearly exposed her nipples, and it was a push-up.</p><p>\u201cLooks nice, sugar, although you really didn\u2019t need anything pushed up.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s heart beat harder, and she could smell his sex again.</p><p>Silva was pushing the poor gray over the edge. \u201cI bought you this nice, loose, button-down shirt so that it would be easy to dress.\u201d</p><p>Darien growled low. Or moaned. Lelandi\u2019s hearing wasn\u2019t what it should be either because of the medication.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get her jeans on, boss, and she\u2019ll be ready to go. She doesn\u2019t need to put her boots on. We have to wheel her out to your SUV, and I\u2019ll follow behind in my car.\u201d</p><p>Darien focused on the shirt, and then his gaze shifted to Silva, who shrugged. \u201cReady to help with the jeans?\u201d</p><p>His eyes strayed to Lelandi\u2019s new panties, and she wished she could see what made them seem so appealing to him. He was having a time helping her into her jeans, although she imagined he\u2019d be a whiz at taking them off. Why she was even thinking such a thing, she hadn\u2019t a clue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The jacket was last, and it was heavy and cumbersome because she felt so weak. Once she sat in the wheelchair, Darien pushed her out of the room where Jake waited beyond the door.</p><p>Walking beside Darien, Jake said, \u201cEveryone\u2019s slowly waking from the drugged coffee\u2014Doc, Ritka, the new janitor, parents of a patient, Peter, Sam, and Uncle Sheridan. But, man, was Uncle Sheridan hotter than a summer heat wave. Even in his half-groggy condition, he\u2019s ordering Trevor about, taping off the break room. He warned us the attempted killer probably didn\u2019t leave any fingerprints behind. Sam\u2019s throwing a beer and pizza party at our place later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou missed the leader\u2019s meeting because you were investigating the shootings. Figured now that you\u2019re taking the lady to your house, you\u2019ll want to have the meeting. And,\u201d Jake said, \u201csince his barmaid will be there, she can serve, like always.\u201d</p><p>Silva gave him a disgruntled look, although the annoyance appeared faked. Lelandi figured she loved being the center of attention in a room full of men. Or at least tried to be. Or was it that she secretly had a yearning for Sam?</p><p>Jake shoved his Stetson on his head and pushed the side door to the hospital open. \u201cHe said you\u2019ve got to earn your keep somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I don\u2019t work lots of overtime so the guys can drink longer? Ahem, is Trevor going to be working guard duty?\u201d Her voice sounded suspiciously hopeful.</p><p>Lelandi wanted to kick the deputy next time she saw him act disinterested in Silva when she wanted so much to please him. Why did women chase after men who showed them no affection in return?</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about the sleeping arrangements?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Silva looked back at Darien. \u201cYeah, boss, who gets to sleep with whom?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi held her breath, waiting for Darien\u2019s word, feeling a mixture of hope he wanted her, and at the same time wishing he\u2019d want to steer clear of her. She had a mission to accomplish. She didn\u2019t need any more of his kisses. And she sure as hell didn\u2019t want them.</p><p>Her tongue traced her lips, just thinking of the way he\u2019d kissed her, and she closed her eyes and moaned. Could any other man make her feel like that? And if he could, she wanted to find him next. Forget about looking for her damned rogue brother.</p><p>She opened her eyes and found everyone watching her.</p><p>Darien\u2019s brows lifted slightly. \u201cLelandi sleeps alone.\u201d</p> <p>She let out her breath, and he cast her a smile.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone bumping into her wounds in the middle of the night. Unless one of my brothers wants to give up his bed to you, Silva...\u201d Darien tilted his head to the side as if to ask if she had any objections, yet finality censored his words.</p><p>Silva frowned back at him. Obviously, she wasn\u2019t interested in his brothers.</p><p>\u201cNot my bed. I stayed up most of last night and gave enough blood, I\u2019m ready for a good night\u2019s sleep,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got guard duty from four to six in the morning, Jake.\u201d Darien wheeled the chair outside to the SUV.</p><p>\u201cI can handle it.\u201d Jake said to Silva, \u201cGuess you can sleep in whoever\u2019s bed isn\u2019t occupied during guard duty.\u201d He opened the passenger door for Darien. \u201cWhat about Tom? He\u2019s doing pretty well, but you don\u2019t plan on having him serving on guard duty, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s champing at the bit to pull it. Think he\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>Jake frowned. \u201cTell him he\u2019d better find a new girl.\u201d</p> <p>Silva chuckled. \u201cYeah, this one for darned sure\u2019s already taken.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stifled a growl. Once she found out who the blackmailer and killer were, and heck, found her gun and took care of them, she was out of here.</p><p>She caught a glimpse of her cousin Ural watching from across the street at some old movie theater, the sign faded like most everything else in Silver Town. Her heart nearly stopped. He wore his hood up, hiding his face, but everyone was sure to be looking for him, and that coat was like an orange prison jumpsuit on an escaped convict.</p><p>Damn him for hanging around. If the grays caught him, they\u2019d crucify him, figuring he had something to do with her sister\u2019s death and the shootings. Plus, Mrs. Hastings had seen him manhandle her, and Darien was pretty hot about that. They wouldn\u2019t use kid gloves on him either, not like they did with her when they were trying to find out the truth. All because he wanted her home before the pack leader found out where she was, or maybe he wanted her to run away with him. She wasn\u2019t really sure what he had in mind.</p><p>Quickly, she looked away so no one saw what had caught her attention, but Silva saw, and Jake, too. Then Darien.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>JAKE CURSED AND TOOK OFF RUNNING AFTER LELANDI\u2019S cousin.</p><p>Her heart hammering, Lelandi tried to climb out of the wheelchair, pain filling her chest. \u201cLeave him alone!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>\u201cCalm down before you hurt yourself further,\u201d Darien ordered, and lifted her flailing body out of the wheelchair and into the backseat of his SUV. \u201cGet in, Silva, and make her stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was going to follow behind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d he snapped, trying to keep Lelandi still. \u201cHell, drive the vehicle. I\u2019ll keep the hellion in her seat.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi struggled to get free when someone opened the other passenger door to the backseat of the vehicle and grabbed her arm.</p><p>She cried out. \u201cTom,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>The poor guy\u2019s head still bandaged, he gave her a toothy grin, but it looked like his struggle to calm her pained him, and she ceased fighting him. What did it matter anyway? She wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and Jake was sure to catch her cousin since he was longer-legged and had a lot more strength in his movement than the shorter red.</p><p>Darien leaned over her and locked her seat belt in place. The strap pressed against her injuries, and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Lelandi.\u201d Darien\u2019s eyes turned to midnight as he motioned to Silva. \u201cDrive.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her back into the seat, Lelandi slipped her hand between the seat belt and her chest, trying to avoid contact with the shoulder strap. Darien began to move it aside for her when Jake cornered Ural next to a fast-food pizza place. She willed her racing heart to slow, but her body wouldn\u2019t obey.</p><p>Darien shouted, \u201cPull into the pizzeria\u2019s parking lot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lelandi screamed and tried to tear off the seat belt.</p><p>\u201cQuit it, Lelandi. We won\u2019t kill the guy.\u201d</p><p>Yet his icy look told another story. Darien attempted to brace her against the seat, his big hands pinning her shoulders back. She bit into the leather jacket covering his arm, but it protected him.</p><p>Pinning her left arm down, Tom chuckled.</p><p>Silva slammed on the brakes in the parking lot. \u201cHe got away.\u201d</p><p>Looking like the devil was after him\u2014and for now he was\u2014Ural dove down a side street, and Jake took chase again. Lelandi was impressed. She didn\u2019t think Ural could outmaneuver the gray in a footrace in their human form. But he was a wiry little guy. If he could turn into the wolf, he\u2019d do even better.</p><p>\u201cDrive us home,\u201d Darien said to Silva, pulling his cell phone out. He punched in a number and moved a tress of hair away from Lelandi\u2019s cheek. She scowled and turned her head away. \u201cUncle Sheridan, get your men to the pizzeria, south on Silver Maple Street, suspect wearing a hooded copper coat. Jake\u2019s on foot chasing him. Yep, same guy who accosted Lelandi behind Hastings B&amp;B. No, Larissa was my mate. The guy in the copper coat is small, most likely a red. Gotcha.\u201d He looked at Lelandi, his expression one of deep satisfaction.</p><p>Despite what a jerk her cousin could be, she didn\u2019t want the grays to harm him. She gave Darien her meanest glower and would give him more hell as soon as she could.</p><p>Darien had every intention of putting Lelandi to bed when he got her home. But after what had happened with the guy in the copper jacket, he didn\u2019t trust her to stay put without a guard. And he didn\u2019t trust that the guy wouldn\u2019t come for her again.</p><p>He planned on securing her in the guest bedroom, but he was awfully tempted to put her in his bedroom suite to cut down on the amount of guards posted. Hell, as light a sleeper as he was, she\u2019d never be able to slip away if she had a notion to. He didn\u2019t care how his people would view his actions either\u2014they\u2019d adjust, but he did care how Lelandi felt about it. To that end, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>Although she sure as hell kissed him back when he kissed her. Which meant? She was probably half out of her head after being injured so badly. Or was that the reason she had clamored for his kisses? Then passed out. Yeah, it had to be the blood loss screwing up her brain.</p><p>But another thought took hold. The woman from his dreams was Lelandi. He stared at her. She refused to look at him. A sickening feeling instantly swept through him. Hell, he\u2019d mated the wrong woman.</p><p>When they pulled into the circular drive of his wooded estate two miles from town, Darien had every intention of showing Lelandi she was his soul mate, but her injuries... he\u2019d kill the bastard who tried to murder her.</p><p>\u201cTom, you have guard duty from twelve to two. Get some rest before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping most of the day, Darien. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Darien lifted Lelandi out of the SUV, the fight out of her now. Soft and pliable, she looked damned kissable again, but when she groaned, he squashed that notion. \u201cWatch her in the living room until Trevor gets here to guard her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure, Darien.\u201d</p><p>Darien had the greatest urge to carry her straight up to his bedroom, lay her in his bed, and ravage her. And he would, once she was healed, and he convinced her she was the one meant for him. Did she have the same dreams he did? If so, why hadn\u2019t she recognized him? Or had she, but she didn\u2019t want him now because he\u2019d taken her sister as his mate? Hell.</p><p>With that damning thought, he carried her to the living room, the craving to have her growing with every step he took. Already he was as hard as granite and the friction from his jeans was making the situation worse. Her eyes widened and he was certain she could smell how turned on he was by touching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clenching his teeth, he set her down on the longest velour sofa, nearly six feet in length. \u201cSilva, can you get a spare pillow and blanket from the linen closet in my bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Silva hurried off.</p><p>\u201cTom, you can get her some ice water. Doc said the fever\u2019s abated, but she still needs to drink plenty of fluids.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get it.\u201d Tom headed for the kitchen.</p><p>Lelandi wouldn\u2019t look at Darien, but held her chest lightly.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurting?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He touched her cheek and although she was still cool to the touch, the feel of her soft skin beneath his fingertips burned him. Hating how much the siren ensnared him, and he couldn\u2019t do anything about it, yet, he pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being too rough earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy fault.\u201d Tears glistened in her eyes.</p><p>He felt like he\u2019d shrunk to half his size. \u201cLelandi.\u201d</p><p>She quickly looked away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what my sister did. It must hurt to learn she\u2019d...\u201d Her voice broke and a wave of commiseration washed over him. Her lower lip quivered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I loved my sister and I wish she hadn\u2019t been mated to him. That she\u2019d found you first and loved you like you both deserved. She would have been happy and... and no one would have hurt her.\u201d</p><p>He took Lelandi\u2019s hand and rubbed his thumb over her fingers, her skin silky soft, her hand small like her sister\u2019s. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, and I assume she had good reason for doing what she did, in her own way.</p><p>Besides, it was partly my responsibility.\u201d He crouched in front of her and rested his hands on her knees. \u201cSilva was right. I wouldn\u2019t let Larissa be. I pursued her and she repeatedly said no, but not why. I figured she was playing hard to get, maybe reluctant because she feared the grays wouldn\u2019t accept her like I did. I thought she was the one for me. When we mated, I discovered she wasn\u2019t a virgin. That she had a living mate never crossed my mind. I guess I was too proud to consider such a thing. Why didn\u2019t you tell me we\u2019ve been together in our dreams?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p> <p>He knew it.</p><p>She shuttered her eyes. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about is this.\u201d He pulled her from the couch and with one arm wrapped around her so she couldn\u2019t step back, he kissed her mouth with a gentle sweep of his lips. Her eyes fluttered closed, her heartbeat quickened, and she fell under his trance. She wasn\u2019t as immune to him as she let on. The tension in her body melted, and he pressed further, his mouth caressing hers, his fingers touching her cheeks, the heat of her body setting his on fire. God in heaven, she was his soul mate.</p><p>She parted her lips slightly to take a breath, but the invitation was too great. He explored her mouth with his tongue, and her hand clutched his shirt, her eyes searching his. \u201cYou are she,\u201d he whispered thickly.</p><p>He pressed his heavy groin against her mound, showing her how much he wanted her. How much he always wanted her. \u201cLelandi,\u201d he said hoarsely with need, then bent his head down to touch her forehead with his.</p><p>Confusion reigned in her gem-quality eyes. \u201cYou are she,\u201d he repeated, kissing her cheek.</p><p>She winced and bit her lip.</p><p>He cursed silently. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p> <p>She seemed torn between telling him the truth and living with the discomfort to avoid being medicated. He helped her sit back down, then saw Tom standing with the glass of water, having witnessed the whole affair. A slight smile curved Tom\u2019s lips, and he raised his brows a hair.</p><p>\u201cSilva\u2019s got Lelandi\u2019s pain pills. Get them for her, and check on Silva to see if she got lost,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>Lelandi smiled a little, but the same soulful expression Larissa had filled Lelandi\u2019s eyes, too. He wondered what had happened to the sisters to make them hurt so.</p><p>He helped her out of her leather jacket and stared at the shirt Silva had bought for her. Vixen. Matchmaker deluxe. In the soft glow of the overhead light, the scrap of lace pushing up Larissa\u2019s breasts showed through the blouse. When Tom came downstairs with the medicine, Silva, the blanket and pillow, he meant to tell Tom to bring him one of his flannel shirts for Lelandi.</p><p>The doorbell rang thwarting him, and Sam barged in, his arms loaded down with pizza boxes. \u201cGot tons of pizzas and beer, if anyone wants to give me a hand.\u201d</p><p>Darien covered Larissa with the blanket. \u201cSit with her, Silva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>But when he and Tom brought in an armload of drinks, he noticed Silva had helped Larissa remove her jeans, now folded on the arm of the couch. He silently groaned, imagining seeing the rest of her nearly naked underneath the blanket.</p><p>When Darien disappeared into the kitchen with his brother and Sam, Silva pulled a chair closer to the couch and asked Lelandi, \u201cHow do you do it? Man, oh man, I thought Darien would take you right there on the couch. I sneaked back up the stairs before Darien noticed me. Tom\u2019s gawking in surprise was audience enough.\u201d Silva grinned. \u201cDarien\u2019s pants get so tight in the crotch when he\u2019s around you, he\u2019s probably strangled. But I can\u2019t get Trevor to feel anything for me.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi knew damn well Darien was projecting her sister on her, and she felt Silva\u2019s pain. Yet, she couldn\u2019t help wanting his heated touches. Nothing was worse than a lupus garou wanting another who didn\u2019t share the same feelings. Yet, she knew from past experience and from her other wolf mates that Silva would have to learn this on her own. No one could tell her what Lelandi and most, she was sure, could already see. Trevor was a bastard, knowing that Silva wanted him and giving her the cold shoulder, taking pride in having her salivating over him when he had no intention of showing her any affection in return.</p><p>As far as Darien was concerned, Lelandi wasn\u2019t Larissa and never could be. He\u2019d have to find another mate. Not someone who looked like her.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lelandi advised, \u201cFind someone else, Silva.\u201d She truly meant it, although she had to be a little more devious in her plan.</p><p>Silva\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean for real. Convince someone to help you make him jealous, but be sure you make it clear from the beginning that you\u2019re only trying to get Trevor\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s whole face lit up. \u201cI know just the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure he knows why you\u2019re doing it. You don\u2019t want to give some poor guy hope when you don\u2019t really mean it.\u201d</p><p>Nodding vigorously, Silva loosened some of the curls piled on top of her head.</p><p>\u201cSo, who are you targeting?\u201d</p><p>Silva grinned. \u201cSam. He\u2019s perfect. Ten years older than me, but he can really put on the charm when he wants. And he\u2019s used to my flirtations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see you turn on a lot of wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Silva fingered her loose curls. \u201cI kind of have a teasing personality. Guess I should tone it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Just channel it.\u201d To the right guy.</p><p>The fact Silva wanted Sam\u2019s help made Lelandi wonder if there wasn\u2019t some underlying interest in him that Silva couldn\u2019t recognize because she was so infatuated with Trevor. Plus if Sam was interested in her, the way she mooned over Trevor would be a dead turnoff. But if Silva gave Sam half a chance...</p><p>If Lelandi could, she would help show Trevor a thing or two before she had to leave. And maybe if she could win Silva over, she might be willing to share more pack secrets that could lead to Lelandi\u2019s discovering who murdered Larissa.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to do about the little lady?\u201d Sam asked in the kitchen, as Darien welcomed his men to the leader\u2019s pack meeting.</p><p>Sam was talking low, but Lelandi could still hear him, although the medicine was making her groggy again while she reclined on the couch.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to be taken up to the guest bedroom,\u201d Darien said. \u201cShe needs to sleep and get her strength back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom\u2019s got a slew of problems to discuss. Is he feeling all right to present the issues?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>Ice clunked into a container.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeard Jake lost that guy in the copper coat near the bank.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi breathed a sigh of relief. Her cousin was the runt of the litter\u2014a beta. No true family loyalty. But if he took her home to Bruin, the leader would undoubtedly force her to mate his brother, Crassus, the bastard. One Wildhaven wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>\u201cI was Larissa\u2019s friend,\u201d Silva said to Lelandi, her voice whisper soft. \u201cThe only female friend she had. Although Nurse Grey was always nice to her. But I don\u2019t think Larissa trusted her or anyone else. Larissa wasn\u2019t an alpha, but she was sweet, had an innocence about her. She didn\u2019t lead Darien on, but I could tell she wanted to know what it would be like with someone who wanted her so badly and really cared for her. Darien seems hard, but he\u2019s still grieving for her. But... she told me some things.\u201d</p><p>Silva paused when the chatter in the kitchen died down. Her lips curved up slightly. \u201cLet\u2019s move to the guest bedroom, sugar. Darien won\u2019t want us to hear boring pack business.\u201d</p><p>Jake slammed the front door and stalked into the living room, casting a glance in Lelandi\u2019s direction. He looked pissed. Guess because he hadn\u2019t caught Ural.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s lips rose slightly despite willing them to remain still. He shook his head at her. Hearing Darien\u2019s voice in the kitchen, he headed that way.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d The sound of Darien\u2019s voice indicated he already knew his brother\u2019s answer.</p><p>\u201cThe guy got away. But Uncle Sheridan and a bunch of our men are searching for him. We\u2019ll get him.\u201d Jake sounded more like he was telling Lelandi the news\u2014a warning.</p><p>\u201cTrevor arrived. Take Lelandi up to the guest room, and he can guard her. Afterward, we\u2019ll start the meeting,\u201d</p><p>Darien said.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Jake stalked back into the living room. When he lifted Lelandi off the couch, she noticed no one spoke in the kitchen. She was dying to hear what Silva had to say about her sister and bet Darien was, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake carried her upstairs and she admired a score of photographs on the walls, featuring clusters of mountain wildflowers. Beautiful, colorful, vivid\u2014lavender columbine peeking out from the base of an alpine grove, pink, showy milkweed like starbursts, purple thistle, and golden mountain dandelions. \u201cWho\u2019s the photographer?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s dark face brightened some. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She thought maybe Darien had taken them. Despite feeling she shouldn\u2019t care, she wanted to know more about the gray, who had taken her sister for his mate.</p> <p>\u201cDarien doesn\u2019t have any real hobbies,\u201d Jake explained as if he read her thoughts. \u201cToo busy keeping the town going, running two businesses, taking care of the pack. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility for one lupus garou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a whole pack to assist him.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave her a smug smile and carried her into a room. Vases of roses and wildflowers cluttered an antique dresser and one of the bedside tables, scenting the air with the most delightful summertime floral fragrance despite being autumn. He glanced at the flowers and shook his head, then laid her in a king-sized, canopied bed of white eyelet. Fit for a princess.</p><p>Silva hurried into the room with Lelandi\u2019s medicine, jeans, and the extra pillow. \u201cNurse Grey, Bertha Hastings, Tom, and a few others sent the flowers. Four secret admirers also.\u201d She pulled a card off a vase of wildflowers and handed it to her. \u201cFrom me.\u201d</p><p>To one hell of a fighter! Go get \u2019em, girl! Next margarita\u2019s on me! Your friend, Silva.</p> <p>Lelandi managed a groggy, heartfelt smile. \u201cThanks, Silva. I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d</p><p>Jake headed for the door. \u201cHoller if you need any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Silva handed Lelandi another card as Jake shut the door. \u201cThis one\u2019s anonymous. Your secret admirers probably hope Darien decides he doesn\u2019t want you and you\u2019ll be interested in one of them.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t really want her. He wanted her sister.</p><p>Her heart in her throat, Lelandi read the card out loud. \u201cYou sure shook up the town, little lady. You\u2019ll make a first-class mate. From someone who would like a chance at being more than a friend.\u201d</p><p>Silva handed her another. \u201cThe anonymous guys probably called the flower orders in. I\u2019ll find out from Rosie who sent them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter I discover what happened to my sister and take care of the bastard, I\u2019m leaving to find my brother.\u201d Lelandi glanced down at the card.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been keeping myself for the best. Wanna tango, baby? Loving you.\u201d</p><p>She gave a short laugh. \u201cI could never tango.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more of a rock and roll kind of girl.\u201d Silva placed her hands on her hips. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue who any of these guys could be.\u201d She waved at a dozen red roses.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let this guy give you his card in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom. These burgundy and gold mums are from Bertha Hastings. She says,</p><p>\u2018You kept your room as neat as a pin, until Darien and Sheriff Sheridan broke in and made a mess of it. To cheer you, here\u2019s a pot of flowers they didn\u2019t manage to break. Get well, young lady. Your room will be ready once you\u2019ve recovered. Free of charge. Bertha Hastings.\u2019</p> <p>She\u2019s a sweet old lady. Really was worried about you.\u201d Frowning, Silva touched her finger to her lips.</p><p>\u201cHmm, one vase of flowers is conspicuously absent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom whom?\u201d</p><p>Silva wiggled her brows. \u201cDarien. He probably didn\u2019t want to order any without raising any more speculation about you and him. Rosie would have told the world.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi took a tired breath and put her hand on her waist. \u201cJake didn\u2019t send me any either.\u201d</p><p>Silva laughed out loud. \u201cHe\u2019s too cheap. Woe to the girl who ever tries to win his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could give her a framed photo of wildflowers.</p><p>They\u2019re really lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell him you think so. That\u2019s why they\u2019re hidden on the staircase and not displayed in the living room for all to see. He loves doing it, but he doesn\u2019t like for anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>Except for Lelandi. She smiled at the contradiction.</p><p>\u201cHmm, the vase of carnations are from a couple of girls who are staying at Hastings Bed and Breakfast. Caitlin and Minx. They said they worried about you when you were in the loft and hoped you were okay. I heard they\u2019re sixteen and want to join the pack.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi sighed. \u201cHow sweet of them to send me flowers.\u201d She wondered which of the twins had found her crying over her sister\u2019s letter that night. But she couldn\u2019t help feeling touched that they cared enough to send her the carnations.</p><p>\u201cAnother anonymous guy. You sure made a stir.\u201d Silva handed the card to Lelandi, then ruffled through another vase of flowers. \u201cI don\u2019t see who this one is from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay around and get to know me, why don\u2019t you, honey? I\u2019ll be seeing you. A fun-loving lupus garou,\u201d</p><p>Lelandi read out loud. \u201cI\u2019m surprised these guys showed any interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the alpha in you. Turns them on.\u201d Silva bent down to retrieve a card off the floor. \u201cHere it is.\u201d Her brow furrowed and she cast Lelandi a condemning look. \u201cI thought you said your parents were dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>EXPECTING TREVOR TO CATCH EVERYTHING SILVA AND Lelandi secretly discussed while he was listening at the guest bedroom door, Darien sat in his favorite leather chair in the living room and motioned to Tom to get on with the abbreviated meeting.</p><p>\u201cUncle Sheridan called and said he\u2019s reconstructing the crime scene over the coffee-drugging incident at the hospital. And Doc Oliver hasn\u2019t fully recovered from the coffee,\u201d Tom said. \u201cOne of the lab technicians discovered it was that date rape drug, GHB.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. Any fingerprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTons. Problem is everyone uses the coffeepot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. What have you got for me?\u201d Darien asked as Sam served up the pizza.</p><p>\u201cCarol Wood wants to work as a nurse at the hospital, but I heard you told her no. She asked if I\u2019d try to sway you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say no. If she doesn\u2019t like working as a school nurse, she can move to another town.\u201d</p><p>Jake lifted a slice of pizza from his plate. \u201cShe\u2019ll be trouble. I\u2019ll bet my paycheck on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther news, Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town is gearing up for the fall festival. Uncle Sheridan is pretty mad that he has to be here again during the activities. That was one of the real reasons he took a vacation,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cHe can concentrate on the shootings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he says his men will be so busy with the influx of tourists...\u201d</p><p>Darien motioned to Mason. \u201cI need you to coordinate a thirty-man call-up police force for backup.\u201d</p><p>Mason raised a can of beer in agreement. \u201cWill do, Darien. I know you didn\u2019t want to have the fall fair again, but it brought in around seventy-five thousand dollars to small business owners when revenues are way off this time of year. Good for the bank, too.\u201d He grabbed another slice of pizza. \u201cUntil we have our first good snowfall and the ski slopes open... we need to do something. The Silver Town Train Ride through the mines hasn\u2019t brought in much in the line of profits this summer either.\u201d</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t like the sudden swell in the human population. Too many things could go wrong. But he did believe in his peoples\u2019 say in matters that affected their well-being also. Not all pack leaders would agree.</p><p>Tom cleared his throat and flipped over another page from his notepad. \u201cA family of five wants to join the pack.\u201d</p><p>Darien took a swig of beer. \u201cWhy are so many wanting to move into the town?\u201d</p><p>Tom shrugged. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Uncle Sheridan checked them out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came in during the evening of the shootings. I figured that might change their minds, but they still want to be considered for inclusion in the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the breakdown of the family unit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, mother, brother of the head of household, and sixteen-year-old twin daughters.\u201d</p><p>Jake gave a small smile. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not any more cantankerous young males?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Have Uncle Sheridan find out what they expect to work at here, their former job skills, training, any past records of problems, why they want to join our pack in particular. Where are they staying in the meantime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHastings B&amp;B. Bertha knows the drill. She\u2019s taking notes and having them watched when she can\u2019t. What do you want to do about the Woodcroft boys?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought Uncle Sheridan was taking care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deferred the decision to you about setting the punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the boys paint the school walls. Carpenter Myers can oversee the job to ensure they do it right. Mason, I want you to arrange that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Tom waited further word, but Darien shook his head. \u201cShould be enough. Did Uncle Sheridan explain to the boys that their parents didn\u2019t pay taxes to support the school? That only the humans pay them and the silver mine subsidizes the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome have grumbled that they want their kids to go to the school instead of home school them,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just like with a human nurse working at the hospital, a testy lupus garou teen trying to prove something to one of the humans could get out of hand. We school our own. Several families are happy to teach the kids of other families who are too busy working.\u201d</p><p>Tom made a note. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another gray wanting to learn all he can about the operation of our town.\u201d</p><p>Darien finished his beer. \u201cWhy all the interest? We\u2019ve had three in the last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord\u2019s getting around we\u2019re a model town,\u201d Jake said. \u201cHow many leaders do we know who can boast running their own towns since their inception without human interference? Even though we try to maintain our shabby look to discourage too much interest, some alpha pack leaders want to build something like we have.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, same as with the ones who want to join the pack, Tom. I want the guy watched. Do a background check on him. Report anything suspicious to either Uncle Sheridan or me. With this situation with Lelandi and her sister, we can\u2019t be too cautious. Any other business?\u201d</p><p>Jake raised a finger. \u201cRosie delivered twelve vases of flowers for Lelandi, but she told me secret admirers sent four of them.\u201d</p><p>Darien snorted. \u201cHell, what next? Have the anonymous buyers traced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d</p><p>Tom chuckled, but quickly coughed to cover his response when Darien gave him a sharp look.</p><p>Trevor hurried into the living room, his face hard. \u201cI thought her parents were supposed to be dead.\u201d</p><p>Darien stared at him. \u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilva said Lelandi got flowers from them.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stared at the card signed: Love, Mom and Dad, typical order called in and signed at the flower shop. \u201cIt has to be a sick joke.\u201d Her eyes filled with tears, and she looked up at Silva, but disbelief filled her face. \u201cBruin\u2019s deputies told me my parents had died in a car accident. He put me under guard, but I escaped shortly afterward. They murdered my parents because Larissa ran away. I kept wanting my parents to move, but they wouldn\u2019t budge. I knew our pack leader would take revenge.\u201d</p><p>Silva pulled a chair over to the bed and took a seat. \u201cWhat if your parents\u2019 deaths were faked? What if this Bruin character wanted you to look for your sister, then he\u2019d know what became of her? Maybe he had you followed? The guy wearing the hooded copper coat, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Bruin? Oh hell, she\u2019d let the pack leader\u2019s name slip. \u201cHe put me under armed guard. He said he\u2019d have me mated to his brother after he declared... my sister was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer husband? Bruin\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>Why did she have to mention his name? Great, just great. \u201cWhat do you know about my sister?\u201d Lelandi asked, before she gave away her whole frigging past.</p> <p>She had to get off this pain medicine for good. Although she was surprised after Ritka had said that the Green Valley deputy knew who she was, Darien never mentioned it to her. Maybe it was a hoax.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never tell anyone else what Larissa told me in private. But I thought you should know. She was really worried someone would find her. I assumed it was her red pack or her family. That they wouldn\u2019t approve that she\u2019d taken a gray mate, although she said she was a loner and had no living family.\u201d Silva glanced at the card in Lelandi\u2019s hand. \u201cI never in a million years dreamed she might have been mated and the guy was still alive. Do you think he\u2019s the one who put a contract out on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone was blackmailing her before this. That makes me think it was someone else who knew she was mated, and she didn\u2019t want him to tell Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a pretty low blow for a pack leader. So,\u201d Silva said, her eyes round, \u201cwas the other guy she was mated to high up in the chain?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi ignored the question. \u201cHe\u2019s abusive, drinks too much. I... I wanted my family to leave\u2014to find my brother. To settle somewhere new. But... they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Silva patted her hand. \u201cTies too strong to the pack?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t say anything. They had no ties to the pack\u2014usurpers. Just a connection to the land. But revealing too much wasn\u2019t a good idea. As if she hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, Silva took up the slack. \u201cDarien said he\u2019s returning you to your pack. But I figure the way he kissed you means he\u2019s changed his mind. You don\u2019t want to return to them, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi\u2019s face heated. \u201cThey killed my parents! I\u2019m not returning. The pack leader will force me to mate his brother. I won\u2019t go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run off on your own on some wild lupus garou chase looking for your brother either. What if you never find him? You could be found out, hurt, killed. What about this guy in the copper coat? Is he a family member, or one of the pack?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi shook her head.</p><p>Silva took a breath, then abruptly changed the subject. \u201cI tried to get Larissa to tell me what was bothering her. I thought maybe it was the pregnancy. Hormonal imbalance kind of thing. \u201d</p><p>Her sister had been pregnant? Lelandi stifled a cry and tears pricked her eyes.</p><p>Silva\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI... I thought you knew. Oh, sweetie, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll get you a box of tissues.\u201d She hurried into the attached bathroom and opened a cabinet.</p><p>Lelandi couldn\u2019t believe her sister had been pregnant when she couldn\u2019t get that way with Crassus. Had she been taking birth control measures behind his back? No wonder Darien was so devastated. Not only had she died, but his offspring had as well. Oh, god, the travesty of it.</p><p>Silva returned to the bedroom and put the box of tissues on the bedside table. \u201cSomething about Darien and your sister\u2019s relationship was all wrong. Do you believe in soul mates among lupus garous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lelandi dabbed her eyes with a tissue. No. She didn\u2019t believe in such a thing even if a hunk of a lupus garou had invaded her dreams for the last several months. Alpha pack leaders often decided who could mate. But she\u2019d never heard of their kind finding their own soul mate. Silva studied her so intensely, Lelandi finally opened up as she pulled the covers to her chin. \u201cI\u2019ve had really vivid dreams, and I sure wish the guy was real.\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOmigosh, you\u2019ve been dream mated with... with...\u201d She looked down at the floor, then gave an almost imperceptible smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s gaze shifted to Lelandi. \u201cDream mating. That\u2019s what Julia Wildthorn, the romance writer, calls it. When soul mates can\u2019t locate each other in the real world, if one has the ability he or she can reach out to the other, offer the bond that unites them. If the other accepts, they\u2019re dream mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how she can make all that stuff up. She says the lupus garous talk like humans in their wolf forms, stand upright even, and worse? Their clothes vanish when they shapeshift into the wolf\u2019s form and reappear on their human form without any effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t reveal our true nature,\u201d Silva huffed. \u201cBesides, I love how her lupus garous find meaningful, heartfelt relationships. We deserve something like that. Your sister said Darien told her he dreamed of her\u2014that\u2019s why he pursued her. Except she didn\u2019t live up to his expectations in real life. Rumors abound that Darien\u2019s grandfather, father, and a couple of his uncles were dream mated.\u201d Silva took a ragged breath. \u201cWhat if that\u2019s the reason he went after her? Only she wasn\u2019t the right one. What if you were? What if your sister realized this, too?\u201d</p><p>Her heart racing, Lelandi stared at the bedcover, her thoughts in turmoil. What if everything Silva said was true? But she never saw her dream lover\u2019s face. Never heard his voice. Couldn\u2019t smell his scent.</p><p>Silva stood and looked out the window. \u201cWhat if she was so depressed because she didn\u2019t want Darien to learn you were the right woman, and she probably wouldn\u2019t want you to know either? On top of that, she was mated to the beast before she met Darien, and she couldn\u2019t let Darien know about that either? Damn, I could see why she was so depressed.\u201d</p><p>Her sister couldn\u2019t have done this to her. How could she? But to get away from Bruin and Crassus, Lelandi could understand why Larissa had left. She deserved to be loved.</p><p>Silva turned to Lelandi. \u201cWhat did he look like? This guy in your dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Darien isn\u2019t the guy.\u201d The elusive smile was fixed once again to Silva\u2019s lips. \u201cAnother thing is...\u201d She let her breath out. \u201cI think Larissa had some affection for a gray working in the silver mine.\u201d</p><p>In disbelief, Lelandi stared at her. Her sister couldn\u2019t have been having an affair with someone else.</p><p>Silva dropped into the chair. \u201cWhat if that had something to do with her depression? She\u2019d found the real guy of her dreams, and she couldn\u2019t have him. Three living male lupus garous at once who pegged her for their own is just not done.\u201d</p><p>How could Larissa\u2019s life have gotten so screwed up? Lelandi closed her eyes, fighting tears. \u201cThe medicine\u2019s making me sleepy.\u201d</p><p>Silva didn\u2019t move for what seemed an eternity, and then she stood. \u201cAll right, honey. You get some sleep.\u201d She strode to the door and closed it behind her.</p><p>If Larissa had had a lover, who else had known? How could she have done this to Darien?</p><p>In the hall, Trevor talked to Silva in a hushed voice.</p><p>\u201cDarien can\u2019t believe in dream mating. Damned hogwash if you ask me. That\u2019s why he mated the red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds to me like it,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut I think he got the wrong girl.\u201d</p><p>Then everything grew deathly quiet.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s head was spinning out of control. The damned medicine? Or Larissa\u2019s unbelievable sordid tale of the double mates, and a lover to boot. But was Lelandi really Darien\u2019s dream mate? What if she wasn\u2019t and she fed into his delusions that she was? She\u2019d be no better than her sister, and she couldn\u2019t do that to Darien. Not after all he\u2019d been through.</p><p>The medicine slipped through her blood, and Lelandi fell into another world, always the forest, near the creek where the water flowed over rounded stone in a never-ending, steady stream, crystal clear, but silent.</p><p>\u201cLelandi,\u201d her dream lover whispered to her while she read his lips. Why couldn\u2019t she see more of him?Speak with him? Know him. She pressed her fingers to his mouth, and he kissed them.</p><p>No, no, she wanted to read his lips. \u201cSay something,\u201dshe implored, but he took one of her fingers and sucked.</p><p>Her skin heated with desire, but she shook her head, pulled her finger free, and tried again. Pressing his fingers to her lips this time, she said her family name, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWildhaven.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t repeat the word.</p><p>\u201cWhat... is... your... name?\u201d she asked. Could he see her face when she couldn\u2019t see his?</p> <p>He kissed her lips, licked them, pressed his tongue into the seam, but she was determined to learn who he was. She pushed at his chest. \u201cNo. Tell me. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. Not understanding? Or not willing to tell her? Did he already have a mate?</p><p>Oh, this was so ridiculous. He was just a fantasy lover.</p><p>She turned away from him, wanting him to be real, not some made-up illusion. He ran his hand over her shoulder with a tender caress, tickling her. She closed her eyes. He melted her annoyance, stirring a flicker of flame deep inside her. He licked her shoulder, touching her bare hip, not pressuring, using the most sensuous of tactile explorations. Trying not to give in to the lust, she clenched her teeth, lifted his hand from her hip, and moved it to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she mouthed against his hand.</p> <p>She wanted him to communicate to her. But instead of helping, he pulled away... and vanished.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She felt the soft bed in the guest bedroom beneath her, and saw Tom sitting in a chair watching her, his look startled. She sat up taller in bed and frowned at him. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Although she felt remiss in not saying something earlier, it was the first time she\u2019d even thought about asking him about his injuries. Then again, she hadn\u2019t been herself with all of the medication she\u2019d been on. For the first time since the incident, she felt clearheaded, without any chest pains, just some strange prickling where her healing properties were busily taking care of the injured areas. Maybe by morning, she\u2019d look and feel as good as new. Then again, maybe not.</p><p>Tom smiled at her finally, and she imagined he\u2019d been half-asleep, he was so slow to react. He touched his temple where the bandage was gone. \u201cJust a scratch and it\u2019s nearly healed. Head wounds bleed a lot, so I had to get a little blood. Jake wouldn\u2019t give me any. Said he\u2019d used all he could spare on you.\u201d He winked, the most devilish twinkle in his light brown eyes. \u201cPretends he doesn\u2019t like you, but his actions tell another story.\u201d</p><p>Pulling her covers higher, she gave a ladylike snort.</p><p>\u201cRight. Nurse Grey forced him to give blood the second time. Probably the same the first time around, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s all show.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe it for a minute. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like my sister, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like that Darien was upset about what to do concerning her. She was deeply troubled, but she wouldn\u2019t let anyone close enough to find out what was wrong. Jake doesn\u2019t like the silent suffering type. Get it out in the open and deal with it. That\u2019s his motto. I figured whatever nightmare she was living, she couldn\u2019t handle on her own, but she didn\u2019t feel confident enough in herself even to tell Darien. Considering how she was mated to a red, and someone was blackmailing her to keep quiet about it...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe hadn\u2019t known Darien that long. Probably was afraid he\u2019d want to kill her for what she\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>The thought sent a shiver sliding down Lelandi\u2019s spine. \u201cWould he have?\u201d</p><p>Tom raised his brows.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to his reaction. What if Darien knew she had a lover? Would Tom tell his brother she asked? Her whole body warmed with mortification. Tom didn\u2019t seem to mind her being here, and now she\u2019d blown it big-time. But the truth of the matter was, what her sister had done could push some lupus garous over the edge. Being that Darien was the leader of his pack and could get pretty angry\u2014</p><p>\u201cI should be asking if you\u2019re all right. You\u2019ve been talking a lot in your sleep. Nightmares?\u201d Tom asked, consoling.</p><p>\u201cWhat... what did I say?\u201d</p> <p>Sheesh, Larissa never wanted to stay in the same bedroom with her because Lelandi walked and talked in her sleep when she was overly tired and stressed out. But she hadn\u2019t done that in a long time... that she knew of. Of course, after Larissa had moved in with Crassus, no one would have known of Lelandi\u2019s clandestine nighttime activities, although her father scolded her for finding him in the den late one night watching an X-rated movie. She wouldn\u2019t have known if he hadn\u2019t yelled at her and woken her up. From then on, she guessed he knew better and sent her back to her room without waking her, or else he made sure she didn\u2019t catch him watching the movies in the den anymore.</p><p>Tom shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say much that made sense.\u201d</p><p>Thank god. She looked at her hands clenched into fists and let go, smoothing the comforter to release the tension filling every muscle fiber, while she listened to the voices downstairs, some heated, some calmly speaking, but none of which she could make out clearly.</p><p>Tom eased out of the chair and handed her the card from his roses. \u201cFrom me.\u201d</p><p>She read the card.</p><p>You saved my life and I owe you mine. Love, Tom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re... you\u2019re welcome. But it was all my fault that the gunman came after me. If you hadn\u2019t been with me, he wouldn\u2019t have shot you. Heck, if you hadn\u2019t been there, you wouldn\u2019t have called for help, and no one would have known what had become of me. So you saved my life.\u201d</p><p>Tom leaned over and kissed her forehead. \u201cThen it means you owe me.\u201d He glanced toward the door.</p><p>Someone was coming. \u201cLooks like my relief.\u201d</p><p>Despite saying he felt fine, he looked weary.</p><p>The door opened slowly and Darien stepped in, first looking at Tom, who gave him a lopsided grin, then at Lelandi. Surprise reflected in his expression to see her awake. \u201cFeeling pain?\u201d A frown collected across his brow.</p><p>\u201cNo. Just woke up.\u201d</p><p>Darien turned back to Tom. \u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, fine as can be. I\u2019ll join the ruckus downstairs, and then retire.\u201d</p><p>Darien listened to the noise drifting upstairs. \u201cTell them to keep it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, will do.\u201d</p><p>Secrets? She was certain whatever the grays wanted to discuss was not to be shared with the rest of the grays in the pack, and certainly not with her unless Darien said so.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning, Tom.\u201d Darien waited for him to leave.</p><p>Tom gave Lelandi a nod and a smile. \u201c\u2019Night, Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, and thanks for watching over me,\u201d she said, with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>She knew damned well they were not only making sure Ural didn\u2019t get to her again, but she had a sneaking suspicion they didn\u2019t trust her to stay put either.</p><p>Tom\u2019s smile broadened, then he closed the door behind him.</p><p>Darien opened his mouth to speak, but paused when Tom hollered halfway down the stairs, \u201cKeep it quiet down there!\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, Darien crossed the floor and touched her forehead, then used the back of his hand to feel her cheek. \u201cNo fever.\u201d He seemed somewhat relieved, yet the wrinkle in his brow didn\u2019t fade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready to run laps by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>A trace of a smile formed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d He remained in place, hovering over her, and she wondered what he wanted now. He glanced at her water cup, still full. His gaze returned to hers. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He opened his mouth to speak, then closed it.</p><p>Whatever was bothering him was starting to bother her. He seemed glued to the patch of carpet next to the bed, and she assumed he wanted to interrogate her.</p><p>Glancing down at the comforter pulled up to her chin, he said, \u201cDoc\u2019s orders, we have to change your bandages every four hours.\u201d</p><p>Lupus garous were not shy around others. So why did she feel nervous? Her skin grew a faint coating of goose bumps. Maybe because he was acting anxious. Silva had already changed her bandages twice earlier in the day, no big deal. Yet, it seemed a big deal when the male gray leader wanted to change them. Maybe it was because he was waiting for her to say it was all right, when Silva charged in like she\u2019d been trained as a nurse before she began waitressing, knew what she was doing, and had no qualms about it. Or maybe because every time Darien got near Lelandi, she felt the sexual tension in the air between them sizzling like exposed live electric wires, smelled the scent of his sex, could nearly taste the craving he had for her.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t need changing.\u201d</p><p>Folding his arms, he lifted a brow. \u201cDoc said the wounds weep until everything\u2019s healed. If the bandage gets too wet, you could get chilled again. That\u2019s what Doc said. Change it every four hours to keep it dry and free of infection.\u201d He glanced at the clock on the bedside table to emphasize the time. \u201cBeen four hours.\u201d He looked back at her, waiting for her to agree.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d She pulled the comforter away so she could get out of bed and go to the bathroom where she could use the mirror to see what she was doing. Big mistake.</p><p>The flannel shirt Silva had helped her into earlier that night had ridden up to her navel, exposing her nakedness all the way to her toes. She was sure her skin had turned as red as her short curly hairs, especially when she saw him taking in his fill.</p><p>She jerked down the shirt, and his gaze shifted from her bare legs to her eyes. He shook his head tightly, but she noticed that he shifted in his stance then. A glance at his crotch gave her the reason. Hard as a rock.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the comforter up to her waist. \u201cMight as well get this over.\u201d</p><p>He began to unbutton her shirt, his shirt, but it felt too much like he was getting her ready for sex, and she quickly brushed his hands away. \u201cI can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trying to be helpful.\u201d</p><p>She frowned when he watched. This was worse than if he unbuttoned the shirt. Problem was, his touching her was making her way too hot. But his watching her had the same damned effect. \u201cCan you do something else? Read a book or something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust pretend I\u2019m the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Oh, god, yeah, playing doctor and patient. She gave him a dirty look while he attempted to hide a saucy smirk.</p><p>When she finished unbuttoning the shirt, she grumpily said, \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed his hands together like he was excited to get started, and she frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cGetting my hands warmed up. They\u2019re cold.\u201d Gingerly, he peeled back her shirt, exposing her left breast and the bandaged wounds. \u201cTell me if anything is sore or hurts.\u201d His demeanor was professional, well, maybe a little anxious.</p><p>She cringed, afraid it would hurt as much as it had before.</p><p>He pulled off the tape around the pads, and considered the wounds with considerable scrutiny. \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cItching, burning some.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and dumped the used bandages in the wastepaper basket. He applied some salve on the bullet holes with such a light touch that it tickled. She couldn\u2019t help smiling, although she fought it. No way did she want to show she wasn\u2019t mad at him.</p><p>He caught her look and his mouth curved up. \u201cGuess it\u2019s not hurting.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cTickling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe done in a minute.\u201d He situated the new pad over the wounds, brushing her already taut nipple with the edge of his hand, and taped the pad in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting cold,\u201d she said, tersely.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re healing well. After Jake pulls guard duty, I\u2019ll change it again.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled the shirt closed and began buttoning it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe Silva will be up by then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a late sleeper. Used to staying up late at the bar. And Jake doesn\u2019t have an ounce of doctoring sense. Tom will probably be asleep still, but even if he isn\u2019t, he\u2019d probably forget what he came in here to do. Doc said you might be getting edgy about not healing faster. He wanted you to know it\u2019s because of the severity of the injuries. If you\u2019d been human, you\u2019d be dead. And if by some miracle you\u2019d lived, Doc said it would take several months to heal. He said you might be feeling all right by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a disparaging look. \u201cI\u2019ll be up and about tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not anything like your sister. Need anything? Something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d She closed her eyes, hoping he\u2019d go away, but he took a seat in the recliner and leaned back, making it squeak.</p><p>She tried hearing what was being said downstairs, but the conversation was too low. She was too keyed up to sleep while Darien watched her. The image of his bandaging her, the way he looked at her, the feel of his hand against her nipple made her ache for his touch again. She ground her teeth, willing her mind to crush the thought so she could sleep.</p><p>Darien could tell from the way she licked her lips and swallowed hard, then ground her teeth, she wasn\u2019t sleeping. He squirmed to get comfortable, his erection springing to life again, just from visualizing her naked supple body under the covers. He hadn\u2019t expected to get an eyeful when she pulled her covers aside. The problem was he had to see for himself she was healing adequately. He didn\u2019t just want Silva\u2019s word for it. Not when he had to prove to Lelandi she was the one meant for him.</p> <p>But being more than just a lupus garou with a raging hard-on, he was a pack leader that needed some damned answers if he was to take her for his mate.</p><p>\u201cWe found your bag.\u201d Darien\u2019s voice sounded harsher than he intended.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes popped open.</p><p>He motioned to the tapestry bag sitting by the dresser. \u201cIt looked like you planned to stay for a while. That guy in the copper coat had taken it. Had his scent all over it, inside and out.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew big.</p><p>\u201cWhich means the guy had broken into your room when Uncle Sheridan and I were trying to get in. What kind of a pack leader would allow two of his females to run off? First your sister, now you? At least now I know his name is Bruin. Or maybe that\u2019s your cover. Maybe his name is really Leidolf.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth gaped, but she quickly clamped it shut.</p><p>That got a response. Although he wasn\u2019t sure what her response meant. \u201cAnd your parents are alive.\u201d</p><p>Darien wanted to send word to her pack concerning her whereabouts, and he wanted to set things straight with her sister\u2019s mate\u2014the honorable thing to do. Plus, this time he was getting the father\u2019s permission to take the woman for his mate. But he still didn\u2019t know who her pack leader really was, and he couldn\u2019t be sure that her pack was innocent when it came to the harm done to either Lelandi or her sister.</p><p>He folded his arms and leaned back into the recliner. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me the truth now?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>HOW IN THE WORLD HAD DARIEN LEARNED HER BROTHER\u2019S name? Lelandi was dying to ask, but she couldn\u2019t. Better to leave Darien confused about who her pack leader was. Did he know where Leidolf was living now? Maybe Silva would, if Lelandi could ask casually without arousing suspicion. Right.</p><p>Ignoring Darien, Lelandi pretended to sleep. More than ever, she had to avenge her sister\u2019s murder and leave. The longer she stayed, the higher the risk Bruin would locate her. Probably Darien would want to contact the leader and tell him what happened to her sister and Lelandi. Sense of honor. Then Bruin would force her to return home.</p><p>After a couple of hours, Darien left the room and thank god, for a change, he didn\u2019t post a guard inside. She climbed out of bed and paced. She had to discover if her parents were alive. But how was she going to do anything when he had her guarded always?</p><p>Footsteps raced up the stairs. \u201cAre you staying with her for a couple of hours?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Darien went with Jake and Tom to question the hospital staff,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>She slipped back into bed and pulled the covers to her chin.</p><p>Sam walked into the room, smiled at her, and shut the door. \u201cStill awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to sleep.\u201d At least she hoped so. After all the time she\u2019d spent lying on her back, the urge to run in her wolf form made her restless and irritable. She wanted to stretch her legs and take a run on the wild side, soon.</p><p>Darien finally went to bed, but was too angry to sleep. Unable to learn anything about who drugged the coffee at the hospital, he racked his brain for alternative solutions. At nearly two in the morning, he had to get some sleep, but he couldn\u2019t stop thinking of Lelandi. The way her nipple had firmed when his hand had brushed it. The way she barely breathed when he was removing the soiled bandages. The way she smiled when the salve tickled her skin, but tried to hide that she wasn\u2019t scowling at him even for a second. He could have woken Silva to have her change the bandages, but he had to see for himself that Lelandi\u2019s wounds were healing properly.</p><p>He shoved his arm underneath his head, his body craving the change. He wanted to take a run in the woods, the urge growing as the moon\u2019s appearance neared. A jaunt through the forest, hunting alone or with a few members of his pack, racing each other, the wind ruffling their fur, enjoying nature at its best.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Unable to visualize anything but Lelandi\u2019s gaze challenging him in his mind\u2019s eye, he tossed his covers aside and grabbed his jeans. The woman tormented his every waking hour no matter how much he tried to ignore his cravings.</p><p>He stalked into the guest bedroom, not sure what he had in mind, but when he saw the empty bed, he gave Jake a questioning glance. His brother motioned to the bathroom. The toilet flushed and the sink water ran for a few seconds, then shut off. When she appeared, she looked like the redheaded goddess of his dreams. The startled look on her face when she saw him standing in the bedroom, gaping at her, endeared him all the more.</p><p>Jake wore an amused expression and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLeave us, Jake,\u201d Darien said, without taking his eyes off her.</p><p>His brother cleared his throat and walked over to the door. \u201c\u2019Night all.\u201d He closed the door on his hasty retreat.</p><p>His shoulders straight, his bare chest muscles taut, Darien crossed the carpeted floor and joined Lelandi standing like a statue. She couldn\u2019t move from the spot, knowing he wanted her. She couldn\u2019t draw on the courage to shove him away, to stop the yearning she had for him.</p><p>He cupped her face and raised her lips to his. The flecks of gold in his dark brown eyes disappeared as they darkened to black. He leaned in, his eyes closed, and he pressed his lips against hers. Lightly, like the flutter of an eyelash against a cheek. She\u2019d never expected such a gentle touch to shatter her composure, but it did. His whisper-soft touch sent a message straight from her brain coursing to every part of her body. Take me, it shouted.</p><p>The only men she\u2019d ever allowed to kiss her were her family members, in a strictly family way. Yet she lusted for Darien like she never had for any man except for her fantasy lover. She wanted to strip off her clothes and ravish him. Every inch of her warmed, and if she\u2019d been wearing panties, they\u2019d be soaking wet now, guaranteed.</p><p>No, no, this is wrong. His tongue probed her mouth with a murmur of a touch. No, she couldn\u2019t let him in. If she did, she\u2019d give herself to him completely. She couldn\u2019t, not after what her sister had meant to him.</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him no, her hands gripping his arms to push him away, but she gave him the wrong signal. His tongue parted her lips further, penetrating her deeper. He pressed his body firmly against her, his erection hard against her waist, her back against the wall. His heart pounded with a thunderous beat as fast as hers, lulling her under his spell with a soothing rhythm, encouraging her to take part in the mating dance. She should have shoved him away, stopped this nonsense, made him realize she didn\u2019t want this. Not from him. Not from a gray. Her dead sister\u2019s mate.</p><p>So why the hell was she touching his tongue tentatively with her own? Bringing a smile to his smug lips? To his heavily lidded, lust-filled eyes? He hesitated for an instant, then delved deeper, intensifying the kiss, and she let him! Kissed him back even. Pressed her body harder against his erection, wanting to feel what she had done to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, no, damn it! He was feeling Larissa in his grasp, and Lelandi served as her sister reincarnated. Nothing more.</p><p>Despite the streaks of pleasure rifling her body, his hands shifting from her arms to her breasts, feeling the change in her nipples as they begged for more, the way her core ached for his penetration, she knew he didn\u2019t feel the same for her. She was not Larissa. She was Lelandi and not his to be had.</p><p>With the utmost reluctance, she pushed him away.</p> <p>He looked chagrined, his lips parting, his dark brows furrowing. Then he swore under his breath, shook his head, and guided her back to bed. Covering her with the comforter, he used a tender touch. He hesitated to leave, his eyes still clouded with desire, and then he turned and retired from the room. Left her unguarded. Well, sure there was a guard at the door, but...</p><p>Footsteps drew close. The door opened, and Jake gave her a smug smile while he buttoned his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m back. Thought I had the rest of the night off, but...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cDarien will be hell to live with in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She would be hell to live with in the morning if she couldn\u2019t quit thinking about what she wanted with her sister\u2019s mate and couldn\u2019t have it.</p><p>Darien couldn\u2019t believe how Lelandi stirred him up. How could he have given in to her so quickly, so completely?</p><p>She-devil.</p> <p>For an hour he tossed and turned, furious with himself for losing control. He should never have kissed her. But he couldn\u2019t get the kiss he\u2019d shared with her out of his mind either. Everything inside him felt alive again with her touch, and he craved having her, no matter how many times he told himself he couldn\u2019t until she was ready.</p><p>He ran his hands through his hair, more frustrated than ever. Until two pairs of footsteps headed in the direction of his bedroom, and he lifted his head off the pillow. Slow footsteps, deliberate, not hurried. If anyone wished to disturb him at this hour, it would have to be an emergency, and yet the footfall indicated otherwise. Like an assassin\u2019s sneaky attempt at slipping in undetected. He reached for his bedside drawer, opened it, and pulled out the gun.</p><p>The footsteps stopped at his door. Forever it seemed, as whoever they were contemplated what to do. He considered telling them to get on with whatever they were there for so he could take care of them. Then a slight tap sounded at the door. Before he could respond, the doorknob twisted, and Jake slowly pushed the door open. Lelandi stood in the doorway in Darien\u2019s flannel shirt, her red hair dangling past her hips, her eyes fixed, staring straight through him.</p><p>\u201cSleepwalking, like Tom when he\u2019s overly tired. Tom said she was talking in her sleep earlier. I wondered where she was going,\u201d Jake\u2019s voice was hushed. \u201cSo I allowed her to leave the guest room.\u201d</p><p>Darien slipped the gun back in the drawer. Lelandi walked slowly to the bed. The side he always slept on. All the moisture in his mouth evaporated. She lifted the covers.</p><p>He looked back at Jake, who shrugged. \u201cDoc said never to startle Tom when he\u2019s sleepwalking. Guess the same goes for Lelandi.\u201d</p> <p>Darien slid over so Lelandi could climb into bed. He pulled the covers to her chin, and she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGuess you have guard duty the rest of the morning.\u201d</p><p>A coy smile fixed to Jake\u2019s lips, and he shut the door on his way out.</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t remember much except jumping on Crassus\u2019s back when he readied his fist for Larissa\u2019s face again. And the pain when Crassus hit Lelandi in the head, and more pain when he jerked her arm behind her back. But she hadn\u2019t saved her sister and now she was dead. Tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p>But then he came as a wolf, distinguished, beautiful, his amber eyes studying her, his ears perked up. Her dream lover. Her silver knight. Her fantasy. Why could she see the whole of him as a wolf, but not as a human?</p><p>Changing from the wolf into his human form, he wrapped his arms around her, held her close, chased away the night terrors. Crassus\u2019s and Bruin\u2019s cruel, hard faces faded in the mist. The pain and suffering vanishing.</p><p>Her lover kissed her head, caressed her arm, her face, made her feel safe, protected, loved, but he didn\u2019t initiate anything deeper. He moved his lips lower, kissing her cheek and sweeping across to her mouth. She opened her lips to him, felt his body harden, pressing against hers, his tongue slipping inside her mouth, the feel of his heart pounding furiously against her chest, his hands stroking her hair, and she wanted him deep inside her, thrusting, claiming her. But he wouldn\u2019t make a move to take her.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d he whispered against her mouth, his voice husky.</p> <p>She moaned, separated her legs for him, and he slipped between them, his erection pressing at her mound. But still, he would not take her. His lips smiled against hers, but he slid out of her grasp and pulled her back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cSleep, vixen,\u201d he said, his voice hushed, his arms tightening around her in a bear hug of an embrace. And in the warmth of the cocoon he provided, the woodland world faded away.</p><p>Later that morning, Darien woke with his arms around Lelandi, her head on his chest, her breathing shallow, her silky red hair caressing his bare skin. God of thunder, how he wanted her, but not like this. Not when she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d gotten herself into. Hell, he\u2019d have to let everyone know now she walked in her sleep, if Jake hadn\u2019t warned them already.</p><p>Not wanting her to wake and find herself in his room, in his bed, and most of all, in his tight embrace, he carried her back to the guest bedroom, and nodded to Peter who would watch over her until she woke. Peter\u2019s brows rose so slightly, if Darien hadn\u2019t been observing him closely, he would have missed the subtle change in his expression.</p><p>At least the deputy wouldn\u2019t tell the world which bed Lelandi had slept in last night, although before long, she\u2019d be in his bed every night once he had his way. He kissed her cheek, then covered her with the eyelet comforter. Still not believing she was a sleepwalker like Tom, he headed down to the kitchen and greeted his brothers. \u201cMorning, Jake, Tom.\u201d</p><p>His beard even scruffier this morning, Jake flipped sausages and bacon in the frying pan and casually said, \u201cMorning, Darien. Trevor mentioned something about dream mating.\u201d</p><p>Tom glanced up from the toaster. \u201cMorning, Darien. Good sleep last night?\u201d He gave Jake a conspirator\u2019s look.</p><p>Darien grabbed the pot of coffee and poured himself a mug. \u201cSlept well enough.\u201d He would not rise to his brother\u2019s inquisitive nature. \u201cWhat does Trevor know about dream mating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe overheard Silva talking to Lelandi. She told her you were convinced Lelandi was your dream mate.\u201d</p><p>Serving up a plate of toast, Tom\u2019s mouth curved up. \u201cHot damn. The trait is inherited. Why didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><p>Jake snorted. \u201cWhat next?\u201d</p><p>Darien plucked toast from the plate. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo maybe about it. Dad had the ability and so did Granddad and two of our uncles.\u201d Tom beamed.</p><p>\u201cMeans Jake and I have a good chance at having the ability.\u201d</p><p>Jake set the platter of sausages and bacon on the kitchen table. \u201cDon\u2019t believe in soul mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur distant cousin, Devlyn, found his soul mate,\u201d Tom reminded him, lifting his refilled mug. \u201cAnd Bella\u2019s a red, too.\u201d</p><p>Darien would definitely have a word with Trevor. He\u2019d never said a thing to Darien last night about \u201cthat\u201d part of the conversation Silva and Lelandi had.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did Trevor say?\u201d</p><p>Jake gave Darien a small smile. Yeah, he knew Darien would give Trevor hell soon.</p><p>\u201cNothing else. In other news, that Chester McKinley wants a word with you when you can spare a moment.\u201d</p><p>Darien looked up from his eggs. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe assistant mayor of Green Valley, checking out our town so he can go back to his own and recommend changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he need to speak to me about? You know I don\u2019t have time to micromanage every little thing that goes on in Silver Town.\u201d</p><p>Jake poured himself another cup of coffee. \u201cHe says he runs a first-rate private eye operation and thought you might like to hear his advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what, Jake? Quit beating around the bush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Larissa and Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>Darien frowned. \u201cWhat does he think he knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d Jake took his seat and speared a slice of bacon. \u201cSaid he\u2019d talk to you about it though.\u201d</p><p>Tom grabbed three pieces of toast. \u201cUncle Sheridan said the guy is legit. He checked with the mayor of Green Valley already.\u201d</p><p>Darien swore their youngest brother could eat triple what they ate and still not gain an ounce. \u201cI\u2019ve got Uncle Sheridan and both of you checking things out. I\u2019d rather keep it in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever know when another mind or two can help give us a lead,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Darien ignored his brother\u2019s comment. All he needed was for the details of this mess to get out to other gray packs. \u201cAnything else I need to know about?\u201d Darien stabbed a sausage with his fork.</p><p>\u201cFall festival starts today. Are you going to open the ceremony like you did last year?\u201d</p><p>Darien gave Jake a dark look.</p><p>Jake\u2019s lips curved upward slightly. \u201cEveryone expects you to be there. But it\u2019s your call.\u201d</p><p>With everything else that had gone on, he\u2019d forgotten about it, and he wasn\u2019t interested. But running the town brought responsibilities he couldn\u2019t ignore. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve barely had time to supervise the factory since the shootings began. And I haven\u2019t had a chance to check in at the mine at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s running smoothly,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cBoth Jake and I have been keeping an eye on things.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s doing what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>Thank god he had brothers who could be counted on.</p><p>His eyes sparkling with humor, Jake cleared his throat. \u201cDo we need to inform everyone who serves guard duty about Lelandi\u2019s nighttime excursions?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tom\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cWhat exactly did I miss last night?\u201d</p><p>Darien swore Tom already knew, but wanted him to reveal more of the details. Which he wasn\u2019t about to do. He opened his mouth to speak, but Tom and Jake\u2019s attention switched to the entryway from the living room. Darien turned around and saw Lelandi, his long flannel shirt reaching thigh-high, her legs and feet bare, her hands locked as if in prayer.</p><p>His gaze shifted to her hair, the sensuous curls garnering his full attention. He was unable to tear his gaze away from the beauty of her silky tresses. Even more red than her sister\u2019s, less golden, more like the woman\u2019s in his dream. How could he have not realized she was the one? Because of the switched names and that Larissa had lied about the dreams, damn it.</p> <p>\u201cAhem.\u201d Jake said, breaking the spell.</p><p>She looked sweet, innocent, edible, her lips parting to speak. \u201cI smelled the food and thought if I ate something, I\u2019d feel more energetic.\u201d</p><p>Tom hurried to escort her to his side of the table. Jake got her a plate and piled it high with eggs and sausages. Darien stared at her rumpled, shiny hair. No matter how much he didn\u2019t want to show his feelings for the woman, he couldn\u2019t block the emotions. Already he was hard as a rock, and he shifted uncomfortably under the table.</p><p>Lelandi sat in the seat Tom pulled out for her, and then he returned with a mug in hand, the coffeepot in the other. \u201cBlack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCream and sugar,\u201d she said, her voice so demure, Darien suspected something was brewing in that pretty head of hers, and he bet he wouldn\u2019t like it.</p> <p>\u201cI want to go to the fair.\u201d</p><p>Not expecting that, Darien sat back hard against his chair. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>She furrowed her brow at him. \u201cI feel one-hundred percent better, and I want to get out. I told you I\u2019d be ready to run laps today.\u201d</p><p>Tom grinned and saluted her with his coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cNot after all that\u2019s happened to you,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cThat guy in the copper coat is still running loose,\u201dJake reminded them. \u201cMason thought he saw him running near here as a wolf last night.\u201d</p> <p>Darien frowned. \u201cThe answer is no. You\u2019ll stay here and continue to recuperate.\u201d</p><p>Sam called out from the foyer. \u201cEveryone decent?\u201d</p><p>Even Darien managed a small smile at the comment, although he was trying to maintain his hard line with Lelandi.</p><p>Sam stalked into the kitchen and cast Lelandi a broad smile. \u201cYou\u2019re looking good.\u201d He handed Darien a stack of mail. \u201cIs Silva around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpstairs sleeping in my bed,\u201d Jake said. Sam looked a little bothered. Jake added, \u201cWe\u2019re playing musical beds. I had last guard duty. She slept in my bed while I was pulling duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I need her for the big opening ceremony. Free sodas for the first fifty customers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst bedroom on the right,\u201d Jake said. \u201cWe woke her and made her move six times last night. I don\u2019t want to disturb her again, so be my guest.\u201d</p><p>Sam hesitated.</p> <p>Lelandi stood. \u201cI\u2019ll get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam can. Eat and get your strength back.\u201d Darien lifted one of the envelopes off the table and frowned.</p><p>Lelandi plopped back down on the chair. \u201cFor what?</p><p>So I can stay here and watch soaps all day? You won\u2019t even let me go to the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could help Silva and me hand out the free sodas,\u201d Sam offered. \u201cWe\u2019d watch over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, that would be fun.\u201d Lelandi cut up her sausage.</p><p>\u201cI can serve drinks in between Silva and Sam. You wouldn\u2019t have to post a guard for me for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be set up?\u201d Darien asked Sam, then lifted the envelope to his nose and breathed in deeply. His heart nearly exploded when he smelled Larissa\u2019s scent on it.</p><p>\u201cThe tavern. I can make sure only the front door is accessible. Lelandi can stay behind the bar with me.\u201d</p><p>Looking for a return address, Darien flipped the envelope over. None. He glanced up at Jake, who was watching Darien with concern. \u201cAll right. I want a guard on the place just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMitchell will do it,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s face brightened and Darien hoped to hell he wasn\u2019t putting her in any more danger. But seeing her expression, he figured she\u2019d feel better and heal faster if she got out of confinement for a while. He considered the envelope again, typewritten, so no clue there. But the postmark indicated it had been mailed from Wildhaven.</p><p>\u201cAnything wrong, Darien?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cTom, get me a map of Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d Tom cast a questioning glance at Jake, missing out on what was going on.</p><p>\u201cIf you hear screaming and things being tossed about, you\u2019ll know Silva wasn\u2019t happy I woke her.\u201d Sam grinned and then headed out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter? He should have come down with you when you joined us,\u201d Darien said to Lelandi, his voice dark.</p><p>Lelandi shrugged and waved for Jake to get her some more coffee.</p><p>As much as Jake had acted annoyed with her, Darien was surprised to see his lips lift slightly, while he refilled her coffee mug. For being such a petite little thing, she sure had everyone wrapped around her will.</p><p>\u201cPoor deputy was bone tired,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>Jake gave her the coffee and headed for the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi frowned at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be too rough on Peter. You\u2019re overworking him.\u201d</p><p>But Jake just stormed out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to that McKinley fellow and tell him you\u2019re too busy to see him, Darien,\u201d Tom said, returning with the map, but waited while Darien looked up the cities listed in the index. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Darien looked up at Lelandi. \u201cI got a letter postmarked Wildhaven. I wondered where it was and who might have sent the correspondence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWildhaven? Never heard of it,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>But Lelandi looked peeked. She glanced at the envelope and dropped her fork on the table.</p><p>Darien seized his knife, slipped it underneath the envelope flap, and ripped.</p><p>Jake rejoined them. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Peter.\u201d His gaze switched to the envelope and the map spread over the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Pulling the letter out, Darien barely breathed. The paper was hers\u2014a light rose color, her scent, her handwriting. \u201cLarissa,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>Dearest Darien,</p><p>If you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m no longer of this world, and I regret I\u2019ve brought you so much sorrow. I beg your forgiveness for lying about my family, about saying I had dream mated with you.I wasn\u2019t your soul mate, but I wanted to care for you like you desired me, a love I didn\u2019t have in my first mating. I wished with all my heart to be who you thought I was. When I found the right man, it was too late for me to take back what I\u2019ddone to you. Now, all that matters is that you know the truth. My sister came into her first wolf\u2019s heat after she was dream mated. Since you think it was me, I believe you\u2019d truly seen my sister. Ask her, Darien. Don\u2019t lose your true soul mate for what I\u2019ve done. My sister will seek you out to avenge my death, and I plead with you with all my heart, if you ever loved me, you will protect her. She doesn\u2019t think she needs your protection or anyone else\u2019s, but she\u2019ll be in grave danger as soon as I\u2019m dead.</p><p>Whatever you do, do not turn her away. She had nothing to do with what happened between you and me, but I have harmed her greatly with what I have done. If nothing else, I pray you will protect her for my failings. I craved to be her, free, unattached, until you took me in. But now she\u2019ll pay for my crime if you don\u2019t help her.</p><p>Love me in death as you did in life by taking care of my blood, my sister, Lelandi.</p><p>Your mate, Larissa.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>DARIEN STARED AT LARISSA\u2019S LETTER IN DISBELIEF, HIS whole body numb. He reread the note, trying to fathom the hidden meaning of her message.</p><p>He rose from his chair and walked out of the dining room. How could he have been so blind? The woman he\u2019d mated had loved another? Who? He\u2019d kill him.</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t remember walking into his office, or sitting at his desk. He stared at the letter, and then clenching it, he hollered, \u201cJake!\u201d</p><p>Jake entered the office, a look of confusion crossing his face.</p><p>\u201cGet Lelandi in here, now.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s brows raised, he quickly nodded, then closed the door.</p><p>Tom entered a minute later, his eyes wide. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Darien? Jake says you\u2019re ready to kill someone.</p><p>Want me to sit in on the little talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>His neck muscles tightening, Tom gave a brief nod.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the boss.\u201d</p><p>Jake ushered Lelandi into the room. She looked pale and her eyes quickly shifted from Darien to the floor.</p><p>Darien motioned to the love seat in his office, then gave his brothers a look that meant one thing. Get outand stay out! Although he had no doubt they would loiter beyond his office door in case things got out of hand.</p><p>They both glanced at Lelandi as she took a seat, looking like they wanted to rescue her, then finally obliged by leaving the room and shutting the door.</p><p>Folding his arms across his chest, Darien tried to settle the fury in his blood before he spoke. \u201cTell me about Wildhaven, Bruin, your parents, the whole deal.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her teeth and glowered at him.</p><p>\u201cWildhaven\u2019s my family\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the name of a town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my family\u2019s name,\u201d she reiterated, indignant.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re a pack leader\u2019s daughter? The Wildhavens settled the area? And both you and Larissa disobeyed him? Terrific. Then tell me about your family. All of it.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi pulled the shirt lower, which drew his gaze to her bare legs. Instantly, he wanted to take her, confirm that she was indeed the one of his dreams, his soul mate. But her soft voice penetrated his lust-filled thoughts. She looked at the letter in his hands, then tilted her chin up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy father was a pack leader when I was a child but his people had died in flooding and mudslides that wiped out his town. A few, who were not relatives, took off to join other packs. Father was devastated, living like a mountain man for ten years with my mother, brother, sister, and me, until he felt the call of the pack and joined my mother\u2019s reds. She was the pack leader\u2019s daughter, and had fallen in love with my father at first sight. She tried to heal his inner self after the tragedy had struck his pack while we lived amongst her reds. But when her father died, a new and ruthless leader took over. Most of her pack fled, and Bruin\u2019s flourished. Father had been injured in the mudslide, a spinal injury, the kind that can permanently damage a lupus garou. And so he was confined to a wheelchair. He couldn\u2019t fight for the pack, but he stubbornly refused leaving the land that was his ancestors\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a born leader is hard to give up,\u201d Darien said, the fury quieting in his blood. But he couldn\u2019t believe how her father would have cared more about the land than his own family.</p><p>\u201cHe challenged the leader, yet couldn\u2019t lead. The natural disaster in his town hadn\u2019t been his fault, yet until he died, he blamed himself. The pack leader\u2019s brother wanted either my sister or me for a mate. We were descendents of the first leader lines of Wildhaven, and since our pack leader, Bruin, was already mated, his brother took Larissa for his own. Bruin figured it would get my father in line if he gave up one of his daughters. My father assumed my sister was the best choice because she was a lot more... even-tempered than me. He feared if Crassus bullied me, I\u2019d attempt to kill him. And I tried, once.\u201d</p> <p>Darien opened his mouth to speak, but she shook her head. \u201cIt was a foolhardy venture. Do you and your brothers have a... well, a connection?\u201d</p><p>Darien frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could sense when Larissa\u2019s emotions were out of control. When she was angry, or hurt, when she was terrified. We shared the ability to detect extreme emotions in the other. Every time Crassus beat her, if she was within a fifty-mile radius of where I was, I knew. Can you imagine knowing someone is beating your sibling half to death, and you can do nothing to stop him?\u201d</p><p>Thor almighty, and he\u2019d considered sending her back to her pack? He\u2019d kill the bastard first. \u201cLelandi\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour times, I allowed it. I told my father, but he could only speak to Bruin, who denied his brother\u2019s cruelty. The fifth time I felt my sister\u2019s pain, her emotions running from sheer terror to hating the bastard, I couldn\u2019t allow it to go on any longer. But I wasn\u2019t prepared to face him. I barged into their home and found my sister\u2019s face bruised and battered. Sobbing, she looked up at me, her eyes filled with pain and horror. Horror because I\u2019d be next to suffer the brute\u2019s beatings. Jumping onto the bastard\u2019s back when he took another swing at her, I yanked at his long hair and reached around and gouged his face. I tried to strangle him. But I don\u2019t remember what happened afterward. A few days later, I woke to find myself at home in bed with a concussion, a broken arm, and collarbone.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her eyes to Darien, but they weren\u2019t filled with tears as he\u2019d expected. Hatred burned brightly in the jade gems. And he couldn\u2019t blame her. His blood craved revenge. No lupus garou would ever touch a woman like that in his pack and get away with it. She looked so vulnerable he wanted to pull her into his arms, and for a minute, he hesitated. If he attempted to console her, he feared she\u2019d quit talking. And he needed to hear her whole story.</p><p>Hell, he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her and not do something. He rose from his chair, and she looked ready to bolt. With a couple of lengthy strides, he crossed the floor and took her hand, then sat down beside her.</p><p>He wanted to embrace her hard, give her his strength because she looked so peaked, but her back remained rigid. He sat beside her on the leather love seat, opting to hold her hand instead.</p><p>\u201cTell me all of it, Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have suffered such cruelty at the hands of the beast. Crassus told me if my sister died, he\u2019d take me for his own. I didn\u2019t perceive the threat lightly. But my father didn\u2019t believe Crassus would kill Larissa to have me.\u201d She pulled away from Darien, her eyes sad as her gaze dropped to the floor. \u201cFor a couple of weeks, my sister seemed to tolerate the forced marriage. I think Bruin had told him to lay off because I was a witness, and he\u2019d pummeled me so badly also. Like a sickness he couldn\u2019t control, Crassus beat her again a week later, and she told me she had to find herself.\u201d</p><p>Darien swore softly under his breath. He had meant to tell her pack where she was as a goodwill gesture, but now he had every intention of crushing the brute who\u2019d made the women suffer.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I asked what she meant, she said, \u2018You know, get a hobby or something.\u2019 She meant to run away. I didn\u2019t realize that until she\u2019d been gone several weeks. Crassus hid the fact she\u2019d run away, probably figuring he\u2019d find her before anybody knew she had left him for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you again, Lelandi. I promise. But if Bruin was your pack leader and Crassus was Larissa\u2019s mate, who\u2019s Leidolf?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMy brother. How did you learn about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeputy Sheriff Smith from Green Valley said your leader was looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeidolf\u2019s a pack leader? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortland, Oregon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t know who the hell he was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019ll want me to join his pack.\u201d</p><p>Darien leaned back into the love seat. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and toyed with the hem of the shirt, her fingers skimming her bare skin. \u201cYou might as well hear everything I\u2019ve got to say about my pack. Bruin kept his pack in line and didn\u2019t tolerate any rebellion. I feared he\u2019d seek revenge against the rest of us when Larissa ran away. Then my father and mother died in a fiery car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little hmpf. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you received flowers from your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s sick joke. Bruin kept me under guard, stating he would declare Larissa dead and have me mated to his brother. I received the letters from Larissa, one for me, and the other for you, and escaped the night before I was to be mated with Crassus, dropping the letter for you at the post office on my way out of Wildhaven.\u201d</p><p>Darien threw Larissa\u2019s letter to him onto the coffee table. Lelandi\u2019s eyes lit on it. \u201cWhy the charade? Why did she claim to be you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was mated; I was not. She probably thought if she took my identity, no one would find out who she was, but if they did, they would discover Lelandi wasn\u2019t mated. But she fell in love. You were obviously good to her when Crassus wasn\u2019t. She wanted what others had, what our parents had had.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in love with me. No bond existed between us. Now she\u2019s dragged you into this mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing my sister, she probably thought you\u2019d want me like you wanted her. Then you could take care of me, and I\u2019d be good for you.\u201d Lelandi shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what I figure anyway. She was more of a dreamer than me. I tend to be totally realistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. So you\u2019re saying you and your sister didn\u2019t cook this whole scheme up so you could be my newest mate.\u201d After all that her sister had pulled, he didn\u2019t know what to really think.</p><p>Lelandi stood up from the couch so suddenly she wavered a minute, but then her eyes glowed with fury and her face flushed. \u201cYou may think all women are after you, Darien Silver, you... you arrogant bastard. But I have no desire to mate with you or any other gray.\u201d</p><p>She turned and stormed toward the door. Yanking it open, she gasped to see his brothers in the doorway, then shoved past them.</p><p>\u201cWatch her, Tom.\u201d Darien motioned for Jake to come in, grabbed the letter, and walked back to his desk.</p><p>Sitting in his chair, Darien still couldn\u2019t believe his mate had been the daughter of leaders on both her mother\u2019s and father\u2019s sides of the family, a rare and highly prized quality in a mate. Which made him wonder why one of the pack members hadn\u2019t already claimed Lelandi. He also considered the despicable possibility that the sisters\u2019 parents had been murdered. One thing he knew, Lelandi wouldn\u2019t be safe until he figured out who killed his mate. And Lelandi was his whether she believed she was his soul mate now or not. Plus, he would deal with this Crassus sooner or later. The bastard would come for Lelandi, if he assumed she\u2019d be his mate. The red was a walking dead man. His pack leader brother, too, if he interfered.</p><p>Darien let out his breath in exasperation. \u201cDid you check into the factory\u2019s accounts, Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, like you suspected. Larissa was siphoning off money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo pay a blackmailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>Jake pulled out a notepad and flipped to a page. \u201cNine-hundred and fifty-two dollars the first month.</p><p>Tried to make it look like a strange amount to fit in with some of the purchases for supplies in the tanning processes. A thousand, sixty-five the next month. Went up to eleven-hundred and some change. Each month it went up, until her death, and then the withdrawals stopped. Hosstene said your name was on the checks so she never considered anything was wrong with them.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head.</p><p>\u201cCan I see the letter?\u201d</p><p>After passing it to his brother, he watched as Jake read it slowly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s just a matchmaking venture?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat with the attempts on Lelandi\u2019s life? Nope.</p><p>Then we have the stalker in the copper-hooded jacket to consider. The blackmailer won\u2019t want to get caught. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Find out if anyone had been getting some extra monthly pocket money.

Instead, he found her quietly sitting on the couch, staring at the coffee table. Which worried him more than when she was misbehaving.</p><p>Darien crouched in front of Lelandi, trying to use his most persuasive tone of voice. \u201cWho is he?\u201d</p> <p>She looked up at him, eyes glaring. \u201cHe\u2019s my mate.\u201d</p><p>Swearing under his breath, Darien rose to his full height. \u201cDoc examined you and found you\u2019re a virgin, so try another story.\u201d</p><p>Sam and Darien\u2019s brothers chuckled, but Lelandi\u2019s cheeks grew sunburn red. \u201cWho the hell gave him permission to examine me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc doesn\u2019t need permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou arrogant bastard! You thought I wanted you and so you made sure I was available?\u201d she screamed at him.</p><p>Everyone was deathly quiet. How could one little woman change the whole scenario around so that he was defending himself now?</p><p>\u201cLike hell I did,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWell, sorry if I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d She rose from the couch, shoved him out of the way, and headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get dressed!\u201d</p><p>Darien stalked after her. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me who the guy is who accosted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk him, if he comes out of the coma your men put him into!\u201d She stomped up the stairs.</p><p>Blowing out his breath, he stomped up the stairs after her and followed her into the guest bedroom.</p><p>Lelandi stiffened her back, whipped around, and glared at Darien.</p><p>For a moment, it was a standoff, Darien standing in the doorway, face red with barely repressed anger, and Lelandi\u2019s feelings just as hot. Then he closed the door and a trickle of fear ran through her veins.</p><p>He had the look of a feral wolf\u2014angered, cornered, only she was the one he was backing into a corner when he stalked across the carpeted floor in her direction.</p><p>His eyes darkened, his gaze intent, determined.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you who he is no matter how much you try to intimidate me.\u201d</p><p>His grim lips almost seemed to smile, but they didn\u2019t exactly either. She wouldn\u2019t give in to him though. The powerful gray pack leader had a lot to learn about a stubborn red female.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d she growled as soon as he invaded her personal space.</p><p>He grabbed her shoulders, watched her expression intently. Did she look as terrified as she felt? Or did she put on a good enough show to hide the way her insides shook?</p><p>She knew what he wanted, what she assumed he\u2019d craved the first time he saw her, to touch her, to kiss her, to love her\u2014but not her, damn it. Rather, her sister.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me.\u201d She meant to speak firmly, angrily, but the words came out breathlessly, almost desperate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mated, Lelandi.\u201d His thumbs kneaded her shoulders in a sensuous caress, his fingers still gripping her. He leaned over and nuzzled her cheek with his smooth face. \u201cLarissa was mated, wrongly, but still mated, and she was not the one I dreamed of loving under the pale light of the moon, naked in the woods.\u201d</p><p>The feel of his heated skin against hers set her blood on fire, but the realization he made love to her sister, calling her by the same name...</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me,\u201d he whispered against her ear, his breath warm, his tongue tickling the sensitive lobe. \u201cTell me about your dreams.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>LELANDI MEANT TO SHOVE DARIEN AWAY, BUT SHE TOUCHED his waist tentatively instead, wanting to rip off his shirt and run her fingers over his bare chest, his face, to caress every inch of him while he touched her\u2014just like the man had done with her in her fantasy world. She wanted to be sure he really wasn\u2019t the man in her dreams.</p><p>Yet liquid heat pooled between her legs and fire filled her belly. No lupus garou had ever smiled so sexy-like; none had ever set her blood afire like he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d She meant to tell him it wasn\u2019t right. He didn\u2019t really want her, just wanted to recapture the love he\u2019d lost with her sister.</p><p>But he covered her mouth with his and stopped her objections. Kissed her\u2014like she was the last woman on earth and he\u2019d been deprived for years\u2014greedily, hungrily, unabashedly.</p><p>Her heartbeat quickened. Now that she was no longer in pain or on medication that dulled her senses, she recognized the feel of him, the firmness, strength, the subtle way he touched her, claimed her, only it was so much more real. The beating of his heart sounded in her ears, the heat of his body burned at her soul, she tasted the sweetness of his lips, smelled the musky scent of him. He was her lover, his face no longer hidden in the shadows of her dreams, but genuine, his expression filled with hope and sexual craving.</p><p>Touching his tongue to the seam of her mouth, then penetrating, exploring, teasing her tongue with his, he pressed his advantage. And she let him, cherished the feel, but couldn\u2019t give in to the lust. His fingers roamed over her arms, tracing the skin, sending trails of tiny caressing sensations up and down, while her fingers remained cemented to his waist. She was afraid to touch him further, afraid to lead him on when she knew what they were doing was wrong and no good would come of it. Bruin and Crassus, her brother even, would not permit the union between the gray and her.</p><p>He maneuvered her away from the wall toward the bed. Not good, yet she didn\u2019t want to stop him. Her reluctance to encourage him didn\u2019t seem to faze him. He kissed her jaw, then swept his tantalizing mouth down her neck, licking a trail to the hollow of her throat.</p><p>She melted. Not being able to stand, she collapsed on her butt on the bed. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>He pushed her knees apart making her feel vulnerable, exposed to his desires. He moved between her legs and reached for the first button on her shirt, but she seized his wrists.</p><p>\u201cI want to make sure you\u2019re healed, Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said, still holding tight, having to stop this madness.</p><p>He smiled and the look was pure devil. \u201cFor what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI meant, I was healed. That\u2019s all. You don\u2019t have to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor\u2019s orders.\u201d The devilish gleam intensified in his darkened eyes.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t this Bruin select a mate for you earlier?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hands free and finished unbuttoning the shirt, then slipped it off her shoulders.</p><p>His gaze focused on her nudity, an appreciative gleam in his eyes, and her skin flushed. \u201cI told you. He thought my temper was too volatile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d Darien pushed her back against the mattress. Straddling her leg with his, he leaned against her, his arousal hard against her thigh as his finger outlined the tip of her breast, then the other.</p><p>Her body tingled, her nubs peaking to the barest of his touches, and a moan welled up from deep within her throat. She couldn\u2019t fight the attraction she had for him even if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth. You\u2019d never come into a wolf\u2019s heat, had you? Not until we mated in our dreams. Not until you became mine. Come to me, Lelandi, like you do in my dreams.\u201d Darien kissed her forehead and waited, watching to see her reaction.</p><p>She studied his heavily lidded eyes, the look of lust filling them. \u201cIt was only a dream,\u201d she insisted. \u201cBut Larissa knew I\u2019d had the dreams of... of a man who was Adonis reborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdonis?\u201d He gave her a wicked smile.</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks like me.\u201d He unbuttoned his shirt, leaving it hanging open.</p><p>She looked at his chest, and yes, the corded muscles, the smattering of dark hair stretching down to his waistband, the bronze skin that took her breath away whenever she spied him in the woods of her dreams... She wanted to reach out to touch him, to feel his skin sizzling beneath her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me we\u2019ve been dream mated?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted to his eyes. \u201cI never saw his face.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, cupped her face, and thought for a moment. \u201cAh. Because I\u2019m the one who has the gift. But you pick up on some of it because you\u2019re my soul mate.\u201d He pressed her hands firmly against his chest. \u201cDo you remember the beating of my heart? The way I feel? The way my mouth feels against yours? Lelandi, you were always the one. The first time I came to you, someone had called your name and in your dream state you had mouthed your name, trying to make sense of it, unable to wake fully. You said your name against my mouth again. But I could never learn your last name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was the one. So why was she still reluctant to give herself to him? Her sister. She couldn\u2019t break free of the notion her sister had meant something to him.</p><p>He pulled Lelandi from the bed into his embrace and held her tight. \u201cWhat I\u2019d had with Larissa didn\u2019t feel right, but she\u2019d told me she didn\u2019t have any family. And she used the name I knew you by. I assumed the dreams I shared with you were fantasy and making love with you in the flesh wasn\u2019t supposed to be as erotic.\u201d</p><p>Her sister had lied. She\u2019d duped him and... and he hadn\u2019t meant anything to her as Lelandi had feared.</p><p>She touched his chest with trembling fingers, wanting what he offered, the sexual connection she\u2019d shared with him upon sleeping, but afraid, too, of the consequences.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s... there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d give you up for anything in the world, Lelandi. You\u2019re the one I\u2019ve searched for every night, longing to be reunited with you. The one who haunts my dreams until we\u2019re together again. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Right or wrong, she pressed her lips against his, giving herself willingly to him and was immediately transported to the dream. Except it was no longer a dream. This time he captivated all of her senses. His sexual pheromones filled her nostrils like an aphrodisiac, his essence overwhelming her senses.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back,\u201d she repeated, her voice soft, worried.</p><p>She\u2019d defy her pack and her family\u2019s wishes. But she wouldn\u2019t be like Larissa. Her mating would be final, like it was for other lupus garous. No other would come between them.</p><p>He stroked her hair with loving caresses. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t come into a wolf\u2019s heat until I reached out to you. You are mine.\u201d</p><p>Like a feral wolf who caught his prey and claimed her, he kissed her greedily, possessively. No more gentleness, waiting to make sure she agreed. And she loved it. His hands tangled in her long hair, and he grabbed handfuls, his smoldering gaze raking over her nakedness. But she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off his face, the chiseled features, the predatory look, the face she\u2019d so wanted to see, but couldn\u2019t in her dreams.</p><p>Releasing her hair, he slid his hands down her shoulders to her breasts, his palms massaging them. His thumbs caressed her nipples, teasing them to beg for more. His tongue plunged into her mouth, melting any denial she might have that he was the one. Tremulous shivers of pleasure sizzled across her bare skin. His rigid erection pressed against her waist, urgent, hungry to batter down her virginal barrier.</p><p>She maneuvered around him so that his back was to the bed, then using his shirt to hold him hostage, she pushed him onto the mattress. His mouth curved up and his eyes sparkled with dark delight. She pressed his legs apart and moved in between them. This time she was in charge, uninhibited like in her dreams.</p><p>Intending to work up nice and slow and torture him, she already craved flopping on her back and letting him take her. So much for her wanting to be in charge. She reached down to unfasten his belt, and he folded his arms behind his head and watched her struggle. But she couldn\u2019t unhook the belt no matter how much she tried. Finally, he chuckled low, quickly stripped, then pulled her on top of him, bare skin to bare skin.</p><p>He was gorgeous\u2014every buff, corded muscle tensed in anticipation. The smattering of dark hair covering his chest trailed down toward the curly hairs between his legs, and she considered the way his erection was already ramrod stiff, thick and readied, poking her in the belly. This was the way she remembered him in the pale light of the moon, the look and feel of his hard muscles, the touch of his soft skin, the way his nipples pebbled with her mouth and tongue grazing them. He swept his hands down her arms, sending a rush of tingling straight to her core, a thousand times more pleasurable than in the dreams.</p><p>She ran her fingers over the muscles in his chest, and his arousal jumped. She smiled and looked up at his face, his eyes glazed over, his lips curving up slightly. She shifted, straddling him, her knees bent, spreading them outward, wanting to capture the pike poking between her legs. Hot and wet and way past ready.</p><p>He groaned and rolled her onto her back, then leaned against her. She loved it when he took charge. He was like her dream lover, but the feelings were richer, his touch more arousing, every sense on high alert as she smelled his sexual desire, heard his heart pumping pell mell, and felt his aroused breath against her cheek. Pure eroticism stoked every nerve ending.</p><p>Clutching handfuls of his shoulder-length hair, she arched her pelvis against him, seeking gratification, her body screaming with unfulfilled need. Responding to her, he rubbed his heavy groin against her folds and elicited a soft, deep-throated moan from her.</p><p>But he refused to enter her yet. Instead, he smiled and flicked his tongue against her sensitive nipple, his gaze focused back on hers. She bucked against him, wanting him to enter her, to make her his mate, to complete the bond that would last forever. But he wouldn\u2019t hurry no matter how much she desired him to, and instead, swept his fingers down her waist, then lifted his body off her slightly, touching the erotic zone at the apex of her thighs. He stroked her hard and fast, and she could barely take the delicious pleasure of his touch. Slipping his fingers lower, he inserted them deeply inside her.</p><p>Hoarsely, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re wet for me.\u201d</p><p>She bit his shoulder with a mock nip, and he thrust his head back and laughed. Of course she was wet. As soon as he\u2019d advanced toward her in the bedroom with that hungry, feral look in his eyes, the moisture had gathered between her legs.</p><p>He thrust his fingers deep inside her, simulating what he would do with his engorged erection, soon, she hoped as he wrung out every emotion, pumping up her craving, just a thread short of completion. Then her internal muscles convulsed with orgasm and a wave of heat surged through her. His fingers stilled inside her, he gave her a satisfied smile.</p> <p>Oh heavens, she\u2019d come with just his fingers inside her. Sweet passion spiraled through her and with a soft moan, she called out his name, loving that she could now say it, no longer silenced like in the dream.</p><p>Darien\u2019s expression filled with deep satisfaction, and she loved seeing how much he enjoyed giving her pleasure. But they weren\u2019t done, not until they\u2019d truly mated.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d he whispered in her ear, \u201cyou know me. And now, it\u2019s my turn.\u201d His eyes held a roguish gleam. And she was ready.</p><p>God of thunder, Lelandi was beautiful. Darien wanted to laugh when she took charge, then quickly ceded, melting to his strokes. And now he had her where he desired her, the vixen.</p><p>For the first time, he wanted to go slow and control the outcome, not wishing to hurt her when he broke through her barrier. He spread her thighs wide and entered her carefully, stretching her to accept his engorged erection.</p><p>\u201cYou... are... huge.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but slowed his penetration. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was supposed to be in charge.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his voice drenched in lust. \u201cYou were taking too long,\u201d he rasped, then paused to take her nipple between his teeth, scraping gently.</p><p>Her inner muscles clenched him tightly, but he gently pushed forward. For a moment he paused, then he watched her face, flushed with arousal, and with a sudden thrust, he breached the maidenhead. She opened her eyes and he worried he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked again, caressing her cheek with his thumb.</p><p>Her muscles clenched again, and she nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve... I\u2019ve never felt anything like this... not even in the dreams.\u201d</p><p>He gave a wolfish grin and brushed her hair away from her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it. Not when you were a virgin.\u201d</p><p>With slow, deep thrusts, he plunged into her over and over again, loving every inch of his dream mate in the flesh. She was his, now and forever.</p><p>Lelandi couldn\u2019t catch her breath as Darien pushed her toward the peak. Julia Wildthorn was right. Sex with a lupus garou who was your soul mate was nothing short of miraculous.</p><p>Darien\u2019s heated gaze swept over her again, his body desiring her with an urgency she felt, too, and she wanted to heighten the pleasure as her body shouted to reach climax again. But he pinned her shoulders down, claiming her, possessing her, making her his for as long as they both lived. She loved what being lupus garou meant\u2014the intensity of the lovemaking, the unbreakable bond between them, stronger even than the familial one, the craving so great, it couldn\u2019t be denied.</p><p>\u201cThor almighty,\u201d Darien groaned, filling her womb with his hot seed, spasms of orgasm rocking her body, washing through her like a rogue tidal wave. For a moment, he lay heavily against her, his and her breathing hard, their hearts pumping at breakneck speed. \u201cLife will never be the same,\u201d he said, huskily, trying to lift his weight from her, but she held on tight. \u201cI\u2019ll crush you.\u201d His eyes smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good against me, I don\u2019t want you to ever let go.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and let out a tired breath. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you knew where you belonged.\u201d</p><p>She bit him on the shoulder, hard this time. He laughed and moved off her, then pulled her on top of him and caressed her waist with a gentle sweeping touch. She cherished the way he could be so loving.</p><p>But then he was back to business. \u201cWhat did you talk about with Silva last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Trevor tell you everything?\u201d Lelandi asked, feeling peeved.</p><p>They were supposed to cuddle for a while, luxuriate in the feel of one another, the bond they\u2019d just created. She realized tangling with a pack leader meant business was a heartbeat away.</p><p>Darien could see convincing Lelandi that as soul mates there would be no secrets between them, he would have to wear her down on that issue, too. But as much as he wanted to hold her tight and enjoy her heated little body, he had to protect her from harm. That meant knowing all he could about Lelandi and her sister. \u201cI\u2019d rather hear it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. Must have been the medicine.\u201d</p><p>Darien humpfed under his breath. \u201cGuess you\u2019re as good a liar as your sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lelandi gave him a half smile and licked Darien\u2019s nipple.</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to come out fighting. He was quickly learning she was like her sister\u2014totally unpredictable. It sure as hell kept him on the edge of his seat.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to miss the opening ceremony,\u201d Jake said downstairs in the living room, loudly enough for Darien and Lelandi to hear.</p> <p>\u201cConsidering the importance of what he\u2019s doing, don\u2019t you think this takes priority over the fair?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, he won\u2019t be so grouchy anymore,\u201d</p><p>Jake added.</p><p>Tom laughed.</p><p>Glancing up at the canopy over the bed, Darien rolled his eyes.</p> <p>Lelandi kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure Sam\u2019s waiting for me to go with him to serve drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather keep you here with me for the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it... was it better for you than in the dreams?\u201d</p><p>He twisted a curl of her hair around his finger. \u201cYou have to ask? I can\u2019t begin to describe how it made me feel, like a joining of our souls, the consummation of a lifelong search, the dream I\u2019ve been trying to make real for months.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. \u201cThe same for me. Only I thought you\u2019d be less\u2014big.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThe real thing feels more...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at the opening ceremony,\u201d Tom hollered, and slammed the front door.</p><p>Darien groaned. \u201cGot to go. But we\u2019re leaving the festivities early so we can return here. Sure you don\u2019t want to stay here until I return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, you\u2019ve promised to let me out of confinement, and I\u2019m going to the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to keep you safe, Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be safe, and thinking about the festivities after the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Darien rose from the bed and looked down at Lelandi\u2019s nakedness. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Absolutely god sent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not half-bad yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdonis, remember?\u201d he said grinning.</p><p>\u201cI hear them stirring, Sam,\u201d Jake said. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t hurry, you can take Silva to the tavern, and I\u2019ll bring Lelandi later. Unless Darien has decided to skip the opening ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head and dressed while Lelandi watched. Her eyes held his hostage and he growled.\u201cCome back early, vixen.\u201d Then he gave her body another long look of approval, groaned, and shut the door on his departure.</p><p>The smoldering gaze in Darien\u2019s eyes made her want to tackle him and return him to bed, forget about the fair or her freedom for a few hours.</p><p>Silva soon joined her, her face unreadable, although Lelandi thought something was wrong. Then Silva said, \u201cDarien must have woken on the wrong side of the bed again. First, he ordered Jake to take Peter to task for sleeping on guard duty. Then Darien told me I had to give you a more decent shirt than what I bought you to wear.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with what you were wearing.\u201d She gave a sly smile. \u201cBut I guess he doesn\u2019t want the rest of the guys to see. I really can\u2019t believe he\u2019s letting you out of the house to work with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s feeling better now. I guess he trusts Sam to keep a good eye on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will.\u201d The look Silva gave and the way she said the words was a warning. Don\u2019t plan on slipping away.</p><p>Lelandi pulled a cashmere sweater out of her bag.</p><p>\u201cHe found my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Silva stared at the bag. \u201cWho had it?\u201d She walked over to it and smelled it. \u201cThe guy in the copper coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells like several grays.\u201d Lelandi finished dressing.</p><p>\u201cEven Sheriff Sheridan\u2019s paws have been on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be. He\u2019s the sheriff. Ready to go, sugar? Sam\u2019s waiting downstairs. Doc Mitchell, our local veterinarian, will be the guard on duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVeterinarian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, horse doctor during the Civil War. He\u2019s been a practicing vet forever. Does a super job when we\u2019re in our wolf forms. And he\u2019s one of the best shooters we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, good enough to have killed the gunman from a distance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong the grays quite a few are like that.\u201d</p><p>Great.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s holding you up, Silva?\u201d Sam shouted from the bottom of the stairs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sirree, boss.\u201d Silva led Lelandi down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want to leave our star guest behind.\u201d</p><p>Sam motioned to a gray-bearded man, his eyes black and beady, but sharp as a wary wolf\u2019s, taking in every inch of her, his mouth expressionless.</p><p>\u201cDoc Mitchell,\u201d Sam explained. \u201cHe\u2019s riding shotgun.\u201d</p><p>The vet patted the gun in the holster at his hip.</p><p>Wearing a leather vest and denims, cowboy boots, and a weather-beaten Stetson, he just needed chaps and a horse\u2014though the distinctive odor of horse clung to him\u2014and he\u2019d be right at home in the part of a grizzly old gunslinger.</p><p>He tipped his hat in greeting.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Doctor Mitchell,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cMitchell\u2014no need to be formal, miss.\u201d He motioned to the black Suburban parked in front of Darien\u2019s house.</p><p>Lelandi smelled snow in the air and wished she\u2019d managed to steal away with some of her warmer clothes.</p><p>Silva sat next to Lelandi in the backseat, then her mouth curved up in a wide smile. \u201cOhmigod, Darien and you...\u201d She squeezed Lelandi\u2019s hands and didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><p>Sam pulled out of the driveway and headed back to town while Mitchell watched out the front windshield and mirrors for signs of trouble.</p><p>Silva said with a smirk, \u201cUnofficially, I\u2019d say you\u2019re a bona fide official member of our pack.\u201d</p><p>Sam glanced over the seat while Mitchell looked in the rearview mirror. \u201cWhy?\u201d Mitchell asked. \u201cDid Darien say something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIt goes a little deeper.\u201d</p><p>Mitchell glanced over the seat at Lelandi. She was sure her face was crimson as hot as it felt.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, I take it the boss will officially announce this soon?\u201d He shook his head and watched the road again. \u201cGoing to be some pissed-off bitches. Although we knew where this was headed.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and Lelandi was ready to deal with every one of them to keep her dream lover at her beck and call.</p><p>When they drove into town, Lelandi stared at the transformation. Colorful banners hung from every covered porch, and arts and crafts and food booths crowded all the wooden walkways down the main street. Even the shabby building across from the tavern was decorated in silver and red banners, proclaiming it to be the first hotel in Silver Town, haunted since its inception. Souvenirs of Indian arrowheads and other old western artifacts were on display. The aroma of sausages and turkey legs grilling filled the air, and Victorian music wafted in the chilly breeze. But the costumes of the townspeople garnered Lelandi\u2019s attention most. Dressed in Victorian era clothing, they wore sunshiny smiles and seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p><p>Lelandi took a deep breath. \u201cI remember wearing the cage when I was a young girl. I can\u2019t imagine dressing like that again.\u201d And the awful corsets, too.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s part of our heritage, our history. Even before we started the fair, we had a Victorian Era Day to celebrate the beginning of our town. A train ride winds up through the mountains, too, and anyone dressed in period costume gets on half price. Looks like a lot of the tourists came prepared this year. Hosstene, Darien\u2019s accountant at the factory,\u201d Silva said, pointing at a stall, \u201cis renting costumes for the day for those who don\u2019t have one and want to fit in.\u201d Silva patted Lelandi\u2019s arm. \u201cBut, you don\u2019t need to rent one. I\u2019ve got just the dress for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I wouldn\u2019t pay any money to that woman,\u201d Lelandi said, recalling their confrontation in the tavern\u2019s restroom.</p><p>Mitchell snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s already a welcoming crowd waiting for their free drinks at the tavern. Give anything away free and it\u2019s a madhouse. Waste of money, I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike when you spay and neuter cats and dogs for free once a month to avoid unwanted pets, right, Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>Sam asked, humor coating his words. \u201cGot a ton of business last year by offering a few free sodas. Before we knew it, everyone was ordering the harder stuff and we made a bundle.\u201d He turned to Lelandi. \u201cJust a warning, this is the one day of the year that humans are allowed to enter. Otherwise, it\u2019s a private club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you let me in that one day.\u201d</p><p>Sam smiled. \u201cPrivate as in only lupus garous are allowed. I didn\u2019t know you were Larissa\u2019s sister at first, but I recognized you were one of us.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed, Deputy Trevor waved at them from the tavern as they pulled into a parking space.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here?\u201d Mitchell grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s orders to ensure we get the little lady into the tavern safe and sound,\u201d Sam said.</p><p>The crowd parted to make way for Sam to unlock the door, but he relocked it after he, Silva, Lelandi, and Mitchell entered the establishment.</p><p>A shudder ran down Lelandi\u2019s entire body, remembering her apprehension when she\u2019d first visited the tavern, and what transpired after she left.</p><p>Silva squeezed her hand and led her to a room off the bar. \u201cHere\u2019s where we store our costumes. We celebrate Blow Me Timber Pirate Day, Viking Day for those of us who were from the Norselands, and Celtic Day for the Scots-Irish among us. German Fest is filled with German foods, song, and drink. We never advertise the events, but the word is spreading and we\u2019re getting more tourists every year. The guys will change in another room.\u201d</p><p>Shelves filled the large room and two doors led into a walk-in closet where costumes hung on poles. Silva pulled out a drawer in a chest at one end of the closet. \u201cTime to return to an earlier era when men wore the pants in the family.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lelandi shook her head. \u201cThey think they still do.\u201d She slipped out of her sweater and unfastened her bra. She\u2019d never thought she\u2019d wear a corset again after she\u2019d ditched hers in the Victorian Age.</p><p>Lelandi fingered the gowns and pulled out a brilliant blue satin one.</p><p>Silva dangled a pair of garters. \u201cRemember these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNobody will know what I wear under the gown.\u201d</p><p>Silva smiled. \u201cDarien will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he doesn\u2019t dress up for these occasions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Silva said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who insisted on it. And he was the one who started Pirate\u2019s Day. I swear he was an ancient Viking, but he isn\u2019t old enough. Here are your drawers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrotchless. Those were the days.\u201d Lelandi laughed.</p> <p>Silva slipped a sleeveless, knee-length cotton chemise over Lelandi\u2019s head. She lifted a robin\u2019s egg blue satin corset, heavily boned with whalebone out of the drawer.</p><p>Lelandi folded her arms. \u201cNot the corset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot to have something to hold you up. You know what they say about women who don\u2019t wear their corsets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re loose women, but...\u201d</p><p>Silva laced up the ties, but not too tightly. Then she pulled the crinoline cage out and opened it up. \u201cBetter than the five or six petticoats we used to wear to give our skirts shape.\u201d She slipped a camisole over Lelandi\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI remember how long it took us to dress.\u201d</p> <p>Silva fitted a simple petticoat over the frame. \u201cAnd how we needed help getting into all this. For most, it didn\u2019t matter, but for us, trying to shed our clothes when the moon first made its appearance...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWhat a chore. I ripped more petticoats trying to ditch them.\u201d She layered an intricately embroidered petticoat over the plain one. \u201cNow for the finale.\u201d She helped Lelandi on with the gown.</p><p>The neckline dipped low, the mere strap of a sleeve rested off the shoulders, and Lelandi felt more exposed than usual. \u201cDo you have anything that\u2019s cut a little higher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Silva said with a knowing smirk. \u201cBesides, for serving in the tavern, it seems appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! They\u2019re Victorian ballroom gowns.\u201d Lelandi fingered a peach one. \u201cNot what the serving wenches would have worn.\u201d</p><p>Silva pulled the peach gown out. \u201cHigh-classed tavern in the New World.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi helped Silva dress and they pinned their hair up, then fastened hats covered in feathers to each other\u2019s hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll skip the gloves,\u201d Silva said. \u201cI tried them last year, but spilled a tray of customers\u2019 drinks, and Sam said enough with the authenticity of the period.\u201d</p><p>Behind the counter, Sam was pouring drinks, wearing a swallowtail coat and black satin knee breeches tight over high boots.</p><p>\u201cWow, Sam, you sure look dashing.\u201d He gave Lelandi a broad smile. Doc Mitchell was wearing a dinner coat without tails and a satin vest. He tipped his head in greeting. Lelandi smiled back at him. \u201cYou, too, Doc. I feel like I\u2019ve definitely traveled back in time.\u201d Especially since the place still seemed part of the Victorian Age.</p> <p>\u201cLadies.\u201d Sam kissed each of their hands in succession. \u201cYou look divine. But if Darien knew how striking Lelandi looked in that blue gown, he\u2019d send her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s hoping no one will spill the beans.\u201d Silva motioned to the glasses stacked underneath the bar. \u201cBring them out and I\u2019ll fill them.\u201d</p><p>Sam motioned to Mitchell to open the door. The crowd surged forward and within minutes, the place was filled with humans and lupus garous. Laughter and conversation quickly filled the silence.</p><p>Dressed in a tweed suit, Joe Kelly, the miner who\u2019d paid for her bottled water the first time she\u2019d been here, walked up to the bar with a smile. This time he was clean, not a speck of grime on his baby-round face.</p><p>His gaze focused on her low-cut bodice, which sent a prickle of anxiety sparking across her skin. No matter how many times she\u2019d tried to pull the bodice higher when she crouched to get glasses from beneath the bar, the darned thing wouldn\u2019t budge. And Sam had caught her in the act every time.</p><p>\u201cCan I have a beer?\u201d Joe asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lelandi filled a glass.</p><p>\u201cYou look a lot like your sister.\u201d</p><p>Triplets often did, she wanted to say. \u201cYou were her friend?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and his mouth curved down.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like being thought of as Larissa\u2019s friend?</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d stalked her and she\u2019d turned him down.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d hired the killer or did the job himself.</p><p>He lifted his gaze slowly. \u201cWill you... leave with me? I... I don\u2019t want you to get hurt, too.\u201d</p><p>She assumed he\u2019d cared for Larissa. A gut instinct.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what happened to my sister?\u201d</p><p>Sam moved closer to Lelandi. He didn\u2019t look at her, just continued pouring drinks, but he had no reason to close in on her, except to hear what was being said. For her protection? Or was there more at stake?</p><p>Joe slid Lelandi a piece of paper. She considered stuffing it in her bodice, but when Trevor showed interest in the note, she opened it. Joe bowed his head and took his beer back to his table.</p><p>The paper was blank. Trevor seized it and Joe gave her a satisfied smile. The deputy shot Joe a blistering look. Joe lifted a shoulder.</p><p>Trevor asked Lelandi, \u201cWhat did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask Sam? He\u2019s been eavesdropping.\u201d</p><p>Sam gave her a reserved smile.</p><p>Trevor\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cBecause I\u2019m asking you.</p><p>\u201d</p><p>Having dealt with his kind before in her pack, she shrugged off his attempt at intimidation. Given a little power, it would go straight to their heads.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted a beer. I gave him one. He worried for my safety. Considering what happened the last time I left this tavern, his concern probably is justified. Oh, and he said I look like my sister. No real revelation there.\u201d She raised a brow, waiting for Trevor\u2019s response.</p><p>He glanced at Sam who nodded, confirming she\u2019d spoken the truth. The deputy crumpled the note and tossed it on the bar, then walked off. Before Lelandi could grab the note, Sam did. Why? Did he think there was some secret communiqu\u00e9 written on the paper in invisible ink?</p><p>Sam shoved the note in his pocket. She hoped if Joe had written anything to her in secret, he wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for it. Unless he had a hand in her sister\u2019s death. As much as she thought he was okay, she couldn\u2019t rule out anyone yet.</p><p>The stocky bitch who\u2019d pulled Lelandi\u2019s hair in the restroom the night she was shot sidled up to the bar.</p><p>Silva was carrying a tray of drinks to a table, Sam was filling more glasses, and Lelandi set more drinks on another tray, trying to ignore Angelina.</p><p>\u201cGot you tending bar, I see. Earning your keep?\u201d Angelina snarled. \u201cThree bullets weren\u2019t enough to keep you away, were they? What will it take?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>LELANDI WANTED TO SHUT ANGELINA\u2019S MOUTH FOR HER AS she leaned haughtily against the bar. In mixed company, lupus garous were careful about what they revealed. But this woman was too angry to care.</p><p>\u201cThree bullet wounds?\u201d a blonde human female asked, her blue eyes round. She wore jeans, snow boots, and a tight-fitting ski sweater that showed off her ample breasts while she sat on a heavy-duty parka\u2014not into the Victorian-era festivities it appeared. \u201cShe\u2019s not the one everyone is talking about, is she? The one people said looked like death had claimed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuperficial wounds.\u201d Lelandi gave the lupus garou bitch a warning look.</p><p>\u201cYou should have died.\u201d Angelina grabbed a glass of Coke off the counter, and took a seat with Ritka and Hosstene. Guess Hosstene had found someone else to man her costume rental booth for the day.</p><p>\u201cAngelina\u2019s a pain in the ass.\u201d Silva left the empty tray on the counter and grabbed another full one. \u201cIt\u2019s rumored she fears tackling you again.\u201d She carried the tray to a table.</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Carol Wood.\u201d The blonde stuck her hand out.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s parents had taught her not to make friends with humans. Close human involvement could cause a world of trouble\u2014period. In all these years, she had heeded their advice and was thankful for it. The woman reminded her of a reporter, eager for a headline that would propel her into an overnight news sensation. Lelandi wiped off her hands on a dish towel and shook the woman\u2019s han</p><p>\u201cI love your costume. I didn\u2019t realize people were dressing up. Next year, I\u2019ll get something. But an early snow\u2019s coming so I was dressed for that.\u201d</p><p>The weatherman had said nothing about an early snow, although Lelandi and her kind could smell it coming. She wondered how this woman knew.</p><p>Carol took a seat at the bar. \u201cChablis, please. So you\u2019re...</p><p>Larissa, right? The sister of Darien\u2019s deceased wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m Lelandi. My sister was Larissa.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi moved away from the woman, but caught the eye of a dark-haired guy sipping a soda, watching every move she made. He wasn\u2019t wearing a costume either, just a sweater and turtleneck and a pair of denims. But it was the intrigued way he observed her that gave her pause. She took a deep breath and breathed in his scent. A gray. And he\u2019d been listening to her conversation with Carol.</p><p>His expression remained serious, and he finally set his glass down and leaned against the bar closer to her. Joe raised up out of his chair, but one of his companions seized his arm and shook his head. His face scowling, Joe retook his seat.</p><p>\u201cNothing is as it seems, miss. Just watch your step.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice was friendly, but dark.</p><p>Trevor came up behind him and growled low, \u201cMove along.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s lips rose in a coy way, then he bowed his head to Lelandi, and took his glass and headed to one of the tables.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d Lelandi asked Sam in a hushed voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced at the table where the gray sat. \u201cChester McKinley. He\u2019s checking out our town so he can make recommendations to his mayor of Green Valley. Why? Was he bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Chester still observed her with a cool, appraising expression. As much as she tried to ignore him, even when she went back to filling another tray of drinks for Silva, Lelandi noticed he was still studying her.</p> <p>Trevor had moved to a position near the restrooms and watched the tavern\u2019s patrons. Mitchell stood near the front door doing the same thing as if he and Trevor were bouncers who usually served on duty. At any rate, she felt safe.</p><p>\u201cSo is this your regular job?\u201d Carol moved a barstool closer to where Lelandi worked.</p><p>What was she doing here? She was supposed to find her sister\u2019s murderer. Now she\u2019d joined with her sister\u2019s widowed mate and the word would soon spread throughout the pack. She\u2019d intended to find her brother next. But at least Bruin was out of the picture. Or she assumed he was. She knew he\u2019d retaliate against her and her parents when Larissa ran off. But she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d try to take Darien on for mating her.</p><p>\u201cI guess you were paying your condolences. I\u2019m so sorry about your sister. I had one who suffered from severe depression. Hers was an organic thing. She finally slit her wrists and well, no more depression.\u201d Carol offered a weak smile, but tears filled her eyes. She stared at her empty wineglass, then frowned. \u201cSorry. That didn\u2019t sound very nice the way I said it. I loved my sister, but my parents doted on her, trying to \u2018fix\u2019 her, trying to placate her. Me, I was upbeat no matter the hardships that came my way so my parents acted like I never needed a support system whenever anything horrible happened in my life. My sister had nothing to complain about. Always ticked me off that she was so jealous of everyone when she had everything. But... I guess I\u2019m still angry with her for ending her own life.\u201d Carol handed Lelandi her empty glass. \u201cAnother Chablis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your sister.\u201d Lelandi poured another glass of wine.</p> <p>\u201cWe were really close when we were little. Then...\u201d Carol hurriedly wiped tears away. \u201cSo... what do you normally do when you\u2019re not filling in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking care of my father.\u201d</p><p>That left a bitterness in Lelandi\u2019s mouth. She hadn\u2019t really considered what she would do beyond looking for her sister\u2019s murderer and finding her brother. If her mother hadn\u2019t worked and needed Lelandi home to take care of their father, she would have worked as a... well, maybe a psychologist. Everyone used her as a sounding board for their troubles. Maybe she would be good at that. Yet, becoming Darien\u2019s mate left her unsure of her next move.</p><p>\u201cOh. Is your father sick?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi looked away. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>She wondered who could be so cruel to send her flowers, saying they were from her parents. Yet a crumb of hope nagged at her. What if they were truly safe? But how?</p> <p>\u201cOh. I\u2019m sorry. What are you going to do now that you have no father to look after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out later,\u201d Lelandi said, not willing to reveal anything else about herself, particularly to a human. \u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmigosh, let me tell you.\u201d Carol leaned forward and whispered, \u201cCan you keep a secret?\u201d</p><p>Right, as if this woman had anything to tell her that would be worth her time. \u201cSure,\u201d Lelandi said, doing her faux bartending psychology work and leaned over the counter. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m psychic, sometimes. It comes and goes,\u201d Carol said, her voice still hushed, then she straightened and grinned.</p><p>Lelandi stared at the woman. She didn\u2019t believe in that stuff. Just like she figured the haunted hotel across the street was part of a big hoax, and soul mates didn\u2019t exist. Except after making love with Darien, she was reevaluating her stance on that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I mentioned it to you, but you seemed the sort that wouldn\u2019t tell the world. And, well, maybe because we both lost a sister to severe depression. Means we have a connection, sort of. Plus,\u201d Carol said, shrugged, and added, \u201cyou\u2019re probably not planning on sticking around. Kind of like telling a stranger on an airline flight about your wildest sexual fantasies, and you\u2019ll never see that person again.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019ve done that?\u201d</p> <p>Carol laughed. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ve wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does being psychic mean for you?\u201d</p><p>What if the woman could envision humans turning into wolves under the full moon or something else that could really cause problems if anyone believed her?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen... things. Have since I was a little girl. Really strange things. But you don\u2019t want to hear about that. Most importantly, I\u2019m a trained nurse\u2014trained in surgery. But the only opening here is for the school nurse. I want to work at the hospital, except that woman...\u201d She waved her half-full wineglass at Ritka\u2019s table. \u201c... the shorter, fat one, Angelina, she wouldn\u2019t give my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the doctor.\u201d Carol shook her head. \u201cDarien Silver is on the hospital board and apparently he has the final say about hiring staff. Said I could work at the school. Sure enough, they said they\u2019d hire me. That the old school nurse, and believe me she looked ancient, was ready to retire. But I\u2019m trained in surgery. Why would I want to work with kids with runny noses? Waste of my training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hospital\u2019s staff must be full,\u201d Lelandi said, understanding why Darien wouldn\u2019t hire her.</p><p>\u201cCan I see your wounds?\u201d Carol pointed to Lelandi\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Lelandi gave her a faked smile. \u201cSorry. If I begin exposing body parts, the guys will think they\u2019re in a strip joint.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughed out loud and slapped the bar. \u201cStrip joint. That\u2019s funny. Here? A strip joint? This place is as backward as they come. I don\u2019t even know why I left Denver after I got my training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents. I\u2019m the only daughter they have left, and I wanted to be here for them.\u201d Carol finished her drink. \u201cLet me tell you, I\u2019m not easily dissuaded.\u201d She handed her glass to Lelandi. \u201cAnother Chablis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive my asking, but do you usually drink this much?\u201d</p><p>Carol gave her a lopsided grin. \u201cI missed the fair last year. What are celebrations for if you can\u2019t have some fun? Fill \u2019er up.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi poured the wine into the glass and deposited the woman\u2019s cash into the register. The tavern was so packed, Silva was getting way behind on service. Hoping she wouldn\u2019t drop a tray of drinks, Lelandi grabbed the next one and meant to carry it to a table full of gray males. Maybe because Darien and his brothers weren\u2019t around or because the five men had a little too much to drink, they were making fools of themselves, trying to get her attention\u2014grinning, wolf whistles, a few comments she couldn\u2019t make over the din of noise in the place. Before she reached the table, Ritka shoved an empty chair into Lelandi\u2019s path.</p><p>The back of the chair knocked the tray into Lelandi\u2019s chest, giving her heart a jump start and a dull thud radiated outward. Before she lost the drinks, Chester McKinley leapt from his chair and seized the tray. He set it on the men\u2019s table, while Ritka gave Lelandi an evil smirk. Lelandi grabbed the chair, her knuckles straining with tension, but fought the urge to knock Ritka\u2019s teeth down her throat. Yet, the male grays waited to see how she handled the situation. Alpha females didn\u2019t back down, although she had to curb her natural lupus garou instincts because of the humans in the establishment.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Chester seized Lelandi\u2019s arm and moved her away from the impending fight, as she warred with her natural instincts. \u201cDid she hurt your injuries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, no, I\u2019m all healed.\u201d Maybe a new bruise though. Lelandi cast Ritka a warning look that she\u2019d deal with her later. \u201cThanks for helping out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admire a woman with spunk. Your courage reminds me of my sister, around the same age as you. She\u2019s gotten herself into predicaments that have forced me to rescue her a few times.\u201d</p><p>Deep inside she wished her brother had been more like Chester and stuck around to help her family. \u201cWhat did you mean about me watching myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s too close to this situation concerning your sister. I\u2019ve been there before. He needs an outsider. Someone who isn\u2019t as easily influenced by family or long-time friendships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a P.I. for a number of years. The cases I\u2019ve worked I\u2019m not emotionally involved in. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about this case?\u201d Lelandi hoped he could give her something to go on.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Darien\u2019s people watch me day and night. I\u2019d need his permission to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi folded her arms. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my permission.\u201d</p><p>Chester smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re really cute, you know?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDarien has to approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. What do you suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. But I need Darien\u2019s approval. Right now, his brother tells me Darien\u2019s too busy to speak with me.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi frowned. \u201cI\u2019m investigating my sister\u2019s death even if he doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>Chester let out his breath. \u201cBetter let the grays handle this. They may not get to the bottom of this as quickly as I might, but you don\u2019t need to get yourself shot up again.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t intended to. But then she realized she needed to find her gun. Where could Darien have secured it? His office? His bedroom? \u201cHow long are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned on being here for just a couple of days and report back to my mayor about Silver Town. But when I saw you shot to hell, I decided to stick around longer. Maybe you\u2019ll need me. And maybe you can change Darien\u2019s mind in the meantime. In any event, you stay\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trevor stormed toward them, gave Chester the evil eye, then continued on past.</p><p>Chester raised his brows, his gaze following the deputy out of the tavern. He squeezed Lelandi\u2019s hand.\u201cGet me a beer, will you? I have a feeling I\u2019ll be tossed out of here shortly for being an outsider talking to you. Although I imagine any of the guys in this place who attempt to speak with you would torque him off.\u201d</p><p>Trusting her wolf instincts, she felt Chester McKinley might be able to solve the mystery of the killings. What was wrong with Darien to brush his offer of help aside?</p> <p>As soon as she saw Darien, she would try to convince him to capitulate.</p><p>Her spirits lifted as she imagined that they might discover the murderer sooner with Chester looking into it. She returned to the bar and got him a beer. Before she could take it to his table, Silva seized it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need any more \u2018incident\u2019s.\u2019 As soon as Trevor tells Darien that Chester McKinley was molesting you, there\u2019ll be hell to pay.\u201d Silva gave Lelandi a broad smile.</p><p>\u201cYou sure know how to do it, sugar. I haven\u2019t managed to do anything with Sam to make Trevor jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your heart isn\u2019t in it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo... no. Sam was totally agreeable. Said he\u2019d do anything for a good cause, and I do want to give it a try. But...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to make Trevor jealous. You\u2019re afraid it may backfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. Trevor\u2019s got a hot temper. I guess I\u2019m afraid he might take it out on Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Lelandi brought out some more glasses. She figured Trevor wouldn\u2019t react because he wouldn\u2019t care what Silva did, truth be told.</p><p>Silva took the beer to Chester\u2019s table and handed it to him. He smiled and thanked her. Returning to the bar, Silva grabbed another tray of drinks. \u201cChester seems a likable sort. Hope Darien\u2019s not too hard on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t molesting me, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs an outsider, he was getting way too friendly.\u201d</p><p>Silva took off with the tray of drinks.</p><p>\u201cAnother refill?\u201d Carol asked Lelandi, lifting her empty wine glass. Her eyes glassy, she appeared as though she\u2019d had enough, a drink or two ago.</p><p>Lelandi handed her a bottle of ice water. \u201cYour head will thank me in the morning.\u201d She hoisted another tray of drinks and headed for a table of humans when Ritka shoved Angelina\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>That was all the cue Angelina needed, and she rose from her seat and rushed to get in Lelandi\u2019s face this time.</p><p>\u201cGetting all the guys hot and bothered now, eh? Not enough that you\u2019ve got Darien panting for you? Even some damned outsider can\u2019t keep his hands off you.</p><p>You\u2019re just like your sister.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been holding a tray, Lelandi would have slapped the bitch in the face, but the place got awfully quiet. Instantly, Lelandi saw the reason. Darien, flanked by his two brothers, was on the warpath. God, he was gorgeous. Dressed in a coat with long tails and a gold paisley brocade vest, he outshone everyone else in the tavern. But his brown eyes turned even darker when he saw her, his measuring gaze taking in every inch of her bodice\u2014way too exposed.</p> <p>Now, if nothing else would, the cut of her gown would force him to return her promptly to his secure lair. Fine. She\u2019d search his house for clues concerning her sister\u2019s murder while everyone was enjoying the fair. And locate her gun. She wanted to read her sister\u2019s letter to him also. If she\u2019d thought of it earlier, she could have stayed home and done so already.</p><p>Jake targeted Chester, who was promptly asked to leave. Darien motioned to Ritka and the other woman and mouthed the word, \u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>Tom yanked Angelina out the door before she could utter a word. Darien took the tray of drinks from Lelandi, delivered them to the wrong table, then led her behind the bar.</p><p>Carol rested her chin on her hands. \u201cHow romantic. Why can\u2019t I find a hero like you to rescue me? All I need is a job as a nurse at the hospital.\u201d She waved her arm toward the door and nearly fell off the barstool. \u201cMaybe I could replace that nurse who rammed a chair into Lelandi when she was trying to serve drinks.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed, Darien looked from Carol to Lelandi. \u201cDid she hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRitka? No.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look like he believed her. \u201cWhat did Chester McKinley say to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to aid in the investigation. I said he could.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s dark expression lightened, and he even managed a small smile. \u201cWhat did he say to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to talk you into agreeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right. And it isn\u2019t happening. From now until you want to return home, you\u2019re staying behind the bar.</p><p>Got it?\u201d</p><p>She frowned back at him and lowered her voice when she spoke so Carol wouldn\u2019t hear. \u201cIf he can help us locate Larissa\u2019s killer, then we should hire him. I know pack leaders don\u2019t like interference from lupus garous from other packs, but if he can aid us...\u201d She gave Darien a look like she meant for him to agree or else.</p><p>He rubbed his hand over her bare arm, as though he was contemplating something. Taking her home? She thought so. But then his expression turned devious, his eyes darkening even more, a slight smile curving his lips. He took hold of her arm and led her into the room off the bar and closed the door. \u201cSilva has the devil in her when she dresses you to entice me, but she doesn\u2019t need to make the effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He kissed Lelandi\u2019s lips, hungry, demanding, his hands on her bare shoulders, caressing, and just as needy. He broke the kiss, his breathing and hers labored. \u201cI haven\u2019t told my people officially yet that you\u2019re mine.\u201d He growled under his breath. \u201cUntil I have done so, more than half those yahoos out there think you\u2019re still available.\u201d</p><p>Although she craved having him, she gave him her meanest glower, wanting the situation with Chester resolved. \u201cI doubt it, Darien. But I still want Chester on the case.\u201d</p><p>He growled again and tackled her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re too damned enticing for your own good.\u201d He rubbed his fingers over the satin fabric covering her breasts, let out his breath in exasperation, then reached lower to lift her skirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she squealed, holding her gown down, startled, but loving how much he wanted her, his wolfish possessiveness, his urgent craving. \u201cI want Chester on the case.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, he stared at her, his expression stormy. \u201cLelandi, this is something I have to do as a leader, and I don\u2019t want investigators from outside our pack. As for you...\u201d He took a ragged breath. \u201cYou are mine. I will remind you of this. I don\u2019t want any lupus hitting on you.\u201d He looked down at the cage around her legs. \u201cI have never done this before when a woman was wearing this metal contraption. How do I remove it?\u201d</p><p>She seized his hands. \u201cWe have to discuss Chester.\u201d</p><p>As focused as he was on wanting to ravish her, she realized after his hearing rumors that other lupus were \u201chitting\u201d on her, he was giving into his more primitive wolf instincts. Compelled to show her he was hers and she was his, that no one else had any right to her, he seemed determined to satisfy this basic need.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWe talk about Chester when we get home, or else.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sharp nod, although his eyes were so smoky with desire, she wasn\u2019t sure he was listening. But she meant what she said. Either they talked when they got home, or she took the case into her own hands.</p><p>He yanked off the lightweight steel crinoline, tossed it aside, then slipped her bodice down, exposing her breasts. Her body heating with the compulsion to mate, the frustration over his leader stubbornness melted. She cherished the sensation of his hands on her breasts, the way he massaged and lifted, bent his head over one and kissed the nipple, making it pucker and tingle. She slipped her fingers through his hair, felt a tinge of icy dampness. Snow.</p><p>He slid his hand down her waist and pulled the long skirt up again. He had a one-track mind. But her fingertips chased away the frown across his temple, and she kissed his mouth, stopping him momentarily.</p><p>A shudder shook him and he quickly pressed his hand between her legs, finding the opening in her crotchless drawers and gave her a lusty smile. \u201cHmm, Lelandi, you\u2019re hot and wet for me.\u201d</p><p>Always, whenever he observed her with that lascivious look in his eyes. He slipped his arms under her and laid her down on the wooden floor. \u201cJust think, September 19th is Talk Like a Pirate Day. You\u2019ll be my sea wench and I\u2019ll plunder your treasures.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand down to his trousers and rubbed the bulge already hard and readied for her. \u201cI\u2019ll be the Pirate Captain, sir, not the treasure.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou laugh, but I\u2019m serious. I could be the Viking pirate Princess Sela or Princess Rusla.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkling, he kissed her again. \u201cYou\u2019ve already stolen my heart, princess. Now I\u2019ll steal yours.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi tugged at his trousers. \u201cFine. Hurry, Darien.\u201d</p><p>His fingers parted her feminine core as his tongue touched hers. \u201cHeaven on earth, love. That\u2019s what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fair that my breasts are bare and my skirts are tugged up to my waist so you can have your fill of me while you\u2019re dressed to the teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplaints, complaints, woman.\u201d He moved her hand from his waist to the crotch of his pants. \u201cRelease me and end my pain.\u201d</p><p>She unbuttoned his pants and reached inside and touched his rock-hard erection.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all yours, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen send me to the moon, sir. Make me climb the peak.\u201d She stroked his member, long, hard, faster, soliciting a groan from deep within his throat, his eyes glazed over with lust.</p><p>\u201cEnough, you vixen.\u201d</p><p>He centered himself between her legs, then entered her, easing in at first, then thrusting hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hand closed on her breast, massaging the mound as his mouth sought her free breast, his lips suckling at the nipple.</p><p>She arched against him, reveling in the feel of his hard thrusts, her pelvis meeting his with as much enthusiasm, her eyes closed so she could concentrate on the feel of his penetration, and of his tongue licking at her sensitive nipple. His heartbeat thundered in her ear, mixed with the sound of her own heart pounding.</p><p>He gripped her bare shoulders as she slipped her hands underneath his waistcoat and yanked his shirttail out of his trousers. His eyes fluttered opened and he grinned, wicked, amative.</p> <p>She traced his abs, the muscles flexing beneath her fingertips. Closing her eyes again, she breathed in the wild, spicy scent of him, of the piney woods and spruce, and felt suspended in time between now and the past, the centuries bridged.</p><p>\u201cMy princess,\u201d he mouthed against her lips, \u201cmy goddess.\u201d</p><p>His chest rubbed against hers, the satin fabric of his vest, teasing her nipples, and then the power of Niagara Falls washed over her in a rush of heated passion, carrying her over the edge, sweeping her toward... toward...</p><p>She moaned as a second wave stole her thoughts, his hot seed filling her womb. \u201cAdonis,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIn the flesh,\u201d she breathed in his ear.</p><p>He nipped her chin and squeezed her breast with one final thrust. \u201cMy... dreams... have... come... true..., love.\u201d His head sank next to her face, his hand cupping her breast. \u201cI have died and gone to Valhalla.\u201d</p> <p>Her fingers caressing locks of his damp hair, she gave a contented sigh. \u201cI never want to move from here.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNext time we\u2019ll do it with fewer clothes. I would never have lasted with you in the earlier time. In truth, I\u2019m glad the days of long gowns and the like are gone.\u201d He swirled his tongue around her nipple as if he was licking the ice cream on a sugar cone. \u201cThough I like the cut of this gown on you.\u201d His gaze shot up to hers. \u201cBut not for everyone in town to see. Silva is absolutely the devil.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off her, adjusted his pants, and tucked his shirt back into his trousers. He helped her stand. Pulling her bodice up, he covered her nipples, his thumbs rubbing the sensitive nubs underneath the lace-trimmed satin. Focusing on them, he let out a low growl. \u201cWear a shirt over them until they settle down.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, Darien.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips, his tongue penetrating her mouth, his hands wrapped securely around her waist.\u201cI love it when you call me by name, Lelandi, for all the times we made love together, and you didn\u2019t know who I was.\u201d He kissed her forehead and brushed his hand down her waist until his fingers reached the apex of her thighs. He cupped her mound through her skirts and rubbed and let out a husky breath. \u201cHurry home and I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she moaned in response, then smiled and pressed her lips against his, nipping his lower one.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me wait long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said with lustful promise and escorted her out of the storeroom.</p><p>Sam stopped filling a mug and looked from Darien to Lelandi and gave a knowing smile.</p><p>Some difference from the first time she\u2019d been here, sitting at the table in the corner, an outsider in disguise.</p><p>Darien kissed her cheek and left her behind the counter. \u201cNo more serving drinks to the tables.\u201d He glanced at the table where the grays had been trying to get her attention. \u201cI\u2019ll have to keep you under lock and key,\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cAs if that\u2019s ever happening.\u201d</p><p>Trevor walked back into the place, but Tom and Jake took seats at an empty table also.</p><p>\u201cKilljoy,\u201d she said to Darien.</p> <p>He gave her a smug look. \u201cIt\u2019s for your protection, Lelandi. I\u2019ve got some business I have to take care of.</p><p>Let Jake know when you want to return home.\u201d</p><p>The humans talked like nothing had gone on. But every gray in the house watched Darien, and when he left, Tom and Jake would observe them next.</p><p>Silva gave her a big smile. Lelandi tried to fill a glass, but it dropped from her grasp and Sam caught it.</p><p>\u201cYou can put out some chips.\u201d He gave her one of his wolfish grins.</p><p>Silva joined her behind the bar and tsked. \u201cBoy, you sure have a stranglehold on that man. I keep trying to learn from your example, but I\u2019m not sure what it is you\u2019re doing to garner his attention. Just when I think he\u2019s going to confine you at home, he takes you in the back room and ravishes you.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNow half the grays in the tavern had their eyes on that door, just waiting to see what the two of you looked like when you came out.\u201d</p><p>Feeling sated, Lelandi poured chips into a bowl.</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s chest was so puffed out, he looked like a peacock strutting out of there. And you, well,\u201d Silva glanced down at Lelandi\u2019s bodice and sighed heavily again. \u201cA fresh bloom to your cheeks and lips, your hair tousled in the throes of passionate lovemaking, and you\u2019ve even lost your hat. In the olden days, that would have been utterly scandalous.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cFor humans,\u201d Lelandi reminded her, speaking low so only Silva could hear, although she imagined Sam was eavesdropping as well. \u201cNot lupus garous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but most of these yahoos didn\u2019t know you and Darien were mated yet. Besides, he\u2019s the pack leader. Whatever happens in regards to him is important to them. When he\u2019s happy...\u201d Silva shrugged. \u201cMakes him easier to live with.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi glanced in the mirror on the back wall. Most of her hair hung to her shoulders in curls, no longer bound.</p><p>Silva gave her a hug. \u201cI want to know all your secrets. Julia Wildthorn has nothing on you.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled, brushed a curl of hair away from her cheek and returned to the counter. Conversation renewed and she could just bet the topic of conversation. Red wolf strikes again!</p><p>Silva ran her hand over Lelandi\u2019s arm. \u201cEveryone\u2019s glad for the two of you. Darien\u2019s come out of his dark mood, except for the other deadly business. Soon you\u2019ll be carrying his babies and the pack will be well on it\u2019s way to mend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriplets.\u201d Carol raised her nearly empty container of bottled water, eyes glittering, but her expression was deadly serious.</p><p>Lelandi stared at her, her heart nearly stopping.What had the woman overheard? Could she really see the future? More importantly, did she know about the lupus garous?</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>WAS THE WINE TALKING OR DID CAROL WOOD REALLY SEE things that others couldn\u2019t? Lelandi wanted to question her further\u2014alone, but Silva stuck close to her at the bar.</p><p>Lelandi gave a disgruntled sigh and handed her two bowls of chips. \u201cDarien won\u2019t let me serve anything to the tables or I\u2019d help you out more.\u201d</p><p>Silva gave her a smirk. \u201cI\u2019m used to the crowds.</p><p>Think nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Silva skirted around the bar, Lelandi leaned over the counter and asked Carol, \u201cDo you... see this for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi pursed her lips. \u201cDo you see that I have triplets?\u201d</p><p>Carol waved her hand at the tavern. \u201cMultiple births abound in Silver Town. Darien\u2019s a triplet. You\u2019re a triplet. So sure, you\u2019ll have triplets, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was a triplet?\u201d</p><p>Carol looked cross-eyed, then her blue eyes straightened. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a brother, too? I thought someone said you did.\u201d She shrugged and rested her elbow on the counter, then leaned her head against her hand. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi poured chips into another bowl.</p><p>\u201cYour sister was pregnant with triplets. But you\u2019ll be feeding yours at your breasts, juggling one after another when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>Sam had moved closer and although he hadn\u2019t looked in their direction, Lelandi was certain he\u2019d heard. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right, statistically speaking,\u201d she said, not wanting anyone to know if Carol truly had psychic powers. But could she know anything about the tragedy that had befallen her sister? She had to find out when the woman was sober, and without big ears listening in on their conversation.</p><p>Silva came behind the bar and cast a glance in Trevor\u2019s direction. He was looking their way, but Lelandi was certain he was watching her, not Silva. But Silva coyly smiled, then made her move on Sam. She kissed him on the cheek. Nothing too risqu\u00e9 or noteworthy, but Sam seized her arm, pulled her into a bear hug and started kissing her like they were in bed, getting ready for the big bang.</p><p>At first, Silva seemed taken aback, stiff, but when Sam kept working on her lips, Silva melted in the big guy\u2019s arms, giving him as much as she was getting.</p><p>Lelandi glanced around at the now quiet tavern, saw Trevor watching, but no scowl marred his expression. Everyone else was rabidly entranced. Some amused.</p><p>Jake shook his head and slugged down some beer.</p><p>Tom took his eyes off Silva and Sam and smiled at Lelandi. Her body warmed with chagrin.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d Silva said, her voice low but because Lelandi was close enough she heard her words. \u201cYou never told me you knew how to melt a lady\u2019s core.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust needed the right woman to do the kiss justice.\u201d</p><p>Sam patted her rump. \u201cNow get back to work.\u201d</p><p>With a grin stretching across her face, she grabbed up another tray. \u201cHmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>Belatedly, several of the guys in the tavern whooped and cheered.</p><p>Silva\u2019s face turned crimson.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Carol said. \u201cNow, I wouldn\u2019t mind a hunk like that kissing me either.\u201d</p><p>Then her head sank to the counter.</p><p>Lelandi shook her head and motioned to Jake, who hurried to the bar. \u201cYou want to go home now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol Wood needs a ride home.\u201d</p><p>Jake waved at one of the grays at a table. \u201cTake Ms. Wood to her place.\u201d</p><p>The guy looked pissed, but nodded and carried Carol out of the tavern.</p><p>Right after that, a husky human male walked up to the bar and handed Lelandi a note. \u201cGuy outside asked me to give this to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before she could take it, Jake pulled it out of the man\u2019s hand. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll give it to her.\u201d</p><p>Jake stood his ground as the man looked from the note to Lelandi. Finally, he shrugged. \u201cAll right. Whatever.\u201d He gave Lelandi a sly smile, then sauntered over to one of the tables.</p><p>Jake opened the note, then shook his head. \u201cTime to go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a note from...\u201d She started to say, Darien, but then she realized Jake would have given it to her. Ural. She rounded the bar as if she planned to go with Jake, then snatched the note from his hand.</p><p>He could have taken it back, but instead gave her a superior smirk while he watched her read it. Ural. She\u2019d recognize his scrawl anywhere. I\u2019m coming for you, Lelandi. Be ready.</p><p>But he was in jail.</p><p>Jake motioned to Trevor, talked to him for a minute, then the deputy went to a table of grays. All six rose and headed outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wanted to stay longer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tell you it isn\u2019t going to fly with Darien.\u201d Jake took her arm, and he and Tom led her to his SUV.</p><p>\u201cHow did Ural get out of jail?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently he had help,\u201d Jake said, his voice dark.</p><p>When they saw Trevor and the other grays outside of the tavern, they shook their heads at Jake\u2019s questioning look. Maybe this time Ural had the sense to return home without her and leave well enough alone.</p><p>On the drive back to Darien\u2019s house, Jake wore a perpetual smile and Lelandi finally asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, for putting Silva up to kissing Sam at the bar.</p> <p>Won\u2019t work, you know. Trevor won\u2019t fall for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, his brow perplexed.</p><p>\u201cTrevor\u2019s not the right one for her.\u201d</p><p>Tom laughed. \u201cWe have a matchmaker in our midst.</p><p>Sonja said she\u2019s getting too old to do it anymore. Now we have her replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Jake responded. \u201cEveryone was relieved when she quit matching bachelors up with their intended mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bachelors you mean were relieved,\u201d Lelandi guessed.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I for one am ready for a mate,\u201d Tom said.\u201cHuman girls don\u2019t have what it takes.\u201d He winked at Lelandi.</p><p>Having no plans to become Silver Town\u2019s new matchmaker, she rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m taking up psychology.\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve okayed this with Darien?\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and stared out the windshield. If she wanted to become a psychologist, by god, she was going to do it.</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cLet us know when you talk to Darien about this so Tom and I can be at the factory or mine for the day.\u201d</p><p>She hmpfed. \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t too hard on Chester McKinley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor said he got intimate with you. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen Darien so mad. Not only that, but when we checked into it, we discovered he was one of the ones who sent a vase of wildflowers to you, anonymously.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped slightly, then she recovered. \u201cI\u2019m not a member of this pack officially yet, and I damn well can do as I please. If I want to talk to Chester, it\u2019s my business. And for your information he wasn\u2019t intimate with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know you mated with Darien. It\u2019s the real deal,\u201d</p><p>Tom said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s as official as it gets.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi glowered at Tom over the back of the seat.</p><p>\u201cDid you find out who the other anonymous guys were who sent flowers to her?\u201d Jake asked Tom.</p><p>\u201cThey were much more discrete. Seems Chester McKinley wanted us to discover who he was easily enough. But I did find out that Joe Kelly was another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, what\u2019s he up to?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cFound out he bought Lelandi her first drink when she arrived at the tavern, too. Sam finally told me. Said it had slipped his mind because of the shooting incident.\u201d Tom chuckled darkly. \u201cDarien better let everyone know she\u2019s his soon or he\u2019s going to be rescuing her from every bachelor\u2019s clutches in the area.\u201d</p><p>Boy, that would really make her popular with the pack.</p><p>When they arrived at the house, Jake sequestered Lelandi back in the guest bedroom. She guessed since Darien hadn\u2019t officially declared they were mated, no one would put her in his room without his order. It really didn\u2019t matter where she was. She just wanted to be free to see her sister\u2019s letter to Darien and locate her blasted gun. But Jake stayed with her and so that was the end of that.</p><p>He finally brought her downstairs for dinner, but Darien was noticeably absent. And Tom and Jake were keeping a real close eye on her. Because of Ural?</p><p>A shiver trailed up her spine. Who was here now who would have freed Ural? Had to be someone from her pack. And no doubt, to get into the jail, several had arrived. Which meant Bruin and his thugs must have found her. All of a sudden, she didn\u2019t feel safe.</p><p>She asked again, \u201cWhen\u2019s Darien coming home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Jake said. He didn\u2019t try to humor her, although Tom had tried to lighten the mood.</p><p>Finally, Jake motioned to the stairs. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to wait up for Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come to you when he\u2019s done with business.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, she retired to bed. But soon, Jake left her alone. She listened for any sounds outside the door. A guard would be posted.</p><p>She closed her eyes and listened, waiting for someone to come into the room. Then she inhaled deeply. Darien would come to her and wrap her in his heat. Then, nothing else would matter.</p><p>Something woke Lelandi from a deep sleep. She listened closely. Branches scratching at the window. She stared at the midnight blue comforter and wondered what happened to her forest green one. Realization hit her with a sick thud that she was in Darien\u2019s home and not in her family\u2019s, that her parents and sister had died, that Bruin might be here.</p><p>The scratching started up again and she glanced at the chair where someone sat during guard duty. No one still. Bathroom break?</p><p>A gentle rapping at the pane forced her heart to leap into her throat. She climbed out of bed, then peeled back one of the blue velvet window panels.</p><p>Standing on a ladder with his nose pressed against the glass, his hood up protecting him from the blowing snow, her cousin Ural scowled at her, motioned to the glass, and mouthed the words, \u201cOpen the damned window!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUral,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>One of his eyes was swollen shut, his lower lip was covered in dry blood, and he had a gash across his brow. She cursed and unlocked the window, then shoved it up.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he growled, climbing inside. He shook off the snow from his coat and slipped his hood down.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know which room I was in? How\u2019d you get out of jail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoke up and the door was open. Walked right out.\u201d</p><p>Her skin grew clammy and she wrung her hands.</p><p>\u201cT\u2014this is a setup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome away with me. I\u2019ll take you somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hair.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cLeave before they catch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mate with a gray. And when Bruin learns you\u2019re here he\u2019ll send a delegation for you. You won\u2019t stand a chance. We can go across country where he can\u2019t find us, start our own pack.\u201d</p><p>Fearing he\u2019d fly into a rage, she wasn\u2019t about to tell him she\u2019d mated Darien. \u201cI\u2019m staying here and finding out who murdered my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what hanging around grays got your sister? Someday you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d He pulled out a hypodermic needle.</p><p>\u201cUral, no!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He lunged for her, sending the bedside lamp crashing to the floor. She could have managed him herself and would have as she held his wrist, keeping the needle from jabbing her. But the bedroom door slammed open, and Darien, his brothers, and Deputy Trevor poured into the room like a river run amuck.</p><p>Jake pulled her free and rushed her out of the room as she tried to remain there to ensure the guys didn\u2019t kill Ural.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Jake,\u201d she screamed, but before she could twist free, he lifted her off her feet and hurried her into another bedroom.</p><p>She figured it was Darien\u2019s room because she could smell his scent more heavily here, and she noted the pale blue comforter and seascapes hanging on the wall. Her sister\u2019s favorite color and wish to live by the sea.</p><p>Jake dumped her on the bed. When she tried to bolt from it, he blocked her. \u201cStay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not barbarians.\u201d</p><p>But she knew better. Pack laws. A rogue lupus garou had infiltrated another\u2019s territory and tried to interfere with pack business. Even more than that. He tried to steal the pack leader\u2019s mate, which meant he could be terminated. Law of the wild prevailed. Might not have looked civilized to outsiders, but it had been their way for centuries, the way they had survived.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him killed,\u201d she said again when Darien walked into the room, his face flushed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to jail.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cYou set him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tell us who he was. Now we know who and what he wanted.\u201d</p><p>Darien motioned for Jake to leave. \u201cSend Silva up in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t like the look in Darien\u2019s eyes. Feral, dark, and intense, making her believe he was ready to lose control in response to Ural\u2019s actions. She rose from the bed and tried to brush past him, but he grabbed her arm and dragged her close. \u201cThis is your room from now on. Anyone tries to get to you in the other room, they\u2019ll get a surprise. I\u2019ve got to talk to Ural, then speak with Uncle Sheridan about some other matters. Try to get some sleep. I\u2019ll wake you later.\u201d His mouth sealed the promise with a kiss, but she was too mad to take the bait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she hadn\u2019t even had a chance to make it clear she wanted Chester investigating her sister\u2019s death either. She looked as cross as she could. \u201cIf you hurt Ural, you might as well sleep in the other room\u2014by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Darien laughed and gave her another quick kiss on the lips. \u201cIn your dreams, Lelandi.\u201d Then he stalked out of his room, and Silva walked in, shaking her head.</p><p>With Deputy Trevor, Uncle Sheridan, and Darien\u2019s brothers looking on, Darien sat in the jail interrogation room across the table from the red, and growled, \u201cIf you\u2019d stuck Lelandi with that needle, you\u2019d be a dead man. So who the hell are you, and what do you want with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cName\u2019s Ural. What would I want with the dead sister? I came for Larissa.\u201d</p><p>Darien glanced at his brothers. Both shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you want to return Larissa home then?\u201d</p><p>Darien asked, drawing Ural into the trap.</p><p>\u201cShe belongs to the pack leader\u2019s brother. You can\u2019t have her, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo Lelandi wasn\u2019t mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Ural shrugged, but winced.</p><p>\u201cHow about guessing why not?\u201d Darien said, his voice growing lower, more of a growl again.</p> <p>The red\u2019s split lip curled up. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty headstrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying Lelandi wouldn\u2019t accept a mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Bruin\u2019s brother. Besides, Larissa would never have mated another when she was already mated to the leader\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. There\u2019s one problem with your story. Larissa gave me a letter stating she was mated to a red and hoped I\u2019d forgive her for mating with me also.\u201d</p><p>Ural\u2019s jaw hung open.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d Darien said, \u201cour local doctor examined Lelandi, the living sister. She\u2019d never been touched. Got another story?\u201d</p><p>Ural tapped his fingers on the table, then crossed his arms over his chest, leaned back in the chair, and gave Darien a conceited look.</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up, Ural. Why did you come to take Lelandi back with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t belong to your kind. Neither did her sister. Hell, you had to have known the woman had already been mated.\u201d Ural leaned into the table and gave Darien a steely-eyed glower. \u201cOne of your people killed Larissa and now they\u2019ll succeed with Lelandi if I don\u2019t take her somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who set up the murder could have been Larissa\u2019s prior mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I saw the shooter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell he did. This guy probably shot the gunman!\u201d Uncle Sheridan roared and advanced on Ural, who looked like he was ready to have an early heart attack. \u201cHell, he probably is his pack\u2019s clean-up man and was ordered to come here and take care of this mess.\u201d</p><p>Ural cast a nervous glance at Uncle Sheridan, breathing down his neck like a giant grizzly ready to make a quick meal of him. \u201cI saw her,\u201d Ural spit out.</p><p>Not sure what to believe, Darien wondered if Ritka, Angelina, or Hosstene had managed to sneak by them and kill the gunman. They were the only women who might have hired a killer, since they hated Larissa and Lelandi both.</p><p>Uncle Sheridan gave a half smile. \u201cA woman? Really.\u201d</p><p>Ural stuck his chin up, but wouldn\u2019t look at Uncle Sheridan. \u201cA woman from your pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know her? To see her, you can identify her?\u201d</p><p>Darien asked, sitting on the edge of his chair. He wasn\u2019t sure he could trust Ural, but if the red had been a witness to the shooting\u2014</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d know her.\u201d Ural gave a satisfied smirk and wiggled his brows. \u201cFor a gray, she has one hell of a sweet ass.\u201d</p><p>Before Darien could stop him, Uncle Sheridan hit Ural in the head with his fist so hard, he knocked him out cold, and Ural fell to the floor in a ragged lump.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Uncle Sheridan!\u201d Darien jumped to his feet and waved his hand at Ural. \u201cWhat the hell did you do that for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had the nerve to talk lewd about one of our women. Son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Darien placed his fists on his hips and glowered at his uncle. \u201cTrevor, get some water to splash on Ural.</p><p>Tom, call Nurse Grey in, just in case Uncle Sheridan did some major damage to Ural with that iron fist of his. Jake, take a break.\u201d</p><p>The three hurried out of the room and Jake shut the door.</p><p>An intimidating figure even when he didn\u2019t mean to be, Uncle Sheridan stood taller and towered over Darien by four inches. But even so, Darien could have knocked his uncle out he was so mad. \u201cWe nearly had something to go on!\u201d He ran his hands through his hair. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you... check out some more leads on the blackmailing scheme.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan had the nerve to look unremorseful and for a tense minute, he stood his ground. Then he bowed his head slightly. \u201cAs you wish. But I\u2019m not sorry. Tell that son of a bitch if he says anything more about our women, I\u2019ll hit him harder.\u201d He stalked out of the room and slammed the door on his way out.</p><p>Jake peered in through the small window in the door and knocked.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d Darien crouched next to Ural and felt his pulse. Thank god, he had one.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Ural\u2019s making it up?\u201d Jake leaned over Ural with a cold pack and applied it to the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cI thought so briefly. But if he wanted to make something up, why not say it was some guy he didn\u2019t know? I think he was up there, saw her, and knows who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilva was the only woman there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. What about Ritka or one of her two girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAh. Yeah. Good candidates.</p><p>Although I doubt with the way Ritka\u2019s eye was swollen, she could have seen well enough to shoot. But Hosstene and Angelina, that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if either of them have an alibi. And question everyone who might have smelled the women\u2019s scents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Tom knocked on the door. Darien rose from his crouched position and waved at him to come in. Trevor followed him in, carrying a bucket of water.</p><p>\u201cNurse Grey\u2019s on her way.\u201d Tom shook his head.</p><p>\u201cUncle Sheridan\u2019s in a real snit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been like that ever since he had to cut his vacation short.\u201d Trevor splashed some cold water on Ural\u2019s face.</p><p>The red didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Darien swore under his breath. \u201cNo one is to beat on him any further, understand? I want to know who shot the gunman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll question some folks like you asked,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with him and see if he comes to,\u201d Tom offered.</p><p>Nurse Grey walked into the room and looked at Ural passed out on the floor, his shirt, face, and hair wet.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened now?\u201d</p><p>Silva sat on the edge of Darien\u2019s bed and gave Lelandi a small smile. \u201cSugar, don\u2019t worry about the red they\u2019ve got in jail. They won\u2019t kill him, although that was a pretty stupid thing he pulled. How was he going to ferret you away after he pumped you full of drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never was much to think things out ahead of time.\u201d Lelandi stretched on the bed, dressed in her jeans and sweater again. \u201cIf Darien or any of his men kill him, I won\u2019t be staying.\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s eyes grew huge. \u201cOh, honey, you can\u2019t mean that. You\u2019re mated to Darien now. You can\u2019t leave him.\u201d</p><p>Then she narrowed her eyes. \u201cThe red\u2019s related to you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what became of Chester McKinley after Darien made him leave?\u201d</p><p>Silva tilted her head to the side. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he could help us solve Larissa\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the incident at the tavern, Darien sent him packing.\u201d</p><p>Damn Darien. Fine. She\u2019d take matters into her own hands then.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right? I have a date with Sam tonight after we close the tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor show, right?\u201d Lelandi hoped she was wrong and that Silva finally realized Sam was right for her.</p><p>Silva gave her a slip of a smile. \u201cSure, just for show until Trevor gets the point. I\u2019ll tell you how it goes. Can you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Silva turned on the television and flipped through the channels. \u201cAh, here\u2019s one of Julia Wildthorn\u2019s romances made into a movie. Want to watch it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya in the morning, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, \u2019night.\u201d</p><p>Silva left the bedroom and greeted Darien on the stairs. \u201cLelandi is going to watch a movie.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi ground her teeth.</p><p>\u201cAre you going back to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sirree, boss. Just as soon as I move some of my clothes from the washer to the dryer. Sam will be firing my butt if I keep using Lelandi as an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him Lelandi takes priority.\u201d Darien entered the bedroom.</p><p>Lelandi folded her arms and glowered at him. \u201cWhat did you do with Ural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s staying in jail for a while. After what he pulled with you, that\u2019s the only place he\u2019s going.\u201d Darien gave Lelandi a hug, but she tensed. \u201cWhat movie are you going to watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of Julia Wildthorn\u2019s werewolf romance novels made for television, By the Light of the Moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He nuzzled her cheek and rubbed her shoulders, and she began to dissolve under his insistent touch. \u201cAfter I discuss business with my brothers and Uncle Sheridan, I\u2019ll show you what real lupus garous do in the name of love.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips, his hands massaging her breasts through her blouse and was really getting worked up when Jake shouted, \u201cUncle Sheridan\u2019s here. And Tom\u2019s just arrived.\u201d</p><p>Darien let out a husky growl. \u201cBe back in a bit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready and waiting.\u201d She gave him a sweet smile and leaned back against the pillows.</p><p>As soon as Darien shut the door, she flew into action. Somehow, she had to sneak into his office downstairs and see if she could find anything of importance there. But first, she searched through his bedside tables, and her heart did a flip when she spied Larissa\u2019s letter. She grabbed the letter and read through it, and nearly quit breathing.</p><p>I wished with all my heart to be who you thought I was. When I found the right man, it was too late for me to take back what I\u2019d done to you.</p> <p>Her sister had another lover? My god, no wonder Darien had been upset when he read the letter. But it confirmed what Silva had said about Larissa seeing some miner. Then the sickening thought swamped Lelandi. What if the triplets weren\u2019t Darien\u2019s?</p><p>Hospital records. She had to get into town and search for Larissa\u2019s records and know for sure. Maybe the doctor said something about her depression, or gave some other clue that might aid her investigation.</p><p>She opened the bedroom window, letting in a gust of snowy wind, and peered out. A rose trellis clung next to the brick wall. If it could hold her weight, she\u2019d make it. She searched in Darien\u2019s closet and found a well worn leather jacket that smelled of him, and she took a deep breath and inhaled his sexy essence. He\u2019d kill her for slipping away. But she was damned tired of being confined and kept in the dark. And if he was going to ignore her wishes to have Chester on the case...</p><p>She shoved on her boots and Darien\u2019s leather jacket, the size overwhelming her. After searching through his closet further, she couldn\u2019t locate any gloves.</p><p>Car keys.</p> <p>Rummaging through Darien\u2019s chest of drawers, she found spare keys for his SUV and something metallic hidden under a pile of socks. Shoving them aside, she gasped. Her gun! And the bullets. She reloaded it and made sure the safety was on, then tucked it in one of the big pockets of his jacket.</p><p>Looking out the window, she considered the drop from the second story. As long as nothing dangerous was hidden in the snowdrift beneath the window, she should be fine. She climbed onto the windowsill, then swung around, grasping the wooden trellis. The flimsy redwood gave way with a snap, her heart flew into her throat, and she fell on her butt in the pile of snow. She was having a very bad feeling about this.</p><p>The powdered snow cushioned her fall, and she let out her breath in relief. Once she was able to plow her way out of the snow pile, she rushed to reach his SUV. The door locks were frozen and it took longer than she liked to get the driver\u2019s door open. After climbing in, she slammed the door, hoping Darien and his family hadn\u2019t heard.</p><p>She planned to return before Darien even missed her, although she\u2019d have to come in the front door, but at least she\u2019d learn what she could about her sister.</p><p>As soon as she drove out of the drive and hit the road, she realized how bad the visibility and treacherous the conditions had become. Darien\u2019s country home provided more privacy for lupus garou gatherings, but right now the two-mile stretch of country road seemed more like fifty. But she was free and she couldn\u2019t stop now.</p><p>The wipers swiped across the windshield at full speed, but the snow piled up so fast, she couldn\u2019t see a thing and wondered if she was even on the road any longer. Sheesh, that was an awful thought.</p> <p>The SUV began to slide. Turn the tires into the slide? No, away from the slide. Hell, who could remember? The next thing she knew, the SUV sailed into the woods. She held her breath before the vehicle lunged into a steep embankment, taking a nosedive into something solid. The impact threw her hard against the steering wheel. Pain radiated through her chest. Bang! Something exploded. A blanket of white filled her vision.</p><p>For a moment, she sat dazed. I\u2019m in heaven. Except for the pain in her chest and her throbbing head that jolted her back to reality. The air bag deflated like a parachute that had lost all its wind, but the scene in front of her was still cloaked in white. The snow blew through the windshield crumbling in a spider web of glass crystals, courtesy of the force of the air bag.</p><p>Snow swirled around inside the SUV, and a cold wetness dribbled down her forehead. Reaching up, she felt a gash on her forehead. Blood painted her fingertips red. Great. Just great. How was she to do her sleuthing? Not to mention Darien would really want to murder her now for turning his SUV on its nose in a pile of snow or rock, or whatever it had managed to slam into.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s bound to be hell to pay anyway,\u201d she muttered under her breath, and jerked her seat belt free, then struggled to open the door. Wedged tight, the frame had crumpled with the impact. Super. She eased herself over the console and tried the passenger door. Same result. Growling under her breath, she leaned back in the seat and kicked through the remaining broken glass.</p><p>After crawling out of the SUV\u2019s window, she slid over the hood, still warm, the snow quickly melting into a frozen glaze, which left her jeans wet. The cold wind whirling around her, turned the denim fabric into ice. Blowing snow blinded her. But she was probably closer to town than to Darien\u2019s house at this rate anyway. No sense in trying to hike back. Although survivalists said, \u201cStay with the vehicle.\u201d But town couldn\u2019t be very far. And she had a mission to accomplish. She was certain the doc would have written about her sister\u2019s frame of mind during the pregnancy, maybe some clue about what was going on. And after reading her sister\u2019s letter about the affair she\u2019d been having, Lelandi couldn\u2019t block the feeling something more was wrong.</p><p>A little snow and cold wouldn\u2019t stop her now.</p><p>Darien shook his head at Uncle Sheridan, while Tom and Jake looked on in the living room. \u201cWe\u2019re not making an example of Ural. If he has accomplices intent on coming for Lelandi, they\u2019ll come. We\u2019ll deal with them then.</p><p>For now, he\u2019s fine where he is. What I want to discuss is who was blackmailing Larissa, how she died, and who hired the gunman to kill Lelandi. But first, any word on Ural, Tom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill out cold. Nurse Grey had us move him to the hospital. He\u2019s confined and Trevor\u2019s pulling guard duty. Charlotte said she\u2019d let us know when he came around.\u201d</p><p>Looking unruffled, Uncle Sheridan set his pad of paper on the coffee table. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned so far. We\u2019ve run ballistics tests on all guns purportedly taken out in the woods the day the shooter killed the gunman. No matches. Which means either the test rules out it was one of our men, one of them had a second gun and gave us the wrong one to test, or the shooter was one of our men, except none of us knew he was out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Silva said, walking into the living room, carrying a load of laundry, \u201c... it was a woman.\u201d</p><p>Darien wondered how Silva had learned of the news so fast. But she always knew the gossip well before anyone else did. His brothers and Uncle Sheridan gave him shakes of their heads or shrugged a shoulder, indicating they hadn\u2019t told her. Trevor. \u201cOnly woman out there was you. And you were with Sam the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan snorted. \u201cAs if any of our women could shoot that far or accurately.\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s back stiffened. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Hell, what now? Darien motioned to a chair. \u201cHave a seat, Silva. Tell us what you know.\u201d</p><p>She plunked down next to Tom. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything before because I knew you\u2019d be mad that I\u2019d killed him. I did it by accident. I swear it. We were sure the gunman was stalking us. So Sam told me to take his gun and go up on the ridge. If the bastard came after me, I was to shoot him. But he went after Sam and although Sam tried to tackle him first, the guy got a shot off, hitting him in the arm instead. I meant to hit the guy\u2019s gun arm, but he bolted when Sam dove for him, and I struck the gunman in the head. I swear I didn\u2019t mean to. When Lelandi said she figured the shooter killed the guy to tie up loose ends, I got scared. Sam didn\u2019t want to say anything either because you\u2019d given orders that we were to stick together. He assumed you\u2019d learn who the guy was who hired the gunman without involving me. But it seems you already know the shooter\u2019s a woman so...\u201dShe shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSam knows better.\u201d Darien blew out his breath. \u201cDid you have Sam\u2019s gun checked, Uncle Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>He looked peeved. \u201cHell no. The lunatic shot Sam. I thought he and Silva had stayed together. At least that\u2019s what they led us to believe. I would never have guessed she killed the gunman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun a ballistics test on Sam\u2019s gun. I want to know right away. And Silva, next time, tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss. I\u2019m so sorry. I well, I couldn\u2019t let you think some shooter was out there still gunning for her.\u201d</p><p>More likely she figured she was about to be found out when Ural came to. \u201cDamn it, Silva,\u201d Darien said. \u201cYou knew how important this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were up on the ridge, did you sense anybody else up there? Smell anyone, hear anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t smell or see anyone either. But I was pretty worried about the gunman and Sam so I might have blocked everything else out. Once I shot the guy, I hurried down to check on Sam and see if the guy was alive.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan said, \u201cYou made a fine mess of it. And although you\u2019re probably not involved in this, it sure can make tongues wag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only meant to wound him. All right? I\u2019m... I\u2019m late getting back to the tavern. Can I go?\u201d Silva asked Darien.</p><p>He bowed his head, but he still couldn\u2019t believe Silva was the one who\u2019d killed the gunman.</p><p>Looking dejected, Silva hurried to the front door. From the foyer, she yelled, \u201cHave you guys seen how bad the storm is getting?\u201d</p><p>Darien and the others joined her and considered the whiteout conditions. \u201cYou\u2019d better stay the night. Call Sam and tell him I said so.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be in the den watching a show. If anyone needs me to fix something to eat later, just holler.\u201d Silva headed for the den.</p><p>Itching to return to Lelandi and smooth things out with her, Darien and the others retook their seats in the living room and he asked, \u201cAnything else?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Uncle Sheridan flipped through his pad of notes again. \u201cMason reviewed bank accounts to see if anyone had received large amounts of money before Larissa\u2019s death. No one had. Which could mean that whoever was blackmailing her kept bank accounts somewhere else. So that was inconclusive. Jake found out some more stuff though.\u201d</p><p>Jake took a sip of his beer. \u201cSince we couldn\u2019t find money in a local account, Trevor and Peter questioned folks to see if anyone bragged about receiving lots of money. Mrs. Hastings\u2019s aunt died in a neighboring town. She received a substantial inheritance and put in the outdoor sauna and enclosed the deck to expand the bed and breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s above reproach,\u201d Darien said.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought so, too, but we had to double check every story.\u201d</p><p>Tom walked back into the room with a Coke. \u201cThen there\u2019s Ritka.\u201d</p><p>Darien sat up taller. She\u2019d certainly hated both Larissa and Lelandi, and she definitely could be suspect.</p><p>\u201cShe bragged she won at the tables in Las Vegas. Angelina and Hosstene vouched for her, but you know how thick they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the amount she won match up with how much was stolen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer winnings amounted to about a fourth of what the blackmailer had received.\u201d</p><p>Deep in thought, Darien rubbed his chin. \u201cWhat if the three women were in on it together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had the same idea. If Angelina and Hosstene got any extra money, they hid it somewhere, aren\u2019t spending it, and aren\u2019t telling,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Darien mulled that one over. \u201cAnyone else have any suspicious money dealings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Uncle Sheridan flipped to the next page of his notepad. \u201cConcerning the family who wanted to join our pack, they\u2019d heard you were a fair pack leader. As far as training, the man is a lumberman by trade. His brother is a male nurse. The mother makes jewelry and is a renowned artist in her trade. The girls are in school. One wants to be a lawyer someday. The other hasn\u2019t decided. Both girls want to help out when the ski lifts are running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the reason they left their former pack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe leader, who was highly respected, died. Another took over and they couldn\u2019t live with his rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could really use the brother who\u2019s a male nurse. If we learn the family is troublesome in the future, we can release them from the pack. But for now, they can stay,\u201d Darien said. \u201cWhat about the smell of rotten leaves at the site where we discovered Lelandi in the woods?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a hollow and lots of leaves have collected there. Wet and shaded, it\u2019s the perfect environment for making compost.\u201d</p><p>But Darien figured whoever the attempted murderer was had to be wearing one of those hunter sprays that either made his scent invisible to others\u2014even to bloodhounds, which could pick up the more subtle scents more so than any other animal including lupus garous\u2014or he was wearing that humus type spray to blend in with the smell of the forest.</p><p>Jake cleared his throat. \u201cCarol Wood keeps asking to speak to you about adding another nurse position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll have a fit when she learns we added another when we said no to hiring her,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cTell her he was hired some weeks ago but just got here, if she asks. The woman will have to learn that when I say no, I mean no. What about the other two vases of flowers sent anonymously to Lelandi?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill haven\u2019t discovered the identity of the buyers.</p><p>But the flowers her parents supposedly sent?\u201d Tom said. \u201cUral bought and paid for them.\u201d</p><p>Darien swore under his breath. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he know how upsetting that is for her? Giving her false hope that her parents are alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing,\u201d Uncle Sheridan said. \u201cChester McKinley informed me he located them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Where are her parents supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan\u2019s face darkened. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t say. If you want to hire him as a P.I., he\u2019ll share his information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn him anyway.\u201d Darien lifted his beer mug.</p><p>\u201cAll right, schedule a meeting for a couple of hours from now. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else. I\u2019ll check Sam\u2019s gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you can make it out in this weather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo snowstorm has ever kept me homebound. Call you later.\u201d Uncle Sheridan grabbed his jacket, shoved his hat on, and left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you both when Chester gets here,\u201d Darien said to his brothers.</p><p>Intending to show Lelandi how lame Julia Wildthorn\u2019s romance stories were compared to the real thing, Darien headed up the stairs. He couldn\u2019t help how annoyed he was with Silva and Sam over the shooter incident though. How many man hours had his men spent on the case, wasted now that they knew Silva was the shooter?</p><p>A man and woman were getting it on with all the moaning and groaning he heard on the television in the bedroom. He hoped Lelandi\u2019s movie had gotten her in the mood for some real lupus garou sex and that she wasn\u2019t still miffed with him over Ural. He gave Peter a nod, then opened the door to the bedroom and closed it.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in bed, no sound came from the bathroom, and the window was wide open. A willful breeze blew in snow all over the carpet. His blood running cold, Darien raced over to the window and peered out. Two of the rungs on the rose trellis were broken and the imprint of a body had impacted with the snowdrift.</p><p>\u201cPeter! Jake! Tom! Lelandi\u2019s gone!\u201d He didn\u2019t see any sign of a struggle, but it didn\u2019t matter. If her past history was any indication of her current situation, she could be in real danger.</p><p>Peter flung the bedroom door open.</p><p>Jake yelled, \u201cI\u2019ll call Uncle Sheridan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him to notify Trevor since he\u2019s taking care of the prisoner if she has a mind to try and free him.\u201d</p><p>Darien ran down the stairs with Peter on his heels.</p><p>\u201cIf she does try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor can throw her in a jail cell until I get there, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Tom offered, \u201cI\u2019ll call reinforcements to search the town for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman is an absolute menace to herself!\u201d</p><p>Darien swore he\u2019d tie her to the bed, and there she\u2019d remain until he eliminated Larissa\u2019s killer.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>NORMALLY, LELANDI COULD SEE IN THE DARK, BUT THE blowing snow was blinding her. She trudged in the direction in which she smelled smoke from a chimney. More than half of the time, she stumbled knee deep in snowdrifts, and although she tried to keep her bare hands in her pockets, she constantly had to brace herself to keep from taking a nosedive. She was certain she\u2019d been at it for over an hour, and she wasn\u2019t sure if she was getting any closer to finding the town. Autumn definitely was her time of year. Winter was for the Arctic wolves and polar bears. Sheesh.</p><p>A blood-curdling scream pierced the frigid air. A girl\u2019s.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s insides froze. \u201cHello?\u201d she shouted.</p><p>The scream had seemed ethereal, everywhere and nowhere at the same time. She stood still and listened. The wind howled through the spruce, haunting her, but she was certain the scream came from a girl.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Lelandi called out.</p><p>\u201cHere!\u201d a girl screamed. \u201cOh god, help us!\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to Lelandi\u2019s eyes, and she ploughed through the thick, wet snow, hoping she\u2019d reach the girl and whoever else was in trouble in time. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault!\u201d a boy said. \u201cHow did I know the storm was going to worsen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, our parents are going to kill us,\u201d the girl said tearfully.</p><p>They didn\u2019t sound very young, probably teenaged. Lelandi opened her mouth to speak, but another boy said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t talked us into this...\u201d</p><p>Jeez, how many were there?</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d Lelandi hollered again, sure she was getting closer to the sounds of their voices.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming!\u201d a different girl said.</p><p>\u201cA woman. Just great. Like she could help us,\u201d the first boy said.</p><p>\u201cListen, Cody, anybody would be welcome. Even Darien. Although he\u2019s going to be pissed. Maybe the woman\u2019s got a cell phone,\u201d the other boy said.</p><p>Darien. They were probably lupus garou teens. A cell phone. Wish she\u2019d had one, but hers was still back at her house in Wildhaven, and she hadn\u2019t had time to grab it when she made her escape. Although she wasn\u2019t sure where she was. Or where the teens were. So calling for help might not have brought anyone to their location anyway.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d all of the kids shouted.</p><p>Sounded like four of them, their voices muffled in the snow and wind. But she was sure she was nearing their location.</p><p>A branch snapped several feet away, and she whipped around, but saw nothing in the white bleakness except trees laden with snow, their heavy branches dipping toward the drifts, making them look like weary old men.</p><p>A deer might have made the sound. Her wolf instincts remained on high alert.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d the kids shouted again, but Lelandi didn\u2019t budge. A shiver shook her but it wasn\u2019t only the cold that created it.</p><p>She moved cautiously forward, listening for any other sound that might indicate someone was tracking or hunting her. The wind howled and the blowing snow blurred visibility down to a couple of feet, but even so she watched and strained to see or hear anything else.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s not coming,\u201d one of the girls said, her voice frightened.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d a boy shouted.</p><p>I\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming. But if someone was following her, Lelandi didn\u2019t want him to know where she was. She wrapped her frigid fingers around the pistol grip, and the knowledge she had it, helped.</p><p>Then something raced in her direction. A lupus garou in wolf form? It charged at her and she aimed her gun. But as soon as it emerged from the blanket of white, she exhaled a tentative sigh. A buck. As soon as he saw her, he dodged off and disappeared into the woods. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A second passed before she realized something must have startled it in her direction.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s lost,\u201d one of the girls said.</p><p>Lelandi moved more quickly now, although she couldn\u2019t shake loose of the feeling a predator had spooked the deer. But if she could reach the kids in time, if someone was stalking her, he would have too many witnesses, and he would most likely stay clear of them.</p> <p>\u201cI think I hear her!\u201d Cody shouted.</p><p>\u201cHello! What\u2019s happened?\u201d Lelandi shouted back, keeping her gun at the ready.</p><p>If worse came to worse, the kids could turn wolf if they were lupus garou now that the moon was out again. As long as the teens had an adult chaperone it would be acceptable. Their wolf coats would protect them from the cold, they could run faster, and find their way to town more easily.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d one of the girls shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s getting closer!\u201d</p><p>Nearly there, her legs weary from the trek and her body trembling with cold, Lelandi waded through the last of the drifting snow.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d the four teens responded again.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t come much closer or you\u2019ll be down here with us,\u201d the boy named Cody warned.</p><p>Lelandi froze in place. \u201cIs anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Caitlin might have fractured her leg,\u201d the other girl said, her voice breaking.</p><p>Lelandi tucked the gun inside the jacket pocket, then got down on her hands and knees and tried reaching out for solid ground, hoping to god that no one would sneak up behind her and shove her off the cliff. Her hands were so chilled, she couldn\u2019t feel anything.</p><p>\u201cThe snow was banked up against the trees, and then the whole side of the mountain gave way,\u201d Cody said. \u201cAnthony\u2019s sprained his wrist. But Minx and I are okay.\u201d</p> <p>If they were lupus garous, it wouldn\u2019t help the injured kids to shapeshift. Not if one of them had a sprained wrist and the other a broken leg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to you, but I\u2019m not sure where the drop-off is yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting close,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cWe lost two of our sleds down the mountainside, but there are another two up there somewhere,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>Winded, Lelandi took another deep breath, the frigid air burning her lungs. \u201cWe can use one to take Caitlin out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awfully steep and I\u2019m not sure either my brother or Caitlin can climb,\u201d Cody said. \u201cI can\u2019t either without a rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we can\u2019t leave anybody behind!\u201d Minx sounded on the verge of hysteria.</p><p>Lelandi drew closer and felt the land give way. Her heart thundered as snow cascaded down the cliff and the girls screamed.</p> <p>\u201cBack up!\u201d Cody shouted.</p><p>As if she wasn\u2019t already! Scrambling backward, she moved away from the edge. \u201cEveryone okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d the teens shouted.</p><p>The two sleds were wedged up against a tree, both wooden, both had long ropes attached. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving anyone behind. I\u2019ve found the sleds.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, she surveyed the forest, looking to see if anyone watched her, took a deep breath, and tried to smell anyone. Nothing, but the fresh, frigid air.</p><p>Fighting the numbness in her fingers, she managed to slip one of the sled\u2019s ropes around a sturdy oak near the edge of the drop-off and tied a knot. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll slide the sled over the edge. Let me know if it reaches you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rope\u2019s too short by about ten feet,\u201d Cody shouted.</p><p>Lelandi dragged the sled back up and again studied the forest. Still nothing.</p><p>For several painfully excruciating minutes, her frozen fingers worked on untying the rope from the other sled, then she fastened it to the rope from the first.</p><p>\u201cAre you still there?\u201d Anthony hollered.</p><p>\u201cCombining ropes from the two sleds,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here the sled comes again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s long enough!\u201d Minx shouted after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t pull any of us up,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a woman.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Male teen lupus garou for sure.</p><p>\u201cFirst, everyone take off their belts and anything else that you might be able to use as ties, scarves, whatever. Then tie Caitlin onto the sled. Can you make secure knots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy Scouts,\u201d Anthony and Cody yelled.</p><p>Unless the lupus garou had their own Boy Scout troop, she feared they were human kids. Which could be bad news for Caitlin\u2019s injuries and the frostbite they may have suffered.</p><p>\u201cOnce she\u2019s secure, I\u2019ll need you, Cody, to use the rope. I\u2019ve tied it securely to the tree. Once you\u2019re here, we can ease Caitlin up together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>Her body shivering endlessly, Lelandi waited, her hands shoved in her pockets, her right hand gripping the gun just in case. When Cody\u2019s rainbow-colored jester hat crested the top, she got on her belly, reached down, and helped him climb the last few feet. She took a deep breath, then smelling his scent, she was relieved in part. At least the boys were lupus garou.</p><p>\u201cMan, that was awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get Caitlin out. Then you climb down and tie Anthony on the sled. With his bad hand, he won\u2019t be able to climb or tie secure knots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll leave Minx by herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d Minx shouted. \u201cJust get my sister out!\u201d</p><p>Lelandi and Cody pulled while she prayed the teens had tied Caitlin securely to the sled. Every few inches Caitlin groaned or cried out, but they finally got her to the top, and Lelandi and Cody hurried to untie her. Lupus garou, too, thank god. She recognized her as one of the twins staying at the Hastings Bed and Breakfast, the one who\u2019d come to check on her in the loft when she\u2019d been crying over Larissa\u2019s letter</p><p>With care, they transferred the girl to the bigger sled, too cumbersome to lift up the mountain with a body tied to it. \u201cNow, take these belts and scarves back down and tie Anthony securely.\u201d</p><p>While Cody climbed down and he and Minx secured Anthony to the sled, Lelandi rubbed Caitlin\u2019s arms. Her lips were as blue as her hand-knit beanie. \u201cHold on, honey. We\u2019ll get you help soon.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m... I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>In stunned silence, Lelandi stared at her. No one mated an underage lupus garou without facing severe consequences. \u201cOne of the boys?\u201d She motioned to the cliff, dreading Caitlin\u2019s response.</p><p>Caitlin shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre... are you feeling any pains in your abdomen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my leg.\u201d</p><p>Thank god. \u201cAll right, honey. We\u2019ll get you to the doctor as soon as we can. He knows about this, right?\u201d</p><p>Fat tears rolled down Caitlin\u2019s cheeks. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lelandi frowned. \u201cDo your parents know?\u201d</p><p>Caitlin closed her blurry eyes.</p><p>\u201cCaitlin, they have to be told.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed. \u201cThey know.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi imagined they were pretty upset with her. Shamed. Was that the reason they\u2019d left their pack and moved here? She had a sneaking suspicion Darien didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cReady!\u201d Cody said. \u201cI\u2019m coming up.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi squeezed Caitlin\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be back after we get Anthony up.\u201d She returned to the edge to watch for Cody.</p><p>When he finally reached the top, he was huffing and puffing, trying to catch his breath. He didn\u2019t say anything about it being awesome this time, but when Lelandi gave him a worried look, he grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s bring my brother up so we can fetch Minx.\u201d</p><p>Because of Anthony\u2019s heavier weight, the rope cut into Lelandi\u2019s hands, and she gritted her teeth against the pain of the burning cuts.</p><p>\u201cHey, brother! Next time eat fewer eggs and sausages for breakfast and only one ham sandwich for lunch instead of three, okay?\u201d</p><p>Anthony laughed. \u201cGood thing you ate so much. You\u2019ve probably burned it all off by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours ago, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>When they got Anthony to the top, they hurried to untie him.</p><p>Lelandi peered over the edge. \u201cWe have a choice, Minx. Either you can climb up using the rope, or we can tie you to the sled.\u201d</p><p>Anthony looked at Lelandi\u2019s bloodied hands. \u201cYou can\u2019t do any more. Let me.\u201d He handed her his ski gloves.</p><p>\u201cYou can help with your good hand. But I\u2019ll use Caitlin\u2019s gloves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which way to come up,\u201d Minx said, her voice desperate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tie her to the sled,\u201d Cody said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she can make that climb. It\u2019s pretty icy and the hand and foot holds are a long reach for someone who\u2019s smaller.\u201d</p><p>Before Lelandi could say a word, he disappeared over the edge.</p><p>Anthony gave a worried chuckle. \u201cHe\u2019s the adventuresome one. Always gets me into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that!\u201d Cody shouted. This time it took him longer to secure her. But then he tugged on the rope. \u201cI\u2019m coming up. Hope the rope isn\u2019t fraying.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi leaned over the edge and watched Cody\u2019s jester hat shaking, the bells jingling on the four tassels.</p><p>Cody collapsed next to them and Anthony, sounding frustrated that he hadn\u2019t helped more, urged, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get Minx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me catch my breath, will you?\u201d Cody gave him an annoyed look. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>With all three of them pulling, and because of her slight weight, they had Minx up in half the time it took to bring up Anthony. \u201cShe must not eat nearly as much as you, Anthony, thank Odin,\u201d Cody said, hurrying to untie her. \u201cWe were headed for a cabin not far from here.

The boys still wanted to sled, but the snow got too bad.\u201d Minx wrapped her arms around Lelandi and gave her a big hug. \u201cThanks so much for rescuing us.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi shuddered to think the kids could have been stuck on the rocky ledge for hours if she hadn\u2019t found them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to the cabin,\u201d Cody said. \u201cWho needs a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take the other sled, but we\u2019ll pull Caitlin for now. If anyone else gets worn out, we\u2019ll use the other sled.\u201d Lelandi tried to give Caitlin\u2019s gloves back to her, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my hands in my pockets. You\u2019ll need the gloves to make it through the snowdrifts.\u201d Caitlin bit her lip as if another shard of pain sliced through her leg.</p> <p>Lelandi nodded and brushed snowflakes off the girl\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get moving. Standing here, we\u2019ll be frozen statues before long,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing out here?\u201d Minx asked Lelandi.</p><p>Lelandi wrapped her arms around herself, attempting to get warm. \u201cTrying to get to town. I had an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s why you have a gash on your head. Do you know the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I heard your voices, I smelled chimney smoke from that direction.\u201d Lelandi motioned into the stark, white bleakness.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s the cottage!\u201d Cody pointed in a different direction, and stumbled toward the blurred outline of a log cabin that seemed to appear out of nowhere like a lake mirage on a desert island.</p><p>Part of the roof was gone, and the icy wind whipped through the dilapidated building with a vengeance. Lelandi had hoped it would have been a safe haven, walls and a roof to keep the wind and snow out, a place to build a fire. No such luck.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stay here.\u201d Minx rubbed her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold and our dad will skin us alive when he learns we\u2019re missing. We\u2019ve got to get Caitlin to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Caitlin shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get grounded for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope Darien doesn\u2019t make us do anything like he already did,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he make you do?\u201d Lelandi peered into the snow, trying to get her bearings, smelling the air.</p><p>\u201cPaint the school, because we wrote on the walls. Nothing bad. Just that our parents shouldn\u2019t have to pay school taxes when we can\u2019t go to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they paying school taxes?\u201d Lelandi tied Caitlin more securely to the sled.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It was all Cody\u2019s fault. He\u2019s always getting us into a mess.\u201d</p><p>Cody grinned, not in the least remorseful.</p><p>Minx asked Lelandi, \u201cWill you get in trouble for the car wreck?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi offered her a small smile. Most likely.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the pack leader\u2019s chosen mate. Dad said. She won\u2019t get in trouble,\u201d Anthony said.</p><p>\u201cOh yes she will. Dad said someone was supposed to guard her at all times because somebody tried to kill her.\u201d Cody banged his gloved hands together, shaking off some of the snow. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be out here by herself so that means Darien\u2019s going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you out here alone?\u201d Minx asked. \u201cYou weren\u2019t running away, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she couldn\u2019t do that. She belongs to Darien and the pack now,\u201d Cody said, matter-of-factly. \u201cDad said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taking a drive into town, but I hadn\u2019t realized the snow was so bad. And Cody\u2019s right. I\u2019m Darien\u2019s mate and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Except to the hospital, if she could make it.</p><p>\u201cI suggested we could turn wolf,\u201d Cody said.</p><p>Minx frowned at him. \u201cOur parents would kill us if an adult wasn\u2019t chaperoning us.\u201d</p><p>Cody pulled his gloved hand out of his parka pocket and waved at Lelandi. \u201cWe have a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinx and Cody, go ahead and shapeshift. With his good hand, Anthony can pull the sled carrying our clothes. As a wolf, Cody can pull Caitlin. Minx will stay with the rest of you while I scout ahead. Stick close together so we don\u2019t lose anyone. If you sense anything that will help us find the town, just holler or howl.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t think any of them could trek for miles in this snow as humans. If the situation became too dire, she\u2019d have Anthony and Caitlin shapeshift, and they\u2019d huddle together until the storm let up.</p><p>Lelandi helped bury Caitlin under Minx\u2019s and her own coat, while Minx and Cody quickly shapeshifted. Then she helped tie Cody\u2019s coat over Anthony\u2019s shoulders to give him some extra warmth. Afterward, she tied Cody to Caitlin\u2019s sled, while Anthony gathered the rope for the sled carrying their clothes.</p><p>Lelandi stripped off her clothes, tossing them on the other garments. Man, was it cold. Her face and body began to shift, but it wasn\u2019t until the fur began to cover her body before she quit shivering.</p><p>Everyone watched her, waiting for her to make the first move. She considered Caitlin and Anthony, who appeared bundled up enough. She listened, smelled the air, then headed south. At least Caitlin and Anthony were dressed in ski bibs, snow boots, parkas, hats and gloves\u2014much more prepared than Lelandi had been.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re going the right way?\u201d Caitlin asked for the hundredth time.</p><p>Lelandi was quite a distance from the teens when she spied the glint of amber eyes watching her from deeper in the woods. Crap.</p><p>As a red female, she\u2019d never be able to fight a male gray and as big as he was, he was male. Her only hope was getting back to the kids because she was certain he wouldn\u2019t want witnesses, or to have to kill them, too. She was the target.</p><p>He growled low and the hair on her back rose. Tail straight, she whipped around and raced back to the sleds, prepared to fight the gray if she had to.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Anthony asked, as soon as she drew close enough.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Caitlin asked, unable to see from the sled.</p><p>A cow mooed in the distance. Their salvation. She hoped.</p><p>Anthony waved his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be Doc Mitchell\u2019s ranch. He\u2019s the vet. He can set Caitlin\u2019s leg until we get into town.\u201d</p><p>Great. Doc Mitchell would not let Lelandi out of his sight once he saw her, just like when he guarded her in the tavern during the fair. She stuck close to the sled, but made them stop as soon as she spied the house\u2019s snowy silhouette. Hating to shapeshift in the blizzard again, she didn\u2019t have much choice. As quickly as she could, she changed and then hurried to dress.</p><p>\u201cDoc Mitchell will get you warmed up and notify your parents. I\u2019ve got to go back to the SUV and wait for Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s way too cold out here,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cAnd you might get lost.\u201d</p><p>Anthony frowned at her. \u201cYou should come with us and get warm, too. Doc Mitchell will call Darien for you also.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi gave them each a hug. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Hurry to the house. And, Caitlin, honey, your parents need to talk to Darien.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, although she didn\u2019t seem happy. \u201cKeep my gloves, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll return them first chance I get. Take care. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>When they wouldn\u2019t leave her, Lelandi motioned for them to go. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to come with us, take Cody\u2019s coat. It\u2019s warmer than yours.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Cody and he bowed his head in acknowledgement.</p><p>\u201cAll right, thanks.\u201d Cody\u2019s white parka would blend in better with the snow and it would be much warmer. Lelandi threw Darien\u2019s jacket on the sled and yanked on Cody\u2019s coat, figuring Darien would be pissed about this, too. If Cody realized he was wearing the pack leader\u2019s leather jacket, he was sure to tell all his friends, and he\u2019d be the hit of the day.</p><p>The teens disappeared in the snow in the direction of the house, and Lelandi headed for the freshly plowed road. The wind hadn\u2019t let up any when she saw a sign declaring it was Silver Town and another posting the speed limit.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t long before she sensed the wolf following her, hidden in the woods. Running wasn\u2019t an option. He\u2019d chase her down and kill her. She turned and stood her ground, although she knew she didn\u2019t stand a chance. But there wasn\u2019t anything else she could do. And wolf to wolf was a better end than human to wolf. She yanked off Caitlin\u2019s gloves and shoved them in Cody\u2019s coat pocket.</p><p>The wolf\u2019s fur bristled, his ears erect, staring her down, angry. She wished she could smell him, know who he was, before he attacked, before the end. His lips curled back, showcasing his killer canines, and he snarled. She fumbled with the buttons on the coat. He was waiting, allowing her the chance to change, a contest between wolves. Some contest. Bastard.</p><p>Suddenly, his tail straightened out, parallel to the ground, signaling danger. She felt the road tremble with an approaching pickup headed toward town, its headlights a warning. Her heart racing, she threw on the gloves and ran, waving at the truck to stop, hoping he\u2019d see her in the white coat in the blinding snow. Despite being thankful her rescue was imminent, if it was one of Darien\u2019s men, she was sunk.</p><p>That\u2019s when she heard the wolf growl and knew the bastard risked killing her in front of a witness, closing in on her fast. The pickup sped up and veered off to the side of her, its brakes squealing, the tires spitting snow. She dodged away from the truck and fell into a snowbank.</p><p>The wolf yelped and darted out of the truck\u2019s path in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cHey, little lady, get in! Hell, that was close. Looks like you had an accident. I\u2019ll take you to the hospital.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a deep breath. Human. She managed a frozen smile and murmured a thanks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a wolf attack a human in these parts. I\u2019ll have to contact the police and let them know. Might be rabid.\u201d</p><p>She stared out the window, keeping an eye out for him, wishing she knew who the lupus garou was who had attacked her.</p> <p>The grizzled old man kept talking, but all she could think of was the teens telling Doc Mitchell she\u2019d been with them, he\u2019d alert Darien, and they\u2019d know her last whereabouts soon. Which meant she hadn\u2019t much time.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>DARIEN PLOWED THROUGH ANOTHER SNOWDRIFT, GLAD Tom\u2019s four-wheel drive monster truck could handle just about any road conditions, but he still wasn\u2019t letting either of his brothers drive, figuring if he had a wreck it would be his fault, no one else to blame.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been driving for an hour in this mess and have barely made any headway,\u201d Jake said. \u201cHow was Lelandi acting before you came down to talk to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed off about Ural. She probably headed to the jail to make sure we didn\u2019t kill him.\u201d He could barely see the road, or whether they were driving on it, the shoulder, or in the ditch. The only thing he could make out were the trees on either side of the road. Darien squinted, but it wasn\u2019t helping.</p> <p>\u201cWait, Darien! I think I see something,\u201d Tom shouted from the backseat.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the right... looks like the tail end of a green pickup.\u201d</p><p>Darien stopped the truck and they got out. \u201cIt\u2019s the Woodcroft boys\u2019 truck. I recognize the crunched right side where Cody backed into their mailbox by accident when he was learning to drive last year.\u201d Now, stuck in the ditch, half-buried in snow and ice. He rubbed the snow off the driver\u2019s side window. No sign of anyone. \u201cCall their dad. See if they made it home, Tom.\u201d</p><p>Tom pulled out his cell phone while Jake and Darien scouted around the truck for tracks. \u201cIf they hiked out of here on foot, the blowing snow covered their tracks already,\u201d Jake said, rubbing his gloved hands together.</p><p>\u201cHi, Anthony, this is Tom. Are your boys at home?\u201dhe yelled into the phone above the blowing wind.</p> <p>Darien pointed to a couple of trees nearby. \u201cBranches are broken. They walked this way, marking a trail at least. That abandoned cabin is located half a mile west of here. They\u2019d know about it. Maybe they went there seeking shelter.\u201d</p><p>Jake made a disgruntled noise. \u201cHell, the whole thing might have blown down in this storm. But it\u2019s worth checking if their dad says they\u2019re not home.\u201d</p><p>They looked at Tom, whose face puckered into a frown. \u201cI\u2019ll let Darien know. We found their truck and it looks like we\u2019ve discovered the direction they\u2019re headed.\u201d He paused. \u201cA mile south of Darien\u2019s place and the truck\u2019s stuck in the ditch and buried in snow.\u201d Tom looked at Darien. \u201cYeah, Lelandi\u2019s still missing. All right. Let you know if we find anyone.\u201d He pocketed his phone. \u201cAnthony, Sr. said they went sledding and were late in arriving home. Peter called him to help in the search for Lelandi, so he\u2019s heading out, but his wife will be home waiting on news of the boys. Not only that, but the sixteen-year-old twin girls that joined our pack were with the boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Darien said. \u201cGrab some flashlights. They might be able to see them. We\u2019ll check that abandoned cabin. Call Uncle Sheridan and tell him we\u2019ve got some missing teens out here now, too. He\u2019ll need to report the girls are with the boys, have abandoned the vehicle, and are on foot somewhere in the woods. And call Bertha Hastings and tell her to start the alert roster calls to account for everyone else.\u201d</p><p>With heartfelt thanks, Lelandi climbed out of the Good Samaritan\u2019s truck and headed for the hospital entrance. Glad to have made it, she felt a sliver of relief, knowing she still might get caught before she discovered anything.</p><p>What of the receptionist? Lelandi hadn\u2019t thought about how she could get past her if that blasted Angelina was on duty. With trepidation at being discovered, Lelandi opened the hospital door and let in a blast of cold, but the heated air inside welcomed her like a hot blanket.</p><p>A woman she didn\u2019t recognize manned the front desk and was talking to a human mother. The woman\u2019s son was coughing nonstop. While the receptionist was busy, Lelandi slinked on past in her wet clothes down the hallway.</p><p>The smell of antiseptics brought a flashback of her stay at the hospital. She shivered, not wanting to think about it. Doc was talking to someone in one of the exam rooms and when she passed it, she saw Ritka adding something to a patient\u2019s IV in the next room.</p> <p>Ohmigod. Deputy Trevor was peering into a hospital room, his back to her.</p><p>Two more hospital rooms to get by and she\u2019d reach Doc\u2019s office at the end of the hall. She hurried past the deputy and into Doc\u2019s office, then shut the door behind her. Her hands shaking, she took a steadying breath. Immaculately neat, everything was in its place. A brass caduceus sat on a stack of papers in the center of the mahogany desk, and she removed Caitlin\u2019s gloves, shoved them in her pocket, then flipped through the papers. Current patient notes, nothing old enough to relate to Larissa\u2019s case.</p><p>Certificates decorated the walls, and a portrait of a white-haired, elegant-looking woman and a distinguished-looking Doc was hanging on one of the walls opposite his desk over a file cabinet.</p><p>Trying the top drawer, she slid it open. Files of current patients. Files of more patients filled the second drawer also. No Wildhaven here though. No, it would be under Darien\u2019s name, Silver.</p><p>And there it was. Lelandi Silver, DECEASED.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s skin prickled. She slipped the file out of the drawer and opened it, her heart fluttering at a quickened pace.</p><p>9/6 Lelandi cut her wrists as a plea for help.</p><p>Her sister had attempted suicide? Hating how much her sister had to have suffered, Lelandi sat down hard on the doc\u2019s chair.</p><p>She must have known she couldn\u2019t die in that manner. I\u2019ve tried speaking with her, but she won\u2019t tell me what\u2019s going on. Nurse Grey spoke with her at some length, but couldn\u2019t determine the cause of depression. Probably brought on inpart by fluctuating hormones from the pregnancy. Suspect underlying reason, but can\u2019t say without further information.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes pricked with tears, and she wiped away a couple rolling down her cheeks. How could she not have been here for her sister?</p><p>9/8 Released Lelandi from the hospital. She seemed more upbeat and I had Doctor Craighton visit her from Green Valley. He\u2019ll be seeing her once a week for a month to work with her through her psychological issues.</p><p>9/12 Lelandi seemed somewhat less distraught. Silva has made friends with her as well. I\u2019m hoping that she\u2019ll adjust to life here with the pack sooner than later as the pregnancy progresses.</p><p>10/6 Darien spoke to me about Lelandi\u2019s crying spells. They\u2019re much more pronounced than for a normal pregnancy. The only thing I can attribute it to is the possibility that the babies aren\u2019t Darien\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to speculate further about that.</p><p>Lelandi reread the entry. Did Darien know? What about the rest of the pack? Silva. Maybe Larissa had told her. Or as bad as the news was, maybe not. No wonder Larissa was so distressed.</p><p>10/20 Lelandi had to be hospitalized for dehydration. Darien says she\u2019s not eating properly. Too ill with morning sickness.</p><p>10/24 Autopsy revealed cause of death: broken neck from strangulation. Deemed a suicide, considering suicide note found in patient\u2019s handwriting, past history of severe depression, and previous suicide attempt.</p><p>10/26 Autopsy of fetuses indicate the DNA does not match Darien\u2019s.</p><p>Tears streaked down Lelandi\u2019s cheeks, and she quickly brushed them away. How could her sister have done this to Darien? To the family? She\u2019d shamed them all. It was bad enough that she\u2019d mated another wolf when she was already mated, although Lelandi could forgive Larissa\u2019s transgressions considering how cruel Crassus was. But how could Larissa have conceived someone else\u2019s babies?</p><p>And who was the villain who seduced her sister? Silva said Larissa was seeing a miner. The only one she knew was Joe Kelly. If not him, would he know her sister\u2019s lover?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe how bad the situation with her sister was turning out.</p><p>\u201cDoctor,\u201d Ritka said from down the hall, jarring Lelandi from her morbid thoughts. \u201cMrs. Waverly wants more medication, but she\u2019s had enough morphine to put a cow under.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Waverly\u2019s bone cancer has spread to many of her vital organs. She doesn\u2019t have long to live. She\u2019s entitled to whatever pain medication helps ease her suffering. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Willy Wilkerson. His lungs sound like they\u2019re full of fluid. Might be pneumonia. And Ural seems to be regaining consciousness.\u201d</p><p>Ural was here? Unconscious! Lelandi ground her teeth. That\u2019s why Deputy Trevor was here. Damn Darien and his men.</p><p>The doctor and Ritka walked past the office and Lelandi didn\u2019t stir.</p><p>Once they\u2019d reached an exam room, Doc Oliver said, \u201cMrs. Wilkerson. We\u2019ll have Willy on medication and better in no time.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi refiled her sister\u2019s health records and made for the door. Whether Trevor liked it or not, she was going to see her cousin and find out what they\u2019d done to him.</p><p>The door eased open and Lelandi\u2019s heart nearly quit.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Doc.</p><p>Joe Kelly hurried inside and shut the door. Snow covered his coat, hair and whiskers, and his eyes had a madman\u2019s look. \u201cSearching for Larissa\u2019s file?\u201d He pulled a gun out and motioned for Lelandi to back up against the wall.</p><p>A sickening feeling rippled through her. Her gaze shifted from the gun to his grim face. \u201cYou were the father of her triplets, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought Darien knew. But he either pretended not to, or was too arrogant to believe someone else had captured his mate\u2019s heart. All that crap about dream mating.\u201d</p><p>Hoping for a distraction, Lelandi backed toward the desk where she could reach the caduceus paperweight. Then she recalled her gun. Hell, she could have used it on the wolf stalking her. Slipping her hand into her pocket, she realized with a sinking heart she\u2019d exchanged jackets with Cody. Oh, god, an underage lupus garouhad her gun filled with silver bullets. Darien would kill her if this lunatic didn\u2019t beat him to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe waved his gun at her and spoke in a hushed voice. \u201cSilver bullets, Lelandi. So don\u2019t try me. She was my one true mate. She told me everything about that abusive red mate of hers, how she couldn\u2019t stand Darien\u2019s touch, but went along with the mating so he\u2019d protect her against Crassus. Not to mention that Darien insisted she was his because he\u2019d seen her in the damned dreams. When I saw you, I figured you were the one he dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClean up loose ends.\u201d</p> <p>Which meant? He\u2019d kill Doc because he\u2019d known about the pregnancy. She lunged for the heavy brass paperweight, but Joe grabbed her arm, and they fell to the floor with a thud. \u201cShit, woman. I\u2019m not going to kill you. I have to get rid of the medical records.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him for an instant. She and Doc knew about her sister\u2019s babies. Why wouldn\u2019t Joe kill them both? Hell, he had silver bullets in his gun. Why would he even be armed if he didn\u2019t intend to murder someone?</p><p>She tried to squirm loose, but Joe kept her effectively pinned down.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019ll get the records for you and you can leave,\u201d she coaxed.</p><p>\u201cNice try, Lelandi. What would prevent you from telling Darien everything you know? Even if you tried to keep your promise, he could force you to tell him the truth. I\u2019ve made arrangements with your cousin Ural to take you away from here, and I want to stay with the pack. So you\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p> <p>And Doc? She wanted to ask him what he intended to do to Doc, but she had a pretty good idea. She feared Joe would be desperate enough to do anything to cover up his deeds.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go quietly with you. Let\u2019s get the files.\u201d She hoped she could come up with a plan before anyone got hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d Ritka hollered down the hall at someone. \u201cVisiting hours are from ten to five, and as far as I know you don\u2019t have any relatives in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see the doctor. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Carol Wood?</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. Darien already said you can\u2019t have a job here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s urgent and has nothing to do with working.\u201d</p><p>Joe pulled Lelandi off the floor and motioned for her to brace the wall. Then he began shuffling through the files.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go down there to see him! He\u2019s with a patient right now!\u201d Ritka\u2019s footfalls pounded after Carol Wood\u2019s.</p><p>Then a thud sounded against the doctor\u2019s door. Carol swore, but the door banged open, and she fell into Doc\u2019s office, landing on her hands and knees.</p><p>Lelandi and Joe froze.</p><p>For a heartbeat, both Ritka and Carol stared at Joe and Lelandi, then Ritka shouted, \u201cDeputy Trevor! Break-in in progress!\u201d</p><p>Joe whipped the gun around and fired two shots at Ritka, the gunfire exploding in Lelandi\u2019s ears. She leapt at Joe and seized the weapon as Ritka crumpled to the floor. He thrust Lelandi aside. Carol screamed and scrambled to her feet, but Doc Oliver appeared in the entryway, blocking her escape. Joe fired at Doc. Clutching his chest, his eyes round, he collapsed. Carol dashed out of the office, and Lelandi dove for the brass weight.</p><p>With a lightning reaction, Joe struck the butt of his gun against her head and sent her sprawling. Flashes of pain streaked through her skull. Momentarily, she saw nothing but blackness, heard nothing, felt nothing. But then files crashed to the floor while Joe ransacked the file cabinet, until he found Larissa\u2019s. He shoved it inside his jacket, went to the window, and jerked it open.</p> <p>A mixture of snow and ice blew into the office, chilling her. She blinked her eyes, trying to clear her head.</p><p>Where the hell was Deputy Trevor? And what if Doc Mitchell arrived with Caitlin and became embroiled in this mess. And the other teens, too. She could see Cody and Anthony trying to rescue her.</p><p>Doc Oliver groaned. His face was sickly pale. Lelandi crawled over to him. Ritka was out cold, and Carol had vanished. Lelandi ripped open Doc\u2019s shirt and meant to dig out the bullet with her fingers, but Joe grabbed her hair and yanked her back. Pain shot through her scalp.</p><p>\u201cTime to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, wanting to save Doc, and clawed at Joe\u2019s fingers to free herself.</p><p>Joe seized her arm and wrenched her to the window.</p><p>\u201cYou hadn\u2019t done anything wrong before this. Why now?\u201d Lelandi struggled to break free of his iron grip, trying to control her tears. She couldn\u2019t fall apart now.</p><p>Carol peeked through the doorway with a cell phone to her ear.</p><p>\u201cGet the bullets out of the nurse and Doc! They\u2019ll kill them. Don\u2019t wait for help!\u201d Lelandi shouted, hoping the bastard wouldn\u2019t shoot her, too.</p><p>Joe shoved Lelandi through the window, and she fell into a blanket of snow. Before she could move, he climbed after her, then aimed through the window at Carol. Her heart in her throat, Lelandi scrambled to her feet and jerked his gun arm upward. The gun went off with a bang, and the bullet struck the ceiling. Bits of plaster and paint snowed down on the desk. Carol screamed and ducked down the hallway.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, woman. I ought to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi believed he would anyway. \u201cWhy shoot Ritka and the doc?\u201d she sobbed. She hoped Carol could save their lives.</p><p>\u201cDoc knew about your sister\u2019s pregnancy. Larissa was certain of it. He\u2019d have told Darien, and by pack law Darien would terminate me.\u201d He yanked her toward a pickup.</p><p>Lights flashing and sirens wailing, several vehicles surrounded the hospital.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Joe took off running, pulling Lelandi into the woods.</p><p>Hell, not again. \u201cYou can\u2019t outrun all of Darien\u2019s pack,\u201d Lelandi said as Joe nearly pulled her arm out of the socket, tugging her over the rough terrain.</p><p>She stumbled knee deep in a snowdrift, and he yanked her up. She growled. He gave her a slight smile, then they scrambled down a steep incline, half-sliding, half-falling until they reached the bottom of the ravine.</p><p>He pulled her across a brook, the icy water freezing her to the core again. The snow was still falling so heavily and the wind blowing it so hard, she could barely see.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>Joe dragged her up the mountain on the other side.</p><p>\u201cClimb,\u201d he hollered at her.</p><p>She balked.</p><p>He pointed the gun at her temple. \u201cDarien can\u2019t save you here. If I put a bullet in that pretty head of yours, they wouldn\u2019t arrive in time to get it out. So climb. It\u2019s your only hope.\u201d</p><p>Clenching her teeth, her hands numb from the frigid water and her wet clothes sticking to her like icy Saran Wrap, she struggled to make the climb.</p><p>\u201cKeep going straight up,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>She looked up, but couldn\u2019t see where he had in mind to take her. They couldn\u2019t climb mountains all day.</p><p>Unless... She glanced back at him. He was to the right of her, resting while she did.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Unless a cave was up here. She began climbing again. Maybe a secret hideaway where he\u2019d taken Larissa? Lelandi wanted to empty her lunch and kill the bastard for shooting Doc and Ritka.</p><p>Men shouted on the ridge from the direction of town. Darien and his men were coming for her. Her heart lifted, but Joe\u2019s expression turned darker. \u201cMove!\u201d</p><p>She tried to make it appear she was too weak to climb quickly, although as frozen as she was, it wasn\u2019t all pretense. He drew closer and struck her in the shoulder. She gasped and nearly fell. Her heart pounding furiously, she clung to the rugged rock face, her fingers so numb she couldn\u2019t feel the jagged edges, wishing she could have put Caitlin\u2019s gloves on.</p><p>\u201cMove, damn you! Quit stalling. Larissa wasn\u2019t half as capable as you, and she made it up this ridge twice as fast as you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m half-frozen,\u201d Lelandi snapped back.</p><p>She moved at the same pace as before, hoping she wouldn\u2019t fall to her death on the icy mountain, until she saw the ledge he pointed to. He yanked her up the last few feet and pulled her into the cave. Hopefully, someone in Darien\u2019s party knew about it.</p><p>\u201cWas this a silver mine?\u201d She tugged Caitlin\u2019s gloves out of the pocket and shoved her icy fingers into them.</p><p>\u201cUntil it played out seventy years ago. Then it shut down.\u201d He grabbed a lantern and lighted it, despite not needing it. But even the flicker of flame radiated a tiny glow of heat she welcomed. Inside the cave, it was slightly warmer than the blowing snow outside, and he handed her a hardhat. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>He was going to shoot her in the head with a silver bullet, but now he wanted to protect her from falling rocks? That was the least of her worries though as they traveled deeper into the bowels of the cave. The walls drew closer, the passageway narrower, the ceiling shorter and Lelandi began to feel hemmed in. \u201cDoes this open up pretty soon?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThey came this way!\u201d Darien shouted.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s spirits soared when she heard Darien\u2019s voice. But it was so far away, she imagined they hadn\u2019t even begun the climb up the mountain.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asked Joe, raising her voice, hoping her words would carry through the cave and back down the ridge.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Joe yanked her deeper, and she gave a hopeful smile, thinking Darien might have heard Joe\u2019s yelling if her words hadn\u2019t carried that far.</p><p>Water glistened off the granite walls and dripped on her hat, and she jerked her head to look up. The place smelled like wet earth and the air turned colder. She shivered.</p><p>\u201cForty-four degrees down here no matter what the temperature is outside,\u201d he said.</p><p>Still, it was warmer than the raging blizzard outside. But her wet clothes made it feel colder.</p><p>The ceiling sank so low, they had to crawl. The rough stone tore at the gloves, and her jeans were no protection for her knees, bruising with every inch she traversed. The place reminded her of the time she got lost in a cave of tunnels, playing hide-and-seek with her brother and sister, then fell into a small hole she couldn\u2019t get out of. Boy, were their parents mad. But since then, she cringed whenever she had to go into small places, even as a wolf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe forced Lelandi to go first, and her breathing grew more labored. She attempted to steady her breathing, calm her racing heart, ignore the tightness in her chest. But nothing was working. Time seemed to slow and the fear of dying in the tomb-like tunnel escalated.</p><p>She paused for the third time, trying to get her anxiety under control, hating that she couldn\u2019t manage it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re claustrophobic,\u201d he snarled.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I am, damn it. Larissa wasn\u2019t. She could hide in the smallest caves back home, curl up in one and wait my brother and me out when we were playing hide-and-seek, but I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>As if she\u2019d tell the bastard.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t answer him, he laughed. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Just suck it up. Now move!\u201d He shoved at her butt and she kicked back with her foot, connecting with some part of him... probably his head as it was so hard.</p><p>He yelped. \u201cDamn it, Lelandi, you\u2019re asking for trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Rocks tumbled together from up above, but the cave was so narrow at this point, she couldn\u2019t look back to see what had happened. The sound of falling rock sent chills racing across her skin. Buried alive in a rock tomb came to mind.</p><p>\u201cI have a little surprise waiting for them.\u201d</p><p>What was this maniac planning? As she reached the opening into a large cave, the mountain shook and rumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Her heart nearly stopped. Darien? His men? What if... what if anyone was badly hurt or killed in the rock slide?</p><p>She scrambled into the cave and Joe followed her out of the tunnel, her boot\u2019s imprint on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI made some assurances that if anyone tried to come in here when Larissa and I were having our special time, they couldn\u2019t tell anyone, and if they did manage to survive, they wouldn\u2019t be able to locate us.\u201d</p> <p>He was crazier than she suspected. \u201cBut you\u2019ve locked us in a tomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Two more tunnels lead out of here that are never used.\u201d</p><p>Another rumble of rocks shook her. She looked back at the tunnel they\u2019d come from. Joe seized her arm, but she jerked free, her teeth clenched, tears filling her eyes. She\u2019d found her soul mate only to lose him? \u201cIf you killed Darien, you might as well shoot me and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I haven\u2019t? Would be a shame if he found you dead, too.\u201d</p><p>He was right, the bastard. If Darien found her dead, he might not get over the grief. A clear plastic bag drew her attention, a pile of furs folded inside.</p><p>\u201cI brought them here for Larissa and me, except she died before we had the chance to use them. I tried to convince her to come away with me, but she was afraid Darien would come after us. He still thought the triplets were his. He would have killed me and taken her back if he\u2019d had to tear the world apart looking for her.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed Lelandi\u2019s arm again and yanked her toward another tunnel. \u201cThis one\u2019s shorter, not as narrow. After we make it down the mountain, we\u2019ll backtrack to town, pick up my truck, and be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need me. Darien won\u2019t care what happens to you if you leave me behind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarien took Larissa from me. Now you\u2019ll be her. Just like everyone thought in the beginning anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll look for me, just like he would have searched for Larissa. He\u2019ll never quit coming after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d risked it last time, maybe Larissa would still be alive.\u201d</p><p>As much as she didn\u2019t like the idea, Joe might be right. If Larissa had left with this man, whoever wanted her dead might not have bothered to kill her.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were taking me to Ural. That he knew where my parents were. Were you telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>BLOCKED FROM HIS BROTHERS AND THIRTY OF HIS MEN. MORE stones rained down from the initial explosion that rocked the mountain. Darien choked on the dust and rubbed his eyes so he could see the mess he was in. The rocks barricaded the tunnel entrance and no one had made it inside but him.</p><p>\u201cEveryone all right out there?\u201d he yelled, hoping to hell no one had been caught in the slide.</p><p>Jake hollered, \u201cWe\u2019re fine. You?\u201d</p><p>Highly pissed. \u201cFine here.\u201d</p><p>He listened, trying to hear any sounds indicating where Joe Kelly and Lelandi were. Nothing. At least Darien could still go after them.</p><p>Sam shouted from the other side of the blockage, \u201cWe could move the rocks, but it will take hours, boss. Mason and I used to come in another way. Less hard on the knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow the men,\u201d Darien growled. He\u2019d kill that son of a bitch as soon as he got his hands on him. If he\u2019d done anything to Lelandi...</p><p>Jake hollered, \u201cWe\u2019ll meet you around the other side, but damn it, Darien, don\u2019t get yourself shot in the meantime. Those bullets are silver.\u201d</p><p>Darien had no intention of waiting for his men to reach him while Lelandi was in Joe\u2019s clutches. \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger, about half an hour. Maybe longer now,\u201d Sam said. \u201cThe way\u2019s easier once you\u2019re inside, no low crawling, but to reach the cave, the climbing\u2019s much harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for us, Darien, damn it,\u201d Jake said again.</p><p>Darien was sure everyone knew he wouldn\u2019t. He raced through the sections of the tunnel that he could, but soon came to an area where he had to crawl. The slight scent of Larissa and Lelandi remained in the tunnel. He ground his teeth when he smelled Lelandi\u2019s fear. Joe was letting off a panicky scent also. Good. Darien hoped he was sweating fear. Damned cowardly male lupus garou who had to use a weapon to fortify himself. The notion Larissa had been here with Joe curdled Darien\u2019s stomach though.</p><p>Down on hands and knees, he traversed the narrow, low ceiling tunnel, and he envisioned Lelandi\u2019s skin being torn up by the rough-edged rocks. Damn that Joe. How could Larissa have managed? He would have seen any injuries she\u2019d incurred. Unless they\u2019d usually come in another way. Sure. Sam said the other tunnel was easier to maneuver. But this time since Joe was trying to outrun Darien and his men, he had used the cave closest to town.</p><p>When Darien finally reached the cave, he climbed out, but saw no sign of them. Except for fur blankets packed in a plastic case. His stomach and fists tightened. Two more tunnels opened out of the cave, and he hurried to one, walked in a couple of feet, but could find none of Lelandi\u2019s or Joe\u2019s scent. He raced across the cave to the other tunnel. But the sound of footfalls from two individuals approached him, making him stop dead. What the hell was Joe up to?</p><p>\u201cHow would I know the damned cave-in would trigger one over here? Or maybe someone set off the cave-in a couple of weeks ago,\u201d Joe growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the other tunnel? What if we\u2019re trapped?\u201d Lelandi sounded desperate, her voice shaking.</p><p>Darien wanted to dive into the tunnel, snap Joe\u2019s worthless neck, and hug Lelandi in his secure embrace to prove she was safe and loved and the likes of Joe would never harm her again.</p><p>\u201cShut up! Don\u2019t get hysterical on me. The other tunnel\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a little trickier getting out through that one, but we\u2019ll manage. You have to watch for the pits. Drop something in them, and you never hear it hit bottom. Lost my hardhat down the first one once. Must have stood there twenty minutes or more waiting for it to hit rock bottom, or water, or something. Nothing. Just went on forever.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, Lelandi. You won\u2019t be traversing any damned pits with this maniac. Darien stripped off his jacket, then shirt and ditched his boots, careful not to make a sound.</p><p>Lelandi and Joe\u2019s footsteps echoed off the tunnel wall as they drew closer. \u201cHe\u2019ll... he\u2019ll come after you. You know he will. If you just leave me behind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up! I told you you\u2019re going to replace my Larissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look just like her. That\u2019ll be enough for now.</p><p>You\u2019ll grow on me.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ll never have the opportunity, Joe. Darien peeled out of his jeans and stretched his arms above his head, physically and mentally preparing for the change. His face elongated into a silver snout, his teeth growing into killing weapons. His body became furred in a silver pelt and his claws extended, readied for a fight. Dropping to his pads, he waited, preparing himself for the leap that would separate Joe from his mate, his teeth itching to sink into his blood, to kill the man who would endanger his mate\u2019s life.</p><p>\u201cDamn it to hell! This one\u2019s blocked, too!\u201d Jake said on the outside of the cave at the tunnel entrance. \u201cIs there another way, Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne other tunnel. But that way\u2019s too treacherous without climbing ropes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some,\u201d Mason said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Deputy Peter added.</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take to get to that tunnel, Sam?\u201d</p><p>Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout forty minutes straight up. When I was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>Joe gave a sickly laugh, the sound echoing off the walls. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through the tunnel way before they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they said we needed climbing ropes,\u201d Lelandi warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some. You wouldn\u2019t think I\u2019d be unprepared, would you? Now come on, quit dawdling. Wouldn\u2019t want them to reach the tunnel entrance before we\u2019ve made our getaway.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019ll never even reach the tunnel entrance, Joe. Rest assured.</p><p>Joe shoved Lelandi out of the tunnel into the main cave. At once her eyes lighted on Darien, and for a minute, she looked like she was trying to figure out which wolf he might be. He bowed his head in greeting. She took a deep breath and her eyes widened. Yes, Lelandi, your silver knight in wolf pelt.</p><p>As soon as Joe stepped into the cavern, Darien leapt. No waiting for the miner\u2019s recognition that he was face-to-face with the pack leader. No long-winded staring down scenes to show who was the boss. The gun loaded with silver bullets precluded that. He couldn\u2019t risk Joe getting a shot off and possibly hitting either Lelandi or himself and leaving her in even more danger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joe\u2019s gun hand went up and he fired at the ceiling, a smattering of pebbles and dust raining down. He fell back with Darien\u2019s pounce, hitting his back and head against the unforgiving rock with an oof. Darien\u2019s teeth sank into Joe\u2019s jugular. The man never had a chance to utter more than a gurgled cry, his amber eyes wide.</p><p>Lelandi collapsed to her knees, and Darien released his grip on Joe, then swung around and nuzzled Lelandi\u2019s arm. She wrapped her arms around his neck and sobbed. Hell, he needed to be in his human form to comfort her best. He quickly shapeshifted and pulled her up. Her clothes were damp, and she was trembling hard from the cold.</p><p>\u201cI... I was so afraid he\u2019d killed you, your brothers, or some of the rest of your people in the rockslide.\u201d</p><p>Darien crushed her to him, warming her body, rubbing her arms, kissing her cheeks and her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re all right. Everyone\u2019s all right.\u201d The left side of her temple was swollen and red and a gash cut through to her eyebrow, the blood dried now along its seam. \u201cThat son of a bitch,\u201d Darien said, smoothing away her hair from the injuries.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, maybe in shock. He held her close to his body and tried to warm her, although the chilly cave was beginning to get to him. Then he noticed the glass in her hair. \u201cHell, Lelandi, did Joe hit you with a glass?\u201d</p><p>She looked like she was going to be sick. \u201cWith his pistol.\u201d She paused, her eyes focusing down. \u201cI... I had an accident before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wrecked the SUV?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her eyes glassy with fresh tears. He let out his breath and hugged her tight again. \u201cAll I care about is what happens to you. We didn\u2019t see the vehicle anywhere in town and we\u2019d trekked through the woods to locate the teens that you\u2019d found. I never thought you might have been in a wreck. Why didn\u2019t you stay at Doc Mitchell\u2019s place?\u201d He threw up his hands in resignation. \u201cForget it. You were too busy trying to get yourself killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the SUV. It\u2019s probably buried in snow off the road somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdin\u2019s teeth, Lelandi, I don\u2019t care about the damned vehicle. You... your safety, that\u2019s all that matters to me.\u201d He pulled her close and she sighed against his bare chest. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a while before my men can get us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Joe said there were climbing ropes for us to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust anything he said. Will you wait here?\u201d</p><p>She wiped the tears from her cheeks and looked so forlorn, he gave her another hard embrace. \u201cI want to get rid of his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one of the bottomless pits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he can join his hardhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll... I\u2019ll go with you. I don\u2019t want to be left behind.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hard, then released her. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d He yanked Joe\u2019s lifeless body off the floor and tossed him over his shoulder, then took Lelandi\u2019s hand. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re here, yes. How are Doc and Ritka?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t look all right. She was pale and shivering uncontrollably. Darien tightened his hold on her hand. He didn\u2019t want to tell her the news, not while they were still stuck in the cave, and after all that had happened to her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d she said under her breath, her voice tearful.</p><p>So much for not telling her. \u201cEven if Joe hadn\u2019t taken you hostage, he\u2019d signed his death warrant for killing Doc and Ritka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol couldn\u2019t get the bullets out in time?\u201d Lelandi asked, her voice barely above a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cDoc was old. He couldn\u2019t withstand the silver in his heart. By the time Carol had put on gloves, found the proper tools, and removed the bullet from Doc, then dug the two bullets from Ritka, she didn\u2019t stand a chance either.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s body sagged and Darien released her hand and wrapped his arm around her waist. \u201cLelandi, honey, we\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died because of me,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cNo, he died because Joe killed him. Because Joe had mated with Larissa. Because the babies were his and not mine. And because Doc knew it. Ritka was just a bystander. None of this has to do with you.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cDo you want to wait for me here while I get rid of Joe\u2019s carcass?\u201d The sooner he could get rid of the bastard, the quicker he could take care of Lelandi.</p><p>She shook her head and stood straighter. \u201cDoc was like an uncle I dearly loved.\u201d</p><p>He moved her farther into the tunnel. \u201cDoc was a good man. His mate preceded him in death a decade ago, and he had no offspring, but he treated us all like his sons and daughters.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi looked up at Darien, tears clouding her eyes.</p><p>Darien smiled at her. \u201cEven me. Didn\u2019t matter that I was no longer just another pup but now pack leader. He was like a revered advisor when it came to anyone who was injured or sick in the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss him,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWe all will.\u201d Darien pulled her to an abrupt stop. \u201cThe first of the pits. Wonder if this is the bottomless one Joe mentioned. I\u2019d hate for it not to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d she said, with a bitter edge to her voice.</p><p>Darien lifted Joe off his shoulder. \u201cThis is as much of a burial as you deserve, Joe, you bastard.\u201d He tossed him into the pit, then he took Lelandi\u2019s hand and walked her back to the cave.</p><p>She sniffled and wiped away another cascade of tears.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see if he hits bottom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to warm you up.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at his hard, nude body, and he smiled back at her. Her eyes met his. \u201cYour people will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly back and forth. \u201cNot as long as it takes to return to town and back again with the ropes. By the time they reach us, we\u2019ll even have time for a quick nap.\u201d</p><p>She clung to him and nuzzled her cheek against his shoulder. \u201cI... I am cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lelandi.\u201d He swept her up in his arms and held her hard against his chest; the heat of her body mixed with his, helping to warm them both.</p><p>When they reached the encased furs, he set her down, then ripped open the plastic covering and spread the faux polar bear skins out. No scent of Larissa or Joe on the skins, thank god. Lelandi took a deep breath and started to pull off her pullover sweater. Darien quickly worked on her belt. She looked so contrite, he was certain she felt sorry for having slipped away from him at the house, endangering herself and upsetting everyone. But she had rescued the kids from the cliff and the word of her good deeds was already spreading throughout the pack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what my sister did to you, Darien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s all in the past.\u201d His mouth tasted her cold lips. \u201cJust be glad we found each other.\u201d</p><p>He finished helping her undress, her body trembling from the frigid air. Then he quickly sandwiched her in between the soft furs and himself.</p><p>The furs felt comforting, dry, and warm against Lelandi\u2019s back, the contrast of Darien\u2019s lean hardness resting on top of her. He rubbed her arms, then her shoulders, and with a devilish smirk plastered on his face, his hands shifted to her breasts, heating her up. She still envisioned him in his wolf form, self-assured, feral, beautiful, her protector. She should have known he\u2019d be the one to come for her.</p><p>She dragged her fingers through his satiny hair and his teeth grazed her neck, sending a thrill through her. She swept her hands down his back, the muscles tensed with need. \u201cI love you, Darien,\u201d she mouthed against his ear.</p><p>His eyes glazed over, he growled low. \u201cNever ever leave me like that again.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, her hands stilled on his waist. \u201cI won\u2019t quit trying to find out who killed my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi...\u201d He groaned and circled a nipple with his tongue, then kissed the tip. He lifted his gaze to her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t ever lose you. Promise you\u2019ll let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips tightly together. It didn\u2019t matter that she was the female alpha leader in the pack now, as much as it mattered that she took part in avenging her sister\u2019s death. And she would, one way or another.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lelandi, I won\u2019t have you getting yourself into dangerous situations like this while you\u2019re searching for your sister\u2019s killer.\u201d</p><p>She raked her nails down his back and caressed his buttocks, squeezing and releasing. He gave out a husky moan and instantly capitulated. \u201cAll right. Ask me when you want to investigate something or someone, and I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re properly guarded.\u201d</p><p>Smiling inwardly, she loved him all the more.</p><p>The wet tip of his erection poked against her mound, and he gave her a lusty grin.</p><p>At first she rubbed against him, his eyes darkening, and he reached up to caress her breasts. \u201cHmm, Darien, you could hire out as a masseuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one body I\u2019d be interested in massaging,\u201d he said, his voice ragged. \u201cAre you going to torture me much longer?\u201d</p><p>Before she could respond, he pressed his fingers between her legs, parted her folds, and sank his fingers deep. His wet fingers rubbed her sensitized nub with exquisite strokes pushing her to the edge while his tongue danced across her nipples, teasing them into submission.</p><p>Every move Darien made heated her further.</p><p>He swept his lips over her closed eyes, down her cheek to the corner of her mouth, then brushed across her mouth in a warm, tantalizing caress. His heartbeat pounded in sync with hers, and his warm breath fanned her cheek.</p><p>\u201cLelandi, my love.\u201d His smoldering eyes took his fill and his lips curved up in a feral way while he continued to ply his strong strokes, and she forgot what she\u2019d intended to do to him, her body enraptured by his touch. If she didn\u2019t slow him down... no, keep... keep going.</p><p>Oh, oh, heavens. She felt her body elevated, her spirit soaring, elation and... and a gush of warmth flooded her, her system filled with white hot completion. The orgasm rocked her body, sending pleasurable ripples of heated passion through her, and she moaned in ecstasy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His sizzling gaze pierced her, and he didn\u2019t wait for her next move. Slipping into her swollen folds, he plunged his thick cock deep, lifting her hips so he could drive into her inner core as if seeing her body come, he was pushed nearer the edge. His eyes heavily lidded and his face flushed with pleasure, he stretched her, thrusting hard and deep and fast.</p><p>Never while she\u2019d made love to him in their dream state had she enjoyed sex this much. \u201cOh, oh, faster, harder.\u201d She dug into his buttocks. \u201cDon\u2019t... stop... now,\u201d she growled, not believing she could come again so soon after.</p><p>He chuckled and drove harder, his hands planted beside her head, and gave a final thrust, a warm bath heating her deep inside. Sinking on top of her, their bodies slippery and hot and satiated, he let out a gratified growl. \u201cThank... Odin... you... were... all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust all right,\u201d she whispered against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cThis side of heaven.\u201d He rolled off her and pulled her on top of him, his arms wrapped securely around her while he tugged the fur that had slipped off them back in place. \u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me again like you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She cuddled against his hard, sweaty chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you for rescuing me. Some rescue, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He growled, nipped her shoulder, and forced her head down on his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that whatever happens, I love you, Lelandi, and would never let any harm come to you.\u201d</p> <p>She snuggled against his chest and licked his nipple, making him groan. \u201cBetter not, or I\u2019ll give you a hard time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou already do, honey. A really hard time. Rest. We\u2019ll be out of here soon, but we have a long, difficult trek ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Hearing footfalls a couple of hours later coming from the tunnel of pits and the shorter one that was supposed to be more navigable, Darien opened a sleepy eye and hugged Lelandi tighter against his chest, her breathing shallow, her eyes closed in slumber.</p><p>\u201cHell, Darien.\u201d Jake entered the cave with ten men from the shorter tunnel, and Tom and another twenty men came from the other. \u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>Glad everyone was okay, Darien gave him a small smile. \u201cThought so, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, not me,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI knew you\u2019d be all right. Jake\u2019s the worrier in the bunch. Kept hurrying the guys to move those boulders and loose rubble, afraid we wouldn\u2019t reach you through the other tunnel in time. It was taking so long for Mason and Peter to get back with the ropes. So...\u201d Tom looked around at the cave, spied blood on the floor and took a deep whiff of the air. \u201cWhere\u2019s Joe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill making his peace with the devil in the center of the earth,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>Tom snickered. \u201cPit burial, eh? Perfectly appropriate.\u201d</p><p>Jake motioned to Lelandi. \u201cShe all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019ll be fine. Give us a moment and we\u2019ll get dressed.\u201d</p><p>Mason dropped a bundle next to Darien\u2019s clothes. \u201cSome gloves, snow shoes, and a heavy-duty parka for the little lady, more her size. The blizzard\u2019s whipping up pretty hard out there.\u201d He gave Jake a stern look. \u201cWhich is why it took us so long to get back to the mountain. It had nothing to do with my age.\u201d</p><p>Tom laughed and slapped Jake on the shoulder as the men hurried out through the short tunnel. \u201cSee, what\u2019d I tell you? Here we are slaving away to protect Darien\u2019s ass, and he\u2019s cozied up with his mate in a love nest of furs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, pack leader thinking.\u201d Jake headed out with Tom.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you moved those boulders to clear the passageway,\u201d Sam said, inside the tunnel.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want Lelandi to have to take the hard way out. Blizzard\u2019s going to be difficult enough to get through,\u201d Jake remarked.</p><p>\u201cGood thing we have those ropes,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Jake chuckled. \u201cYeah, so we can all get lost together.\u201d</p><p>Wanting to get Lelandi home safely, Darien kissed her ear to wake her. \u201cHoney, time to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, maybe everyone should stay here in the cave until the storm blows over,\u201d Lelandi murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot enough furs to keep everyone warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could all turn wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather be in the privacy of my bed with you. Come on, sleepyhead. Time to get up and get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so warm here, and so...\u201d She shivered. \u201cSo cold out there.\u201d She pointed one finger outside the furs.</p><p>He kissed her finger. \u201cI\u2019ll help you dress faster.\u201d Darien slipped out from under the covers, threw his clothes on, then slid his cold hands under the furs to Lelandi\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cOh heavens, Darien. Your fingers are like ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way, Cody gave me back my favorite leather jacket. He warned me it had a gun in the pocket and figured you took it with you to protect yourself.\u201d He tilted his chin down and gave her an exasperated look.</p><p>\u201cHe offered me his parka so I\u2019d stay warmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for that,\u201d Darien said, helping her into her clothes, \u201cI was grateful. But sheesh, Lelandi...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t remember the gun was in your jacket pocket until Joe pulled his on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank Odin for that. I could imagine you shooting each other and neither of you making it.\u201d</p><p>He bundled her up to her neck in the winter parka, although he wished it was a bright color and not white where he could lose her in the blinding snow.</p><p>\u201cWe could return as wolves,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe climb is too steep on this side of the mountain.</p><p>Better suited to a mountain goat... or humans with climbing gear.\u201d</p><p>After what she\u2019d already been through, that didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>THE GUYS ALL GAVE LELANDI SURREPTITIOUS SMILES WHEN she walked into the tunnel with Darien. Yeah, here they\u2019d been busting their butts, trying to save their pack leader and his mate, and what do they find?</p><p>But heck, if any of them had been stuck in a cave with their mate, they would have done the same!</p><p>The wind whipped snow in through the opening where there had been none when Joe forced her through the tunnel before. If the snow wasn\u2019t blowing so hard, she would be elated to see the sight of the mountains, but all she could see was a white blanket, disguising everything in its path.</p><p>Many of the men had started down the mountain, some waiting at various points along the trail, some down at the bottom wearing their wolf coats. If the climb hadn\u2019t been so steep, she would have welcomed shapeshifting.</p><p>Jake handed Darien a rope already attached to Sam and Mason and several others who were partway down the steep incline.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten really icy,\u201d Mason warned.</p><p>Darien tied the rope around Lelandi\u2019s waist and kissed her lips hard. \u201cTake it easy. The guys down below will stop your tumble if you slip. I\u2019ll hold you from up above. Just concentrate on getting good toe and finger holds, and you\u2019ll be down at the bottom before you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Darien.\u201d She glanced at Jake and Tom.</p><p>\u201cAnd to all of you who came to my rescue.\u201d</p><p>Jake took the rope that Darien had tied to himself.</p><p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work. Think nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>Tom grinned. \u201cHey, we were rescuing Darien, too, but he\u2019ll never admit it.\u201d</p><p>Darien chuckled, his icy breath mixing with the blowing snow. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d arrive in time.\u201d</p><p>He crouched down on the ledge and helped ease Lelandi over it. Her stomach iced with fear. Climbing up, no problem. But this side was much steeper, and the hand and foot holds were so far apart, much better suited to the grays\u2019 long reach, that she had to slide down partway to reach the next toe or finger hold. Every time she did, Darien held tight to the cliff face to ensure she didn\u2019t pull him and the others off the mountain. Sam and the others below waited until she caught hold of something.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Tom shouted from several feet above Jake.</p><p>\u201cSlow,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s getting tired.\u201d Darien\u2019s voice showed concern.</p><p>She wished he hadn\u2019t said that because although every muscle ached with fatigue, she didn\u2019t want it advertised to every gray out here. What would they think about her ability to be the female leader?</p><p>\u201cWait up, boss.\u201d Sam began to climb back up. \u201cShe can\u2019t reach a foothold.\u201d</p><p>She wanted desperately to jump down to the bottom of the cliff, wishing the snow would cushion her fall.</p><p>\u201cTry to grasp onto anything, Lelandi. Sam will help you.\u201d</p><p>Everyone waited while Sam climbed below Lelandi, the wind-driven snow buffeting her, threatening to pull her from her tentative grip on the jagged rocks. But she couldn\u2019t make a move down or to either side. She wondered if Larissa could have come this way. How could she have managed? But maybe the snow and ice made the difference.</p><p>\u201cPut your right foot in my hand, and I\u2019ll guide you to a shelf,\u201d Sam coaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pull the rest of you off the mountain.\u201d Lelandi\u2019s voice wavered, although she was trying to keep it together for Darien.</p><p>A pack leader\u2019s bitch was strong. Not a panicked weakling. But her arms and legs were growing wearier by the second, and her fingers and toes were already dead from the cold. If she could have had viable foot and hand holds all the way down, she\u2019d be at the base of the mountain by now.</p><p>\u201cLelandi, concentrate on what Sam\u2019s saying. As petite as you are, you weigh nothing. The rest of us are fine.\u201d</p><p>She reached out her foot, not believing she could stretch that far, and touched Sam\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now put your weight on my hand and lean to your right. I\u2019ll move you to the ledge. It\u2019ll be slow going. Easy does it. One inch at a time.\u201d</p><p>Sam crept across the rock face while helping her. \u201cOkay, here you go.\u201d She grasped a rock and pulled herself to the ledge. \u201cThere\u2019s enough room for two, Darien.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darien was down in seconds, standing on the ledge with Lelandi, holding her body against the rock face, warming her. Jake and Tom moved farther down. The rest who were tied to the rope waited.</p><p>\u201cYou can make it.\u201d Darien kissed Lelandi\u2019s cheek, heating her icy skin.</p><p>\u201cI... I wish I were a lot taller.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish you any other way.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get you down from here. The longer we\u2019re in this cold, the harder it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m holding everyone up so much. They\u2019d all be warm in their beds by now if I wasn\u2019t so slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi, believe me when I say everyone here wants nothing more than to bring you back safely. You\u2019re one of us. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... I\u2019m ready.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t. She figured that however long she had to climb was going to be as difficult as the many feet she\u2019d already traversed. She was wrong.</p><p>Darien eased her down over the ledge, and she found her first good foothold she\u2019d managed to find in the last half hour. Sam waited before he moved back down. Probably a good thing because if she got stuck like the last time, he\u2019d have to waste more energy climbing back up to her. Poor bartender. She hoped Silva would give him a really good backrub when he made it back to town.</p> <p>She reached for another rock, but couldn\u2019t grasp it, and made a slight jump for it, like she\u2019d done so many times before. But the rock was icy and she lost her grip and slid.</p><p>\u201cHold on!\u201d Darien shouted, and everyone braced themselves as Lelandi fell below Sam, the wind twisting her until she was dangling upside down.</p><p>She was nearly eye level with Mason, and she offered him a frozen smile. \u201cI just found a faster way to get down.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and began to climb up, tugging at her until he was able to get her feet below her body and one planted on a sturdy rock jutting out. He looked up at Darien and Sam. \u201cShe\u2019s secure. One hell of a trooper, Darien.\u201d</p><p>Man, the pack would be laughing about this for eons. Yet no one looked like they thought she was ready for a clown suit. Instead, everyone looked like they worried she\u2019d never make it. But damn it, she would make it. Even if she had to go down headfirst to get there. At least she\u2019d made some more progress!</p><p>Sam made his way past her and then men on either side of her roped together with their own lines, reached for her to move her down another few inches, and then another few, while Darien and his group hung on tight to the cliff every time she slipped.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m at the bottom!\u201d Mason shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re almost here!\u201d</p><p>Thank god. Lelandi was frozen to the bone, and she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d thaw out until summer.</p><p>Sam shouted next, \u201cI\u2019ve got you!\u201d</p><p>But although he reached for her, two other men brought her down to the base of the mountain, and she sank in the deep snow.</p><p>Darien was beside her in the next instant and untied the rope from her waist. \u201cCan you shapeshift, Lelandi?\u201d</p><p>Peter shouted from somewhere deep in the white bleakness, \u201cGot a sled, boss! We\u2019ll tow her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can shapeshift,\u201d Lelandi objected, not wanting to show how inept she was, yet when she tried to take a step, her legs were shaky and to her mortification, she stumbled.</p><p>Darien grabbed her arm and pulled her tight.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone down from the mountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll down,\u201d Tom confirmed.</p><p>\u201cAll down,\u201d Tom confirmed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see that everyone gets in safely.\u201d</p><p>Peter and his sled came into sight, pulled by a dozen wolves. Lelandi smelled their lupus garou scent and gave a tired smile. Several of the men deposited their clothes on the sled and shapeshifted, then spread out on the way to Darien\u2019s place.</p><p>\u201cLittle lady okay?\u201d Mitchell asked from somewhere in the mist of snow.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Doc, cold, but we\u2019ll have her home and warmed up in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have slipped away like you did after leaving the kids off at my ranch,\u201d Mitchell said, his gruff voice scolding. \u201cThe kids were upset when they heard the same maniac who took you hostage murdered Doc and Ritka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they going to be all right?\u201d She hated how guilty her voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019ll heal in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaitlin... is she...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. But I need to talk to her parents.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, Darien was still in the dark about Caitlin\u2019s pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cI take it Joe is no longer a problem,\u201d Mitchell said.</p><p>\u201cPit burial,\u201d Tom piped up from some feet behind, sounding proud as he yanked off his gloves.</p><p>\u201cBetter than what he deserved,\u201d Jake grumbled.</p><p>Peter said, \u201cSeveral of our men wanted to know if they could pull guard duty. Despite the weather, six reds drove into town.\u201d</p><p>All at once, Lelandi felt sick to her stomach. It had to be Bruin and his brother Crassus looking to return Larissa and her home. Darien rubbed her back.</p><p>\u201cOne of them said he was Larissa\u2019s mate. The other was named Bruin, the guy\u2019s brother and pack leader at Wildhaven. He says Lelandi now belongs to Crassus, and he wants both women returned to the pack at once. So our guys want to know if you need them for guard duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>Darien shielded Lelandi from the blowing wind while she removed her clothes and shapeshifted. Stretching her arms above her head, she welcomed the painless change. Her face elongated into a nice-sized feminine snout, the red furred mask reaching the length of her nose, and the underside of her chin and chest\u2014an elegant white. She stretched her legs out, her tail straight and proud. Her eyes looked more amber than green when she was in her wolf\u2019s pelt, and she took a deep breath.</p><p>Darien smiled at her wolf form. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, you know.\u201d</p><p>She nudged his leg and he hurried to strip and change.</p><p>Once he had, she stuck close to him, but kept examining the other wolves. Trying to learn who they all were? Eventually she\u2019d know the whole pack, but unless she could smell them, she wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize who they were unless she\u2019d seen them change.</p><p>He rubbed her muzzle with his face as they trotted to his house, a couple miles away. Even so, she seemed wary, the way she pulled her ears back, her body snug against his so she\u2019d keep her bearing as they moved, but she kept looking around at the other wolves. He wished he could ask her what was wrong. Attempting a calming signal, he turned his head and licked the back of her head. She whipped her head around, and he nuzzled her face. Her narrowed eyes softened. Several of his pack watched her behavior, knowing something was wrong. He wished she\u2019d told him what the matter was before they\u2019d shapeshifted.</p><p>As soon as they arrived at Darien\u2019s house, Sam began making coffee and hot chocolate for the men, while Darien and Lelandi shapeshifted and dressed in the den, then he ushered her toward the stairs to take a hot shower. \u201cWhat was the matter in the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gray attempted to attack me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Lelandi. Why didn\u2019t you tell me? I take it you didn\u2019t get his scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you describe him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray and big. Really big.\u201d</p><p>Jake pulled a sweater over his head. \u201cThat describes more than half of our men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jake,\u201d she said, her voice irritated. \u201cIf I saw him in wolf form again, I\u2019d probably know him.\u201d She let out her breath. \u201cWhat about Bruin and his men?\u201d</p><p>Trevor sauntered into the living room and gave her a disgruntled look. \u201cThey\u2019ve been put up at Hastings Bed and Breakfast. They didn\u2019t like that they couldn\u2019t see you right away, Darien, especially since she\u2019s one of their pack. He\u2019s a pack leader so should be treated accordingly.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cAny pack leader who allows his males to abuse the females has my condemnation, not respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff is keeping them occupied. He\u2019s got another four guys down there, watching to make sure no one gets out of hand. Bruin\u2019s brother, Crassus, a subchief, demands the release of his mate from our custody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him she had a proper burial?\u201d</p><p>Trevor skirted Darien\u2019s comment. \u201cHe said Lelandi is his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy\u2019s a bold-faced liar,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cBruin said that it\u2019s a pack law, if a mate\u2019s life was ended and a sibling was available, if the male wished her to replace the dead mate it was up to him, the pack leader, and her father.\u201d</p><p>An ancient law. Great.</p><p>\u201cConvenient since the pack leader\u2019s his brother,\u201d Darien said, his face tight, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Trevor lifted a shoulder. \u201cAnd her father is dead. He said he did the mating ritual with her in absentia. It\u2019s an ancient ritual. But it\u2019s valid.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never heard anyone actually use it in contemporary times, but Darien wouldn\u2019t go along with it, so it was a moot case.</p><p>\u201cNot as far as we\u2019re concerned.\u201d Darien gave Lelandi\u2019s hand a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cIs this a fight we want to get involved in?\u201d Trevor asked.</p><p>\u201cHave to. You say the sibling has to be available?\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s lower lip dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way to claim a mate permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be agreeable.\u201d Trevor glanced at Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to convince her, then, won\u2019t I?\u201d Darien moved Lelandi toward the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll start your shower.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t have widened any further.</p><p>\u201cGuess you didn\u2019t get the word. They\u2019re already mated.\u201d Tom gave Trevor a slap on the back. \u201cSo, where were you while the rest of us were rescuing the lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I was with the sheriff, trying to sort this red pack business out. It would have been helpful to know that Darien took her as his mate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to tell the pack leader the news,\u201d Tom said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had time to tell the rest of our pack yet. But I\u2019m sure after the cave incident, the word will quickly spread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened at the cave?\u201d</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cYou should have been with us. Much more interesting I\u2019m sure than what you were up to.\u201d</p> <p>Darien smiled and kissed Lelandi as he walked her up the stairs. \u201cGuess I\u2019ve been a little remiss in letting the pack know you\u2019re one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any regrets, do you? I mean, you\u2019re not afraid I can\u2019t deal with the fallout, are you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his bedroom and shut the door. \u201cLike what? That you won\u2019t be loved by my people?</p><p>You will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe women who wanted me as a mate?\u201d He laughed and pulled off her sweater and dropped it on a chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Ritka. I never said so before because I was so upset about Doc. But I really am sorry. She didn\u2019t deserve to die either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Lelandi.\u201d He took a deep breath and slipped her boots off. \u201cThis will cause us trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruin will want to fight you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Darien gave her a brilliant smile. \u201cNo. Well, maybe. But the outcome won\u2019t be what he\u2019d expect. No. I was thinking about the staffing at the hospital. With Ritka gone, Carol Wood will insist that she\u2019s hired on at the hospital. I\u2019ve got a real problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any nurse\u2019s training, but I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help.\u201d</p> <p>He placed his hands on her face and tilted her head back. \u201cI\u2019ll send human patients to other hospitals in nearby towns until we get it sorted out. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cWhat happened to Ural? Why was he in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>Darien sighed deeply. \u201cI didn\u2019t authorize it, but Uncle Sheridan knocked him out when Ural made a crude comment about one of our female grays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was the shooter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sheriff nearly killed him for it?\u201d</p><p>Darien lifted her chin and looked into her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t authorize it. Uncle Sheridan took it upon himself to knock Ural out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Ural revealed who the shooter was?\u201d</p> <p>Darien stared at her for a minute, then shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re implying, but Ural just pushed Uncle Sheridan\u2019s buttons.\u201d</p><p>But had Ural pushed Sheridan\u2019s buttons or did he have something to hide?</p><p>\u201cSo is Ural all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, back in jail with a swollen cheek, but Silva told us herself she was the shooter.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cLong story. I\u2019ll tell you later about it.\u201d He pressed her lips with a warm, hot kiss and her whole body liquefied.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She sighed deeply. He was trying to get her mind off the problems the pack faced, but she couldn\u2019t quit worrying about it. \u201cWhat about Nurse Grey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can handle a lot of the cases\u2014mostly lupus garou. But she\u2019ll be shorthanded for anything major. Although we have Matthew now, too.\u201d He unfastened her belt.</p><p>\u201cDoctor Weber!\u201d</p><p>Darien lifted his head from kissing her throat and gave her a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lupus garou from my father\u2019s original pack.</p><p>We have to bring him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a red.\u201d</p><p>She gave Darien an annoyed look. \u201cI\u2019m a red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d He kissed her lips, forcing her to kiss him back. She couldn\u2019t resist and probed his mouth with her tongue. \u201cWhat I mean is he might not want to join a gray pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will. I know he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send the correspondence offering him a job.\u201d He sighed heavily. \u201cI don\u2019t want you digging into this mess concerning your sister on your own anymore.\u201d She tried to pull away, but he held her firm. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>She glowered at him. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows and gave her a wickedly provocative look.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m just supposed to be your sexual playmate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d he teased. He grabbed handfuls of her hair and touched his nose to the strands. \u201cYou smell like the great outdoors, wild and sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She licked his lips. \u201cYou taste feral and sinful.\u201d With a fever that couldn\u2019t be quenched, she wanted him. She grasped his hand and tugged him toward the bathroom. \u201cYou were going to help me with my shower. Right?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arm around her and pulled her back tight against his chest. Leaning over her, he rested his mouth next to her ear, and slid his fingers into her jeans, then touched her between the legs. \u201cHmm, nice and wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d She wriggled against his fingers.</p><p>Oh man, she\u2019d never make it to the shower at this rate.</p><p>His cock had grown rock hard and was prodding her backside. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get you into the shower now...\u201d He slipped the lace of the low-cut bra down, exposing her breasts. Turning her around, he leaned down, licked a nipple, and blew on it, sending shivers streaking across her skin. Instantly, the cool air made the nipple pucker. He smiled and licked the other with his tongue in a circle, then blew on it, too.</p><p>He tackled her jeans, his breathing heavy, his heartbeat accelerated.</p><p>Lelandi unbuttoned Darien\u2019s shirt and slid it down to his elbows, then held him hostage, his chest and shoulders bare. Strong and virile, he was a lupus garou in his prime, and all hers. Leaning down, she licked his nipple and gave him the same wisp of breath to tease him. His nipple pebbled, and he groaned low with need.</p><p>\u201cHmm, like that, do we?\u201d</p><p>He nipped her chin with a playful bite. Lelandi laughed and licked his other nipple. He shivered and the craving for satisfaction swept her up in the feel of him, his satiny skin, tangy velvet against her tongue.</p><p>He held Lelandi\u2019s arms tightly and nuzzled her neck with his mouth, and took another deep breath, no doubt smelling her musky scent of arousal. She tilted her head back, her crotch tingling because he touched her throat so exquisitely.</p><p>Whispering in his ear, \u201cI love you,\u201d she licked inside, then nibbled the lobe.</p><p>Growling, he swept her off her feet and carried her into the bathroom. He set her down, reached into the shower, and turned on the water. \u201cI want you, Lelandi. Now.\u201d</p><p>The feeling was mutual, and they shed the rest of their clothes. She reached for the peach body wash so she could run her fingers over every inch of him with the light sweet scent.</p><p>As soon as the water was hot, he lifted her into the tub and sprayed the silky water all over her body, then aimed the pulsating nozzle between her legs. She squealed and laughed.</p><p>He soaped her breasts and she flicked her nails over the soft soap coating his nipples. They quickly moved their hands lower, his sweeping erotically between her thighs, while she enjoyed scrubbing his erection and watched fascinated when it jumped in her hands.</p><p>He chuckled darkly and hurried to rinse them off.</p><p>\u201cYou will be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems appropriate since you wring out my emotions, too,\u201d she said, kissing his throat.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t comment, except to give her a smoldering smile, then lifted her against the tile shower wall, wrapped her legs around him, and thrust deeply into her slippery sheath.</p><p>\u201cAdonis,\u201d she moaned against his shower-kissed skin. He was so hot.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cMy redheaded goddess.\u201d</p><p>The pleasurable assault of his kisses on her lips, her cheeks, her throat, drove her toward the peak of pleasure while he buried himself inside her. Plunging deep and slow and hard, the tension in his face eased, he let out a tired groan, and a wash of heat filled her. His hot kisses teased her mouth to open for him, his tongue tangled with hers, and her body exploded into a million earth-shattering pieces of pleasure. She collapsed in his arms and wanted to cuddle with him in bed for all eternity.</p><p>After drying and slipping into bed, they slept.</p><p>But their sleep was cut short when Jake hollered from downstairs, \u201cDarien, Uncle Sheridan\u2019s here and so is Chester McKinley.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>NOT PLANNING ON BEING LEFT OUT OF ANY MORE BUSINESS concerning her sister, Lelandi nearly leapt out of Darien\u2019s arms and headed for her discarded clothes in the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m sitting in on this, Darien.\u201d But she wondered what had changed his mind about talking to Chester.</p><p>\u201cI guess I have no say in the matter.\u201d He yanked on his jeans, his expression lightly teasing.</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m not a beta wolf.\u201d Lelandi quickly buttoned her shirt.</p><p>Darien walked over and rested his hands on her shoulders, his lips pressing against hers. \u201cYou\u2019re an alpha for sure. For now, I\u2019ll allow it... as an alpha male.\u201d He rebuttoned her shirt.</p><p>\u201cBetter put on a sweater or I\u2019ll have to kick Chester McKinley\u2019s butt out of here, because no doubt he\u2019d take a longer look at you than I\u2019d care for.\u201d</p><p>She jerked on a pullover sweater and slipped into a pair of jeans. \u201cDespite whatever anyone told you, he was a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that.\u201d Darien zipped her jeans for her. He lifted her chin and gazed into her green eyes sparkling with fire. \u201cI have no intention of keeping you out of the picture if you\u2019re going to look into this by yourself and put your life in more danger. I understand as an alpha you can\u2019t wait for others to do everything for you.\u201d He leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll solve this.\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him and squeezed tight, her head pressed against his chest. \u201cI love you, you big gray.\u201d</p><p>Cheered to see her feeling better, he tousled her hair, then led her downstairs to the living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Upon seeing Lelandi, Uncle Sheridan raised his brows in question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying for the meeting,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cWhen women start ruling things, that\u2019ll be the end of life as we know it,\u201d Uncle Sheridan said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll improve it, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>Uncle Sheridan gave her a disparaging look.</p><p>Darien couched a smile and sat down with her on a sofa, then motioned for Chester McKinley to get on with the news.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want an outsider sticking his nose in your business, Darien, but I do this kind of work all the time and what I discover goes no farther than this room. If you want to reveal to your pack what we find, that\u2019s up to you. Nobody will hear it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. So what\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake a list of everyone who would benefit from Larissa\u2019s death and all who had grudges against her.\u201d</p><p>Darien rubbed Lelandi\u2019s hand. Although she seemed determined to be part of this, she shivered, and he thought she wasn\u2019t holding up well. But he couldn\u2019t blame her. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan handed the paper to Chester.</p><p>He perused the checklist and nodded. \u201cNormally a blackmailer continues to milk the victim for all it\u2019s worth. So there wouldn\u2019t be any reason to kill the victim and get rid of an easy source of income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless the blackmailer feared getting caught. What if Larissa had recognized who the blackmailer was?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi asked.</p> <p>\u201cBingo. Of course, it could be there was a killer and a blackmailer and neither had anything to do with the other, but I\u2019m betting they\u2019re one and the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cThirty years in the business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like more solid evidence than that,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. So we have a shooter who kills the gunman so he can\u2019t talk. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilva, the waitress at Silver Town Tavern, says she shot him, although she was only protecting Sam, our bartender, and didn\u2019t mean to kill the gunman,\u201d</p><p>Darien said.</p><p>Glancing down at the checklist, Chester rubbed his beard. \u201cIs she on the suspect list?\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi frowned. \u201cOf course not. She was friends with my sister and has been my friend ever since I first arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And oftentimes a perpetrator is the one you least suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Lelandi, even you are a suspect,\u201d Chester said.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s mouth dropped open, then she snapped it shut. Darien shook his head. \u201cWatch what you say, Chester McKinley.\u201d</p><p>After a minute of silence, Lelandi said, \u201cOf course, Chester. I see what you mean. I came here to chase after Darien, but I had to get rid of my sister first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. My point being that even Darien\u2019s brothers are suspect. Darien himself also, if you want to go that far. What about Sheriff Sheridan? He hasn\u2019t taken a vacation in ten years and then he suddenly ups and goes on one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a blamed minute,\u201d Uncle Sheridan said. \u201cI earned that damned vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention Uncle Sheridan wanted to get out of town before the second annual fair arrived,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Chester raised his hands in conciliation. \u201cI\u2019m saying we can\u2019t look at only the ones we suspect, but those who appear to be above suspicion. Keep an open mind. I have to in this business. But it\u2019s easier for me since I\u2019m not connected to anyone in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not investigating Lelandi, my brothers, or Uncle Sheridan and if this is the kind of bull\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chester raised his brows. \u201cYou want solid proof.\u201d</p><p>He dug around in his jeans pocket and pulled out a bullet and bullet casing. \u201cI found the bullet casing up on the ridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shooter\u2019s,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cI found the bullet several feet short of where the dead gunman\u2019s body had lain. Now, what if Silva\u2019s bullet fell short, but someone else fired at the same time? Did anyone hear separate shots fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The gunman shot Sam in the arm first,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cBut at least two more shots were fired. One that hit the gunman, fatally wounding him, and the other that missed its mark.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan put the bullet and casing into a plastic evidence bag. \u201cI\u2019ll get these checked right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to ask Silva if she heard another shot fired or anyone moving around near her. Smelled anyone, sensed she wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already asked her and she said no,\u201d Darien said. \u201cWhat about Lelandi\u2019s parents?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I meant to mention that first. Her cousin Ural and I had a nice, long chat. He learned your parents were being targeted for termination so that your father couldn\u2019t object to your mating Crassus. Ural moved them to Oregon, somewhere safe, then staged the car accident. When he came back for you, he discovered your pack leader had already posted a guard. So Ural waited until you escaped. He followed you here, discovered your sister had died, and wanted to take you with him to see your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, why didn\u2019t he say so? Do you have any proof they\u2019re alive?\u201d Lelandi asked, her face growing red.</p><p>Chester handed her a letter. \u201cYour mother\u2019s handwriting, correct?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes misted as she read the note. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>She choked up. \u201cMy mother says my father wants me to join them, and that they\u2019re with my brother and uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me.\u201d Darien tightened his hold on her hand. \u201cThey can live with our pack.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cKnowing my father, he wouldn\u2019t want to live with a gray pack, no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind...\u201d He watched her, waiting for her response.</p><p>\u201cI want to see them. Do they know about Larissa? They must if Ural has talked to them.\u201d She sank into the cushions, looking drained and Darien wrapped his arm around her shoulder.</p><p>Sam hollered into the house from the front door. \u201cSorry for the interruption folks, but there\u2019s a Miss Carol Wood here to see Lelandi. Is she free to speak with her?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi closed her eyes, then opened them, so not wanting to talk to the poor lady. First this business about her parents\u2014she couldn\u2019t be more pleased they were safe, but she knew how badly they must feel that Larissa was dead. And Carol\u2014she must be feeling horrible about losing both Doc and Ritka, despite their deaths not being her fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiring her at the hospital if she thinks she can win you over and try to get to me.\u201d Darien patted Lelandi\u2019s leg. His chin was down and his eyes were narrowed, conveying a guarded threat.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about.\u201d Lelandi rose from the sofa and the men all stood.</p><p>Carol and Sam remained in the chilly foyer waiting for her, Sam\u2019s expression solemn, Carol\u2019s even grimmer. Her vivid blue eyes, wearing a wealth of worry, watched Lelandi, then she turned her attention back to the living room that was hidden from their view in the foyer. None of the men talked and Lelandi wondered if that was making Carol uncomfortable, or if it was the way Sam, as big as he was, continued to chaperone them.</p><p>Lelandi took a deep settling breath and reached for Carol\u2019s hand. She didn\u2019t want to make friends with a human. Keeping the lupus garou secret precluded that, but she had to know what this was about. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the sunroom. Even though it\u2019s pretty cold out, someone probably started a nice fire. If it\u2019s not comfortable enough, we can find some other spot to sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I didn\u2019t mean to disturb you after what happened, but we have to talk.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi led Carol through the living room where the men all stood up from the couches and chairs. \u201cLadies,\u201d Darien said, his expression hard.</p><p>As if he had to warn her not to get too friendly with a human. She gave him an annoyed look back. Carol noticed; her anxious expression didn\u2019t waver.</p><p>They walked to the back of the house and Lelandi opened the door to the sunroom. Two men she didn\u2019t know were talking inside, but as soon as they saw Lelandi and Carol they both made their excuses and left the room. Lelandi shut the door and motioned to a couch that faced the fireplace and a floor-to-ceiling window that showed the winter scene outside.</p><p>\u201cUnusually early snow,\u201d Carol remarked.</p><p>But Lelandi knew Carol wasn\u2019t there for chitchat.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to approach a human about human frailties. But she could be a good listener. So instead of saying anything, she sat in the chair close to the end of the pale green couch where Carol perched herself.</p><p>Carol spoke low. \u201cI\u2019m sick with worry for your safety.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi tried to hide her surprise, but she was afraid she\u2019d failed.</p><p>\u201cI... I felt terrible about Doctor Oliver and Nurse Ritka. I... I didn\u2019t save their lives.\u201d Carol quickly brushed away tears.</p><p>Lelandi reached over and took hold of her hand and squeezed. \u201cYou did everything you could for them. I know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in fate? That our lives are predetermined? That nothing we do will change our fate? Do you?\u201d Carol pulled her hand away from Lelandi\u2019s and pushed her fingers through her wind-tousled blonde curls. \u201cI saw Joe Kelly shoot Doctor Oliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... no. I saw it happen before it happened. Don\u2019t you see? I have these damned psychic abilities, and what do they do for me? Nothing. I couldn\u2019t save him, could I? I came to stop Doctor Oliver from confronting Joe. But instead I got him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lelandi moved to the couch. She put her arm around Carol\u2019s shoulders and realized how much it was like when she comforted her sister after her mate beat her. Regret filled her with a sense of loss, knowing she could never comfort her sister again. But she wanted to help Carol get through her troubles now. \u201cJoe intended to kill Doc. He told me so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Carol pulled a tissue from her pocket and blew her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re not safe with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Darien and his brothers?\u201d Lelandi had a very bad feeling about this.</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes glistened with fresh tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what they are. But if you stay with them, they\u2019ll make you one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi\u2019s heartbeat did double time, but she tried to keep the panic hidden. If a human learned the truth about the lupus garous, Bruin discretely terminated them. A car accident, drowning, whatever it took to make it appear the human had met his end accidentally. But she couldn\u2019t be sure Carol knew about the lupus garous either.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lelandi asked as innocently as she could manage.</p><p>Carol studied her face for what seemed an eternity. Lelandi\u2019s hands grew sweaty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not one of them already, are you?\u201d Carol looked down at the floor as if she was considering something, then her head rose quickly, and she looked at Lelandi\u2019s face again, her own filled with horror. She jumped up from the couch, then offered a fake smile, her body trembling slightly. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get home and feed my cat. I forgot to leave food out for him.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi had to stop her from leaving. She had to know the truth. Did Carol realize what they were? With the gentlest of touches, she reached out to Carol. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m in a lot of danger. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to because Darien doesn\u2019t want me involved. But I am involved. Will you listen?\u201d</p> <p>Carol glanced back at the door like a rabbit looking for a quick escape from the little red wolf.</p><p>\u201cCarol.\u201d Lelandi resumed her seat on the overstuffed chair next to the couch, trying to put some distance between them so the woman wouldn\u2019t feel so cornered. A secret for a secret? She had to know what Carol suspected. \u201cSomeone was blackmailing my sister.\u201d</p><p>Carol hesitated.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you can help me find out who with your special abilities.\u201d She raised her brows. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this person was the one who killed her or not, but...\u201d</p><p>Carol sat down on the couch, leaned forward, and patted Lelandi\u2019s hand. \u201cDo you have any suspects?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s heart filled with hope that Carol might be able to help her, but she shook her head. \u201cNo one that I have any evidence on. But Ritka and her girlfriends hated Larissa. With her out of the way, they had a chance to...\u201d She almost said mate. She wasn\u2019t used to having a human confidant. Rubbing her arms, she let out her breath. \u201cDarien would be available to marry again.</p> <p>Maybe one of them was the blackmailer. Maybe they thought he\u2019d divorce her if... oh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carol said with certainty.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll three.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi closed her gaping mouth and stared at the petite woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just supposing here, but the three of them were Super-Glued together. If one did it, the others were bound to know. But the others would want a share, too.</p><p>What would they blackmail her about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was already married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. You\u2019re a prisoner here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien is determined to keep me safe, but I want to find out who was blackmailing my sister and who killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not one of them, are you?\u201d Carol asked again, her expression hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I\u2019m not from here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen things that no one should ever witness. Unnatural things.\u201d</p><p>Oh, god, no, no, Carol, don\u2019t say it.</p><p>Carol glanced back at the door, then turned to Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re part of some cult. When the moon appears, they strip off their clothes, then cover themselves in animal skins and run around in the woods howling.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi barely breathed. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen Darien and the others do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no, not for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they like nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say that again. It\u2019s always dark and difficult to make out what\u2019s happening because the cool night air mixes with the sun-warmed earth, creating a screen of fog. Some of the men and women have sex in the wilderness like they\u2019re a bunch of wild animals. You know, the men mounting the women from behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn animal skins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Carol looked at her curiously. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds a little kinky. Although I recall you saying you wished you could tell someone you\u2019d never meet again about a sexual fantasy of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely not one of them.\u201d Carol shook her head a little too vigorously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain Darien and his family and friends aren\u2019t a part of a cult. He\u2019s too busy running the factory and silver mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. But some of the people living here are in it. You have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your psychic powers ever wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I have difficulty sorting out what everything means. I saw an injured girl and felt the pain in her leg, saw her washed in a blanket of white mist. I guessed later it was the girl you rescued in the woods during the blizzard before Joe kidnapped you. But I couldn\u2019t see where she was, who she was, what happened to her, who was with her. The visions are not all that clear most of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a nightmare? Where the dreams are mixed up and run together with the oddest images?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Carol said, but she sounded like she didn\u2019t think so, that she figured Lelandi didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cI... I felt bad when Joe took you hostage. I hadn\u2019t seen that happen. I don\u2019t know why I can see some things and not others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see now? Anything in my future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man threatens to take you back home. He\u2019s a redhead, not as tall as Darien, but heavy-set. And he has a savage streak.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s heart fluttered. \u201cCrassus.\u201d</p><p>Carol stood and began to pace. \u201cBut there\u2019s someone else. A man. I can\u2019t see who, but I sense he holds a lot of anger, directed at your sister, then at you. You\u2019re not only the embodiment of Larissa, but you\u2019re trying to find her killer\u2014him. He\u2019s frustrated because he hasn\u2019t been able to get to you. But he\u2019s someone Darien trusts.\u201d</p><p>Chill bumps erupted on Lelandi\u2019s arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how he plans to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Carol tried to smile. \u201cI really admire you. No matter what, you stand up for yourself. I wish I could be more like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are, Carol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I still don\u2019t have a job at the hospital. But you never give in. If I see anything else, I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stood and took Carol\u2019s hand, but Carol gave her a warm hug back. \u201cSomehow we\u2019ve been thrown together... maybe because our sisters both died and were so depressed. I don\u2019t know. But I... I have to help you if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Carol. Maybe with your abilities, you can.\u201d But how in the hell could Lelandi help Carol? If anyone learned she might be seeing lupus garous mating in the woods on moon-filled nights, the powers-that-be would eliminate her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get home,\u201d Carol said. \u201cI really did forget to feed Puss this morning. He\u2019ll be roaring by the time I return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the front door. If you learn anything more...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi shook her head.</p><p>Carol ran her hand over her arm. \u201cI\u2019ll drop by.</p><p>They\u2019ll be listening in on your phone conversations, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi snorted. \u201cProbably. They think everyone\u2019s suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRightly so. First, that guy shot you, then Joe took you hostage, then... why were you in the blizzard with the girl who\u2019d been injured?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled. \u201cSearching for evidence about my sister. I escaped the house.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cBut it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why not. You could have died out there.\u201d</p><p>Carol opened the door to the sunroom, and they headed to the living room.</p><p>The men stood. Darien\u2019s face looked dark and his brothers and the others\u2014Chester, Sam, Uncle Sheridan\u2014all looked as concerned. Had one of them listened in on Carol\u2019s conversation with Lelandi through a vent or some damned thing?</p><p>\u201cCan I have a word with you, Miss Wood?\u201d Darien motioned to the sunroom.</p><p>Carol looked like she was ready to have heart failure.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s whole body chilled with fear, and she felt sick to her stomach.</p><p>Jake said to Lelandi, \u201cI need to talk to you. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>Torn, she didn\u2019t know what to do. She wanted to protect Carol from her mate when she should have been totally loyal to him and to the pack, to all lupus garous, first and foremost. Darien gave her a look like she better do what was expected of her.</p><p>That\u2019s when Lelandi snapped.</p><p>\u201cSure, but I want to see what Darien has to say to Carol first.\u201d She gave the men all her sweetest smile, faked to high heaven.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Darien didn\u2019t sound like it was fine with him.</p><p>The three of them walked into the sunroom. Carol looked pale and as uncomfortable as if Darien and his family had just pronounced she was a witch and at any moment the inquisition would burn her at the stake. Lelandi didn\u2019t feel much better.</p><p>None of the men looked happy with either Lelandi or Carol. But Lelandi didn\u2019t care. If Carol hadn\u2019t wanted to help her, the woman wouldn\u2019t be in this untenable situation now.</p><p>Darien waited for them to sit and then gave his full attention to Carol as if Lelandi wasn\u2019t there. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Lelandi\u2019s health,\u201d he said smoothly.</p><p>Carol glanced at Lelandi, her look one of disbelief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lelandi was sure she appeared as astonished. What the hell was he up to?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re afraid someone plans to kill her, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s constantly under guard. She wants to learn who blackmailed her sister and murdered her. But I can\u2019t let her run around town on her own. You know what\u2019s happened to her already. In that light and because you\u2019re unhappy with your job prospect as a nurse at the school, I\u2019m offering you a job as Lelandi\u2019s personal nurse. If anything should happen to her, your medical knowledge could save her life. Your salary would be commensurate with what you would earn at the hospital, but you would only need keep Lelandi company when she wishes it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have a cat and...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJake will see to the cat\u2019s care. Doc Mitchell will board him until you\u2019re ready to return home.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi felt cornered into making a decision. But she was certain if she didn\u2019t agree, Carol\u2019s life would hang in the balance. \u201cUntil you can catch the bastard who murdered my sister, I think it\u2019s a perfect solution, Darien. Of course, if you agree to it, Carol.\u201d</p><p>Carol didn\u2019t appear comfortable with agreeing to the conditions of her new employment. \u201cWould I be free to go and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Darien\u2019s face remained stern, determined. He would have his way, one way or another.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go. It\u2019s up to you. I would hope that you\u2019d consider my terms favorably for Lelandi\u2019s sake though. If you don\u2019t stay here around the clock, however, there\u2019s no sense in you being here. Who knows when the killer will strike again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go home and get some clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom will take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Carol offered a smile, but the warmth didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do this for Lelandi. And hope to god I can make a difference if need be.\u201d She rose from the couch.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Darien motioned to the door and when he opened it, he said, \u201cTom, take Miss Wood to her place to get some clothes. Jake, you can take her cat to Doc Mitchell\u2019s for boarding until we get this situation cleared up with Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>Carol still looked like she thought they were going to burn her at the stake.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a little bit,\u201d Lelandi promised. \u201cI haven\u2019t baked anything in eons with my sister. Maybe we can whip up something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn apple pie?\u201d</p><p>Darien looked somewhat mollified with Lelandi\u2019s response. \u201cRun her by the grocery store and get whatever ingredients they need.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s expression brightened and she had more of a spring to her step when she left the house with Darien\u2019s brothers. But as soon as the door shut, Darien gave Lelandi a look like she\u2019d overstepped her bounds. He took her hand and led her up the stairs without saying a word and although everyone watched them, no one said anything either. She was in trouble now.</p><p>She had no good reason for getting on Darien\u2019s bad side either. If Carol knew they were lupus garous, she put them all at risk. Lelandi had no business covering for her.</p><p>When they reached the bedroom, Darien released her and shut the door. She felt small and unworthy under his steely gaze. She didn\u2019t say anything, not sure how to respond, and he finally blew out his breath. \u201cWhat the hell was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to warn me I was in danger. We all know that. So what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi.\u201d Darien ran his hands up and down her arms. \u201cShe\u2019s dangerous. How long have you known she has psychic abilities?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve only met her once before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she told you then?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. \u201cI... I don\u2019t want her killed.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight and kissed her forehead. \u201cWe have to do what\u2019s right for the pack. In days gone by, we could have someone institutionalized if they\u2019d seen one of us turn wolf. But we can\u2019t do that anymore. If she does have visions that involve you and whoever this maniac is, I want her here. And I want to know about it immediately. We\u2019ll put her talent to good use and take it from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when she\u2019s not of any more use... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can work something out.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t think he would. The pack took priority.</p><p>Lupus garou took priority. One human woman was of little consequence.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe she sees us as humans wearing animal skins, howling at the moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says it\u2019s dark. And it would be for her. We can see at night. She wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s a fog. Yet, she seems to see a hell of a lot despite it being nighttime while the cultists run around in a fog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you implying?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m implying that she sees us as wolves, not as humans wearing furs. She was testing your reaction, seeing how you responded to the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s afraid I\u2019d think she was crazy?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek. \u201cOr, because you\u2019re one of us, and she wanted to see if you\u2019d betray this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she think I am?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, I don\u2019t believe she thought I was. Then something made her reconsider. In the end, I felt she wasn\u2019t sure. Maybe she trusted me. Until you said she had to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your safety and hers. If anyone found out she might be able to identify whoever murdered Larissa, Carol would be a dead woman.\u201d Darien paused for a minute, letting the seriousness of the situation sink in.</p><p>\u201cOh, I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf any of the lupus garous of the pack discovered she might be able to tell the world about us, one of them might not wait for me to make a decision concerning her disposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand fully.\u201d</p><p>He hugged her tightly, wanting to keep her safe from all the evils of the world, but already he was worrying about Carol and her abilities to see the lupus garous as they were, and what he would have to do if things got out of hand. He knew if he didn\u2019t handle the matter right, he\u2019d end up driving a wedge between himself and his mate.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>AFTER SETTLING IN, LELANDI AND CAROL MADE TWO APPLE pies, while Tom and Jake took Darien aside to speak to him privately in his office. He figured there had been more trouble with their new live-in guest.</p><p>\u201cCarol tried to sneak a gun into her bag, but I told her you and your men were the only ones who would be armed. She didn\u2019t like it, but finally gave in,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be a problem. But maybe she can use these abilities of hers to warn us before whoever murdered Larissa strikes at Lelandi again,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>A rapping at the door sounded.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Darien asked gruffly.</p><p>Lelandi opened the door, her face strained.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Carol?\u201d Darien asked, already leaving the office. He was sure the woman would attempt to flee if given the opportunity. She didn\u2019t appear to be the fighting sort.</p><p>Lelandi grabbed his arm. \u201cDarien, Silva\u2019s here helping her with the pies. But Carol had a... premonition. A group of men are coming to see you. They\u2019re angry, but they\u2019re not the real problem. Another group is planning on slipping into a bedroom to steal me away. She doesn\u2019t see what happens afterward, just that we\u2019ve got trouble coming soon.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s phone rang and Tom grabbed it off the desk. \u201cYeah?\u201d He looked up at Darien, his expression darkened. \u201cUncle Sheridan says he couldn\u2019t keep the reds at Hastings B&amp;B. They\u2019re on their way here.\u201d</p><p>When everyone glanced at Lelandi, she lifted a shoulder. \u201cCarol sees things sometimes. I guess she really does have psychic abilities.\u201d</p><p>He was having a hard time believing it, but already adrenaline was coursing through his veins, getting him ready for a fight. \u201cTom, tell Uncle Sheridan I want him and both his deputies here.\u201d Darien took Lelandi\u2019s hand and kissed it, hoping not to show how anxious he was about her. \u201cI want you and Silva in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Carol?\u201d</p><p>Jake said, \u201cShe can\u2019t be allowed to see what happens when we have to fight. She\u2019ll be traumatized.\u201d</p><p>Everyone headed out of Darien\u2019s office.</p><p>Carol would be more than traumatized. Tension filled every muscle in Lelandi\u2019s body. She wasn\u2019t worried that the grays would beat the reds. Well, maybe a little. Bruin and his brothers could be pretty underhanded and brutal. But she was worried about Carol and Silva, too.</p><p>\u201cUncle Sheridan\u2019s getting his deputies and a few others to guard the place,\u201d Tom said. \u201cDo you want me to watch Carol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be with Jake. Are you ready to play the alpha leader again?\u201d</p><p>Jake gave him an evil smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Carol?\u201d Lelandi asked, her blood growing cold.</p><p>\u201cAsk her. I\u2019m sure she knows what\u2019s going to happen already.\u201d He led Lelandi toward the kitchen. \u201cHave both Silva and Carol go with you to the bedroom. You\u2019ll watch something on television, pretend like nothing is out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan barged into the house with Peter and Chester McKinley.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Trevor?\u201d Darien asked, his tone annoyed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to help even though I\u2019m not one of your pack, if you\u2019ll let me,\u201d Chester said.</p><p>Darien glanced out the front window. Several gray wolves were positioning themselves around the estate. \u201cAll right. You stay with Jake and Tom.\u201d</p><p>Darien amazed Lelandi at every turn. Normally, a pack leader wouldn\u2019t want interference from a wolf he didn\u2019t trust and know well when a serious crisis was at hand.</p><p>He kissed Lelandi\u2019s cheek. \u201cGo, move the women upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope the pies are done.\u201d She hurried off to the kitchen, praying Darien knew what he was doing concerning Carol and that no one would hurt her in the impending fracas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe reds arrived in the drive,\u201d Tom warned.</p><p>\u201cCarol, Silva, how far along are the pies?\u201d Lelandi asked, her pulse pounding.</p><p>Silva gave her a knowing look. \u201cWe brought them out to cool.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuper. Why don\u2019t we go up to one of the bedrooms and watch some TV?\u201d She motioned toward the living room.</p><p>\u201cSure, sugar. Sounds like a great idea.\u201d</p><p>Carol offered a wary smile. \u201cLove to until the pies are ready to eat. We need to make sure we get some before the guys scarf them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d Lelandi waited for Silva and Carol to leave first. She tried to keep the panic from her voice, but she was sure both women noticed.</p><p>On the way to the stairs, they headed toward the men gathered in the living room.</p> <p>Darien grabbed Jake\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAre you sure you can handle this?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s face lit up with a sinister cast. \u201cYou bet, Darien. They won\u2019t know what hit them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Uncle Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll set. Go protect the little lady. You know they\u2019ll pull something sneaky to take her out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you. Thanks for trusting in me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSam?\u201d</p><p>Sam patted Tom on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of Jake in case anything gets out of hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Trevor?\u201d Silva asked.</p><p>\u201cLate. I\u2019m sure he has a damned good excuse though,\u201d</p><p>Darien said, his words sarcastic.</p><p>Lelandi thought Silva had given up on that worthless Trevor. What now? \u201cIs Jake going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake will be fine. Every time I have to leave town, he takes over.\u201d Darien looked at Peter. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>A knock sounded at the front door and Darien took Lelandi\u2019s hand and rushed her up the stairs with Silva and Carol following, and Peter bringing up the rear. \u201cYou were supposed to be upstairs already,\u201d Darien scolded.</p><p>But as soon as Darien and Lelandi reached the landing, he shoved her against the wall, and she smelled the reds\u2019 scents, too. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMust have slipped in before my guards were in place on the property.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes looked like they were going to pop out of her head. Silva and Lelandi breathed in deeply and listened, trying to sense where the reds were located.</p><p>Darien nodded to Peter and they both began stripping out of their clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want us to go?\u201d Lelandi asked Darien, knowing he planned to shapeshift and soon couldn\u2019t tell her anything.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you need to go?\u201d Darien deferred to Carol.</p><p>She looked too stunned to answer.</p><p>Lelandi shook her hand. \u201cCarol. Where do you see that we need to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a big blue bedroom with a sitting area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s bedroom.\u201d Lelandi led Carol down the hall with Silva trailing behind.</p><p>\u201cA security monitor is in the room. Hit the green switch for the living room. We should be able to hear the conversation,\u201d Silva said.</p><p>Carol glanced back at Darien\u2014both he and Peter were now naked. Lelandi pulled her into the bedroom so she wouldn\u2019t see them shapeshift. No smell of the reds in here. They must have broken into Jake\u2019s or... or maybe the guest bedroom, thinking she was still staying there.</p><p>In their wolf pelts, Darien and Peter loped after them and Carol cried out.</p><p>\u201cGood pet wolves,\u201d Lelandi said, patting Darien on the head.</p><p>Carol hadn\u2019t seen the men transform, but she did see their clothes lying on the floor in the hallway, and Darien and Peter had vanished. She knew.</p><p>Lelandi closed the door and Peter sat next to it, his ears perked up, listening.</p><p>Silva motioned to one of the two chairs. \u201cI\u2019ll put something on. Like comedies?\u201d</p><p>Carol nodded heartily, but her attention was glued to Lelandi who flipped on the monitor switch, then took a seat on the bed. Darien jumped up on the mattress and nuzzled her hand with his nose.</p><p>She scratched his head and smiled. \u201cWant me to rub your belly, too?\u201d</p><p>Peter and Silva glanced back at them.</p><p>A wolf that would bear his belly to another showed his complete trust in the other, but Darien pushed his nose into her crotch and sniffed. Smiling, Lelandi shoved his head away. Silva chuckled and turned on the television.</p><p>Peter observed Darien and Lelandi for a minute more, then when Darien laid his head on her lap, Peter concentrated on the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bruin Stillwater,\u201d the red pack leader said to Jake downstairs.</p><p>Even hearing Bruin\u2019s dark voice sent chills streaking down Lelandi\u2019s spine. Carol watched the monitor with rapt attention. Silva turned the TV lower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the pack leader of Wildhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien Silver of Silver Town. I understand you already know Larissa died,\u201d Jake said, his tone conciliatory with a hint of gruffness.</p><p>\u201cOne of your people murdered her, you mean,\u201d Bruin corrected.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have conclusive evidence either way. It\u2019s possible even a red murdered her for mating a gray when she was mated to your brother already. Which of these gentlemen is your brother, Crassus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Crassus.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s skin crawled. Whispering, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s not his voice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he intends on coming for you,\u201d Silva said.</p><p>\u201cCrassus,\u201d Carol whispered. \u201cThe one I saw in the vision.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi had figured the bastard would come for her. Afraid someone else would fail. And, too, she assumed he wanted to show her how she couldn\u2019t escape him. He\u2019d find so much more satisfaction in returning her home if he did so himself.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve already relayed to you through the sheriff, Lelandi belongs to the pack. Now that her sister is confirmed dead, Crassus will mate her. Has in fact\u2014in absentia\u2014as is our right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this done?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cYou question my honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mated her as soon as she arrived here,\u201d Jake lied.</p><p>\u201cYou see, we were dream mated. For months we\u2019d made love in our dream states, and she came into her first wolf heat when we met. So you see, we\u2019re soul mates. And we won\u2019t be separated.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi glanced at Darien. He had told Jake about her wolf heat? If he\u2019d been in his human form, she would have slugged him.</p><p>\u201cYou stole Crassus\u2019s mate from him. You will give Lelandi back or else...\u201d</p><p>The sound of growling came from the hallway. Carol jumped from the chair she was sitting on. Lelandi and Silva rose. \u201cThey can\u2019t open the door,\u201d Lelandi said under her breath. Then she belatedly realized they hadn\u2019t locked it and dashed for it.</p><p>The door slammed open, throwing her against the wall. She recognized the two reds right away. Carruthers and Connors, the black-haired twin cops from Wildhaven, the two lupus garou that had guarded her back home before she escaped, looking smug, their lips curled up slightly, their amber eyes revealed a small sense of delight in bringing her the news. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us. Bruin says.\u201d</p><p>Then all hell broke loose. Darien lunged for Carruthers and Peter went for Connors. But three red wolves dashed into the room. Carol screamed. Silva grabbed for a lamp while Lelandi searched in Darien\u2019s sock drawer. He hadn\u2019t put her gun back here. Damn it. Why didn\u2019t he tell her where it was? Too late. She and Silva could shapeshift, but Lelandi wasn\u2019t any match for a male, gray or red. She was sure Silva wouldn\u2019t be either. She seized the other bedside table lamp.</p><p>\u201cGet into the bathroom and stay there!\u201d Lelandi shouted at Carol.</p><p>But Darien had one of the wolves by the throat, pinning Carol into a corner.</p><p>Then Crassus stalked into the room like he owned the place, his strawberry blond hair unbound, his dark eyes challenging her. For an instant, she felt an inkling of terror. He could snap her neck in two and end her life easily. But even worse, he could claim her for his own if he could kill Darien.</p><p>Lelandi moved in Carol\u2019s direction, her lamp readied, her eyes challenging him back. Cowering before the son of a bitch was not an option. But her heated blood ran cold now. He was bigger, stronger, and meaner than she could ever be. He wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take her.</p><p>Like most of the reds in his pack, he wasn\u2019t tall, but he was bulky, like a football player in his prime and was always itching for a fight. His older brother, Bruin, was the only one stronger, more deadly.</p><p>The sound of fighting was going on downstairs, and she hoped Jake and the rest would win against Bruin and his men. More than six reds had come into town.</p><p>As if he had no worries, Crassus folded his arms, and his lips rose in a gloating sneer. \u201cYour father wouldn\u2019t give you to me. I suspected it had to do with your temper. Would have made our mating much more\u2014challenging. Or it might have been because you hadn\u2019t come into a wolf\u2019s heat yet, and he was afraid you wouldn\u2019t be worth having.\u201d His eyes as cold as ash, he added, \u201cBut Larissa is dead and you will now be mine.\u201d</p><p>His words cut through her like an icy blade, but she tried to act nonchalant and waved a hand at Darien who was tackling another wolf. \u201cMeet my mate. You\u2019re already too late, Crassus. Live with it.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to touch Lelandi\u2019s hair, but she slapped his hand away. He laughed from the gut, sinister, cruelly. But before she could react, he grabbed her by the throat and slammed her against the wall. A streak of pain slid down her spine, and she dropped the lamp. \u201cYou hoped Bruin would give you to another pack member\u2014another subchief, even though your father insisted, but Bruin wouldn\u2019t. Not unless I told him I didn\u2019t want you. You can\u2019t have a gray. You\u2019re mated to me, albeit in absentia. But we\u2019ll get to the good part after we rid ourselves of the grays.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to twist free, his meaty hand tightening on her throat. Her vision darkened, she gasped for air, then Darien chomped down on Crassus\u2019s arm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darien\u2019s focus had to remain on the wolves in the room first, more deadly with their powerful bites, more of a threat than any of those in their human forms. But as soon as Crassus grabbed Lelandi\u2019s throat, Darien had to get rid of the wolf he was fighting, then he aimed for the bastard. No contest existed between a wolf and a human, and he\u2019d hoped the beast would have changed so he could take care of him wolf to wolf.</p><p>As soon as Darien bit Crassus\u2019s arm, he screamed and released Lelandi. He ripped off his shirt, though his swarthy face exuded pain, and he struggled with the effort, his arm dripping with blood.</p><p>The twin cops who had entered the room initially, quickly turned wolf to deal with Peter now that the other reds were dead. Darien bit one of them while he waited for Crassus to change.</p> <p>Lelandi was still clutching her throat, trying to draw air into her lungs when Carol cried out. She slid to the floor, her eyes dazed, her throat dripping with blood from a nasty gash. Lelandi skirted around the four wolves battling each other and reached Carol, her hand on her throat, stemming the blood. \u201cOhmigod, Carol. You\u2019ll be... all right.\u201d Some reassurance. It didn\u2019t matter that Carol\u2019s death would be the easiest solution now that she knew they were lupus garous. Lelandi desperately wanted her to live.</p><p>Silva was already on the phone. \u201cAngelina, call Nurse Matthew right away and dispatch him to Darien\u2019s home. We have multiple injuries.\u201d She clicked off the phone and punched in numbers. \u201cThe new male nurse is on his way,\u201d she said to Lelandi. She paused. \u201cCharlotte? It\u2019s Silva. Come right away to Darien\u2019s house. We\u2019ve got casualties, but the fight\u2019s still ongoing.\u201d</p><p>Silva hung up the phone and climbed over the bed to get to Lelandi, while Crassus ditched his trousers and shapeshifted. \u201cIs she going to live?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi yanked a pillowcase off one of the pillows and applied pressure to the wound. She didn\u2019t think Carol was going to make it. The woman\u2019s heartbeat was fading, and she was bleeding too much. \u201cI... I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get some of that leftover bandaging Doc gave me to use on your wounds.\u201d Silva climbed back over the bed and raced into the bathroom.</p> <p>Standing as a wolf, Crassus bared his teeth at Darien. Crassus looked so damned arrogant. Didn\u2019t he know he was no match for a gray alpha pack leader?</p><p>The two circled each other while Peter and the remaining red stopped to watch the fight between a leader and a subchief. Silva returned with the bandaging and she and Lelandi bound Carol\u2019s wound. Darien lunged at Crassus, but the wolf twisted away so hard to avoid Darien\u2019s snapping jaws, he fell on his butt, then quickly retreated.</p><p>\u201cHell, there\u2019s more of them!\u201d someone shouted from downstairs.</p><p>Lelandi took her eyes off Darien and Crassus to look at Silva. She looked as worried as Lelandi felt.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re going after the reds.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s mouth dropped slightly. What reds in their right mind would fight Bruin and his pack here? Then anger welled up to volcanic proportions deep inside her\u2014not her emotions, but her brother\u2019s, the symbiotic reaction she had when her sister or brother\u2019s feelings ran high. Leidolf was here.</p> <p>Darien took a chunk out of Crassus\u2019s ear, and he fell away in a panic, his ear bleeding. But Darien didn\u2019t wait for another run. He cornered the red, bottled him between the sofa and the wall and leapt in the air.</p><p>Crassus yelped before Darien planted his teeth into his neck. It was the last sound the bastard would ever make as Darien\u2019s canines snapped the wolf\u2019s neck in half, then released him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you, Lelandi, Silva?\u201d Nurse Grey cried out from downstairs as lamps and tables crashed downstairs.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs, end of hall, Darien\u2019s room. Hurry!\u201d Lelandi shouted.</p><p>Darien eyed the lone red wolf standing next to Peter, but he tucked tail and lay down on his stomach.</p><p>Nurse Grey and Matthew bolted upstairs with a medical kit. \u201cOh my, what\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you take care of her?\u201d Lelandi asked, holding Carol\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYes, let me get in there and I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll... I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Lelandi dashed out of the room and down the hall.</p><p>\u201cLelandi!\u201d Silva shouted. \u201cNo, wait!\u201d</p><p>Darien chased Lelandi down the stairs, and she was sure if he could, he would force her back into the bedroom to keep her out of harm\u2019s way. But her brother was in the thick of it, and she couldn\u2019t let anyone in Darien\u2019s pack kill him, mistaking him for the enemy.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she yelled, trying to get beyond the grays to get closer to her brother, but one of the grays snapped at her, keeping her away from the reds battling each other. Her brother was fighting Bruin, and the grays were letting him? Then she saw another familiar red, her uncle, tearing into Bruin\u2019s youngest brother, Cindon\u2014as mean-hearted as Crassus and Bruin. It was rumored their father was a real psycho and bullied them until they became just like him.</p><p>Her uncle turned his head in her direction briefly. He shielded bared teeth instantly, his look shifting from her to Darien standing next to her, his stance protective. Her heart lifted to see both her uncle and brother back together again. But then she cringed when Bruin knocked Leidolf on his hip.</p><p>Leidolf quickly recovered and dodged the heavier wolf\u2019s lunge. Bruin weighed at least forty pounds more than her brother, was shorter and stockier and thicker necked. But Leidolf had a regal way of moving, swiftly, silently, dangerously. He\u2019d taken down a stag without a sound, killed a bear that had attacked her mother when they were living in the mountains, and now he seemed even more serious, determined, deadly.</p><p>Darien watched, as if he was ruler of all the land, and the tournament was for his and his courtiers\u2019 sport. Everyone\u2019s tongues panted from exertion and blood tinged a fair amount of the wolves\u2019 pelts. A couple sat down. The rest stiffly observed, wary of the fight, promising to take on the pack leader and his brother if the reds who fought them lost the game. Old Mr. Hastings, who had shouted that her brother and uncle had arrived, was the only one in human form.</p><p>Darien glanced up at Lelandi and licked her hand. She crouched down next to him, wrapped her arm around his neck, and gave him a hug. \u201cThanks for avenging my sister\u2019s tormenter.\u201d She spoke loud enough for Bruin to hear.</p><p>He jerked his head in her direction, and Leidolf slammed into him, knocking the pack leader off his pads. He crashed into a table and broke one of the legs. Leidolf growled low at Bruin, then savagely attacked his throat. Bruin bit back, but Leidolf held on for dear life, growling. After several seconds that felt like hours, Bruin sank to the floor, dead.</p><p>Uncle Hrothgar seemed to smile, then he tackled Bruin\u2019s last living brother, biting him in the face when Cindon turned his head to protect his throat. None could be left standing if they were to oust the red pack from their lands.</p><p>Two more of the grays sat down, the fight nearly ended.</p><p>Silva came down the stairs and gave Lelandi a somber nod. But Lelandi didn\u2019t know how to take the message. She wanted to check on Carol, but she had to see her uncle win against Bruin\u2019s brother</p><p>Leidolf watched their uncle for a minute, then turned his attention on her. He was heaving with weariness, but anger still filled his soul. His gaze shifted to Darien. He knew. He understood she was his now, and she sensed he didn\u2019t like it. He didn\u2019t have to like it. He\u2019d left them to fend for their own, and she\u2019d found her soul mate.</p><p>Uncle Hrothgar pounced again at Cindon, this time snapping his neck in two like Darien had done to his brother, Crassus. For several minutes, no one did anything, the grays watching what the red wolves did next, and the reds eyeing Darien.</p><p>\u201cMy brother, Leidolf.\u201d Lelandi stood and motioned to the red wolf standing next to Bruin\u2019s dead body. \u201cAnd Uncle Hrothgar.\u201d She motioned to the other.</p><p>Darien panted, then licked Lelandi\u2019s hand and ran up the stairs. Still, no one moved, waiting for Darien\u2019s word.</p><p>A few minutes later, he returned dressed in his jeans, while he yanked a shirt on, a trail of blood running down his chest. \u201cLeidolf,\u201d he addressed Lelandi\u2019s brother first. Then he bowed his head slightly at Uncle Hrothgar. \u201cWelcome to my pack.\u201d</p><p>The two considered Lelandi, then loped out through the front door.</p><p>Darien gave her a weary smile and kissed her cheek. \u201cChange, and get this place cleaned up,\u201d he said to his pack. He looked around and frowned. \u201cWhere the hell is Trevor?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan jerked on his clothes and gave a disgruntled growl. \u201cI\u2019ll check into it and let you know.\u201d He took off for his truck.</p><p>Darien still couldn\u2019t believe Lelandi\u2019s brother and uncle had arrived so unexpectedly, but he suspected Ural must have sent word to them.</p><p>Tall for a red, a man walked back into the house, his chestnut hair tinged red, his eyes as jade as Lelandi\u2019s, narrowed, wary. Darien suspected his height had to do with his royal heritage and the fact he was directly related to the first lupus garou\u2014a gray. His body erect, wiry, ready for confrontation, a proud and sturdy jaw, angry lips and brows deeply furrowed defined him. Again he looked at Lelandi like she belonged to him, and he wanted her back. Lelandi\u2019s uncle walked in afterward, somewhat older, same height, more cautious, a lot less cocky.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine,\u201d Darien growled, unable to welcome the intruder like he\u2019d intended, unable to curb his feral possessiveness when it came to his mate.</p><p>Leidolf cocked his head slightly, his lips curving upward a hint.</p><p>Lelandi stood stock still, not saying a word, but her eyes were wide and expressive. She appeared worried that Darien and Leidolf would fight.</p><p>Darien took the aggressive red male\u2019s cue though, and bowed his head as Tom and Jake flanked him. \u201cShe is mine,\u201d he reiterated, not about to make any flowery speeches.</p><p>Leidolf kissed Lelandi on the cheek, and she appeared to be holding her breath, pale and unsure of herself.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Leidolf said, his voice a deep, threatening timbre. \u201cI had planned to bring Lelandi home to my pack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lelandi let out her breath. \u201cTo Wildhaven? You\u2019ll lead them now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, in Oregon. Mother and Father have joined me there. Uncle Hrothgar will take on the pack in Wildhaven. Will you come with me?\u201d He lightly took hold of her arm as if to persuade her to follow his lead.</p><p>\u201cNo, Leidolf.\u201d Her cheeks reddened and she jerked her arm out of his grasp. \u201cYou left us two years ago! We could have used your help! You think you can waltz in here and dictate to me because now you\u2019re a pack leader? That would be the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen, that\u2019s settled. Several prime-aged reds joined the pack and were looking for a mate and were very much interested when I said my sister was available, but...\u201d Leidolf gave a shrug and cast Darien a seething look.</p><p>So, had Leidolf already promised his sister to a pack member? When a pack had a severe shortage of females as many do, bringing in eligible mates could improve a new leader\u2019s standing, not to mention it tied more of the clan\u2019s loyalty with the bond created. Darien folded his arms, trying to appear relaxed, but if Leidolf grabbed Lelandi\u2019s arm again...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not available. I\u2019m mated. And this is where I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>Loving seeing Lelandi\u2019s ire unloaded on her brother after what he\u2019d pulled, Darien agreed.</p><p>Leidolf shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p> <p>Darien ground his teeth. If Leidolf had any intention of taking Lelandi with him, Darien would shapeshift and change the red\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s been done, can\u2019t be undone under our laws. If your mate should ever expire and you want a home with us, you\u2019ll be welcome, Lelandi.\u201d Leidolf turned to Darien. \u201cIf you\u2019ll permit me, I\u2019ll take Ural off your hands. He\u2019ll return with me to my pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>She kissed her brother on the cheek. \u201cBe safe, my brother. I\u2019d like to visit you and your pack soon.\u201d She squeezed his hand, released him, then wrapped her arm around Darien\u2019s waist. \u201cWith my mate.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang and Lelandi gave a little start. Tom grabbed the phone half-buried under the sofa. \u201cYes, Uncle Sheridan? I\u2019ll tell Darien you haven\u2019t located Trevor yet. Darien wants Ural released into the red\u2019s care and they\u2019re leaving. Leidolf will meet you at the jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stay and share a meal with us at least, brother?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p> <p>\u201cSome other time,\u201d he said, his eyes still challenging Darien.</p><p>Darien pulled Lelandi out of the red\u2019s path, glad her brother was leaving. Jake finally moved aside, his posture stiff, his gaze intent on Leidolf.</p><p>Leidolf smirked at Darien. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you had brothers. Sisters can be so much trouble.\u201d</p><p>Darien could imagine.</p><p>Turning to Darien, Tom asked, \u201cShould I go with Leidolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Leidolf dismissed him with a wave of his hand, then stalked toward the front door.</p><p>Darien was glad Lelandi didn\u2019t have any airs.</p><p>Leidolf yanked open the door and turned to Darien.</p> <p>\u201cTake care of her, better than you did our sister Larissa.\u201d</p><p>His conveyed the deadly threat with a look of contempt.</p><p>Darien wouldn\u2019t be tested, but Lelandi jerked free from him and slugged Leidolf in the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a real bastard. We had to fend for ourselves. You should have protected Larissa from Crassus\u2019s brutality. You! And you should have forced Mother and Father to move before the demon took Larissa as his mate.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf\u2019s darkened eyes softened. \u201cIf I had, Larissa would have been alive, granted. But you would have been mated to one of my reds, and not to the one you\u2019ve given your heart to.\u201d He bowed his head and stalked out the door.</p><p>The phone rang in Tom\u2019s hand, and he lifted it to his ear. \u201cUncle Sheridan? Sure.\u201d</p><p>He handed the phone to Darien. \u201cHe\u2019s steaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat son of a bitch knocked Trevor out and already freed Ural from the jail. Trevor\u2019s tied up like a calf, fuming, ready to kill a couple of reds. But he\u2019s all right.</p><p>What do you want me to do?\u201d Uncle Sheridan asked.</p><p>\u201cRelease him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeidolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf and her uncle got into the Humvee and Ural waved out the window. \u201cSee ya later, Lelandi. Don\u2019t be a stranger,\u201d Ural shouted.</p><p>Darien pulled Lelandi into his embrace and hugged her hard. \u201cWhenever you want to see your family, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family now. But I\u2019d like to see my parents. Oh... oh, Carol.\u201d</p><p>Darien motioned to Jake. \u201cSee how she is.\u201d</p><p>Darien moved Lelandi back into the living room where the furniture had been righted and the table with the broken leg removed. Bruin\u2019s body and his brothers\u2019 and the rest of his men\u2019s had been taken from the house. \u201cWhere\u2019s the red who gave up the fight?\u201d Darien asked Peter.</p><p>\u201cHe took off when Bruin died.\u201d</p><p>Jake ran down the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m taking Carol to the hospital. Anybody else need patching up, come along with me. Nurse Grey and Matthew will take care of the injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she... she...\u201d Lelandi swallowed hard.</p><p>Jake scratched his stubbly chin. \u201cYou know how a little lupus garou genetics help with the healing process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s... she\u2019s turned?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>Darien took a deep breath. \u201cThat solves one problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell it does,\u201d Jake said, scowling. \u201cShe\u2019s already bitching about wanting to be a nurse at the hospital... again.\u201d</p><p>And there would be more trouble inherent with a newly turned lupus garou in the pack\u2014particularly a female. Which of the wolves had so savagely bitten her? A red, because she was easy prey, or a gray to get rid of the threat to their kind. \u201cWho bit her?\u201d</p><p>Jake snorted. \u201cOne of the reds. Seems red females are going to be overrunning the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpfh. Guess you\u2019ll have to get used to it.\u201d Looking up at Darien, Lelandi tightened her grasp on his hand. \u201cNow can she be on the hospital staff?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>EARLY THE NEXT MORNING, LELANDI TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS she and Silva headed for Carol\u2019s hospital room, hoping Carol would be awake this time.</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s turned a human in the last one-hundred and thirty years in Silver Town,\u201d Silva said, her voice hushed. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine what she might be feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry maybe. Frustrated. Probably scared. I still can\u2019t believe the bite turned her instead of killing her since she lost so much blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s a fighter.\u201d Silva sounded proud of her.</p><p>\u201cGood thing, too.\u201d Lelandi was grateful Carol had survived but worried about how she would accept all the changes.</p><p>Guarding Carol\u2019s hospital room, Trevor looked pissed.</p><p>Silva straightened and put on her hopeful-smiley look, and Lelandi wanted to slap her. Trevor didn\u2019t look at Silva once, but glowered at Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cNo visitors,\u201d Trevor snapped.</p><p>\u201cTry and stop us,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>Silva turned her head to conceal a smile.</p><p>Immediately, Trevor rose to his six-foot height. \u201cThe sheriff said no visitors unless Darien approves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering the circumstances, he means no human visitors,\u201d Silva contradicted him.</p><p>\u201cOr, maybe he\u2019s concerned for her safety, but we\u2019re not a threat,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>Trevor stood firm, his hand resting on the pistol at his hip.</p><p>Not wanting to delay seeing Carol and tired of this macho bull, Lelandi stiffened. \u201cMove, deputy, or I\u2019ll call Darien. You don\u2019t want to explain to him why you won\u2019t let his mate see the patient.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed murder, but he shoved his hand at Silva, stopping her from entering. \u201cYou\u2019re not authorized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my bodyguard today, Trevor. Don\u2019t make this hard on yourself.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Palm up, Lelandi extended her hand to Silva. \u201cPhone?\u201d</p><p>Silva dug around in her suitcase-sized leather bag.</p><p>Trevor still wouldn\u2019t move, but as soon as Silva found her phone, Trevor growled. \u201cI\u2019ll report this to the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d Lelandi said with a lift of her chin. Jerk.</p><p>Grudgingly, he half-moved out of the doorway so that Lelandi had to brush past him to get into the room. She thought about shoving him out of the way, but rather enjoyed pushing his buttons in a more feminine way. Silva shut the door after them.</p><p>Carol watched them from the bed. Sitting up, her face was glum and she turned away. Her neck was bandaged and a light stain of red colored the cloth. Her skin was pale, her blonde curls tangled around her shoulders as if she\u2019d had a bad night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>Her skin was icy; Lelandi hated being in unfamiliar settings. Dealing with a newly turned lupus garou made her particularly uncomfortable, no matter how hard she tried to shake loose of the feeling. But she couldn\u2019t leave the poor woman in isolation either. She wished</p><p>Silva would help her out, like she usually did in a tense situation, but Silva seemed as unsure as Lelandi as to what to do.</p><p>\u201cCarol, we came by to... sit with you for a while,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t let my parents see me,\u201d Carol said softly, blinking away tears.</p><p>\u201cDarien?\u201d Lelandi pulled a chair close to the bed.</p><p>\u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe... he\u2019s afraid you\u2019ll tell your parents what happened.\u201d</p><p>Carol gave a derisive laugh. \u201cMy parents would have me certified. Just as crazy as my sister. That would really go over well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see your parents?\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s dull blue eyes sparkled.</p><p>Silva wrung her hands.</p><p>\u201cOne of us will have to stay with you while they visit,\u201d Lelandi warned.</p><p>Carol quickly nodded.</p><p>Silva let out her breath. \u201cAre you sure Darien will approve?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d Lelandi called his cell phone, but there was no answer. Carol\u2019s jaw tightened. Lelandi smiled. \u201cAlways another way to get around the big boss.\u201d She punched in another number and was instantly rewarded.</p><p>\u201cThis is Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi here, visiting Carol at the hospital. She\u2019s pretty down. Can you authorize her parents\u2019 visit if I stay in the room while they\u2019re here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilva can stay, too,\u201d Carol hurriedly said.</p><p>Silva smiled and pulled up another chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check with Darien and get back with you.\u201d Tom sounded so concerned, she wondered what was up.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he? I tried calling, but there wasn\u2019t any answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe silver mine. An accident occurred with one of the tourist cars on the train.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs anyone hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t be telling you this, Lelandi, not until Darien approves. But, Angelina and Hosstene were on the car that Darien said was rigged to break free. The car tumbled down several hundred feet, striking a number of trees before it impacted with a boulder.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi stared at Silva in disbelief. \u201cWere... were they injured badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHosstene was decapitated. Angelina is on her way to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they have been riding on the train? Only the tourists take that trip, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting someone? We don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMurder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems that way. Darien suspects Angelina, Hosstene, and Ritka were three of the ones blackmailing your sister. He believes whoever rigged the accident is the fourth and wants to eliminate his partners in the crime.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi sat down hard on the vinyl chair next to the bed. \u201cHow bad is Angelina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral broken bones. Internal bleeding. Not sure of the severity of all her injuries until a doctor takes a look. Darien didn\u2019t want to tell you until he was more certain of the women\u2019s guilt. Let me speak to Doc Mitchell, will you?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s face warmed. \u201cHe\u2019s... well, he had to check out Mrs. Fennigan\u2019s dog who was having symptoms of a stroke.\u201d</p><p>Tom didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. She was in trouble now. \u201cWho\u2019s watching you?\u201d Tom\u2019s voice was deep with barely repressed anger, and he sounded like Darien, except he would have sworn.</p><p>\u201cSilva.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lelandi. The murderer is still out there and someone has to watch you at all times. Why the hell didn\u2019t Doc Mitchell call in someone else? Forget it. He would have. But you didn\u2019t wait. Who\u2019s watching Carol\u2019s room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeputy Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Stay there until I can get someone else to the hospital to escort you straight home after your visit.\u201d</p><p>Not liking that she had to be constantly watched, Lelandi clenched her teeth. \u201cWill do. What about Carol\u2019s parents?\u201d</p><p>Tom grumbled, \u201cDarien will go ballistic when he learns you\u2019ve been running around without protection. I\u2019ll make arrangements for her parents\u2019 visit. But don\u2019t you leave there until I have a security detail for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d She smiled and hung up the phone.</p><p>\u201cI could hear Tom\u2019s voice all the way over here,\u201d</p><p>Silva said.</p><p>Carol was frowning so hard, Lelandi took her hand and gave her a reassuring squeeze. \u201cTom will make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... you risked your life to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>But Silva disagreed. \u201cYes, she did. We were all set on coming here when Doc Mitchell got the emergency call. Peter was supposed to meet us at the house, but when he didn\u2019t show on time, Lelandi insisted we get to the hospital. She worried about you and didn\u2019t want to wait any longer, assuming Trevor would be here in case anyone threatened her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have risked it,\u201d Carol scolded.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Lelandi hated that everyone worried about her like she was a child who couldn\u2019t deal with adversity.</p><p>\u201cMy throat still hurts. Tom gave me blood and I\u2019m feeling a little better, but...\u201d She laid her head back against the pillow, her eyes soggy, dark circles coloring the skin.</p><p>\u201cDo you... want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>Carol inhaled deeply. \u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy. Like Silva, I heard everything Tom said over the phone, he was so angry. I heard him say Hosstene was dead. And Angelina\u2019s in a bad way. That Darien thinks they were in on the blackmail. That the car they were riding in was sabotaged. I can even hear your heart beating rapidly. The smell of antiseptics in the room is overwhelming and burning my eyes. Even when the lights were out last night, I could see as if it were daylight. Although it wasn\u2019t exactly like daylight. More like a dark day when the clouds are getting ready to dump rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll take getting used to.\u201d Lelandi wished she could give her better advice.</p><p>\u201cIs this how it felt when you were turned?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Silva shook her head. \u201cWe were born as lupus garous. In fact, you\u2019re in the presence of a royal.\u201d Her voice full of pride, she motioned to Lelandi with a bow of her head, and Lelandi rolled her eyes at her.</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes grew big. \u201cA royal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Silva means is I\u2019m a direct descendent of the original lupus garou. We believe he was a Norseman, although no one knows exactly how he contracted the lupus garou condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome say a wolf bit him but instead of dying, his blood fought off the infection by mutating,\u201d Silva suggested.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think Lelandi was a werewolf because she\u2019s so small compared to the rest of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gray wolves.\u201d Silva sat taller. \u201cLelandi\u2019s a red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre... are there Mexican werewolves, too? Other kinds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMexican wolves are really grays,\u201d Silva said. \u201cIn the Southwest they call them Mexican wolves. And in the Northeast, timber wolves are also grays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about other kinds of lupus garous. \u201d Lelandi motioned at the window. \u201cNormally, we don\u2019t go searching for other packs unless someone\u2019s looking for a mate, and even then, many find rogues instead. But we don\u2019t write down the histories about our lines either. Too dangerous. All we know is what\u2019s passed down orally from generation to generation.\u201d</p><p>Carol touched the bandage on her neck. \u201cWhat kind am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA red bit you. So now there are two of us in the pack.\u201d Lelandi smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe pack. I\u2019m one of you now?\u201d Carol seemed unsure as to whether this was good news or bad.</p><p>\u201cYes. As long as you wish. Some become loners, rogues. Most stay with a pack for protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about real wolves? Do they get you mixed up with them?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi chuckled. \u201cOne time a female wolf in heat lifted her tail and was trying to entice my brother to mate with her. My sister and I couldn\u2019t stop laughing. Except the next day, a male loner wolf tried to mate me. Then it wasn\u2019t so funny. Leidolf went after him and that was the last we saw of him in our territory.\u201d</p><p>Carol laughed, then her expression turned contemplative. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about wolf behavior. How once they\u2019ve chosen a mate, they\u2019ll copulate with them several times over and over again, then back up to them, sometimes even putting their leg over them to protect their mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA defensive measure, sure.\u201d Lelandi smiled. \u201cBut lupus garous are a little more civilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo reds were the first kind of werewolves?\u201d</p><p>Silva laughed.</p><p>Lelandi looked at her, surprised at her reaction. \u201cYes, Carol, a red was the first lupus garou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gray.\u201d Silva bit her lip, suppressing another giggle.</p><p>Carol\u2019s brows and lips raised. \u201cThe problem with oral history? I thought since Lelandi was a royal and a red, the first must have been a red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a royal because she has ties to the original, this is true. And she\u2019s had very few human influences afterward, but my ancestors say the first was a gray who mated with a petite redheaded Celt. One of her sons mated with another. And so on until eventually a line of reds was born.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi frowned. \u201cNot true. The first was a red. One of his daughters mated a gargantuan of a berserker, a king of the Norsemen. That\u2019s where the first gray line began.\u201d</p><p>Carol grinned. \u201cI can see living with a gray pack, but being a red, is going to cause me problems already.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi patted her hand and whispered conspiratorially, \u201cThe reds came first. That\u2019s all you have to remember. I\u2019ll fill you in on the rest later.\u201d</p><p>Silva gave her a devilish smirk. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Darien\u2019s never heard that version before. Wonder what he\u2019ll think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll agree with me.\u201d Lelandi turned to Carol.</p><p>\u201cBut I have a question for you that\u2019s been nagging at me. Darien said you must have seen what happens when we ditch our clothes and mate in the woods. That you didn\u2019t see humans wearing animal skins like you said.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s cheeks blossomed with color, and she began playing with her thin blanket. \u201cI... I did see you as werewolves. I was trying to find out if you were one of them. I... I wanted to protect you. I knew it was too late for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for you?\u201d</p><p>Carol looked steadily into Lelandi\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhen I had the vision, the scene was set in the woods at night, but I could see as if it was a cloudy day. Just like last night in the hospital room. Which could only mean one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the scene you envisioned finally occurs, you would be one of us,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Silva said. \u201cYou really can see into the future?\u201d</p><p>Sam burst into the room, slamming the door against the wall, his look feral. \u201cDarien read the riot act to the pack. You are not to go anywhere unescorted,\u201d he directed at Lelandi. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silva got up from her chair, sauntered over to Sam, and ran her hands over his sweater-covered chest. While Trevor was watching from the hall, she kissed Sam on the lips. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Silva, you\u2019d think you were afraid of letting our relationship go too far, the way you get me worked up in public, and cool it when we\u2019re in private.\u201d His hands cupped her face like she was a precious porcelain doll, then he kissed her lips, gently at first, then building up the momentum until her hands pressed against his back, encouraging him to go further.</p><p>Lelandi smiled. Trevor looked disgusted and closed the door.</p> <p>Sam broke the kiss, his breathing labored, and so was Silva\u2019s. \u201cNext time, we\u2019ll get a room,\u201d he promised with a caddish wink.</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019d be your mate?\u201d Silva\u2019s lips curved up a hint, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>He chuckled darkly, released her, and motioned to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside while you visit Carol.\u201d He gave Lelandi a warning look, then stiffly walked out of the room and shut the door.</p><p>\u201cAs to your question, Silva, yes, I see glimpses of the future,\u201d Carol said, smiling. \u201cYou won\u2019t be getting a room.\u201d</p><p>Silva frowned. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou two were some of the... pack members I saw in the woods that night.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi laughed. \u201cGood, that means Trevor\u2019s out of the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Carol warned.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Lelandi asked. \u201cDo you see his complicity in all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear the threat in his voice? I wouldn\u2019t trust him one iota.\u201d Carol sipped some water. \u201cHas he ever been treated as a suspect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But Carol\u2019s comment made Lelandi think of Chester\u2019s words. What if it was someone Darien trusted? Someone close to him. \u201cI doubt Darien would suspect him of wrongdoing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas he ever noticeably absent when you needed help?\u201d Carol set the empty cup on the table.</p><p>Lelandi refilled it. \u201cWhen Darien fought Bruin\u2019s brother. But my brother had tied him up at the jail cell to free my cousin, Ural. So Trevor was truly all tied up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when you were shot? Was he with any of the search parties? Also, what about the shooter who killed the gunman? Was Trevor\u2019s gun checked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor was taking care of mudslide victims on the highway. And... uhm, I was the shooter,\u201d Silva explained.</p><p>Carol gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cLong story,\u201d Lelandi said. \u201cSilva can tell you about it later. But Chester McKinley discovered another bullet and casing. He thought your bullet fell short, Silva.\u201d</p><p>Silva\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave it to the sheriff to check out.\u201d</p> <p>Carol frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t remember reading about any mudslides on the highway in the Silver Town Express. The shooting was important and would make the headlines, but if anyone was injured in the mudslide, it would have been mentioned. What about when that maniac took you hostage? Was Trevor looking for you with the rest of the pack?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was helping the sheriff watch my old pack at Hastings Bed and Breakfast,\u201d Lelandi said. Although he\u2019d had perfectly good excuses every time, the feeling there was more to the story made her skin tingle.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the warning, Carol. Believe me, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Silva didn\u2019t say anything for several seconds, then she abruptly stood. \u201cWill you two be all right? I\u2019ll ask Nurse Grey when Carol can be released.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Lelandi exchanged a look with Carol.</p><p>Silva gave one of her faked smiles, attempting to hide her anxiety and hurried out of the room. \u201cBe right back, Sam.\u201d She closed the door, and her boots clicked down the hall.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like Silva suddenly became suspicious of something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering Trevor, right?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi took a deep breath. \u201cSince she\u2019s had such a crush on him, I think so. She constantly kept tabs on him, until she switched her affections to the one who really counted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Carol said, dreamily. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t do wrong by him. I have another question though.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi figured she\u2019d never hear the end of them, although she couldn\u2019t blame her. She hadn\u2019t even given Carol the spiel concerning the semi-immortal part. And she figured Carol wasn\u2019t a virgin. But Lelandi had to warn Carol that she couldn\u2019t have casual sexual relations with a lupus garou. That if one acted interested in her\u2014and with shortages in most packs she\u2019d have lots of interest\u2014if she responded in the same way toward a male, she could be mated and it would be a done deal, for life. But this wasn\u2019t the time or place to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cThe bullets that killed Doc Oliver and Ritka were silver, weren\u2019t they?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how are werewolves able to work in the silver mine? I mean, they do, don\u2019t they? Wouldn\u2019t it kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s only deadly if it strikes the heart or brain and isn\u2019t removed immediately. Silver doesn\u2019t bother us otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to get tired of all my questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol, this is such a big change for you. Feel free to ask me anytime. Darien will want you to stay with a pack member until you adjust. The moon\u2019s out and whenever it is, the pull to shapeshift can be strong. But since you\u2019ve been only recently changed and are still injured, you might not experience it for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have to shapeshift then even if I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here to see our daughter, Carol Wood,\u201d a woman said beyond the hospital room door, sounding brusque and noticeably upset.</p><p>Lelandi patted Carol\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWill you be all right?\u201d</p><p>Tears misting her eyes, Carol nodded. \u201cDarien gave me a cover story.\u201d</p><p>He would. Although Lelandi trusted Carol not to tell her parents what she\u2019d become, she had to stay with them in the room until they left. But she was dying to see what Silva was up to. And she wanted in the worst way to question Angelina.</p><p>Sam opened the door and allowed Carol\u2019s parents to enter. Their eyes widened when they saw Lelandi with Carol.</p><p>\u201cNurse Grey said you couldn\u2019t be seen at first, and we thought you were really bad off. She told us we can\u2019t visit for long.\u201d Carol\u2019s mother grasped her hand, her blonde hair as golden as her daughter\u2019s, her eyes as blue. Her father towered over them, but didn\u2019t say a word, his rail-thin body bent with weariness, his dark eyes worried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, dear?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Carol managed a small, tearful smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Mom.</p><p>I\u2019ll be out of here soon.\u201d She motioned to Lelandi. \u201cThis is Lelandi. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know your last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>Carol\u2019s mouth gaped. \u201cYou married Darien?\u201d</p><p>Her mother and father looked as shocked.</p><p>\u201cWhen things aren\u2019t so hectic, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll make the announcement.\u201d Lelandi hated that part of fitting in with human society. Their kind didn\u2019t do the wedding bit. Their mating meant more than any kind of ceremony could mean. They stayed with their spouse until one died. Or at least that\u2019s the way they normally lived their lives.</p><p>Finally finding her voice, Carol said, \u201cOh, sure, I knew it would happen sooner than later. I\u2019m so very happy for you. This is my mother, Lori, and my father, Christopher Wood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Lelandi said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Aren\u2019t you the one who was shot a few days ago?\u201d Mrs. Wood took a ragged breath.</p><p>\u201cKidnappings, more shootings. And all of it revolves around you.\u201d Running her hand over Carol\u2019s hair, she said, \u201cNurse Grey told us a wild wolf bit Carol and it\u2019s been destroyed. But why\u2019s Deputy Sheriff Trevor Osgood guarding her room? And Sam? What in the world is going on?\u201d</p><p>Carol paled even further.</p><p>Lelandi realized living with a pack that didn\u2019t associate with humans had its advantages. \u201cThey\u2019re here because of me,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Mrs. Wood\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t be here. If danger follows you wherever you go, I want you out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wood cleared his throat. His wife looked sharply at him. \u201cHoney, if Carol wants Mrs. Silver\u2019s company, then don\u2019t you think she should have her friendship? Mr. Silver does run the town, and Carol hasn\u2019t made any friends since she returned home.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Wood looked like she could strangle him with her glare.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s right. Lelandi made friends with me as soon as I met her.\u201d Carol gave her a warm smile.</p><p>Lelandi wondered how Carol had ever gotten that notion, but she was glad to be her friend now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s even convinced Darien I should work at the hospital. You know how much I\u2019ve wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Great. Put me on the spot, why don\u2019t you, Carol?</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a better friend,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re so much alike. I can\u2019t even say how much so.\u201d</p><p>Nurse Grey walked into the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll have to ask everyone to leave so I can change Miss Wood\u2019s bandages. She\u2019ll be released tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen... then it\u2019s not as bad as we expected?\u201d Mrs. Wood asked.</p><p>Nurse Grey checked Carol\u2019s vital signs. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine, but she needs to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back and see me soon,\u201d Carol said to Lelandi, her expression mournful.</p><p>Lelandi gave her a cheerful smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later. Behave yourself until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you take Trevor with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d Lelandi left the room and snagged Sam\u2019s arm, then walked him down to Doc\u2019s office. \u201cTell Darien he needs to remove Trevor from guard duty for Carol.\u201d</p><p>Sam folded his arms. \u201cHe\u2019ll want to know a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s a target, too. Darien knows the specifics as to why. She doesn\u2019t feel safe around Trevor. Give her some peace of mind, okay? See if maybe Tom or Jake will watch her in the meantime. I\u2019d do it, if Darien would let me.\u201d</p> <p>Sam gave a snort. \u201cYou are supposed to be guarded, not guarding others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Or otherwise I\u2019d kick Trevor\u2019s butt out of here.\u201d</p><p>Sam shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019d try, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make an honest woman of Silva?\u201d</p><p>A smile lit Sam\u2019s face, but he didn\u2019t answer.</p> <p>Instead, he grabbed Doc\u2019s phone and made a call. \u201cDarien? Sam here.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi slipped into the hallway. As soon as she saw Peter guarding a room, she headed in his direction.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in here?\u201d</p><p>The deputy quickly stood. \u201cAngelina Mavery.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s heart skipped a beat, the idea sinking in that whoever had tried to kill Angelina would try again and now she had to have a guard posted, too. \u201cDo you mind if I see her? I won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p> <p>IF PETER DIDN\u2019T HURRY AND ALLOW LELANDI INTO Angelina\u2019s hospital room, any number of people\u2014Darien, top of the list\u2014would stop her. Peter looked down at his Stetson in his hands, and then his gaze rose again.</p><p>\u201cPeter, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake told me you stuck up for me when I fell asleep on guard duty, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tap her foot in impatience. Time was of the essence, and if Sam discovered she was not with him... \u201cYes, because you were pulling too many hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor was supposed to have relieved me halfway through the night, but he never showed up.\u201d</p><p>Ohmigod. \u201cDid you tell Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I didn\u2019t want to get Trevor in trouble, but I couldn\u2019t have Darien firing me for not protecting you.\u201d Peter motioned with his head toward Angelina\u2019s door. \u201cThe way I look at it, you deserve some answers. If Angelina had anything to do with my own sister\u2019s death...\u201d</p><p>His eyes took on a menacing cast. \u201cGo right in.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi hesitated, then reached up and kissed Peter\u2019s cheek. \u201cThanks. Darien will make you sheriff when his uncle wants to retire, if I have any say in it.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s face turned crimson, but his lips turned up slightly. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She slipped into the room and closed the door.</p><p>Angelina\u2019s face was bruised and bloodied, the skin around both eyes blackened\u2014her gaze glowering at Lelandi. A bandage was secured across her forehead, a long, jagged line of blood tinting it red. Her neck was in a brace and her arm and leg were in a cast.</p><p>Lelandi started in on her. \u201cYou were blackmailing my sister, you bitch.\u201d</p><p>Angelina cast her a simpering smile. \u201cYour sister was a whore. Three men! Three men she was fooling around with that we know of, and Darien should never have mated with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else was in on this? You\u2019re not clever enough to mastermind it. And since your two compatriots are dead and the fourth undoubtedly wants you the same way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink what you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien will discover you\u2019re involved. Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll find his darling mate was depositing money in an account meant for her and her lover to make their getaway. Had nothing to do with me.\u201d She jutted her chin out, her brown eyes black, a couple of stripped leaves sticking out of her muddy-colored hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying Joe Kelly and Larissa pretended there was a blackmailing scheme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had the perfect motivation. Joe was stealing from the silver mine also.\u201d Angelina shrugged and winced.</p><p>\u201cNo. You, Ritka, Hosstene, and the mastermind blackmailed my sister. Except Joe shot Ritka before you could pin the blackmailing crime on him. Seems ironic. Then the fourth person wanted both you and Hosstene dead.\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s eyes misted.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he or she want to kill you if you had nothing to do with the blackmail scheme and murdering my sister? Can he get to the money that all of you hid?\u201d</p><p>Angelina\u2019s mouth turned down even more.</p><p>\u201cNow who should get out of town before you end up dead like your friends?\u201d Lelandi asked, playing on Ritka\u2019s words telling Lelandi to leave town before she ended up like her sister. \u201cI normally don\u2019t want to see people dead. But in your case, I\u2019d make an exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell,\u201d Angelina spat.</p><p>\u201cWhoever your mastermind is will kill you. Seems a shame you\u2019ll die and the murderer will get away with not only eliminating your spiteful hide, but abscond with the money.\u201d</p><p>Angelina glowered at her, the flecks of gold in her amber eyes like burning embers.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your accomplice? Who tried to kill you?\u201d</p><p>Angelina crinkled the bed linens in her good hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know who it is. Ritka dealt with him.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s heart missed a beat. \u201cBut it\u2019s a he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He orchestrated the whole setup. At least I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a he.\u201d Angelina glowered. \u201cYour sister was despicably weak. We all knew it. She should never have been the pack leader\u2019s bitch.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi opened her mouth to retort, but Darien entered the room and shook his head at her, his look dark, but sympathetic. \u201cLet my men and me question her, Lelandi.\u201d He ran his hand over her shoulder and down her arm, taking hold of her hand and kissing it. \u201cSilva wants to talk to you at the nurse\u2019s station.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi kissed Darien\u2019s cheek, and quickly wiped away a tear rolling down hers. \u201cShe admitted to blackmailing Larissa. Another orchestrated the whole sorry affair. She said Joe stole the silver from the mine.\u201d Before she gave in to her darker wolf instincts and broke Angelina\u2019s other arm for good measure, Lelandi stormed out of the room.</p><p>Standing beside Peter, Sam growled. \u201cI was supposed to be watching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeter had the job. I\u2019m going to speak to Silva. Right down there. All right?\u201d She glanced down the hall at Carol\u2019s room. Tom guarded her now. \u201cWhere did Trevor go?\u201d******</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s helping the sheriff with the train derailment,\u201d</p><p>Sam said. \u201cThis town\u2019s never going to be the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get any flak, did you?\u201d Lelandi asked Peter.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Sam ground his teeth. \u201cI did, for not knowing where you were when I called Darien.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled at the rough and tumble bartender and patted his shoulder. \u201cYou can handle it.\u201d Then she joined Silva at the unmanned nurse\u2019s desk. \u201cDid you find out anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse Grey said no one was brought in for injuries sustained in a mudslide during the night of the shootings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich could mean none of the injuries were severe enough to require hospital care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So I checked with the Silver Town Express staff. None were aware of the mudslide, but because of the shootings they had concentrated on that news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the guys who have to clear the roads during a storm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy next thought exactly.\u201d Silva waved a slip of paper, showing each of the points she\u2019d checked off. \u201cI called the road-clearing crew supervisor. On the night the gunman shot you, no mudslides had been reported, but several of his crew were searching for you in the woods. All were on call, so if a mudslide had occurred, they would have been notified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when Trevor was supposed to be with the sheriff at Hastings Bed and Breakfast and didn\u2019t show up to help in the fight against my red pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne way to find out.\u201d Silva grabbed the phone off the nurse\u2019s desk and punched in some numbers. She handed the phone to Lelandi.</p><p>\u201cHastings Bed and Breakfast. This is Bertha Hastings.</p><p>How may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Hastings? This is Lelandi. Was Trevor there when the reds came to take me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff sent him on an errand. When he didn\u2019t return, Sheridan left some men to watch the reds, and he searched for the deputy. He found him and had him guard the prisoner at the jailhouse.\u201d Mrs. Hastings paused, then added, \u201cMany thought Darien would take Trevor\u2019s sister as his mate, but then he made it clear he was looking for someone outside the pack. Rumors began to circulate that Darien had a dream and the visions changed his mind. Trevor\u2019s sister left Silver Town, joined another pack, and mated with a beta male. Too loyal to the pack, Trevor won\u2019t leave, but he resented Larissa because his sister didn\u2019t share the bed of the alpha pack leader. His position would have been elevated if Darien had taken his sister as his mate. Trevor figured he\u2019d be sheriff when Sheridan retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he could have masterminded blackmailing my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. He might not like that your sister stole Darien\u2019s affections, but he\u2019s not that underhanded. He huffs and puffs and can be disagreeable, but that\u2019s as far as it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the gunman shot Tom, Sam, and me, there had been no mudslide, no injured victims. He said he was taking care of that mess instead of searching for me.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hastings took a deep breath and exhaled. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s guilty of a dereliction of his duties. Ask him. Whatever I can do to shed any light on this, please, anytime, call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks.\u201d Lelandi hung up the phone. \u201cIf Trevor was not doing his duty and tried to cover it up, what was he doing?\u201d</p><p>The sound of footfalls headed in their direction and they turned. Darien stalked toward them with Jake at his side. Neither looked happy.</p><p>Darien slipped his hand around Lelandi\u2019s arm, escorting her in the direction of the front doors while Jake shadowed them. \u201cI\u2019m taking you home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did Angelina say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know who the mastermind is. Ritka knew, but wouldn\u2019t say. Since Hosstene was my accountant at the factory, she cleared Larissa\u2019s checks without a word to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Ritka was the only one dealing with this guy, do you think they had sexual relations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoc Featherston conducted an autopsy and confirmed she wasn\u2019t a virgin, yet officially, she\u2019d never been mated.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi let out her breath. \u201cSo he might have been her lover, too. But no male seems to be unduly upset at her passing.\u201d She glanced back at Silva, looking abandoned.</p><p>\u201cLater. I want her to stay with Carol for now and keep her company. She needs someone to talk to until she can settle into her new life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHrumpf,\u201d Lelandi said. \u201cShe\u2019ll brainwash her.\u201d</p><p>Darien stared down at Lelandi as he walked her to his new SUV. \u201cBrainwash her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, tell her that the grays were the first lupus garous.</p><p>\u201d Darien laughed. \u201cI\u2019m staying out of this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Trevor guard the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol thinks he\u2019s involved. She told Tom all that she suspected. I have Uncle Sheridan checking Trevor\u2019s story out, and in the meantime, he\u2019s got jailhouse duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s being set up. Why not have him guard me, and you can have someone watch him just in case. When you\u2019re not around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, Lelandi?\u201d He helped her into the SUV.</p> <p>\u201cI just want to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Jake climbed into the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI was seeing his sister,\u201d Darien said, sounding tired.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She took his hand and kissed it. \u201cBut then you had a vision. But not exactly a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dream where I first found you. I knew then I had to have you, no other. Trevor was angry, his sister heartbroken. He didn\u2019t care so much about how his sister felt, but that he would have had more leverage with me had I mated her. When Larissa came to Silver Town and we were mated, Annie took off for Green Valley and mated with a gray there. I understand she\u2019s happy and due to have twins in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Trevor could have been blackmailing Larissa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Surprised Darien would permit it, Lelandi sat on one of the sofas, waiting for Trevor to join her in the sunroom, ready to question him about his mudslide story. The snow fell steadily outside the windows and a fire blazed in a rock fireplace centered in the room, giving it a homey, comfortable ambience\u2014which didn\u2019t fit the mood of what she was about to do. Trevor\u2019s face couldn\u2019t have been any stonier and his icy glare held her gaze when he stalked into the room. But she steeled her resolve while Jake remained outside within earshot.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Not removing his jacket, Trevor shoved his hands in his pockets and ignored her.</p><p>Fine. \u201cYou lied about the mudslide when Tom and I were shot. You said you were taking care of accident victims.\u201d</p><p>Trevor continued to glower at her.</p><p>\u201cDeputy, I don\u2019t believe you did anything malicious to contribute to my sister\u2019s death. I know you hated her. That you wanted Darien to marry your sister, hoping she could convince Darien to make you sheriff some day and not Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no authority questioning me. You\u2019re just Darien\u2019s bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And Larissa was my sister. You\u2019re right. You don\u2019t have to tell me anything. But how long do you think it\u2019ll be before Darien discovers you lied about the mudslide? Do you want to die for someone else\u2019s crime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was seeing someone,\u201d he mumbled under his breath, his gaze shifting to the fire.</p><p>Ohmigod, no wonder he hadn\u2019t been interested in Silva. He was already hung up on someone else. But why keep it a secret? \u201cSomeone Darien didn\u2019t approve of?\u201d</p><p>Trevor refused to look at her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who was already mated?\u201d</p><p>He jerked his head around and cast her a chilling glare. \u201cNo, damn you. Just because your sister hooked up with three different mates, doesn\u2019t mean any of the rest of us do.\u201d</p><p>Needing his cooperation, Lelandi stamped down a hasty response. She hated the shameful way her sister had carried on with another male when she was mated to Darien, yet she couldn\u2019t help feeling Larissa was the victim of her circumstances. If her people had allowed for divorce, she would have been fine. \u201cThen who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need her alibi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Silva was the shooter. Ritka and her friends were the blackmailers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Silva wasn\u2019t the shooter.\u201d</p><p>Trevor\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWho was the mastermind who killed Hosstene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t pin that on me. I had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you when you were supposed to aid Darien in his fight against my red pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had me replace Wilkerson pulling guard duty at the jailhouse. Later, I heard Darien said I was supposed to be at the house protecting you. But no one ever told me. Then here come two blasted reds, taller than any I\u2019ve ever seen. They knock me out, tie me up, and free the prisoner. I\u2019ll tell you another thing, the sheriff told Darien he was looking for me as if he had no idea where I was. Hell, he sent me to the jailhouse.\u201d</p><p>Miscommunication? Or was Trevor lying again? \u201cYou said there were only six males from the pack who arrived. But there were several more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I saw. Apparently, more sneaked in without our knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told them about the guest room where I was staying? That\u2019s where they entered the second floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were staying with Darien by then.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi was beginning to wonder about Darien\u2019s uncle. \u201cDid the sheriff know I had moved to Darien\u2019s bedroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him.\u201d</p><p>Trevor yanked his keys out of his pocket, but before he could leave, Lelandi asked, \u201cWhat happened to you at the hospital when Ritka and Doc were shot? You were guarding Ural. Or supposed to be. Ritka screamed for you, but you never came.\u201d</p><p>The tips of Trevor\u2019s ears reddened. \u201cI don\u2019t need to explain anything more to you.\u201d He stormed out of the sunroom.</p><p>Jake immediately peeked in on Lelandi. Assured she was all right, he lifted his phone from his belt and shut the door.</p><p>Lelandi took a deep breath. Next, she had to have a word with the sheriff. She was certain that would go over as well as the talk with his deputy. But she had to ask Darien if he knew what had happened to Trevor when Joe killed Doc and Ritka.</p><p>An hour later, Darien arrived home and Lelandi, anxious to get an audience with his uncle, dropped the salad fixings in the bowl and hurried to see her mate while Tom was preparing lasagna in the kitchen. She blurted, \u201cCan you arrange for me to speak with Sheridan?\u201d</p><p>Tom served up the lasagna and Jake finished the salad and set it on the table, both casting them a sideways glance. She assumed it was a sore subject.</p><p>Darien kissed Lelandi\u2019s mouth, then smiled and hugged her tight. \u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the dismissal. \u201cWhat about your uncle? He might be the key to knowing what Trevor was doing the night he said he was working a mudslide.\u201d</p><p>Darien pulled out her chair. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later. This afternoon, we\u2019ll have a memorial service for Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about for Ritka?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>Darien cast him an annoyed look like he shouldn\u2019t have mentioned it. \u201cHer family wants a private ceremony. Immediate family only.\u201d</p><p>Jake and Tom exchanged glances but neither said a word.</p><p>Lelandi hated it when the brothers knew something she didn\u2019t and were bent on keeping it from her. \u201cOkay, so why do they want a private ceremony? Is this done regularly here?\u201d</p><p>Back home pack members buried their kind. No one had a simple, family ceremony, although humans were excluded. She assumed humans would come to Doc\u2019s funeral since his work had impacted so many in the community.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the family agreed upon,\u201d Darien said casually, giving her a look like he wanted her to leave it at that.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not normal. Which means something. Care to speculate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means,\u201d Lelandi said, clenching her teeth, \u201csince Ritka was involved in my sister\u2019s death, her family\u2019s too ashamed to have the pack witness the burial.\u201d</p><p>None of them said anything.</p><p>\u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means the family wanted it. Nothing more to it than that.\u201d Darien\u2019s voice had a warning edge to it.</p><p>\u201cSorry, if I don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>Darien let out a harsh breath. \u201cThey feel your sister contributed to her death.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s jaw tightened and she fought tears welling up deep inside.</p><p>\u201cThey know they can\u2019t exclude you from the funeral without offending me, but they look at you and are reminded of Larissa. So they are having a private funeral. Most likely she was involved in the blackmail. But we have no hard evidence to support this theory.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi got up abruptly from the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. You and the rest of the pack can go. I wouldn\u2019t want to deprive them of their leader\u2019s presence.\u201d</p><p>Darien seized her wrist and made her sit back down. \u201cThey made their decision. Under the circumstances, it\u2019s best for all concerned.\u201d</p><p>Because Ritka was involved in Larissa\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, \u201cso tell me\u2014when Ritka screamed for Trevor at the hospital, why didn\u2019t he stop Joe?\u201d</p><p>Jake and Tom concentrated on their lasagna while Darien placed his fork on his plate and leaned away from the table. \u201cWhen Joe saw Trevor was guarding Ural, he knocked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Lelandi said, rolling her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe had a concussion, Lelandi. So yes, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my brother and uncle conveniently got the better of him in the jail. Maybe Trevor needs a different job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Sheridan counseled him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmpf. He needs a heck of a lot more than counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs to another matter,\u201d Darien said, \u201cwe\u2019ll have a Thanksgiving feast for the pack.\u201d</p><p>She figured the feast was a tradition they\u2019d always carried out like so many people did across the States until she saw the questioning glances on his brothers\u2019 faces.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, because Jake and Tom wouldn\u2019t, and she figured something more had to be up.</p><p>\u201cA feast to give thanks that I have a mate. Is that not reason enough?\u201d Darien\u2019s expression was lighthearted, but the fa\u00e7ade didn\u2019t hide the darkness brewing beneath the surface.</p> <p>She offered a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure everyone will enjoy a feast, no matter the reason. Free food puts everyone in good spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you want to have this feast?\u201d Jake asked, his voice shadowed. \u201cThe civic auditorium? School gym? The tavern, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Darien lifted his cup to his lips.</p><p>Lelandi suspected the worst. Darien knew who killed her sister, and he needed the majority of the pack together. The feast was the battleground. Or at least the beginning. The battle would take place in the woods, secluded from town, perfect for a fight between wolves.</p><p>Her eyes filling with tears, she sat back in her chair. Ever since she\u2019d learned her sister had died, she\u2019d had this overwhelming ache to right the wrong, to avenge her sister\u2019s death. And now Darien knew who it was? But he would have told her right away if he\u2019d planned to. Which meant he was keeping it a secret. Anger and upset bottled up inside threatened to spill out. She fought the emotions, trying to maintain a cool, alpha stance. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll reveal himself when the time comes.\u201d</p> <p>She ground her teeth, attempting to stay calm, but her blood was running hot.</p><p>Jake scraped his empty wineglass across the oak table.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Jake? You know how much doing that annoys me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you suspect him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Lelandi asked in exasperation. She quickly brushed away insolent tears that dared streak down her cheeks. She was not a wilting damn flower.</p><p>Darien looked torn between comforting her and being the indomitable pack leader and setting up the rules. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I won\u2019t openly speculate. Too much of that has been going on of late. Several pack members have unduly ostracized Trevor because many think he had a hand in Larissa\u2019s death. At the feast, the murderer will reveal himself. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll organize the men to cook the turkeys beforehand at the school,\u201d Jake offered.</p><p>\u201cTom, I want you to get the word out to the pack about the feast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do, Darien. I can coordinate the efforts of those making the vegetables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Darien turned to Lelandi.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand his seeing how teary-eyed she\u2019d become. Looking down at the table, she swallowed the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cLelandi,\u201d he said softly, \u201cmaybe you, Carol, and Silva can make some more of those apple pies that everyone loved so much?\u201d</p><p>Her heart aching to the core, she glowered at him. \u201cYou know who it is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d he said to his brothers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make the arrangements at once,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Tom inclined his head slightly to Lelandi, then the two brothers hastened to leave the dining room.</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t move from his chair, but just studied Lelandi.</p><p>Why did he have to keep her in the dark? Why?</p><p>He rose from his chair and walked around the table to join her, touching her cheek with his fingertips in a gentle caress. \u201cIf I tell you who I suspect and I\u2019m wrong, you\u2019ll harbor a mistrust of the individual. But more than that, I know how you are. You\u2019ll confront him without regard to the danger you\u2019d put yourself in. I won\u2019t have it. In two day\u2019s time, we\u2019ll know once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll fight him to the death.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang and Tom hurried back into the room to get it. \u201cTom here.\u201d The look of shock on Tom\u2019s face made her suspect something awful must have happened. Jake poked his head in.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>Tom looked at Darien, waiting for him to allow him to speak in front of Lelandi.</p><p>He seemed indecisive about allowing it or keeping her further in the dark. Then he finally gave a slight nod, his gaze hard as he caught Lelandi\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cAngelina\u2019s dead,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>\u201cHeart gave out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatural causes or was she helped along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoroner won\u2019t be able to tell us for a few days.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi closed her eyes, not believing the killer could have struck again. She felt hands on her shoulders and looked up to see Darien rubbing them. He leaned down and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDid he kill her, Darien? Did he get to her, too?\u201d She choked back a sob.</p><p>Darien shook his head and said to Tom, \u201cI want the report soonest. Jake, I need you and Tom to talk to everyone. Find out who was serving on guard duty when she expired and who went in to see her.\u201d He squeezed Lelandi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve had enough excitement to last a lifetime and it\u2019s getting late. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t brush her worry away, and when he led her upstairs, she felt drained, as if she wasn\u2019t even there. Would the killer truly be revealed at the feast? Or would he try for her again before then?</p><p>Two days later, Lelandi read over the coroner\u2019s report in Darien\u2019s office while he watched her. Death due to asphyxiation. \u201cMurdered,\u201d Lelandi said under her breath, although she wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>\u201cHer room was at the back of the hospital. Someone had unlocked the window, an inside job. Anyone could have slipped in, murdered her, and left without anyone being aware,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cBut it was a man who killed her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely, and she bit him.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi glanced up from the report. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Featherston told me. He found remnants of blood around her teeth, but the blood wasn\u2019t hers. He didn\u2019t want the word to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, Darien. By now the bite marks could have healed and disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not. Mandatory dress is short-sleeved shirts for the men for the feast today. Only my brothers, Doc Featherston, and the killer will know the real reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t he do a DNA test on the blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough for the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the murderer doesn\u2019t show up today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will. And the game will be over.\u201d</p><p>Later that afternoon, and with the tension running high, Darien welcomed Lelandi\u2019s family in the sunroom while Lelandi baked pies with Carol and Silva in the kitchen. He gave Lelandi\u2019s mother a hug, seeing the resemblance to Lelandi, the red hair, petite features, green eyes and riveting smile. He shook her father\u2019s hand as he sat in his wheelchair, looking proud, but with a weariness lingering in his features. His dark amber eyes assessed Darien with a wolf\u2019s guardedness.</p><p>Lelandi was unaware Darien had invited her family so that he had a chance to meet them first, and welcome them like a pack leader would before he switched roles to greet them as family. Darien shook Leidolf\u2019s hand next, then her Uncle Hrothgar\u2019s, and Ural\u2019s last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you suspect the reason I\u2019ve invited you here,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cTo ask permission to have my daughter after the fact,\u201d her father growled, banging his fist on the arm of his wheelchair. Lelandi\u2019s mother rested her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Although it had never been his intention to ask for Lelandi since he\u2019d already mated with her, Darien bowed his head with respect.</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission,\u201d her father said, his voice gruff, but admiration shown in his eyes.</p><p>Everyone else waited quietly for Darien\u2019s next words, tension filling the room. \u201cThe killer will be exposed today, the fight will follow, and the celebration feast afterward.\u201d</p><p>Her father inclined his head. \u201cThis is acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard rumors Lelandi may be with triplets,\u201d her mother said, her voice hopeful.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wildhaven, it\u2019s too early to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. But I wish to discuss another matter. We\u2019ve lost our doctor and Lelandi has her heart set on Doc Weber of your pack joining us. Would this be agreeable?\u201d</p><p>Hrothgar cleared his throat. \u201cI, of course, would prefer he stay at Wildhaven with my pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201chaving triplets can be difficult for even lupus garous. Because Lelandi has a fondness for Doc Weber and he has for her...\u201d She spread her hands, palms up.</p><p>Darien waited for Hrothgar\u2019s approval as Wildhaven\u2019s newest pack leader. Hrothgar gave a stiff nod.</p><p>Turning to Leidolf, Darien said, \u201cI know you want to avenge Larissa\u2019s death. I ask that you allow me the honor since it is my pack, she was my mate\u2014no matter how wrongly that came about\u2014and the villain is one of my pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to tear the bastard from limb to limb, I acquiesce. Should you not succeed, I won\u2019t wait for either of your brothers to jump into the fray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Darien looked at Jake and Tom, both who reluctantly nodded. \u201cSettled then.\u201d He motioned to Tom, who opened the door and Mrs. Hastings and several other ladies hurried in with apple cider, shrimp, and cheese dips with crackers. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Lelandi you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He had every intention of delaying the inevitable, feeling an insatiable urge to prove to her that she wanted to remain with him and not return to her family no matter how much he told himself the notion was too ridiculous to consider. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 25</p><p>BUSINESS AS USUAL. THAT\u2019S THE WAY EVERYONE PLAYED their roles as Sam organized the drinks in the dining room, Tom coordinated the side dishes, Jake managed the deliveries of the turkeys, while Lelandi, Carol, and Silva finished baking the pies. The aroma of roasted turkey and gravy filled the air, making Lelandi\u2019s stomach rumble, although she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to eat, she was so uptight.</p><p>Carol peered out the kitchen window where the table sat in an alcove. \u201cSnow\u2019s still falling. This will be the best ski season Silver Town\u2019s had in five years.\u201d</p> <p>Silva cast a questioning look in Lelandi\u2019s direction, but though she caught it, she didn\u2019t acknowledge her concern. Everyone was wearing polite smiles, the conversations centering around the weather, a hunt, some whispered speculation about Sam and Silva, but nothing about the reason for the feast. Lelandi was sure the conversations about that had already been held behind closed doors.</p><p>Darien walked into the kitchen, stretched his arms above his head, and smiled at Lelandi.</p><p>Silva stammered some excuse and hurried out of the kitchen. Carol took longer before it sank in that the alpha leader needed a moment alone with his mate. Her face suddenly flushed and she quickly made her excuses and hurried after Silva, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something to me?\u201d she scolded outside the kitchen.</p><p>Darien rested his hands on Lelandi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou smell of cinnamon, apples, and brown sugar. Good enough to eat.\u201d He kissed her lips, not waiting for her approval, slipping his tongue into her mouth. \u201cHmm, taste like brown sugar, apples, and cinnamon, too.\u201d</p> <p>She melted like the dabs of butter she\u2019d spread on top of the lattice-work pie crusts. \u201cHave... have you seen anyone with bite marks?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cLelandi...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid either Angelina didn\u2019t bite her attacker hard enough or the scar has already healed. No matter. We\u2019ve got him where we want him. I\u2019ve felt the distance between us when we\u2019ve made love the last two days. I know you feel hurt that I wouldn\u2019t tell you who I most suspect. But I have to do this my way, knowing you the way I do.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her gaze from his chest to his eyes. \u201cI love you, Darien, but I don\u2019t want to be kept in the dark.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips again, his fingers pushing a couple of buttons through the buttonholes on her silk blouse. He slipped his hands inside her blouse and fondled her breasts through the lacy bra.</p><p>\u201cAhh, Darien, you taste of apple cider, the good stuff.\u201d She tangled her tongue with his for another spicy taste.</p><p>Voices drew nearer the kitchen, but suddenly stopped and footfalls moved discretely away. Lelandi suspected Silva and Carol were warding everyone away in lieu of a \u201cDon\u2019t Disturb\u201d sign.</p> <p>Darien tackled Lelandi\u2019s belt, but she stilled his hands. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling testy.\u201d</p><p>He captured her mouth with his, kissing her into submission and moved her hands away from her belt, then unbuckled it. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy the meal more after we relieve some of the tension between us.\u201d</p><p>She suspected there was more to his need to make love to her than he was admitting. She recognized his craving to prove she was his and couldn\u2019t understand what had triggered it again. Unless it was to confirm to his gathered pack that he had claimed her. No, it seemed to run deeper, like when he felt his pack members were hitting on her at the tavern, and he had to show she was his and only his.</p><p>He rubbed his hand between her legs, his fingers pressing the jeans and satin panties between her feminine folds, stealing her thoughts, eliciting a soft moan from her.</p><p>\u201cSay you want to wait and we will,\u201d he whispered into her ear, his voice husky with desire. He leaned his hardened erection against her and rubbed. \u201cSay you want me, Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>She could no more resist him now than she could in her dreams. Seizing the buttons on his shirt, she nearly ripped them off in haste. She ran her hands over his bare chest, her fingernails flickering over his already pebbled nipples. With a groan, he yanked down her jeans and panties in one fell swoop. Leaning her against the kitchen table covered in flour, granules of brown sugar, and speckles of cinnamon, he shoved away mixing spoons and a sieve that clattered to the tile floor.</p><p>He dipped his hand in a bag of brown sugar, then sprinkled it on her bare breasts and stomach. Lelandi smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to eat your meal, before you get dessert. Didn\u2019t your mother ever tell you that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was more of a red meat kind of guy\u2014although all of that\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged out of his jeans and pushed her legs apart. But before he penetrated her woman\u2019s core, he licked the sugar off her breasts and stomach, sending streaks of pleasure rifling through her. She needed this as much as he did. She wanted the closeness, the loving, the solidarity, before he had to fight. And if it gave him strength, all the better.</p><p>She combed her fingers through his hair, luxuriating in the feel of the satiny strands and of his velvet tongue lapping at her skin. His fingers slipped down her stomach, tracing the slight swell in her belly, lower, to her short curly hairs, combing through them to discover the dewy opening between her thighs. Stroking her nub, he triggered flames of desire to sweep through her, a delicious torment, begging to be appeased.</p><p>She dug her fingers into his back, the toned muscles of the lupus garou tensing with her touch, and she prodded him to penetrate her. She listened to the soothing sound of the thunder of his heartbeat, his heavy lusty breath, and her heartbeat pounding beneath his.</p><p>Darien plunged deep inside of her, his stiff cock thrusting with feverish intent, his pelvis rubbing her mound until every nerve was ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she mouthed against his lips, remembering the dreams when she couldn\u2019t hear her words or his. For the first time since he\u2019d made the announcement about having the feast, she felt one with him again. Then an earth-shattering release compelled her to cry out, her body trembling with satisfaction, but Darien muffled her voice with another erotic deep kiss, his tongue probing her mouth.</p><p>Groaning, he filled her with his seed, but thrust twice more until she\u2019d milked him dry, the orgasm rippling through her.</p><p>He closed his eyes and rested on top of her. \u201cYou are something else, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could say the same about you.\u201d She combed her fingers through his hair. \u201cNow you\u2019ll want a nap.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he licked her lips. \u201cNow I want a feast. And then dessert again.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off her and a few granules of brown sugar sparkled on his chest. She licked them up, then he helped her off the table and wiped the flour from her back. \u201cWe\u2019re a mess,\u201d she whispered, her skin flushed with exertion.</p><p>He cast her a wolfish grin. \u201cYou got the brunt of it.\u201d He brushed flour out of her hair and she groaned. \u201cAt least the granules of cinnamon disappear in the color of your hair.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an annoyed look. \u201cNext time, I\u2019m on top.</p><p>You can be covered in flour, sugar, and cinnamon.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he helped her into her clothes. \u201cI\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>He touched her belly. \u201cI understand Carol believes we\u2019ll have triplets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConjecture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. But she won\u2019t tell me what sex they are.\u201d</p><p>Pleased that Carol thought she was pregnant, Lelandi still couldn\u2019t believe Carol could really know such a thing. She shook more flour and sugar out of her hair.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI invited your brother and uncle and parents to the feast. They dragged Ural along.\u201d Lelandi stared at Darien, then slapped his shoulder.</p><p>That\u2019s why he had been so intent on making love to her. It had nothing to do with his pack but all to do with worrying she might want to return to her family.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to prove anything to them. I would have stayed with you.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and kissed it. \u201cYou\u2019re an alpha pack leader\u2019s mate, and you have the heart of a lion. Let\u2019s get the feast under way.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi was sure the fight would come first, but only after she dealt with her father, who wouldn\u2019t like it that she hadn\u2019t gotten his permission to mate Darien.</p><p>Darien escorted Lelandi into the sunroom where her parents were sitting, visiting with some of the members of his pack. Her brother and uncle were talking to Jake, and Ural sat in a corner looking unhappy. Probably still mad because of his incarceration and Darien\u2019s people\u2019s treatment of him. But he shouldn\u2019t have hung around.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you alone for a few minutes to get reacquainted,\u201d Darien said to Lelandi. Everyone remained stiff and formal until Darien gave Lelandi a searing kiss on the mouth, grinned, and then winked at her. He squeezed her hand and reiterated, \u201cThe entertainment begins in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>The grays who were speaking with Lelandi\u2019s family rapidly left the sunroom while Lelandi kissed her mother and father, then her brother, uncle, and cousin.</p><p>\u201cTriplets,\u201d her mother said, her face beaming. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you during the last trimester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill... will you be living with Leidolf all the way out in Oregon?\u201d Lelandi\u2019s voice betrayed her sadness.</p><p>\u201cHeaven\u2019s no. Not with my grandkids coming and Hrothgar now in charge of the pack at Wildhaven.\u201d Her mother patted Uncle Hrothgar\u2019s arm. \u201cYour father\u2019s little brother is now in charge and our land is saved.\u201d She glanced at Leidolf. \u201cWhen are you going to give me some grandkids?\u201d</p><p>Leidolf looked annoyed and folded his arms. \u201cI need a mate and none are available, right now.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor tugged at Uncle Hrothgar\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a mate, too. I did see a red female in the house earlier. What is she doing in a gray pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol? A red from Bruin\u2019s pack turned her. But she\u2019s an only child now and has aging parents here so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s interested in leaving.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leidolf shook his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take a newly turned lupus garou. Too much of a responsibility. They don\u2019t know our ways and would need constant supervision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if you can be that choosy, dear brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s our line to think of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean because we\u2019re royals?\u201d Lelandi rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt never meant much to you, but someone has to keep the line going. And not by mixing up with a gray either.\u201d</p><p>Their mother smiled. \u201cJust like the old days. I forget how much you two fought.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYour mate is motioning for this event to get under way. Save your teeth and claws for the one who deserves your wrath, if Darien should fail in his mission to avenge Larissa\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t fail,\u201d Lelandi said with confidence. But she sure as hell wanted to know who he was going to be pitted against\u2014who had killed her sister.</p><p>In front of his gathered pack and their guests, Darien raised a glass of cider, his free arm around Lelandi\u2019s waist. \u201cWe\u2019re gathered here to celebrate the mating between our clans of Silver Town and Wildhaven. Lelandi is not only a royal,\u201d Darien said, pausing until the gasps died away, \u201cbut the daughter of pack leaders on both her paternal and maternal sides. So we are much honored to welcome Lelandi and her family into our embrace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d a chorus of grays and reds responded.</p><p>He raised his hand for silence. \u201cNow for the grievous news. A pack bands together as a family, a united front against all others. But when one of our kind deviates from acceptable pack behavior, the individual must be dealt with swiftly and harshly. A death for a death, although in this case the murderer has killed more than one. But we can only mete out justice once.</p><p>\u201cNormally, I would challenge the murderer and face him in our way, wolf to wolf. But I ask my Uncle Sheridan, sheriff of Silver Town, to fight on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>Low conversation filled the room and Lelandi glanced at Darien. He pressed her close and whispered in her ear, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Sheridan stood tall, a small smile curving his lips. He glanced at Trevor.</p><p>\u201cHe has agreed to fight Trevor.\u201d</p> <p>The room was deadly silent.</p><p>Red-faced, Trevor stood his ground.</p><p>Lelandi looked up at Darien, tears in her eyes. Trevor wasn\u2019t the killer. How could Darien have made the mistake?</p><p>\u201cTrevor admitted he lied about taking care of mudslide victims on the night of the shootings. Why? He wouldn\u2019t reveal the answer. But Uncle Sheridan knew. Trevor had hired the gunman who shot Lelandi, Tom, and Sam. He appeared on the ridge and killed the gunman before anyone could question him. The motive, you ask? He wanted to be sheriff. He thought his sister\u2019s mating with me would secure that position for him in the future. But some might have heard rumors Larissa\u2019s offspring were not my own and when Ritka revealed this to Trevor, he dreamed up this blackmail scheme. Through the sheriff\u2019s diligence, he discovered the money in a bank account in Green Valley in Trevor\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Trevor shot a dagger of a glare at the sheriff.</p><p>Darien motioned to Chester. \u201cActing on our behalf, P.I. Chester McKinley helped to uncover this treachery. All the puzzle pieces fit together. Trevor was a condemned man living on borrowed time.\u201d Darien\u2019s spine stiffened and his eyes held a feral gleam.</p><p>But Trevor didn\u2019t look like a condemned man, which made Lelandi suspicious that Darien and he had cooked up this whole charade.</p><p>\u201cExcept for one thing.\u201d Darien waved at Carol. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have revealed Carol\u2019s special gift because it\u2019s her choice, but she\u2019s agreed to save a man\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>Carol nodded.</p><p>Lelandi stared at her. She knew, too? And didn\u2019t tell Lelandi? Inwardly, she growled.</p><p>\u201cCarol has second sight.\u201d</p><p>Muffled conversation renewed.</p><p>\u201cShe saw not Trevor in the vision, but another man, who shoved the chair out from under Larissa\u2019s feet, allowing her to strangle until she was dead.\u201d</p><p>Darien held onto Lelandi when she felt ready to collapse, but she had to remain strong as the pack leader\u2019s mate, and she bit back the tears, willing them to stay at bay.</p><p>\u201cCarol\u2019s visions aren\u2019t clear all the time, she explained to me. But one thing was\u2014he wore a police uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrevor,\u201d Sheridan said, his voice booming.</p><p>\u201cAt first, that\u2019s what Carol thought since all evidence pointed to him. But she touched the rope the murderer had tied into a noose. That man was you, Uncle Sheridan. You went on vacation, thinking you\u2019d committed the perfect crime\u2014murdered my mate, who was a disgrace to the pack because she was already mated and now having another gray\u2019s offspring. But you hadn\u2019t planned on Larissa having a family. A sister, who would come to avenge her. Ritka must have notified you when she was at the tavern that Lelandi had arrived, and you hurried home to take care of the mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Trevor\u2019s gun fired the fatal bullet that killed the gunman. He was the shooter,\u201d Sheridan said.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers and I investigated your house when you searched for evidence at Trevor\u2019s. We had already inspected his home first and found nothing to connect him with the crimes. However, at your home, we discovered the hunter\u2019s spray that makes an individual smell like decaying leaves. At Angelina\u2019s home, we found the kind that makes a person invisible to other animals. Why would either of you need hunter\u2019s sprays to hide your scent?\u201d</p><p>Sheridan gave a coy smile. \u201cI have no idea why Angelina would have such a thing, but the stuff I have was evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHidden underneath your bathroom sink? And the GHB? Used to drug so many at the hospital? We found it in the same location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore evidence. I couldn\u2019t keep it at the jailhouse. Trevor might have destroyed it. Besides, I was drugged, too, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConveniently, yes. To counter suspicion. And you were the one in charge of so many of the investigations. You could \u2018find\u2019 whatever suited your purposes. If you had \u2018found\u2019 the GHB used in the crime at the hospital, why hadn\u2019t you reported it? We checked the area where we discovered Lelandi after she\u2019d been shot. No decaying leaves like you\u2019d said.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi shivered, realizing how close she\u2019d come to death at Darien\u2019s uncle\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cI must have gone to the wrong location. At the time of the shooting, I was at a hotel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe investigated the hotel already. You checked in, but you disappeared in a hurry. One of the maids said you left several items in the bathroom and on the desk. You grabbed your bag, threw it in the truck, and roared out of there like the devil was after you. Even the manager said she noticed because you nearly hit another vehicle and the driver laid on the horn,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cSo I left in a hurry. Mason called me and said several shootings had occurred, and I needed to return at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called you on your cell phone well after you\u2019d left the hotel. Time enough for you to have heard from Ritka, hired a gunman, and return so you could strangle Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Sheridan turned his murderous glower on Trevor. \u201cHe has no alibi for the night of the shootings. He lied. And if I was strangling Lelandi, who shot the gunman?\u201d</p><p>Darien offered a sinister smile. \u201cYou admit there had to be two of you? That the time was such that someone else had to have shot and killed the gunman? Only Jake and I knew this.\u201d</p><p>Sheridan\u2019s jaw ticked in restrained anger.</p><p>\u201cTrue, Trevor lied about where he was. But he does have an alibi. He\u2019s been having an affair with an underage lupus garou.\u201d</p><p>Ohmigod, was it Caitlin?</p><p>Sheridan looked smug. \u201cThen the girl lied. To give him an alibi,\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mother told me about her daughter\u2019s condition. She found them in bed together in a hotel on the outskirts of town. She was giving them the riot act for an hour at the same time when the shooting of the gunman occurred. Angelina used Trevor\u2019s gun to murder the gunman. You and she are without alibis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s conveniently dead so she can\u2019t defend herself. But then again, she hated Larissa and Lelandi, so maybe she did hire the gunman. She did have the blackmail money.\u201d</p><p>Darien snorted. \u201cYou said Trevor had it.\u201d He waved a diary in the air. \u201cRitka was your lover. Doc Featherston examined the body and learned she\u2019d been mated. Ritka wrote how you\u2019d set up the blackmail scheme and when Larissa discovered you were the mastermind, you killed her. You were obsessed with keeping the pack line clean, and Ritka feared you, although you continued to come to her night after night. She was your partner in crime, along with Hosstene and Angelina, who you conveniently disposed of. But, you, damn it, you are my own flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mate was a whore and brought shame to both the pack and our family\u2019s good name. It was only a matter of time before she took off with Joe. He\u2019d been stealing from the silver mine so he and his lover could leave here. You would have gone after her, killed Joe, and brought her and her bastard children back to the pack as your own, while she remained the female pack leader, weak and disloyal. With her lover dead, do you think she would have changed her ways? Bah! She would have been more depressed, bringing the whole pack down with her. I couldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d Uncle Sheridan tore at his shirt. \u201cYou want me to fight Trevor, I will.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi hated Sheridan, but his words tore at her heart. He was probably right about everything he said.</p><p>The pack would have suffered. But she couldn\u2019t agree her sister should have died because she had loved the wrong man.</p><p>Darien grunted. \u201cNo. I only wanted to draw the truth from you. You\u2019ve shamed the family and our pack.</p><p>You\u2019ll fight me.\u201d</p><p>Several of the pack members patted Trevor on the back, although some gave him dirty looks. Taking an underage lupus garou was unacceptable in their society, and Lelandi wondered again if it was Caitlin. She glanced at Doc Mitchell and his gaze met hers. Caitlin\u2019s parents were absent. In fact, no underage lupus garou were present. When Bruin had such a gathering, everyone from the pack, regardless of age, was required to attend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darien kissed Lelandi\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lelandi. I had to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always done right by me. You will for Larissa as well.\u201d</p><p>Darien took a deep breath and nodded. \u201cIt ends here and now.\u201d He turned to face his pack. \u201cTo the field.\u201d</p> <p>The battlefield.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>AS SOON AS LELANDI SAW SHERIDAN IN HIS WOLF COAT, SHE knew he was the one who\u2019d stalked her in the woods. Too bad the pickup hadn\u2019t run him over on the road.</p><p>Nearly everyone loped out into the winter setting in their wolf forms where the upper crust of snow was crisp and giant snowflakes fluttered earthward. Wolves have the advantage over larger animals on deep-crusted snow, although Lelandi figured Sheridan wouldn\u2019t fall through the snow like a moose or elk might, slowing him down, despite his heftier size. Though she could hope.</p><p>Carol, not ready to join the wolf pack to watch another killing fight, didn\u2019t shapeshift. Maybe because she was afraid to turn wolf or the fear another wolf would attack her again. Lelandi\u2019s father, who remained in his wheelchair, watched out the sunroom window with Carol at his side. Since the accident, he hadn\u2019t been able to shapeshift, and she knew he felt like less of a lupus garou and battled depression, wishing often he had died with his people. Although she was certain he wanted desperately to be the one to avenge Larissa\u2019s death.</p> <p>Both grays and reds alike formed a circle while Darien and his uncle faced off. Sheridan was taller by four inches and stockier built, but Darien had youth and strength on his side.</p><p>Leidolf crouched, ready to pounce, but Uncle Hrothgar growled at him, and her brother bowed his head slightly and straightened. For an eternity, it seemed Darien stared Sheridan down. Their wolf coats kept the chill out, the second dense coat keeping the snowflakes from touching their skin and melting. Everyone patiently watched for the showdown to begin while neither panted, just watched each other, their tails stretched stiff behind them, their thick hair standing at attention, ears perked, waiting for the other to move.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s mind worked over the past events, and she realized how easy it had been for Sheridan to cover his tracks since he was always in charge of the investigations\u2014even to confirm Larissa had committed suicide.</p><p>Darien turned and walked in a circle toward his uncle, who immediately moved away.</p><p>Sheridan continued to avoid Darien, but the pack leader was quickly closing the gap. Inwardly, Lelandi darkly smiled. The first test and Sheridan had failed. The bastard. Sheridan tried to turn, but he wasn\u2019t agile enough and Darien bit him in the flank.</p><p>If Lelandi hadn\u2019t been in her wolf form, she would have cheered Darien.</p> <p>Sheridan yelped and dodged before Darien took another bite. He wouldn\u2019t kill him quickly, she figured. Not after Sheridan had murdered her sister, two pack members, and tried to murder Lelandi.</p><p>His people and hers would want justice\u2014lupus garou justice, but drawn out enough to make it count.</p><p>Sheridan tried to hide his limp from the wound, but he continued to circle around the inside of the group, keeping away from Darien. By the way his tail drooped slightly, Sheridan was already showing signs of defeat.</p><p>When he neared Leidolf, her brother snarled at Sheridan, his teeth bared, his tail straight\u2014readying for the attack.</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s fur stood on end. Let Darien take care of it, she prayed. But Sheridan snapped back at Leidolf, so close Lelandi nearly died. Leidolf\u2019s blood was running hot, the way the anger swelled deep inside him and she, being so connected with her triplet\u2019s emotions, felt swept into the maelstrom.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Leidolf responded to Sheridan\u2019s taunt and attacked, sinking his teeth into the bigger gray\u2019s side.</p><p>Sheridan could kill her brother for being such a hotheaded fool as soon as the bigger gray shook him loose. But she didn\u2019t expect Sheridan to free himself from Leidolf\u2019s grip, then bite into Leidolf\u2019s neck, since Darien was more of a threat.</p><p>Instinctively, Lelandi went for Sheridan\u2019s throat and grabbed hold. She felt Darien brush against her side, trying to get to Sheridan, but she couldn\u2019t let go for fear the gray would kill her next. As fast as it took a bolt of lightning to strike the ground, Sheridan released Leidolf and seized Lelandi\u2019s throat. He would kill her like he murdered her sister, and if he did, he would destroy Darien\u2019s reason to live.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have time to panic, or feel Sheridan\u2019s jaws clamping down tighter, stopping the air from flowing, before Darien grappled his uncle\u2019s neck with his powerful jaws. Biting down hard, he crushed the bone and the life out of the gray.</p><p>Sheridan\u2019s mouth loosened on Lelandi\u2019s neck, and they both collapsed. When she fell on her side, she lay still, trying to catch her breath. But it was worse than that, and she couldn\u2019t help being totally humiliated. Darien quickly changed into his human form despite the cold and held his hand over the wound on her throat. \u201cCarol!\u201d</p><p>His own neck bleeding, Leidolf nuzzled her face.</p><p>Darien lifted Lelandi from the snow and hurried her into the house.</p><p>\u201cLay her there, Darien. I... I\u2019ve never taken care of an injured wolf,\u201d Carol said, opening a first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cThey can be testier than in their human forms, but in Lelandi\u2019s case, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s always true,\u201d Darien said, a slight smile curving his lips.</p><p>Lelandi growled.</p><p>Doc Mitchell stalked into the house, zipping up his jeans and grabbed his bag. \u201cCame prepared for any eventuality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she changing back?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>Jake threw on a pair of jeans. \u201cToo tired, loss of blood, trauma.\u201d</p><p>Carol\u2019s gaze strayed to Leidolf, yanking on a pair of olive drab khakis.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of Lelandi,\u201d Doc Mitchell said. \u201cYou look after Leidolf.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf buckled his belt. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t need looking after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit, son, and do it for your mother. She\u2019s already lost one of you, and she\u2019s looking a little pale,\u201d his father said.</p><p>Leidolf grumbled, then sat on a chair, his face scowling while Carol wiped away the blood on his throat, and then bandaged him.</p><p>Lelandi studied the way her brother treated Carol with such annoyance and the gentle way in which she ministered to his wounds. Possibility?</p><p>\u201cLelandi, honey,\u201d Darien said. \u201cCan\u2019t you change back?\u201d</p><p>Mitchell bandaged her neck. \u201cSheridan didn\u2019t have a chance to dig in deep enough so the bite marks aren\u2019t too bad. She\u2019ll be fine in a couple of hours.\u201d He gave her a shot for the pain, which she didn\u2019t want, and growled again. The medication spread through her veins, heating her blood.</p><p>Her mother wiped away tears from her own cheeks, then leaned over and patted Lelandi\u2019s head. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right in a little bit, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi closed her eyes, hating that she would fall apart now. How did this look to the whole pack? She groaned.</p><p>Her mother sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the shock of nearly losing her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did not nearly lose me!\u201d her brother snapped.</p><p>Her mother ran her hand over Lelandi\u2019s back. \u201cShe\u2019s been under a lot of strain. That was the last straw. Remember the time when you almost drowned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Leidolf growled.</p><p>\u201cWell, remember? She finally managed to get you by the neck and pull you to shore, but she was in shock over the ordeal. Took her three days before she could turn human again.\u201d</p><p>Leidolf gave an evil grin. \u201cYeah, I remember. She was awful to live with.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi growled low. She had no control over the connection she had with her siblings and their emotions. But she had been the only one who felt her siblings\u2019 emotions so severely she could put herself into such a state over them. She growled again.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Darien lifted Lelandi off the floor. \u201cEnjoy the feast. We will return when we return.\u201d He carried her toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Uncle Sheridan?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cUnmarked grave. The devil can take him.\u201d</p><p>Darien carried Lelandi up the stairs to their bedroom, then laid her down on the mattress. \u201cYou need peace and quiet, love.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to eat. To celebrate their union and the destruction of the gray who had murdered her sister. And she wanted to be human to do it! Damn it.</p><p>But because of the strain and extreme weariness creeping through her body from the pain killer, she drifted off to sleep and found her silver knight waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cLelandi, love.\u201d</p><p>She reached out her arms to him, and he took her into his hard embrace and willed him to love her.</p><p>The rush of adrenaline flowed through her, filling her with orgasmic pleasure, and Lelandi blinked her eyes and stared up at Darien. He smiled back at her, his cock buried deep inside her as hot lava filled her to the core.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she hummed. \u201cWhen did I turn human?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow and slid off her, then pulled her onto his damp chest. \u201cBefore I ravished you.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to me in a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You fell asleep and shapeshifted. I replaced your bandage, but as soon as I pulled you into my arms to snuggle, you had other notions. Started kissing me and stroking me. I thought you were awake.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and touched his taut nipple. \u201cI am now.\u201d Then she frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s really dead, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lelandi. I\u2019m so sorry he was the one.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cMy own flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow... how did you know about Ritka\u2019s diary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarol had a vision that Ritka had hidden it in Doc\u2019s office, where no one would suspect it\u2014buried behind deceased patient files. We didn\u2019t know if she had written anything incriminating, but she must have feared Sheridan might turn on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for interfering in the fight.\u201d</p><p>He touched her throat below the bandage. \u201cIf you had tried to protect me and had gotten injured, I would have been perturbed. But I understand that you have this emotional tie to your siblings that can\u2019t be walled up. Although...\u201d He kissed her eyelid, then the other. \u201c... you got in my way when I tried to tackle Uncle Sheridan while he still had hold of your brother. I don\u2019t blame Leidolf for attacking him either. Both of you had every right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour people aren\u2019t mad at me, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re eating and having a merry time of it. But they\u2019re looking forward to us joining them.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled her cheek against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m starving and if I don\u2019t eat my main course, I won\u2019t get any more dessert.\u201d A sexy smile tugging at his mouth, he rolled out of bed, then jerked on his jeans. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hungry for dessert, again.\u201d</p><p>Sitting before the fire in the living room, Sam\u2019s bearded face glowed in the light of the embers while he told another story of their ancestors\u2019 exploits of long ago. Darien wrapped his arm around Lelandi and pulled her close on the couch, and for the first time ever, she really felt part of the pack. Leidolf was sipping another beer in one of the chairs, studying Carol as she sat on the floor next to Tom, enraptured with Sam\u2019s tales, her blue eyes wide with awe. Silva served another tray of drinks, and Lelandi\u2019s father nodded off in his wheelchair.</p><p>Doc Mitchell and Chester McKinley played a game of chess nearby while Mason supervised. Eleanor and Nurse Grey made turkey sandwiches for everyone. The Hastings sat together on a love seat, cuddled together as if they were young lovers all over again. Jake took a seat on the other side of Carol and offered her a bag of chips. She smiled at him like she was in love, and Leidolf took another swig of his beer, his expression annoyed.</p><p>Peter looked happy and relaxed now that he was the new sheriff of Silver Town and gave Lelandi a satisfied smile. Trevor had vanished, and she wondered if he\u2019d left to see Caitlin.</p><p>Darien rubbed her tummy absentmindedly and it made her warm and tingly inside.</p> <p>She glanced at Carol. She didn\u2019t want her to leave Silver Town after they\u2019d become friends, but what if she could be the one for her footloose brother? Lelandi frowned. Carol had wanted to be near her parents, and Leidolf now had a pack of his own to lead and couldn\u2019t abandon them.</p><p>She kissed Darien\u2019s cheek and snuggled closer. Leidolf could figure it out on his own.</p><p>Now that Lelandi was Darien\u2019s, life couldn\u2019t get any better. Although he still had to deal with Trevor\u2019s behavior concerning sixteen-year-old Caitlin. Her parents were agreeable the two were now mated, and she would move in with him, but his inappropriate actions had to be punished. Deviating from acceptable pack behavior couldn\u2019t be tolerated.</p><p>As for Leidolf, itching to return to his pack in Portland, Darien couldn\u2019t be more glad. The farther her brother was away from Lelandi, the better, considering how her emotional state was tied to his.</p><p>Carol was another issue. Dealing with a newly turned lupus garou was problematic. As soon as he could, he needed to have her mated so that her mate would keep her in line. He rubbed his chin as he considered Leidolf, who seemed aggravated over Darien\u2019s brothers\u2019 attention to Carol. Maybe Leidolf was the solution to Darien\u2019s problem.</p><p>He leaned back on the couch and pulled Lelandi closer. Larissa would never know how much of a nightmare she\u2019d created, but in her death, she\u2019d brought Lelandi into his life. Because of that, he could forgive Larissa.</p> <p>But the families of those who\u2019d died\u2014Ritka, Angelina, Hosstene, and Uncle Sheridan\u2014wouldn\u2019t be so easily appeased. For them, although they recognized their family members had committed grave injustices, many felt their actions somewhat justified. If Larissa hadn\u2019t been mated already, then had an affair with Joe, most likely none would have committed the crimes. Some had voiced their dissent, and he assumed they might leave the pack.</p><p>He glanced at his cousins, Uncle Sheridan\u2019s four grown sons. For some time now, they\u2019d been conspicuously absent from any of the pack goings-on. Had they known about their father\u2019s complicity?</p><p>Connor, the most light-hearted one of the bunch, looked Darien\u2019s way. For the briefest of moments, he appeared sad, but he quickly hardened his expression and turned away.</p><p>Yep, ripples of dissent were already stirring, but Darien had dealt with problems like these for years. He\u2019d deal with these, too.</p><p>Lelandi looked up at Darien and smiled, not in a sweetly innocent way, but in one that said she wanted some alone time with him. He rubbed her arm and leaned over and gave her a kiss.</p><p>Sam quit orating a story and Darien looked up and found every eye in the room on him.</p><p>\u201cLelandi\u2019s feeling tired.\u201d</p><p>Several smiled.</p> <p>He rose from the couch with Lelandi. Loving every bit of her, the feral and the tame, he swept her up in his arms to whoops and cheers and headed to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYou are so subtle, you know?\u201d she said in a harsh, low voice.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou should be proud of me. I didn\u2019t say I was taking you to bed to ravish you.\u201d</p><p>She groaned and he laughed.</p><p>Several downstairs laughed and Sam began telling another story. And Darien, well, he was going to make sure Carol\u2019s prediction came true. In nine months, he\u2019d be cradling an armful of triplets. God, how he loved Lelandi. His dream had finally been realized.</p><p>\u201cAbout Carol,\u201d Lelandi said as Darien deposited her on the bed.</p><p>He growled low. \u201cNow is not the time to discuss pack business.\u201d He straddled her, his rock-hard erection straining for release, and she gave him a coy smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is pack business,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, from now on I\u2019ll be taking care of a lot more of this kind of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien, I was thinking. I want to be a psychologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what I was going to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to go away to college. So no.\u201d His dark eyes challenged her as he quickly divested her of her clothes.</p><p>\u201cI can take it online. When Larissa needed help, a psychologist had to come from Green Valley.\u201d Lelandi ran her fingers through Darien\u2019s silky hair, but she could tell from his hard expression, he wasn\u2019t buying her pitch.</p><p>\u201cI still say no.\u201d He jerked off his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He climbed off the bed and ditched his boots and jeans. \u201cI don\u2019t want you talking to crazy people.\u201d Returning to bed, he leaned next to her, and massaged her breast. \u201cThey can become infatuated with their doctor, believing the doctor loves them because she listens to their concerns, she cares about them. And one as attractive as you...\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI could help people deal with grief and all kinds of different anxieties. I need to have something to do.\u201d</p><p>His hand shifted to her belly, and he caressed her with a gentle touch. \u201cYou\u2019ll have plenty to do.\u201d</p><p>She growled.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cAll right. Get your degree online, and then you can see female patients, only.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI can just hear what your people will say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur people. If a guy wants to see you, he\u2019ll have to request an audience with either me or one of my brothers first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll cut down the number of male patients I get.\u201d</p><p>He offered a devilish smile.</p><p>She touched his face, then leaned over to kiss his lips. \u201cHmm, Darien, my dream lover. Make the dream come true again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already has, sweet Lelandi. It already has.\u201d</p><p>With that, he swept her into their own private world, vowing to take her for a romp in the woods in their wolf states later that evening to fulfill Carol\u2019s prediction that men and women dressed in wolf skins made love beneath the pale light of the moon.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
