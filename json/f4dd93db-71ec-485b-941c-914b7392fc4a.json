But for the weekend, she intended to celebrate life to the fullest.</p><p>She gripped the door of the Officer\u2019s Club bar, preparing herself to do something she\u2019d never even considered before. She intended to find a man\u2014a stranger\u2014for a one-night stand.</p> <p>Lucky for her, she was away from her home base, which gave her a wealth of unfamiliar faces to peruse. Country music and the clang of the bell over the bar swelled as she swung the door wider to reveal the Friday-night crowd.</p><p>No crying. No fear. She would forget herself with some stranger and lose herself in sensations she might never feel again.</p><p>Nola shouldered deeper into the press of bodies. The room reverberated with cheering. The place was packed, as she would expect on a Friday night, but the majority clustered in a circle to the side, was the source of the whoop, whoop, whoop. And \u201cGo, Lurch! Go, Lurch!\u201d</p><p>Lurch? Now there was a call sign for a guy worth investigating.</p><p>Curiosity nipped, sucking her feet sideways.</p> <p>She angled toward the commotion. Sidestepping an amorous couple making tracks toward the door, she caught sight of a chalkboard mounted on an easel. A bartender stood beside with a stubby piece of chalk to scratch out numbers. Ah. Bets. But what for?</p><p>She sidled through to the inner circle. Her eyes homed in on the source of the noise. The focus of the cheering was...</p><p>A man.</p><p>Holy cow, what a man. On the floor pumping push-ups in BDU pants and a brown T-shirt, he clapped between counts\u2014ninety-five at the moment. The number hit a hundred and still he didn\u2019t stop or even hesitate. Must be his size that earned him the nickname \u201cLurch\u201d because, holy cow, he was big.</p><p>Two men in similar uniforms split from the crowd carrying a fifty-some-odd-year-old waitress on their shoulders like Cleopatra. With ceremonial hoopla, they placed her on the man\u2019s back. His arms strained against the T-shirt, muscles bulging, veins rippling along the stretch of tendons, but still he pushed.</p><p>Up. Down. Again and again.</p> <p>Ohmigod, her own tummy did a flip of attraction. Arousal. And hadn\u2019t she come here for just this reason?</p><p>Twenty-five years old and she didn\u2019t have anyone else to turn to for comfort, which could really pitch her into a tailspin if she let herself think on it for too long.</p><p>Her elderly parents gone. Her marriage kaput because her ex-husband couldn\u2019t take the stress of a wife who might not live to see thirty. Zero siblings. Her best friend deployed to Turkey. Her only other friends a bunch of rowdy Air Force crew dogs who spent as much time on the road as she did, and she really couldn\u2019t see herself showing weakness by bawling her eyes out to any of them.</p><p>Charge ahead, girl.</p><p>She made a quick check of his left hand. No wedding band. No pale cheater mark along his tan ring finger. Sheesh, she wished she\u2019d thought to change into something other than her flight suit.</p><p>Too late for regrets. She was here now, and if she left to change, the man in front of her might be gone by the time she returned. Besides, she didn\u2019t want to miss a second of this display.</p><p>Sweat started to pop along his forehead and even a hint along his shoulders, but still he kept moving. The man was a poster boy for health and vitality.</p><p>Invincibility, perhaps? All things she so desperately wanted to soak up right now. She found herself clapping the count along with everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cOne hundred forty-eight.\u201d</p><p>He switched to one-handed push-ups. The crowd roared louder.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred forty-nine. One hundred-fifty.\u201d</p><p>He reached behind to steady the waitress and jumped to his feet, easing the apron-clad lady to hers, as well. With all the showmanship of his single-handed display, he wrapped an arm around the waitress\u2019s waist, dipped her and gave her a quick kiss before setting her free. \u201cThank you much, Delphine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem for you, Captain Rick. Anytime you\u2019re in town.\u201d</p><p>Rick. She liked that name. Solid.</p><p>However if she didn\u2019t get her butt in gear and make a move soon, he would be gone. Nola stepped forward. And thank you, Jesus, that\u2019s all it took.</p><p>He looked her way and his deep chocolate eyes held. Without breaking the stare, he smiled, snagged the rest of his uniform off the back of a chair and slid his arms through, slowly buttoning up over his chest.</p><p>DeMassi was stitched over the left pocket and above that she recognized the insignia for a pararescueman. He hurtled himself out of planes. Penetrated the most hostile of territories. Anything to save a downed airman, to bring someone like her home.</p><p>Honorable to the core and darn near invincible, for sure. Even his patch proclaimed That Others May Live.</p><p>He fastened the last button and started toward her. \u201cHello, Lieutenant Seabrook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello to you, Captain DeMassi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola, like New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, classy.\u201d He extended his broad hand toward her. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick. I heard from your cheering section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all away from home, coming in from maneuvers to one of our favorite Officer\u2019s Clubs, needing to let off some steam. They would have cheered on anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d She folded his hand in hers, warm and strong.</p><p>More of that vitality she needed. Her imagination skipped ahead to thoughts of his hand against her skin. She didn\u2019t need to worry about concerns of compatibility or depth. This was about the moment. She refused to let echoes of her mother\u2019s preaching voice make her feel guilty or shallow.</p><p>Nola\u2019s hand stayed connected to Rick\u2019s, shaking, seesawing slower and slower, up and down like his push-ups until finally she inched away with a self-conscious laugh, wiping her hand against her flight suit leg. \u201cThis is awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be all collected and say something femme fatale perfect but now I\u2019m...\u201d She started to turn, her nerve wobbling. \u201cForget it.\u201d</p><p>His hand fell on her shoulder, heavy and warm sparking another jolt of that alive feeling she needed.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked back and what she saw in his eyes mirrored the sensations zipping through her like lightning traveling through an aircraft\u2014not fatal, but hair crackling, unsettling, and oh so invigorating.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She meant the word as a statement as well as a question.</p><p>\u201cHow about this?\u201d He held her with those deep eyes rather than his hands, as if sensing she needed space. Would he be this perceptive in bed? \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about saying the right things. We can say whatever we want, even if it\u2019s a damn awful first date wrong thing to say.\u201d</p><p>Date? She was thinking encounter, but okay. Breathe. His game had intriguing merit. The bar patrons kept their distance, even if they watched with half-veiled interest.</p><p>Hesitantly, she hitched her elbows back onto the bar. \u201cYou go first.\u201d</p><p>He propped one arm beside her and leaned in to make his move, his shoulders blocking everything but him.</p><p>\u201cI live with my parents.\u201d He thumped his chest with his fist and belched. \u201cMom does my laundry.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing. Settling a somber expression, she responded, \u201cSpeaking of laundry, I just don\u2019t get what all the hoopla is about fancy underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. You go right for the jugular, lady.\u201d He grabbed his head in mock agony. \u201cAll right, time for the big guns. My doc said not to worry. It\u2019s only a cold sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should be able to enjoy our meal together.\u201d She reached for the laminated menu wedged between the condiments. \u201cWhat\u2019s the most expensive item featured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it doesn\u2019t matter since I maxed out all my credit cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, since it will soon be our money because I\u2019m husband hunting.\u201d Nothing could be further from the truth. Her divorce left her scathed, but good.</p><p>\u201cAh, good one.\u201d He tapped his forehead, then snapped his fingers. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind going a lifetime unsatisfied in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as we get to go to bed together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>She froze and so did he. They weren\u2019t playing anymore.</p><p>He held out his hand. \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>And she did. Silently. Talking softly about anything, mostly seductive. For hours until the crowd thinned and the bell rang for last call. They broke apart and he extended his hand again. She knew if she took it this time they would be heading for a different kind of dance, the one she had come here searching for.</p><p>Again, her hand fit perfectly in his. A short stroll later they had walked to his room in the visiting officer\u2019s quarters. He kicked the door closed behind him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even bother telling him she\u2019d never done anything like this before. Truth or not, she didn\u2019t want to sound trite and she didn\u2019t intend to see him again anyway. He seemed okay with that. No guilt for either of them. She was through with words and he seemed to feel the same way.</p><p>Between kisses, their clothes fell away until only their underwear remained. Skin to skin. Her hands explored the hardened expanse of his muscles more impressive than she\u2019d even imagined.</p><p>And her imagination had been mighty darn amazing. She\u2019d been right to do this. This was exactly the escape she needed this weekend to take her away from the ordeal that awaited her next week.</p><p>His talented hands made fast work of the front clasp on her bra and he swept the lacy scrap down her shoulders with reverent fingers. A long, slow exhale slid from his mouth, blowing an appreciative whistle over her exposed skin. \u201cWow, lady, you are something to behold.\u201d</p><p>Gulping back emotion, she lifted his hand, placed the callused warmth over her bared breast and savored the sensation as if for the last time. Which it very well could be.</p><p>Because Monday, combat veteran that she was, she began her toughest battle ever\u2014one that started not with a mission briefing, but with a mastectomy.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Present Day: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Texas</p><p>Major Rick DeMassi forced his steel-pin-filled legs to move as he gripped the metal bars for balance. He narrowed his focus to a tunnel as he always did on missions, and no undertaking had been more important than getting back on his feet again.</p><p>Every day in rehab he resolved to end this one better than he finished his final assignment during the cleanup after Hurricane Katrina. The carnage had threatened to suck him under, but he\u2019d kept his eyes on the teddy bear ahead, sticking halfway out of the muck. After years of search and rescue, he\u2019d known in his gut there was a child close by.</p><p>Too bad his gut couldn\u2019t tell him if that child was alive or dead.</p><p>Now there weren\u2019t teddy bears to zero in on, even theoretically. His teenage daughter was long past the age of such toys. Still he wanted to greet her on his own two feet someday soon\u2014as the hero she thought he was. So he went through the daily torture of grabbing these damn bars and shuffling one shattered leg in front of the other.</p><p>What a joke in comparison to the old days when he leaped from helicopters. Swam churning waters. Or sludged through unstable wreckage toward a stuffed toy to pull out a child.</p><p>\u201cCareful, sir.\u201d The voice echoed in his head. Then or now, he wasn\u2019t sure. The stench of antiseptic burned his nose as strongly as the stench of rotting muck. \u201cSteady is better than fast.\u201d</p><p>One foot in front of the other.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Step.</p><p>For the kid. For his child. For the trapped child. Both merged in his head. The past and the present. Both times painful, squeezing labored breaths from his body until he thought he didn\u2019t have anything left inside him but somehow he kept going. Running then. Shuffling now. The irony didn\u2019t escape him, but he wasn\u2019t a quitter.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much time left,\u201d the sergeant said, an orderly watching him like a babysitter in case he fell, but the voice could have been from the past, rushing him along. Urging him to the cargo plane. But he couldn\u2019t leave the little girl and her doll behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been a crap father to his daughter, always on the job, barely a presence in her life. He wouldn\u2019t let this wounded little girl down, too. Even if the best he could do was recover her dead body for burial...</p><p>Rick gritted his teeth. \u201cFive more minutes, Sergeant, and I\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that, Major.\u201d</p> <p>He would reach the end of this walk without falling. Not like before.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Step.</p><p>Pain. Penance. Step. The sound of airplane engines had hummed in the background much the same as the heater now. Gusting wind over him. The antiseptic scent of the hospital as unwelcome a stench as the stench of...worse than muck...</p><p>Death.</p> <p>Except the child had been alive, even if barely. He\u2019d seen the doll flutter as if tugged.</p><p>Walk now. Run then.</p><p>He\u2019d pulled the girl out, a child maybe four. They\u2019d even made it to the emergency personnel where he\u2019d passed her off...just as rotten boards gave way underneath him.</p><p>Agonizing pain razored through him. The ground sucked him in. Nails and boards cut into skin and muscle. Bones snapped. Wood tore into his legs. Ripped tendons.</p><p>Reach up. Out. Trudge. Don\u2019t give up.</p><p>His vision tightened the tunnel until he could swear he saw the load ramp at the end of his metal bars. How damn ridiculous was that? Maybe it was just some of that visionary crap the shrink was always telling him about.</p> <p>Picture what you want. Yeah. That was it. He wanted his job back.</p><p>Hell, he wanted his life back.</p><p>Okay, the load ramp gaping at the back of the airplane. Go with that image. Move toward it.</p><p>Light faded and blazed as he struggled with consciousness. A voice tugged at him from his past. He blinked, cleared his vision and his eyes agreed with his ears. What the...?</p><p>He must be delusional thinking of that woman who\u2019d left his bed with only a terse little note five years ago.</p><p>Still he couldn\u2019t stop himself from croaking out the name. \u201cNola?\u201d</p><p>The woman moved toward him, stepping into the light streaming through the rehab area\u2019s windows and revealing a face from the past he\u2019d never expected to see again...</p><p>At a time when he very likely didn\u2019t have a future.</p> <p>Putting the past to rest so she could move forward with her future was easier said than done. But Nola was a determined lady.</p><p>She needed to wrap her brain around a reality she barely dared dream was real. She\u2019d reached her five-year remission mark.</p><p>Her docs all encouraged her to celebrate. The mind and body worked in synch after all.</p><p>Easier said than done. Believing in the future was tough after so long of living for today. Milk the most from each second because today was a gift and tomorrow an unknown. Walk to the towering man inching slowly her way.</p><p>Her hand closed around her purse, which held her very organized day planner, which held her list.</p><p>The list. A list of all the people she needed to make contact with for closure. She\u2019d already contacted every friend she could think of that she may have wronged. A flight student she\u2019d been unnecessarily harsh to during a check ride because in her early days as an instructor perhaps she\u2019d been a bit full of herself.</p><p>She\u2019d even contacted a guy from junior high who she\u2019d picked on unmercifully all because she\u2019d liked him and had been too immature to know how to show it. He\u2019d thought she was nuts for calling, but ah well, such was life. She wasn\u2019t as worried about looking cool these days.</p><p>Today she\u2019d finally tracked down Rick DeMassi, the man she\u2019d left high and dry and gloriously n**ed in a VOQ room. Once she\u2019d learned of his injuries, her relief at finding him alive had been stronger than she would have expected for someone she\u2019d only spent thirty hours with five years ago. But they\u2019d been a crucial thirty hours. He\u2019d given her a great gift over that weekend, even if he hadn\u2019t known.</p><p>His talented touch had been the last she\u2019d felt on her breasts. More importantly, his gentleness and strength had bolstered her to walk into hell alone and she would never forget him.</p><p>She\u2019d had a mastectomy, but beaten the cancer. Now she needed to see Rick one more time to complete her list before she could close the door on the recovery part of her cancer journey.</p><p>So she\u2019d driven all the way from her home base in Charleston, South Carolina, and here she stood at a physical rehab center connected to the same hospital where she\u2019d started her treatments. How ironic was that? But somehow serendipitous.</p><p>How bad must his injuries have been for him to still be recovering a year later? Her stomach knotted at even the mention of hospitals. Walking into one usually had her fighting back an anxiety attack. Striding into this one in particular threatened a flat KO.</p><p>But she refused to let anything stop her, especially once she\u2019d heard he was the patient. No way could she turn her back until she was certain he had everything he needed. Theirs may have only been a weekend together where he unwittingly gave her comfort, but those two days stayed with her still. His face on the back of her eyelids, recalling his touch to override pain...</p><p>All of it carried her through hell as surely as his arms had carried her across a room to rest her so gently, seductively on a mattress.</p><p>Right now, he could barely carry himself across the room.</p><p>Overall, he might be slimmer, but his chest bore the same rippled muscles, his eyes the same fathomless intensity. But his face had an angular cut to it, his features a hard enigmatic look. No joking this go-round as he shuffled the last two feet between them to stop. She\u2019d seen his lips move with a muffled whisper, but couldn\u2019t hear what he\u2019d said.</p><p>She inhaled deeper with a bracing breath and noticed something else familiar. Even through the antiseptic hospital smell she recognized the spicy scent of him.</p><p>A cleared throat pulled her out of her reverie. The sergeant\u2014a therapist of some sort\u2014raised a brow, mumbled something about break time and draped a hand towel around Rick\u2019s neck before leaving.</p><p>Okey doke. Time to quit daydreaming.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She forced a smile over her lips when she really just wanted to stare awhile longer, and doggone it, there went her mother\u2019s voice again about rude manners. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>Long lashes swept down over his chocolate brown eyes and up again in his first sign that he\u2019d actually noticed her. \u201cYou\u2019re a memorable lady, Nola.\u201d</p><p>Thank God, thank God, thank God he remembered her name and she hadn\u2019t just made a total idiot out of herself.</p><p>Then a smile twitched at one corner, just a hint but enough of the man she\u2019d known to help her relax her grip on the Tupperware container she\u2019d forgotten she held.</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re here because?\u201d He released one bar and held on single-handed.</p><p>He looked more \u201cokay\u201d that way. She couldn\u2019t gauge the extent of the injury to his legs since he wore dark blue sweatpants and a gray T-shirt with Air Force logos imprinted. Whether or not his sudden easy stance was an act for her benefit she didn\u2019t know, but it eased some of the tension inside her. She understood about \u201cbrave front\u201d acts.</p><p>\u201cI have a list.\u201d She blurted.</p><p>Sheesh. She was a mature woman. A seasoned combat veteran, trained to fly multimillion-dollar cargo jets and here she was acting like hormonal mush.</p><p>All right. Maybe not hormonal. More like knocked off balance by the whole hospital scene and seeing his pain. Remembering her own. Knowing how pride hurt more than any needles.</p><p>Rick shifted from one foot to the other and studied her through narrowed eyes. \u201cThey took me off the painkillers a long time ago, so my brain\u2019s clear. Still, you\u2019ll need to run that by me again, because you\u2019re not making a bit of sense.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but notice how he continued to grip the bar, his arm not even shaking, but his complexion beginning to pale beneath his tan.</p><p>More of that pride.</p><p>She scanned quickly for one of those industrial-looking uncomfy sofas they always had everywhere in places like this, and sure enough there was one right behind her. She plunked down to sit and hoped Rick would cut himself some slack and do the same.</p><p>\u201cI was in town, heard through the grapevine that you were here and thought I would stop in to say hi for old time\u2019s sake.\u201d She lifted the aqua-and-white Tupperware container full of chocolate chip M&amp;M\u2019s cookies, raising it at just the right level where he would have to come to the sofa if he wanted a chance at a cookie. She hadn\u2019t met a male yet who could say no to cookies. \u201cHospital food usually sucks, so I figured you might like this.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she didn\u2019t recall much about the hospital food since she hadn\u2019t been able to keep anything down during chemo. But every man she\u2019d met worshipped food, so she\u2019d figured cookies would be a decent icebreaker.</p><p>Rick shuffled with studied practice\u2014holy guacamole, this guy had pride by the buckets\u2014until he dropped down beside her. Sweat dotted his upper lip but somehow he managed not to sigh when he sat.</p><p>\u201cThanks, you\u2019re right.\u201d He took the cookies, brow furrowing. \u201cThis is still...uh...unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine so.\u201d She knotted her fingers in her lap, wishing she had that container back so her hands wouldn\u2019t feel so empty.</p><p>\u201cI should let you get back to work.\u201d He nodded to her flight suit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done for the day.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to reference her own swing by the hospital to gather old lingering paperwork and say farewells to some remaining staff members. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, but then I\u2019m stuck here. Don\u2019t you need to head home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo boyfriend or husband to call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d Her eyes fell to his ring finger. Still bare. Her stomach did that little flip again. \u201cDo you really think I would bring cookies to a guy if I had a boyfriend or, heaven forbid, a husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy \u2018heaven forbid\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Her ex shouldn\u2019t still have the power to hurt her. She didn\u2019t love the bastard anymore. But still, his defection when she\u2019d needed him most cut deeper than any surgeon\u2019s knife. \u201cBeen there, done that, got the scars and divorce papers to show for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d he popped open the container of cookies \u201c\u2014so you\u2019re a card-carrying member of the Marriage Sucks Club, too, huh?\u201d He shoved a cookie in his mouth and offered her one, as well.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d She selected a cookie and weighed her words and finally asked the question that had been nibbling at the edges of her mind the same way she nipped around the cookie. \u201cWant to tell me what happened with the legs?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed his treat. \u201cHurricane Katrina cleanup was hazardous.\u201d</p><p>The simple words painted a vivid picture. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Nola could also tell from his stony face the subject was closed. She understood the reticence well and had to respect the boundaries.</p><p>She should probably pack up and go\u2014cookies delivered. Mission accomplished. Page turned and book closed. Except... She couldn\u2019t make herself get up off the uncomfy sofa.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you get sprung from this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a crummy liar.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI really am out soon. I just have to hire a babysitter and then they\u2019ll cut me loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it from your tone you don\u2019t think you need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want one.\u201d</p><p>Awkward silence settled, kind of like that first meeting, but they\u2019d already exhausted the wrong-first-date topics. She reached for her purse beside her. \u201cI should go and let you get a shower or something.\u201d</p><p>Shower? Sooo not a memory from the past she needed right now with him all sweaty and hot beside her, with her going on five years of abstinence, with his touch the last she\u2019d felt. She clenched her fists to keep her hand from protectively covering her scarred breast. Yes, she\u2019d had reconstruction, but she wasn\u2019t the same by any stretch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stop. She wasn\u2019t going there today. Except how could she not?</p><p>Ah hell, this was gonna be a long night with more than likely a few tears. She was human and closing this book was hard.</p><p>Rick grabbed for his crutches at the end of the bars and nodded for the sergeant to pick up the cookies. \u201cI\u2019ll walk with you to the door.\u201d</p> <p>She started to tell him no need to bother but then thought of that prickly male ego and opted to keep her yap closed. Let him do what he pleased. She stayed silent while he worked his way to his feet, shuffling to reach for crutches in what must have been a painful maneuver, yet he never even winced.</p><p>He nodded toward the hallway and began thumping his way down the hall alongside her. The awkward silence grew heavier with each step down the hall closer to the door. The crisp November air outside along with the bright sun did nothing to lighten the moment.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the cookies.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, quizzical. Not rude enough to glance back at the rehab clinic, but she could sense his itchiness for her to leave.</p><p>What had she expected? A resurrection of the relationship? The attraction was still there, but Rick\u2019s walls were high. More of that pride. He undoubtedly just wanted to get her in her car and return to his room without falling on his face. The longer she waited, the harder she made things for him.</p> <p>She needed to quit being selfish. \u201cI know it seems strange, my showing up like this out of the blue. I probably should have called first.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d most definitely been selfish, because she\u2019d feared if she\u2019d called first he might have rejected the notion of her coming. God, she didn\u2019t like what that said about her. Asserting her needs above the needs or wants of others.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>He stared at her for a whole cycle on the red light before shaking his head. \u201cI gave up trying to understand women a long time ago. You did a nice thing coming here today for whatever reason. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.\u201d</p><p>She could see the strain of standing so long etched on his face, the color seeping away. Yet somehow that took nothing away from his strength, instead only adding to it because of the sheer will it must take to keep his feet under him. She understood well the grit it took to haul yourself through that kind of pain.</p><p>Whoa. Hold on. This was getting way too deep.</p> <p>She backed toward her SUV, fishing in her purse for her keys so she could thumb the remote starter and warm the car. Texas in November wasn\u2019t as cold as some of the Northern climates where she\u2019d been stationed, but there was a definite chill in the air. Besides, she always started her car first to get the temperature right.</p><p>The weather matched her mood. This hadn\u2019t gone at all as she\u2019d expected. She should be happy. Instead she felt chilled.</p><p>Hollow.</p><p>Nola smiled her farewell to a man she knew she would never forget.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Rick.\u201d Her fingers closed around the keys. She thumbed the remote starter\u2014</p><p>And the world blasted into a fireball of heat as her car exploded.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Blast still ringing in his ears, Rick dropped his crutches and flung his body on top of Nola\u2019s. Thank heaven his professional instincts hadn\u2019t abandoned him in the rubble of Hurricane Katrina or that flying shard of fender would have caught Nola square on the temple.</p> <p>He\u2019d lived through his fair share of explosions overseas, but he\u2019d never expected to face one on American soil. What the hell had just happened with Nola\u2019s car?</p><p>The crackle of flames echoed in his ears, the stench of burning fuel stinging his nose. He stayed on top of Nola while he scanned the parking lot.</p><p>No sign of anyone suspicious. Just people with concerned and shocked faces pouring from around the medical park, others running or flattened to the concrete watching. A couple of persons had cell phones in hand, dialing. Good. Cops should be on the way soon.</p><p>\u201cNola?\u201d he asked against her ear, working like hell not to think about how much better her hair smelled after months in a hospital. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Squished, but okay,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he lied, his left knee already aching like a sonuvabitch.</p><p>Nola elbowed him gently in the gut. \u201cRick? Let me up, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He rolled to the side while still keeping an arm hooked around her waist to anchor her to the ground so she wouldn\u2019t do something reckless like spring to her feet. She might be a trained combat vet, but he didn\u2019t have any time in the field with her to know anything about her skills. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to apologize. Good God, you saved my butt from flying debris.\u201d She kept her position, breaths steady as she grappled for her keys a few inches away. \u201cI\u2019m not some prickly ingrate. I just got a little smooshed. You\u2019re a big fella.\u201d</p><p>Not so much as he used to be, but hey, he hated the self-pity gig. No use dwelling on that. Since there didn\u2019t seem to be any further immediate threat, time to haul his sorry hide the rest of the way up.</p><p>He shifted. His knee hollered back at him.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>How was he going to get to his feet and keep her safely at his side until the cops arrived? He searched around him for options to brace himself... If he rolled right, he could grab a bench for leverage, pull himself up and sit. From there, he could retrieve a crutch and stand.</p><p>Easy. In theory.</p><p>Nola reached for her purse from under a park bench and jammed her keys inside. \u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>Like hell. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrideful guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I fall on my ass you can help me.\u201d He reached for the bench and kept his eyes open for surprise threats in spite of the seeming calm after the storm. Screw worrying about himself. Her safety had to be his first priority. \u201cUntil then, I\u2019ve got it. How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, big guy.\u201d</p><p>Deep breath. Thirteen teeth-gritting seconds later\u2014yeah, he counted every one to keep his mind on something other than the grinding pain\u2014he was on his feet again scanning the perimeter. And he damn well waved away the attendant coming toward him with a wheelchair. The smart young goon knew to back off and help somebody else who\u2019d apparently twisted an ankle in the mayhem.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rick kept the lone crutch jammed under his arm, enough to hold his balance since the majority of the damage was to his left leg. In some portion of his brain, he heard the rustle behind him of Nola pushing to her feet, too. Good. That meant he truly hadn\u2019t hurt her when he\u2019d shoved her to the concrete.</p><p>Keeping the crutch tucked securely, he grabbed her wrist and urged her to the safety of the portico of the rehab center, into the anonymity of a cluster of nurses and orderlies in purple scrubs. That should serve as a decent safety net of anonymity for now in case someone was gunning for her and waiting around. Watching.</p><p>He continued to scan. Adrenaline surged. Damn, he\u2019d forgotten the rush that compelled his body beyond normal endurance, but he welcomed it now.</p><p>Still, what kind of guardian did he make? Well, at least he was one more barrier between her and whoever was trying to blow her up. He had his brain and instincts.</p><p>And that brain and those instincts were telling him whatever threat there was to her had passed for the moment.</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, Rick!\u201d</p><p>Her voice stalled him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your back?\u201d</p><p>Hell. Now that she mentioned it... His back did sting almost as much as his knee.</p><p>Her hands skimmed over his shoulder blades. \u201cSomething hit you. It looks like you\u2019ll need stitches.\u201d</p><p>The glide of her touch almost made him forget the pain.</p><p>\u201cAm I going to bleed to death until I get to the doc?\u201d</p><p>She moved to his side, the loose blond curls of her bangs brushing along the top ridges of her furrowed brow. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it can wait.\u201d He exhaled long and slow, his fingers itching to thread through that cap of whispery curls all around her face and pull her to his chest where nobody could hurt her. Except his chest wasn\u2019t as invincible as he\u2019d once thought. \u201cAny chance your car was a rental?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, curls dancing. \u201cI wish, but no. That was my car. My totally brand-new, just-off-the-lot SUV I\u2019d bought because of my to-do list.\u201d</p><p>To-do list? Whatever. Irrelevant really. And along the lines of irrelevant thoughts, he could have sworn her hair was straight before. But then women changed their hair. His ex-wife kept her hair permed on a regular basis. God, his mind was racing a million miles a minute.</p><p>\u201cDamn. Sorry about the car being new.\u201d He scratched his neck and resisted the urge to reach over to his throbbing back. \u201cThat sucks for you.\u201d</p><p>Sirens whined in the background. The cops undoubtedly, a fire truck, too. With some luck they would have an easy answer, not to mention protection.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just hope there\u2019s some mobster who has a car that looks just like yours, who was supposed to be here today visiting his old infirm relative.\u201d</p><p>Her nervous laugh didn\u2019t reassure him in the least. She had a fatalistic look to her that said she accepted she was the target.</p><p>More of that adrenaline pumped, reminding him of missions past, the calling that had urged him to join the Air Force. Everything he\u2019d been and done scrolled through his mind, nudging him, whispering at him to reclaim it all. He heard the cops\u2019 siren drone closer and yet he couldn\u2019t force himself to relinquish his post guarding her. There was no shaking the inevitable.</p><p>Uniformed or not, he was back on duty.</p><p>Apparently she had a new watchdog after all.</p><p>Rick hadn\u2019t left her side except when the cops insisted on a solo interview. They\u2019d acted as if they suspected him of being a stalker boyfriend or something worse.</p><p>His growl hadn\u2019t done much to further his innocence.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. Men. She stopped by their uncomfy sofa\u2014or at least that\u2019s what she\u2019d started to think of it as from their earlier chitchat in the rehab room. Given that most of the physical therapists had headed off for supper, the place was for the most part deserted except for the occasional health-care professional bustling by, past and away.</p><p>She was on her own to get her head together before she said goodbye to Rick once and for all, a more emotional event than she\u2019d expected, what with them almost getting blown up. He could have so easily been injured worse if he\u2019d been standing closer to her car. She could have died if she hadn\u2019t bothered to warm up her car with the remote starter.</p><p>Her knees folded and she flopped to sit on the couch, her black leather boots thudding on the tile floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He joined her, the cops having stopped keeping them apart.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking how lucky we both are. What if I\u2019d waited to start the car from inside and you\u2019d been standing beside? God. We both could have died.\u201d She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cTwo warriors taken down by a car bomb.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cQuite an ignominious end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Is your back okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders, only wincing a hint as the Air Force PT T-shirt tugged at the blood on his back. \u201cDoc put butterfly bandages on while you were interviewed by the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you weren\u2019t hurt worse because of me.\u201d She hated to think about causing him more pain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain this was meant for you?\u201d</p><p>She might as well be up-front with him. She was surprised he hadn\u2019t found out during the interview with the police.</p><p>Nola slid her purse from her shoulder, unzipped the leather bag and withdrew a manila envelope. She plopped the envelope onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and open it.\u201d</p><p>Without answering, he pried apart the metal prongs and poured out a dozen or so sheaves of paper, all black-and-white copies of notes comprised of words clipped from magazines. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe originals are with the police back in Charleston, South Carolina, where I\u2019m stationed, but I keep these with me at all times in case another comes when I\u2019m on the road so I can show local cops.\u201d</p><p>She watched while he thumbed through the stack of her stalker\u2019s notes about how he was watching her. How he\u2019d seen what she chose at the mall. When he\u2019d noticed the specific date she\u2019d come home from a flight.</p><p>An outfit of hers he liked most.</p> <p>The low hum of life in the hall continued while he read. A cart rattled by. A television squawked and talked and blared laughter. Conversation echoed from the chow hall.</p><p>All the while Rick\u2019s jaw grew tighter with each Xerox copy before he finally replaced the stack into the envelope. \u201cThe explosion\u2019s not coincidental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She\u2019d kept the notes because the police instructed her to do so, but she hadn\u2019t taken the whole thing too seriously until now. She\u2019d been so certain her training would be enough to protect herself against anything anyone could bring her way.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t factored in car bombs.</p><p>\u201cJesus, lady. How can you sit there so calmly?\u201d</p> <p>He thought she was calm? Hah.</p><p>She pulled a tight smile. \u201cTrust me, my heart\u2019s racing like a newbie pilot during a check ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had other accidents like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was the first, actually. Before now, I\u2019ve only gotten letters. I lead a simple life. Work and more work.\u201d Of course he was curious, but she\u2019d answered these questions so many times she wanted to bang her head against a wall. \u201cBelieve me, the police and I have both been over and over this. We have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about an ex?\u201d</p><p>Was he asking about a boyfriend? \u201cThere\u2019s none in the picture, and certainly none of the psycho type.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your ex-husband?\u201d</p><p>More questions about her love life? She certainly didn\u2019t have any romance going on now or anytime recently, and she didn\u2019t dare wrap her brain around the notion Rick might be interested in jump-starting their short-lived affair. \u201cPeter Grant and I haven\u2019t been together in over five years. I even went back to my maiden name the minute we separated.\u201d</p><p>Which brought to mind the fact that she and Rick had been together just after her marriage breakup, a timing he apparently noticed, as well. The remembered weekend tingled through her mind, as real as if it had happened yesterday as she stared into his eyes, seeing herself and want reflected.</p><p>He blinked slowly, without looking away. \u201cWho else could it be then? Stats show a stalker is usually someone you know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head to break the contact more than to negate his statement. \u201cThis has to be some bizarre coincidence, a threat meant for somebody else, like your mobster theory. I\u2019m not even home, for heaven\u2019s sake. And the letters... I can\u2019t even hazard a guess. It has to be some freak, one of those strange people you walk past who decides there\u2019s some cosmic connection and reads signs where there are none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever his reason, there\u2019s a huge leap from letter writing to blowing up your car.\u201d</p><p>His face went hard, protective, a visage she recognized well from working with these guys on a daily basis. He was in defender mode, and all she could think was that Rick had been injured because of her.</p><p>She reached to touch his shoulder gingerly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your back.\u201d</p> <p>He went stock-still. \u201cIt\u2019s barely a ding. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, is it okay if I say you\u2019ve got enough on your plate medically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He growled. Then gave her a begrudging smile. \u201cBut then I guess because of that full plate I barely notice this. Now can we drop the subject of the scratches on my back?\u201d</p><p>Her mind winged back to other scratches on his back, ones left by her fingernails, the intensity of their sex wringing responses from her she\u2019d never felt before or after.</p><p>Actually, she had no encounters after her surgery at all to go by. Showing her scarred body to a man had been a more difficult hurdle to overcome than she\u2019d expected. She\u2019d found it easier simply to focus on work. There was plenty of work to go around these days with conflicts all over the world.</p><p>One day blended into the next until suddenly here she was, five years later after her encounter at the bar with Rick and her mastectomy. Ready to face the rest of her life but suddenly having her foundation blown to bits again\u2014literally.</p><p>Rick rubbed along his jaw. \u201cYou mentioned telling the police about the letters...\u201d he continued like a dog with a bone.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I told the cops at home about the third letter. These are copies.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her and she stared back, sinking into the moment the way she\u2019d done five years ago during their \u201csay all the wrong things\u201d fun moment and before she knew it her mouth was moving. \u201cI want you to feel free to say no because this could really be dangerous. But I was thinking it might be in my best interest to have a man living under my roof right now.\u201d</p><p>The minute the words fell out of her mouth she almost looked over her shoulder to see who\u2019d said them. But yep. She\u2019d been the one to voice the outrageous offer. She had most definitely said the wrong first date thing.</p><p>She desperately wanted to call the words back. Some maniac was trying to blow her up and now she\u2019d done more to lure a watchdog of a man into her life? Rick had already been one foot on his way toward following her home. Now she would never shake him loose. She didn\u2019t need or want this. She\u2019d meant to say goodbye.</p><p>Right?</p><p>God. How convenient that there were four pretty walls nearby for her to bang her hard head against. The stalker must have been scaring her more than she\u2019d been willing to admit.</p><p>\u201cSo, Rick? What do you think about my idea?\u201d Maybe he would say no.</p><p>And maybe pigs would fly out of her ears.</p><p>He scratched along the back of his neck. \u201cHow about run it by me again, because I think my hearing\u2019s gone bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Forget about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I follow. It goes something like this. After over a year in a hospital, I need a babysitter who won\u2019t drive me crazy. You\u2019re an independent soul, and I know you can kick any stalker\u2019s butt. But having a man around can give off a first line of defense.\u201d</p><p>Might as well go with it. \u201cKind of like having a dog with a loud bark.\u201d</p><p>He picked at the rubber on the top of his crutch. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether you\u2019re complimenting or insulting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling you a Chihuahua if that helps.\u201d She grinned for the first time since she\u2019d blurted the impulsive offer. \u201cMy garage has been converted into a studio apartment so you would have plenty of privacy. It\u2019s a first floor, no stairs to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Ooops. She could see his back getting up about her mentioning his injuries. Men could so miss the big picture. But then who was she to talk? She couldn\u2019t bring herself to be with a man because she was wrapped up in her own self-image.</p><p>Time to help the man out. He\u2019d obviously been through hell and she understood the bite of those flames well.</p><p>\u201cPeople profile, and you\u2019re a really big guy.\u201d Ego stroke time. \u201cA police dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at the suck-up game.\u201d He surprised her with a half smile.</p><p>A really surprisingly cute half smile on that rugged big mug of his. She had trouble remembering what she planned to say and that was so not good.</p><p>So she grinned right back. She could do this. She was good at putting distance between herself and men, after all, she worked in an almost exclusively male environment. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, I\u2019m not insinuating that we pick up where we left off five years ago.\u201d</p><p>His smile went wider than hers. \u201cYou mean the point where I woke up in a bed by myself with a letter that said, \u2018Thanks for a great weekend. Have a nice life.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded, contrition biting. \u201cThe letter wasn\u2019t that...uh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever you want to remember it.\u201d He passed the envelope of stalker notes back to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry if I was rude. That was an amazing weekend during a difficult time for me.\u201d She gathered up the envelope to her chest and made a stab at backing out of this setup after all. \u201cIt was a silly idea that we should move in together. I shouldn\u2019t have asked you to put yourself in danger. Forget I said anything. I\u2019m just...I don\u2019t know. Shaken up, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He watched her silently which made her all fidgety when she prided herself on her poise under fire.</p><p>She got off the fake leather sofa ASAP before she did something reckless like move close enough to share leg-to-leg body heat with him. \u201cIt was good to see you again. Enjoy the cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola.\u201d</p><p>She backed away, hoping the rental car company would show up with a temporary vehicle for her soon. She definitely needed to get out of here.</p><p>\u201cNola.\u201d His voice swelled to a growl.</p><p>Her spine stiffened but her feet kept inching her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cNola, damn it.\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>\u201cI never said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d let her babble on just to see what she would say?</p><p>Rick nodded toward the window showcasing the burned-out shell of her SUV. \u201cThe minute that car blew, you had yourself a new roommate.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Rick dropped onto the edge of the bed in his empty room, resting his crutches against the nightstand. He\u2019d used up his reserves today walking around with Nola. He\u2019d been on his feet more this afternoon than any day since the accident\u2014and he wasn\u2019t a slacker around this place by any standards.</p><p>He carried his weight on the rehab circuit. He wanted the hell out. Not just out, but on his own two feet. Whole, back to some kind of productive work. He knew he couldn\u2019t return to his pararescue life at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona. That part of his life was packed up tighter than his furniture in storage.</p><p>All of which he would think about later. Right now he had a more immediate goal\u2014finding out what was going on in Nola Seabrook\u2019s life.</p><p>She was with the cops again while they finished up a few more last-minute details about her vehicle. He didn\u2019t like being shuffled away for the second time. Who did they think he was? An overbearing boyfriend in a wife-beater T-shirt? He told them he hadn\u2019t seen the woman in five years, but cops didn\u2019t have reason to trust what people said.</p><p>Might as well make the best of this time alone. He figured he had about a half hour to catch his breath before he would see her. Then they would start to make plans to move in together\u2014strangers who knew what the other looked like naked. Except he didn\u2019t look the same anymore.</p><p>Regardless, he would be out of this place by morning.</p><p>He would be living with a woman for the first time in ten years. Holy hell, he really did need a shrink after all because this was the craziest thing he\u2019d ever done and in his line of work, he\u2019d taken more than a few insane risks. Rick shook his head and focused on practical concerns, rather than perfumed and n**ed notions of sharing a place with a female.</p><p>Practical. Focus. Living at her house would serve a dual purpose. He could provide some extra protection, and he could push himself harder on the rehabilitation path than they allowed him here.</p><p>A win-win situation.</p><p>His cell phone rang from the table beside him, jerking him back to the present. Scooping it up, he checked the screen...and cursed. Truth was he lived to see that number. Now he didn\u2019t know what to say to her.</p><p>His kid. His daughter. Not a baby anymore.</p><p>At fifteen years old, Lauren had expectations and rightly so. Even at full speed, he hadn\u2019t been the best of dads, but at least he\u2019d been someone she could brag about. She deserved that hero father who could do more than hobble in and out of her life. He\u2019d never been much when it came to the emotional quotient\u2014just ask his ex. Still, in the minimal time he\u2019d spent in the States he\u2019d tried his best to do something with his daughter. Camping and hiking. Amusement parks and air shows. Beach surfing marathons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now he couldn\u2019t do more than write checks.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>His thumb hovered over the On button...then he pitched the phone on the bed. He would have to speak to Lauren eventually. Now just wasn\u2019t the best time, right after he almost had his butt blown up by a car bomb...</p> <p>Then agreed to move in with a woman he\u2019d slept with five years ago. Talk about another sort of bomb in his life.</p><p>The phone jangled again.</p><p>He stared as if he could will it to silence, prepared to wait it out again...but his hand stretched out with a mind of its own and clasped the receiver. Hell, he couldn\u2019t ignore her call anymore than he could ignore her baby cry at 2:00 a.m. no matter how many times his ex vowed their kid would never learn to sleep through the night that way.</p><p>He thumbed the On button. \u201cHello, Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d Her familiar voice greeted him through the airwaves along with the sounds of some fast-food joint. She always enjoyed hanging out with friends over a burger after school. \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t answer before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, kiddo, I didn\u2019t have my phone with me.\u201d His head thumped back against the wall as he lied to his child. Guilt sucked.</p><p>\u201cYou always have your phone with you. I mean, God, like whenever I see you your cell phone is like an extension of your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike father, like daughter.\u201d He swung his legs up on the bed. Might as well get comfortable. She was chatty like her mother, but damn, he\u2019d missed Lauren\u2019s voice so much he wanted to take in every second of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m not that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiddo, I pay your cell phone bill. I\u2019ve seen the number of text messages.\u201d</p><p>She giggled over the airwaves at their ritual pseudo-bickering. \u201cI\u2019ll try to cut back on the LOL responses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. I\u2019m just ragging you.\u201d He held the phone and wished he could give her more than a few flipping extra text messages. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear your voice. But why aren\u2019t you using the home phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house for the Thanksgiving week. I wish I could see you, though.\u201d</p><p>Damn. More of that guilt.</p><p>He stared out the window at Nola breaking away from the cops in the parking lot near the greasy spoon across the street. She would be back inside before he knew it. His time with Lauren was short.</p><p>\u201cSoon, kiddo.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>He hated hearing the disappointment in her voice. He loved his kid, but better to make sure she had lower expectations than to let her down. \u201cThe job makes it tough for me to get away sometimes, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, you have important things to do.\u201d Her laugh thinned. \u201cYou would tell me about them, but then you would have to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>How could he know her laugh thinned? Maybe it was just some weird sentimentality on his part because the cell phone connection was so clear she could have been right here in the room with him as they made more small talk. He asked her about school. Thanksgiving break. Things that didn\u2019t mean anything, but he should have already known about.</p><p>\u201cWas there anything else you needed, kiddo? Because if not, can we talk later? I have to cut this short.\u201d Nola would be back any second now.</p><p>\u201cSure, Dad. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t miss the forced cheer in her voice and wanted to kick himself\u2014not that he could do that much damage with even the better of his bum legs. \u201cI will call later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Lauren, I l\u2014\u201d</p><p>She disconnected before he could even finish saying he loved her.</p><p>Nola hesitated in Rick\u2019s door, hating to pull him out of his reverie as he stared at his closed cell phone cradled in his hand. You\u2019d never know he was injured the way he sprawled on his bed like any other guy lounging at the end of a long day of work. He\u2019d changed into fresh sweatpants and a T-shirt stretching over muscles.</p><p>His hand still clutching the cell phone.</p><p>Who was Lauren? Not that it should matter to her. Logic told her if he had a serious girlfriend, he would be moving in with that woman rather than Nola.</p><p>One weekend five years ago gave her no right to feel jealous.</p><p>So why was she standing here with the cookies he\u2019d forgotten in her hand feeling the need to close the door on that part of her life? Had she asked him to move in with her because she had some maniac blowing up things in her life?</p><p>Maybe the whole move-in thing had been some spontaneous goof-up that he already regretted now that the Lauren person had called.</p><p>Nola rapped her knuckles on the door, drawing his attention away from the phone and to her. \u201cDid you mean it when you said you were going to move in with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never make promises I can\u2019t keep.\u201d His thumb moved back and forth over the small silver phone.</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d She inched into the room, unable to help noticing how stark it looked for a place he must have lived in for months. Whenever she\u2019d spent even a week in the hospital, she\u2019d brought pictures and a water fountain from home along with her helmet to serve as motivation to recover her health and her life. \u201cIt must be tough carrying around that much perfection.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his feet at the ankles, lounging in bed, a look she remembered as well as the errant twinkle sparking to life in his eyes. \u201cWhen you have a mouth this big, you have to be right.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled from her in a surprising burst.</p><p>She smiled along with him. How could she not? And what a time to realize she hadn\u2019t smiled this much in... She couldn\u2019t recall how long. \u201cThat ego must be mighty heavy to tote around, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spent enough time in the military to know it\u2019s important to be able to make decisions quickly in the field. Once committed to the plan of action, see it through.\u201d</p><p>Except she wondered if he could still be in the military with the injury to his legs. That would have to chew at him. Attitude was so important to recovery. She wondered if she would have even made it without the hope of regaining her place in the cockpit again.</p><p>Imagining his pain stole the smile from her face. She set the cookies on his bedside table. What a pitiful offering to someone who\u2019d lost so much.</p><p>He popped the lid off and pulled one out, waving for her to have a seat in the leather recliner beside the industrial hospital roller table. \u201cHave you had any more thoughts on who would want to blow you up beyond that mystery stranger?\u201d</p><p>She sat, because then he would have an excuse to stay right where he was, all comfy on his bed, not because she wanted to stick around longer. Hah. Liar. \u201cI lead a pretty benign life. The only people who want to blow me up are enemies overseas and it\u2019s not a personal thing, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop from asking, \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely certain your ex-husband\u2019s not the stalker type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing my ex wants is to lay eyes on me again. Peter\u2019s happily married with a pretty new wife living in Georgia. And yes, that stung for three frozen margaritas, a hangover and a week beyond that before I decided to move on.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHe has two baby girls and another kid on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bites.\u201d</p><p>She jolted. She hadn\u2019t expected sympathy. \u201cYeah. Far worse than losing the scumbag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom still seems to think I want updates on my ex\u2019s dating life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod save us from helpful relatives.\u201d Was that plural ex wives? Or just one? She was tempted to ask but that would put them on a more intimate footing before moving in together.</p><p>Not wise.</p><p>He toasted her with a cookie, chewing down two before he spoke again. \u201cWho knew you were here?\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cAre you insinuating I didn\u2019t tell the police everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re a prickly thing. I was just wondering if you held back. Sometimes there are things we think sound silly or unimportant.\u201d</p><p>Her stiff spine eased. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to help and I should be grateful. This whole thing just has me wound tight. I\u2019m used to worrying on the job, but damn it, I treasured the safe haven of home to recharge between missions and now this stalker has encroached on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurnout bites, too, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Burnout? He had his wires crossed there, but she wasn\u2019t going to argue with the man. Better to change the subject. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this one last time. The second I asked you to move in, I regretted it. These are my problems and I won\u2019t be able to live with myself if something happens to you because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like I said before, seems as if we\u2019re stuck with each other. So if you don\u2019t mind a stubborn, bum leg bodyguard, I\u2019m ready to sign on for the job. God knows I\u2019d like to get out of this place and the last thing I want is one of the prison warden nurses watching over me 24-7.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m a pushover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I guess I don\u2019t really know you, do I?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard against the memory of the things they did know about each other, intimate things that heated the air like the lotion he\u2019d rubbed all over her body the second day they\u2019d made love because one night hadn\u2019t been near enough. Leaving him had been more than difficult. She\u2019d wanted more, so much more, but time had run out for her.</p><p>Now here they were again. What was he saying? She needed to keep sharp around him or her mind would muddle up and she would do something impulsive like ask him to move in with her.</p><p>\u201cI may not know you, but I have decent instincts, and I believe you\u2019ll be fair. Plus, you have a day job that will give me some breathing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathing room is important to you.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to give him claustrophobia, because his gaze finally broke with hers, away, out the window to the sky he no longer sailed through, only him and his parachute. She imagined the clouds called to him. That she could well understand because the sky called to her as a pilot. She couldn\u2019t imagine having her wings clipped.</p><p>Finally, he looked back. \u201cBreathing room is critical. Call it my cave time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man who admits to Cro-Magnon traits?\u201d She stuck a finger in her ear and twisted. \u201cI can\u2019t have heard right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? My ex made sure I understood myself well.\u201d</p><p>There he went mentioning the ex again. How recent was the divorce? Did it have anything to do with his injuries? He hadn\u2019t been wearing a ring five years ago. Okay, she was thinking way too much about his personal life. \u201cThis whole moving in together sounds good, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having second thoughts about my coming to Charleston with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some kind of maniac trying to blow me up and the last thing I want is to put somebody else in danger. Damn it. I should have thought this through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you, lady, you can\u2019t shake me loose now. If you won\u2019t let me in your house, I\u2019ll be sleeping in a tent in your yard, and believe me, the cold air and humidity will play hell on the rods in my legs.\u201d</p><p>In spite of his humor, he was set on a path as steely as the metal in his legs. She could tell he wasn\u2019t going to back off. She would just have to hope and pray the police protection around her house would be enough to keep them both safe.</p><p>Rick had helped her before, and while it had only taken a couple of days, she couldn\u2019t walk away from him while he was in need even if it took longer to help him through his recovery.</p><p>As much as she chafed at the idea of playing to the he-man syndrome, she also walked in that world daily. She understood how much more it must chafe at him to have the props kicked out from under him.</p><p>Men didn\u2019t seem to get the fact their strength came from so much more than catapulting out of airplanes.</p><p>All a moot point. Apparently he\u2019d decided his redemption lay in protecting her. And he did need her, too. She owed him for that weekend five years ago. She might not have made it through without the confidence he gave her. So much of her survival depended on the mental. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something she could give him now.</p><p>\u201cAll right, roomie. How fast can we spring you from this joint?\u201d</p><p>Through the caf\u00e9 window, he watched the smoldering remains of her car in the lot, firefighters waiting, their foam caking and crackling like an over-baked meringue. Cops were long gone, having already finished their note taking and investigation.</p> <p>They never even saw him from his perch in the nearby greasy spoon where he inhaled the scent of frying hamburgers and humanity.</p><p>If he wanted Nola Seabrook dead now, she would be six feet under. But he liked the hunt.</p><p>She always used her remote starter for her car, so he\u2019d known she would thumb the button rather than turn the key. The look of shock, the fear on her face when her car exploded had been well worth the risk of planting the device in open daylight. Of course the thrill, the rush, that\u2019s what this was all about.</p><p>Recapturing what he\u2019d lost.</p><p>She would die\u2014eventually. He had his timetable, but it would be his. He was in control of his life again. He didn\u2019t need his youthful body. He\u2019d learned to dominate with his mind, his brain. Working his way onto the military hospital parking lot had been a rush.</p> <p>His street-smart wits combined with his warrior-honed skills made him indomitable.</p><p>The fun was in the cat-and-mouse game. She owed him for the humiliation she\u2019d caused. She wouldn\u2019t get away from him this time.</p><p>He started to leave, but reconsidered. He needed to eat after all. What better way to savor this victory than with a meal while he regrouped for the next stage of his battle plan?</p><p>Apparently he wasn\u2019t the only one watching the rehabilitation center with such interest long past what the burning vehicle warranted. A teenage girl stared at the medical building\u2014the windows, not the SUV. She clutched her cellular phone in her hand, her too-tight jeans slung low on her h*ps with too many holes in them to be accidental. Why did these youths want to appear poor? He\u2019d been poverty-stricken and it was not fun or trendy.</p><p>She pocketed her cellular phone and sidled up to the linoleum counter. \u201cI\u2019d like an application for a waitress job.\u201d</p><p>The woman behind the cash register shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for any more after-school help.\u201d</p> <p>The girl shoved her hands in her back pockets. \u201cPlease, I work really hard and it says right there you need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want no troublemaking teenagers.\u201d The woman\u2014Jo Nell, her tag read\u2014folded her arms underneath her well-harnessed breasts.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t cause trouble. Besides, it doesn\u2019t look to me like you can be picky.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes stayed strong, defiant, but her voice had just a hint of desperation. \u201cHow about I work for a trial hour, with no pay? Then you can decide. Looks to me like you\u2019ve got your hands full with all these gawkers trolling in from that car explosion...\u201d</p><p>The man working the griddle leaned into the pass-through window. \u201cJo Nell, quit your yacking and give the girl a chance. She\u2019s right. Orders are coming faster than you\u2019re filling them.\u201d He pitched a pad and pencil her way before snatching up a spatula again. \u201cNumber seven coming up!\u201d</p><p>The teenager snatched an apron and hooked it over her neck. \u201cThanks a million. You won\u2019t regret it. I\u2019ve got hardworking genes.\u201d</p><p>Tennis shoes squeaking, she wound her way across the room with a single-minded determination that made him grin with memories he had not allowed himself in months.</p><p>Pencil poised over her paper she stopped by his table. \u201cHave you decided yet what you\u2019ll have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most definitely have.\u201d He folded the menu closed. \u201cWhat is your name, chica?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLauren, and hopefully that\u2019ll be on my own name tag at the end of the next hour so I can work here near my dad\u2019s hospital.\u201d</p><p>Once he finished placing his order, he smiled at the innocent child, thinking of his own family he\u2019d lost because of Nola. \u201cGood luck, little Lauren. And be careful in this big city. I would hate for bad luck to visit anyone as lovely as you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Eyes gritty from lack of sleep, Nola turned the rental car into her dusty driveway and wondered what Rick would think of her little waterside bungalow on a barrier island outside of Charleston, South Carolina. The headlights sweeping the yard showed nothing disturbed. Her alarm system wasn\u2019t blaring. Her nearest neighbor, ex-cop Malcolm Cuvier, had kept the lawn in order and watched out for intruders.</p><p>All seemed right in her home at least.</p><p>Moonbeams reached across the reedy water to illuminate her yellow clapboard house. One story, two bedrooms, with a long living-kitchen area that overlooked a porch along the bay. Not much space, but then how many square feet did a woman need who never planned to marry or have children?</p><p>Car idling, she stretched in the leather seat, only to find Rick...</p><p>Asleep?</p><p>Some watchdog.</p><p>Of course he was still recovering and this had to have been a long day for him, even for a fellow who appeared as vital as he did. They both knew he was around for show more than any actual protection he could provide. That had to grate on him. She remembered well her own frustration with how long it took to get back up to speed with simple tasks like cooking a meal without needing a nap\u2014which then meant reheating the darn meal if the whole thing wasn\u2019t ruined by the time she woke up.</p><p>Rubbing the back of her neck, she threaded her fingers through her hair and shook it loose, relaxing in her seat and staring at her home through \u201cRick eyes.\u201d What had once seemed a lovely hide-away now appeared dangerously isolated. A few lonely crickets chirped, even this late in November, hearty stock hanging around until Thanksgiving week, but nothing else, no one else, her nearest neighbor a mile away through thick trees filled with Spanish moss.</p><p>She would be spending the holiday with a man she barely knew, even given the day spent in the car making small talk. Now she knew what fast food he liked\u2014a Big Mac. And what kind of music he enjoyed\u2014retro rock. Still, in her house out here in the middle of nowhere with no family, no love, she felt...vulnerable.</p><p>Nola didn\u2019t like that feeling much. The cancer nightmare had been rife with helplessness and while she\u2019d tried her best to hold strong, nobody could make it through something like that without moments\u2014hell, to be honest, much longer than moments\u2014of gut-wrenching tears and fears.</p><p>This stalker thing brought those feelings back to the fore at a time when she should have been able to put the whole experience behind her. The bastard trying to scare her may not have harmed her, but he had stolen the beautiful sanctuary of her home.</p><p>She\u2019d bought the waterside cottage as a gift to herself once she\u2019d begun to trust remission and wasn\u2019t trucking it to the doctor every three minutes for some treatment or another. Solitude became a treasured rarity during that first year, her body out there for every doctor, nurse, aide and student to poke, prod and study.</p><p>Hurt.</p><p>The pain, the total loss of privacy, the tubes, everything had been beyond imagining. Nothing could have prepared her, and heaven knows she\u2019d read and researched every last detail.</p><p>Whoa. Back up. Dump that in the past. She didn\u2019t want to go there ever again, especially now. Wasn\u2019t seeing Rick again about moving ahead? She could help him even if she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Rick\u2019s deep voice growled from beside her, \u201care we gonna sleep in the car or head inside?\u201d</p><p>Nola would have jerked clean out of her skin if it weren\u2019t for years of military training. She turned the key off and pulled it from the ignition. \u201cI thought you were already asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Just watching you through my eyelashes.\u201d He straightened with a stretch and yawn, his bulging arms and body filling the confines of the vehicle, a bulk better suited to a larger SUV. \u201cPeople give away more when they think people aren\u2019t looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect to find out about me from staring?\u201d She hated the whole lab item under a microscope feel. \u201cSheesh, Rick, you could just ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like this at all. What had she given away about herself to this apparently too perceptive man?</p><p>He opened the door and hauled himself out by holding on to the door frame, the moon casting shadows down the hard angles of his face. She couldn\u2019t help but notice more hollows than before.</p><p>Sympathy tweaked, chasing away her own insecurities. \u201cCan I help y\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Balancing with seeming ease, he opened the back door and pulled out his crutches, his shoulders blocking the moon and any further chance of reading his expression.</p><p>She opened her door and swung her legs out onto the dusty driveway. \u201cJust because someone offers help, you don\u2019t have to be rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He made his way around the hood. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to overlook my grumpiness sometimes. Habit born from frustration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d He held up a hand. \u201cThat makes the frustration worse. I appreciate that you\u2019re a nice sympathetic babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe?\u201d She snorted. \u201cAre you trying to get me to kick that crutch out from under your arm?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and pointed toward her with said crutch, balancing on the other. \u201cNow that\u2019s more like it.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she waved for him to follow her and charged toward the garage apartment entrance on the side of her cottage. Why hadn\u2019t she taken more time to get to know this guy five years ago? Oh yeah, she\u2019d only wanted him to bang her brains out.</p><p>\u201cThis is it.\u201d Her fingers fisted around the keys. A memory of her car exploding swelled in her mind, closing her throat.</p><p>Rick rested a hand on her shoulder. \u201cFlashbacks suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d She clenched the keys tighter. \u201cNothing to do but deal with it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t question how he knew and understood what she was thinking. They had that career experience in common. The trauma of the car explosion may have happened in the civilian world, but it bore a stark resemblance to the type of event that could have taken place on an Iraqi roadside. They\u2019d all been wound tight to be on the lookout for such things for years now.</p><p>Nola fit the key in the garage apartment lock. The door swung wide to a one-room studio. She\u2019d used it for friends to visit\u2014more privacy that way. God, she really was a mess these days, but yeah, she had some personal space issues left to deal with.</p><p>\u201cYou can move things around if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to buy some weights tomorrow, so I can work out.\u201d He thumped past, proficient with the crutches. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll move the dining table to the side and put mats there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fine to me. You\u2019ve still got the bar and stools for meals.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cSofa and TV are fine for mealtime.\u201d</p><p>Sounded pretty much like her mealtime. How logical it would be to eat together. How logical...enticing...habit forming.</p><p>Dangerously addictive. \u201cDo you need help settling in or would you prefer some peace and quiet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really can manage.\u201d He propped his crutches against the wall and walked slowly around the apartment, not running any races, but making his way by unobtrusively holding on to furniture or walls. \u201cThey held me back by babying me at that place.\u201d</p><p>Of course he could manage. Right up until the point where his legs gave out under him. She would have to figure out pride-saving ways to offer help.</p><p>Or just quit asking.</p><p>Nola walked outside, popped the trunk, yanked his suitcase and hauled it inside before he could argue. She pitched it on the sectional sofa. The bed in the corner would have been optimal, but she figured it was better to ditch the thing fast.</p><p>\u201cOkey doke. You\u2019re all set.\u201d She pivoted on her heel and was out the door lickety-split, before he could get all uptight and macho again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNola,\u201d he called from beside her, sprawled in an iron lawn chair just outside the door.</p><p>She spun around, startled to see him sitting there.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, sure.\u201d She stared back, the moon streaking star sparks against his jet-black hair and eyes. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola, come here.\u201d</p><p>Nerves pattered. She tamped them down, tossed her shoulders back and inched closer.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, stopping toe-to-toe in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI figure if there\u2019s anyone looking at your new watchdog, we\u2019d better clear up that whole me sleeping in the garage thing and why you carried my luggage. Just to be safe, we want them to believe I have a vested interest in keeping you safe.\u201d</p> <p>Hmm. She hadn\u2019t thought about that. She backed away a step from the intensity in his opaque eyes.</p><p>Her feet shot out from under her\u2014thanks to slick dew in the mulchy leaves. She\u2019d been so busy worrying about him she hadn\u2019t thought about herself falling flat on her own butt on top of him.</p><p>Then he folded her into his lap, his arms going around her in unmistakable possessiveness. His face hovered just over hers, his mouth so close. She remembered. Oh yes, she remembered the confidence of his kiss. The way he seemed to know right from the start exactly what she wanted.</p><p>He listened to her needs.</p><p>His thumb resting on the curve of her breast twitched.</p><p>With his face so close to hers she could feel his breath caress her as gently as his hands once had. A simple stretch up on her toes and she could press her lips to his again. Would reality match the memory?</p> <p>That simple thought was enough to help her pull away. She didn\u2019t want to lose the special remembrance that had carried her through. To find out it had somehow been a fantasy could make her lose faith in her recovery. How messed up was that? But she\u2019d fast learned much of the healing process involved the body and mind working in synch.</p><p>She simply couldn\u2019t risk...fear.</p><p>Nola scrambled off his lap and gave him a bold once-over. \u201cAll right, pal, no more of that. People don\u2019t have to think we\u2019re dating for you to be a watchdog. And about the lap thing...\u201d She swallowed hard. Harder. Gave up getting rid of the lump and just moved on. \u201cWe can rest easy since we\u2019ve now officially cleared away the wrong thing to do right off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust how we said all the wrong things on that first night in the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Because anything intimate would be unwise. I\u2019m not in the market for a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I came here to watch out for you\u2014not to watch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to know, though, that the attraction is still there. We\u2019re only human.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went harder than the steel of his muscles as he stood. \u201cI don\u2019t need a pity f\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa. You can stop right there. There\u2019s no reason for you to assume that from what I said.\u201d Her own voice went as hard as his eyes. She didn\u2019t take that kind of crap from anyone. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve that kind of garbage tossed my way. I wasn\u2019t pitying you and I don\u2019t say or do things I don\u2019t mean. I also don\u2019t give my body away that lightly, thank you very much.\u201d She pulled herself upright and braced, in charge. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re the last guy I would pity. You seem to be able to hold your own just fine.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, damn him. \u201cRight when I think you\u2019re going to piss me off, you go and say something all sweet and perfect.\u201d</p><p>Sweet? Sheesh, he was charming.</p><p>Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few with some clean sheets. You can make your own bed, though, because I\u2019m not any man\u2019s maid.\u201d</p><p>Spinning away, she held her rigid spine stance even though his wicked smile could deflate a dirigible. Whoa, mama, what had she let herself in for?</p><p>Well, hell. She\u2019d sure told him.</p><p>The grin Rick hadn\u2019t even realized spread across his face dug deeper until next thing he knew he was laughing so hard his legs gave out from under him and he fell on his ass in the iron chair again. Even then, his humor didn\u2019t fade. It felt good to be treated like a man instead of a patient. Damn good.</p><p>Laughter tapering off, he made his way on aching-like-hell legs back into the garage apartment by holding onto trees and then walls until finally he collapsed on the sectional sofa. Plenty of room to stretch out\u2014he liked it, a couch that wasn\u2019t institutional-board hard. Air that smelled \u201chome normal\u201d rather than \u201chospital antiseptic.\u201d</p><p>Home normal. What would that be? Regular cleaners? Like Windex and some air freshener. What did women call it...?</p><p>Potpourri.</p><p>Yeah. Sure enough, over there in the corner he saw a little glass bowl with shreds of red leaves and other leafy stuff.</p><p>Man, he was seriously losing it if he was getting all worked up over the smell of glass cleaner and nature shavings. Except each of these items were clues about Nola, a woman he\u2019d moved in with when he\u2019d vowed no way in hell would he ever live with a woman again.</p><p>After splitting with his ex-wife, he\u2019d been certain he would live alone forever. Not that he was actually living with Nola. Still, here he was learning more about her.</p><p>Except he did already know about the way she enjoyed having her br**sts stroked and nuzzled while he rocked inside her. Definitely not a wise thought to be having after a year without sex.</p><p>His brain must be malfunctioning from sex deprivation because now that he thought of it... Damn it. He should have checked her part of the house, not that he would make much of an intimidating watchdog right now. His body was pretty much shot. Better to check on her and go in armed with cops as backup if needed.</p><p>He reached for his cell phone and dialed her cell from memory.</p><p>She picked up after two rings. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick? Why wouldn\u2019t I be? I told you in the yard...\u201d</p><p>Ah, so she thought he was referring to the almost kiss. She definitely didn\u2019t sound as if she had a stalker at her throat. He exhaled long and hard, his heart slowing to half time. \u201cI wondered if maybe your letter-writing buddy might be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Uh. Right. No new messages.\u201d Rustling sounded in the background, like her feet shuffling, a soda can popping, the refrigerator door closing. \u201cI\u2019m just getting something to drink before I bring your sheets. Hope you don\u2019t mind the wait.\u201d</p><p>He wondered what she was drinking, what it would taste like on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo hurry.\u201d He could use a few extra minutes to gather some restraint when it came to seeing her, smelling her. Wanting to touch and taste her. Back to business, pal. \u201cWe need to come up with a duress word so even if someone dangerous is with you, you can let me know there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She slurped another sip, the slightly undignified sound kinda endearing because it was...personal? \u201cI should have thought of that. How about milk shake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilk shake?\u201d Another personal fact. She must have a weakness for them. What flavor? Knowing it was wrong, stupid and definitely unwise, he made a vow to find out her favorite flavor someday.</p><p>\u201cSure. Milk shake. I can work it into a sentence without it sounding weird, but the chances of me accidentally using it are next to nil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Milk shake it is.\u201d He held the phone and wondered why he didn\u2019t just hang up now. \u201cYou\u2019ll reset your security system after bringing the sheets? And make sure I have the code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll check the place over more thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be good to have fresh eyes and ideas. The guys at work have been driving me crazy hovering over me. Maybe now they\u2019ll back off with the kid gloves and start treating me like an equal again instead of acting like I might break.\u201d</p><p>The guys at work.</p><p>She\u2019d already had watchdogs? So why had she asked a busted up dude like him? For some reason her pride had needed to keep them at a distance. Interesting. He wasn\u2019t sure whether to be complimented or insulted. This woman was tough as hell to understand. \u201cGood night, Nola.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Rick.\u201d</p><p>He thumbed the Off button.</p><p>Potpourri and pride.</p><p>Hell. The more he knew about her, the deeper she trenched into his mind.</p><p>He levered himself off the sofa, held on to the kitchen island, braced his other hand against the wall. Yeah, it was the principle of the thing, he would get to that crystal dish without his crutches.</p><p>And he did. It hurt, muscles tightening and straining, overworked and yeah, he would pay with a sleepless night, but he made it.</p><p>Every day a little more.</p><p>Leaning against the counter, he opened a cabinet, picked up her decorative bowl and hid the sweet-smelling junk behind a mixing bowl he was mighty damn certain a dial-a-meal guy like him would never use.</p><p>He was here to keep Nola safe, heal his legs and move on once her stalker had been nabbed. Nothing more.</p><p>Mind set, he closed the cabinet door on the mixing bowl, potpourri and sweet-smelling temptations.</p><p>He was tempted to kill her tonight. Drive his chilly rental car from where it was parked two neighborhoods over. Go to her house, break in and just end it all.</p><p>Following her from Texas all the way to South Carolina, he had suppressed the urge to run her off the road so many times. The crippled man would have died with her, but there were often unforeseen casualties in war. Given the man\u2019s injuries, he would probably welcome death anyway.</p><p>Heaven above, he personally would not want to live with half a body. Half a man. Half a fighter.</p><p>The temptation was growing so strong to finish it that finally he needed to put distance between himself and her. Once he had been certain she planned to return home, he had sped ahead, skipping meals in order to reach her house first and leave her a welcome-home gift.</p><p>She should be finding it soon. Too bad he would not see her face when she discovered his \u201cgift,\u201d but he could not risk staying so close to her house. Oh, he didn\u2019t doubt that he could remain unseen, but he did question his ability to keep his hands from around her beautiful, vulnerable neck.</p><p>He would simply have to relive the expression on her face when her car had exploded into flames. And about her car... She would need to shop for another soon, which gave him another idea. Oh the ideas of ways to torment her. He definitely wanted to play this out a while longer.</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>The rapping on the rental car window startled him from his plans, reminding him of the need to stay sharp. She was a fighter, too, after all. A fighter who\u2019d beaten him once before.</p><p>He turned to look and found a local police officer with a flashlight.</p><p>Relax. Not Nola.</p><p>He rolled down the window. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sir, vagrancy is against the law around here.\u201d The county cop kept the flashlight pointed in his eyes. \u201cIf you need somewhere to sleep, you\u2019re going to have to move your car someplace else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sleeping.\u201d Indignation sparked. He was not some vagrant, even if he did plan to sleep here eventually, and yes, he hoped to hang around long enough to catch a distant glimpse of her leaving on some errand. Just a look to carry him through.</p><p>\u201cSir, I have received calls from two concerned neighbors about your vehicle sitting here for the past five hours.\u201d The policeman swept his flashlight through the car, inspecting. \u201cThing is, you have stayed in the car. That\u2019s making people uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is sitting in a car against the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know your business.\u201d The flashlight swung directly back into his eyes, blinding him.</p><p>All right. He was wise enough to know when to stop questioning the authority figure. He did not need to be hauled in, especially since Nola had reported his letters to the authorities. He was two neighborhoods over, but he did not want them making the connection. In fact, he should line up another rental immediately. \u201cI am going to pull out my wallet now, all right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay, now. Take it slow and easy, mister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d He reached with one hand into his back pocket, carefully dodging his concealed Taurus .40 caliber pistol. \u201cHere is my private investigator\u2019s license. I am simply watching that house over there to see how long he stays with the lady. Let us just say the man is not her husband.\u201d</p><p>The police officer lowered the beam to the documents, wide-brimmed hat shadowing his eyes until eventually his shoulders lowered as well. If body language could be believed, apparently he had bought the cover story. \u201cI really don\u2019t like people causing trouble, loitering around. Don\u2019t make me pull your license.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know my rights, and the police can only file a complaint against me. They cannot actually pull it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. But if I receive any more calls about you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy business should be through tonight.\u201d A lie, but he lied well and with a straight face. He would simply have to be more careful about staying hidden.</p><p>Perhaps he could even look into renting one of the small places nearby. Except the time seemed to be drawing closer. The hotel would serve his purposes as long as it had wireless access for him to work on his next plan to keep the heat turned up on Nola Seabrook\u2019s life.</p><p>After dropping off Rick\u2019s sheets without lingering, Nola finished her diet drink and tossed the can in the recycling bin back in the main house. She should probably find something to eat, but her stomach still hadn\u2019t settled from her car explo\u2014</p> <p>Oh, hell. Who was she kidding? Her belly was turning loop-de-loops over the fact that she had a man living under her roof again. Didn\u2019t matter they weren\u2019t sharing a bed. They were sharing shingles.</p><p>She\u2019d trusted a near stranger with her safety over a squadron full of friends. How messed up was that? Or maybe it made total sense because this way she maintained some control. Some distance. Not that she\u2019d kept her distance very well when she\u2019d landed in Rick DeMassi\u2019s lap earlier. What a freaking mess.</p><p>Okay, she would reclaim her life. Be normal.</p><p>Nola snagged an apple from a basket on the counter and crunched. She hit the remote to turn on her favorite jazz music and started shedding clothes on her way to her bedroom.</p><p>She thrived on disarray in her home. She had more than enough of regimen at work these days. Her T-shirt went sailing to land on the back of her sofa. Nola kicked one shoe under the dining room table, the other under her telephone table.</p><p>And speaking of her phone, she\u2019d better keep her cell phone with her for emergencies. She looped the string holder around her wrist.</p> <p>\u201cMilk shake. Milk shake. Milk shake.\u201d She repeated the duress words a few more times with a dance step to her walk as she committed it to memory.</p><p>She unbuttoned her jeans and kicked them into a pool in the hall until she wore only her sport bra, high-cut cotton panties and Christmas-green socks. Back before her cancer, she\u2019d lived in a totally orderly world of beige and white, only to discover she controlled nothing. Now, she lived her life differently, vibrantly, with a certain respect for the psychedelic chaos factor.</p><p>Her problem lay in trying to blend the two parts of herself, past and present.</p><p>She padded down the narrow hall full of pictures of planes and friends snapped around the world. During her recovery, she\u2019d taken a framing class and matted photos from her past in bright colors. She\u2019d populated her home with the memories to give herself hope of adding more images someday. And she had.</p><p>Would she add one of herself with Rick to look at after he left?</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t that a dangerous thought to carry into her bedroom? She creaked open the door, swinging the cell phone on her wrist, a reminder that Rick was only a simple call and wall away.</p><p>Had she been totally reckless to invite him here with their sexual history? Or maybe he was exactly the man to invite under her roof, perhaps under her bedspread, as well. He had scars, too. Could he be the one she could trust to show her own?</p><p>All-too-deep thoughts for her exhausted body tonight. She stepped into her room and clicked on the switch for her Tiffany lamp to cast multicolor lights over her Laura Ashley patterned pink-and-white room full of pillows and trinket boxes and her newfound joy in clutter. She soaked in the familiarity of it all, readying to flop into the plump comfort of her bed...</p> <p>Only to stop short.</p><p>Lying on her floral pillow sham rested a surprise box of Godiva chocolates. Which would have been creepy enough by itself, except the box was open with half the candies missing and only the light chocolates remaining, as if someone had removed all the dark.</p><p>The kind she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>Her fingers shook as she reached for her cell phone, already whispering, \u201cMilk shake.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t sleep on a sofa.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t? No word stirred Rick to be contrary more than that.</p><p>Standing in Nola\u2019s living room after the cops had left from taking their statements, he had plenty of frustration built against her candy-leaving stalker as it was. Rick refused to let her boot him out of her place in some misguided sense of independence that was flat-out unsafe.</p><p>Nola had to know this ramped things up to a new level of dangerous. She might look unfazed standing there in her sweatpants and T-shirt with her fists perched on her hips. But he still remembered those same fists shaking when he\u2019d seen her in the sport bra and high-cut panties she\u2019d been wearing when he made his way into her place after her \u201cmilk shake\u201d call.</p><p>This stalker guy had slipped past her security system while she was out of town\u2014and blown up her car in another city. The fella was freaking everywhere at once. Not a chance Rick was letting her out of his sight, even if it meant sleeping on her flowery sofa that oozed estrogen.</p><p>He met her nose-to-nose. Okay, more like nose to curly hair. \u201cLike hell I can\u2019t sleep there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be realistic.\u201d Her fists slid from her h*ps and she backed away to sit on the edge of the matching poofy chair. \u201cYou\u2019re still recovering from major injuries. There is no way I\u2019m putting you on a sofa, or even a pullout couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there is no way I\u2019m letting you sleep in this house alone.\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to be maneuvered through her obvious attempt at low-key body language. \u201cThe cops may not have been overly concerned about the private investigator vagrant they mentioned being the only disturbance recently, but I\u2019m not dismissing it so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was actually a couple of neighborhoods over,\u201d she said, her voice rock solid. \u201cAnd my neighbor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Malcolm Cuvier fella, the ex-cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d been Johnny-on-the-spot when the cops showed up. Forced into retirement at forty when he took a bullet in the lung, he still listened to his police scanner religiously. \u201cHe\u2019s going to call in some favors and look into it a little deeper for us.\u201d</p><p>Rick dropped to sit beside her on the arm of the chair. Besides, his legs were aching a little. He wasn\u2019t getting all softhearted over this lady. He just needed to take care of his body since she was counting on him.</p><p>Still his hand gravitated to rub along her back between her shoulder blades absently while she stared off into space. He thought through what the cops had relayed about the stranger dude nearby. \u201cAll right, so the vagrant had an accent and was around fifty and claimed to be a private investigator. Could be our guy or hired by our guy. It\u2019s a start, more than we knew before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d She tipped her face up to his.</p><p>\u201cDuh. You asked me to help out, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She half smiled. \u201cDuh.\u201d</p><p>He started to pat her back again only to realize he was still touching her, in fact had been rubbing soothing circles along her back the whole time.</p><p>She looked up at him, his head beginning the dip down that would take him to her lips. Already the memory of the feel and fit of her came back to mind a second before he rediscovered... Yeah. He skimmed her mouth with his, his hand palming her back more firmly, drawing her closer. The scent of her filled him, spurring him to take this further, deeper, but what did she want?</p><p>He took her little gasp, the tiny moan in the back of the throat as an affirmation and delved into her mouth. No protest. Definitely no protest. Her hands slid up to his shoulders, around his neck.</p><p>Holy crap.</p><p>At least she had her clothes on now. He couldn\u2019t erase the image of her in those high-cut panties and sport bra, but at least the clothes offered a boundary of sorts or they would both be in serious trouble. Because as much as he was enjoying this kiss, he knew things wouldn\u2019t go any further.</p><p>He didn\u2019t question how he knew their limits when they\u2019d both hopped into bed so quickly before, but somehow, he just knew...call it taking a radar read off the woman. She had a wariness to her now that hadn\u2019t been there before, a steeliness too, no question. Nola also had more boundaries, and he had to admit he felt pretty damn much the same.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help but notice other differences, too. She was thinner, more whipcord. His mind played tricks on him because he could have sworn he remembered fuller breasts, but still he found her no less attractive. Just different. Like with her new curls.</p><p>Of course a lot of years had passed. His memory could well be faulty. His hand fisted in her T-shirt at her waist as he thought of how he\u2019d palmed her breast...</p><p>No. Stop. He wouldn\u2019t go there in his head and if he didn\u2019t pull back from this kiss soon, he would be going much further than either of them was ready for.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t afford the distraction when he needed to think about her safety\u2014especially when he had a long night ahead of him sharing a room with her. Easing away, he ended the kiss with a final brush over her lips, then the tip of her nose, her closed eyes, her forehead, before resting his chin on top of her head.</p><p>Best to keep things light. They couldn\u2019t pretend the kiss didn\u2019t happen, but he didn\u2019t want to talk it to death. He\u2019d better grab hold of the conversation first.</p><p>\u201cAbout watching over you tonight and the whole couch dilemma, if I sleep in your bed, I think I may suffocate from all the ruffles and powder puff.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, just a surprise since I expected something more...sleek. But I like surprises.\u201d His smile faded and his hand slid away from her back. He draped his arm along the back of the chair. \u201cEven if I conceded and let you sleep on the sofa, you would be out in the living room while I\u2019m in the next room, down the hall, too far away.\u201d</p><p>Her spare room only contained office furniture, not even a sofa.</p><p>\u201cHow about this then,\u201d she offered. \u201cWe\u2019ll both sleep in the garage apartment tonight. You sleep on the bed and I will sleep on the sectional sofa, which does have a pullout sofa bed.\u201d</p><p>He could live with the compromise. The place had fewer entrances to guard and the guy would actually be less likely to look for her there. Yeah. It fit. She was a reasonable woman. A reasonable woman who\u2019d had one helluva day. He couldn\u2019t resist teasing another smile from her.</p><p>\u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhat would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, you let me bench-press you as my weights so I can restore my lost testosterone percentage points.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shook with another laugh, weary, but still a solid chuckle. She extended her hand. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d He closed his fingers around hers\u2014soft, long fingers he could remember stroking over him with tender thoroughness, leaving him damn near begging at times.</p><p>He gritted his teeth.</p><p>Definitely a long night ahead of him.</p><p>God, this was a long flight.</p><p>Nola gripped the stick in her hand. She\u2019d been called in to sub for Bronco, who\u2019d thrown out his back in an intramural game of basketball. She\u2019d barely made the requisite twelve-hour crew rest for the afternoon flight, but the squadron commander really needed this mission\u2014with the demo of new upgrades to the aircraft. And, quite frankly, she hadn\u2019t minded the space from Rick after spending the night in the same room, after sharing a hair-curling kiss neither of them discussed. Instead, she\u2019d hugged a pillow and listened to him breathe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roll over.</p><p>Rustle the sheets.</p><p>Too many memories stirred of sharing sheets with him.</p> <p>She\u2019d suspected his legs were bothering him and she\u2019d wished she could offer a massage, but... They couldn\u2019t go there, not without things leading further. She needed more time with him before she made a decision about that.</p><p>He\u2019d ridden with her today to the base, checked in with the clinic about his rehab and then detailed his own plans to check out her security.</p><p>Nola worked her boots against the rudders, slicing the planes wings through clouds. Another ten minutes and they would be on autopilot, so she soaked up these remaining seconds of control, power. Freedom. She loved to fly, had known it was her destiny since the instant she\u2019d sat behind the controls for the first time. Sure she\u2019d started out piloting because she wanted to prove as a woman she could equal any man... Now she flew because she couldn\u2019t imagine not flying.</p><p>She and her ex-husband had met in flight school, had fallen hard and fast. Their relationship had been based on attraction and shared dreams.... Until Peter had washed out of flight school in the last month.</p><p>He\u2019d been one of the lucky ones who could stay in the Air Force. Some who washed out of training didn\u2019t even get to stay in the service. Peter hadn\u2019t considered himself lucky at all. Losing his dream had changed him. He\u2019d served four more years in the service at a desk job before putting in his papers.</p> <p>Why was Peter so heavily on her mind today? Had to be because of having a man under her roof again, even if it was purely platonic.</p><p>Purely? That kiss had been anything but platonic. If the two of them were already traveling this far and fast down memory lane, they wouldn\u2019t last too much longer without making their way to the end of the map. Had this been her reason for tracking him down? She\u2019d chosen him to be her last lover before the operation, did she want him to be her first after surgery, as well?</p><p>That scared her witless because the intent would have been subconscious and she liked to think she was making her own choices these days. And what did all of this have to do with her ex and him washing out of pilot training?</p><p>More of her flipping subconscious at work.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do if you couldn\u2019t fly anymore?\u201d The words fell out of her mouth of their own volition. Luckily, only her boss flying beside her would hear and not the crew in back.</p><p>\u201cWho gave you the grumpies instead of bananas with your Cheerios?\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Carson \u201cScorch\u201d Hunt glanced up from checking the fuel display.</p> <p>\u201cHa-ha. Very funny. Not.\u201d Her hand clenched around the stick. She wished she could mask her feelings as well as the clouds hid the ground below. \u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d All humor vanished from his poster-boy-perfect face\u2014she preferred craggy these days. \u201cOh damn. Is your cancer back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Ohmigod, no.\u201d Thank heavens. \u201cAnd I certainly wouldn\u2019t tell you in the middle of flying and risk unsettling our concentration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. All right.\u201d His exhale filled the headset long and slow before he continued, \u201cThis is about the man living with you. There are going to be a lot of broken hearts around the squadron once this becomes common knowledge.\u201d</p><p>How did he already know about Rick liv\u2014? \u201cAre there no secrets in this squadron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid not,\u201d he said as he opened his flight bag to pull out his lunch with Beachcombers Bar and Grill stamped across the sack containing a hamburger that smelled too good. \u201cI heard from Bronco that you called his wife since she\u2019s a flight surgeon to get her advice on the best options for rehab in the area.\u201d</p><p>Bronco always had been a big ole gossip. He must have spilled all when he called in sick because of his back. Well, this squadron thrived on practical jokes and Bronco was about to be the recipient of a whopper practical joke except she wasn\u2019t feeling particularly funny right now.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have a friend recovering at my place for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA PJ.\u201d A parajumper, also known as a pararescueman.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose guys are hard core. He must be going through hell adjusting. You\u2019re a good friend to take in somebody carrying that much baggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you sure are one chatty boss.\u201d</p><p>A boss she had dated back when their ranks and positions were closer, before he was the head honcho. They\u2019d gone out a couple of times, had fun, but soon realized there simply wasn\u2019t any chemistry. The friendship stuck, though.</p><p>Scorch turned to face her full on, the plane skimming through a sky as blue as his serious eyes. \u201cYeah, I get that you want me to back off, but hell, Bronco\u2019s a gossip and I\u2019m freaking Ann Landers. So here goes. How did you feel when you thought you wouldn\u2019t fly anymore?\u201d</p><p>She started to tell him to take a hike, sir, and then...she stopped and thought. If she meant to move forward, she had to stop pushing people away. Scorch truly was a good boss who cared about his people. Beyond that, he knew her well as a friend, in fact knew more about her than most folks.</p><p>Yet, she\u2019d never told him about Rick.</p><p>Still, she could carry on this conversation without relaying that tidbit.</p><p>Deep breath. Leap. \u201cI was so wrapped up thinking I might not even live, the notion of losing my wings wasn\u2019t up front in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereas your friend\u2019s mortality isn\u2019t in question since his isn\u2019t a life-threatening illness.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this job of ours is more than a job, a calling, service to country, to others above self. Those PJs really push themselves\u2014That Others May Live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir motto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about your cancer, how you fought so damn bravely, but all the while preparing yourself to die.\u201d</p><p>Ah. The clue bird landed on her head. \u201cHe has prepared himself to die, but never prepared himself to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since I\u2019m the boss and know everything, you might want to take those words to heart yourself.\u201d</p><p>An image flashed to mind of Rick\u2019s face as they\u2019d driven around base earlier\u2014the hunger in his eyes as he\u2019d stared out at the flight line at the airplanes. Planes he\u2019d once jumped out of to save lives.</p><p>Just as her boss had said. She\u2019d faced the possibility of death. But she\u2019d never thought about living\u2014and losing her dream.</p><p>Rick faced that nightmare every day, something far less clear-cut in its healing. How could she have been so dense? Hell, she lived with a man who couldn\u2019t face losing his dream. She\u2019d seen how it tore apart her ex-husband watching her put on her flight suit each day.</p><p>Rick would help her, but this had to be painful for him in ways he never would have anticipated. And\u2014ouch\u2014that stung her in a way she hadn\u2019t foreseen, either.</p><p>Self-revelations hurt as much as any incisions. This healing process just went on and on and on. Sheesh, when would she get to just live a normal day?</p><p>Maybe this was normal. The good and the bad. Learning and moving ahead. Time to quit grousing and start embracing those lessons so she could live each day a little stronger and wiser before she moved on to the next.</p><p>Definitely ouch.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve finally found your vulnerability,\u201d Rick pronounced from the passenger side of the rental SUV, working to inject levity in his tone.</p><p>He hurt like hell. The rehab folks here took torture lessons from the same folks as the technicians in Texas. His legs hurt. His head hurt.</p><p>And after three nights sharing a room with Nola, other parts of him hurt even worse.</p><p>He was grouchy as all get-out and determined not to show it.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Nola glanced from the road to him then back to the street, turning off the interstate.</p><p>\u201cYour weakness.\u201d He hooked his elbow on the open window. Tough to believe tomorrow would be Thanksgiving, with temperate weather like this. The time for family dinners. He squelched thoughts of Lauren at two with mashed potatoes all over her chubby cheeks. Patience. \u201cYour tender spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat chance. I have no tender spots. I am a warrior woman, invincible.\u201d She winked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Okay, warrior woman.\u201d Actually, there was something to what she said. She did have training he hadn\u2019t given as much thought to as he should. She could fight her stalker, maybe better than he could right now with his exhausted body. God, he needed a nap, but she\u2019d been all psyched up to go car shopping and he wasn\u2019t letting her out of the house without him or one of her flyboy buddies.</p><p>He shifted in his seat, his legs protesting\u2014loud\u2014at the lack of space. He needed a half hour of Jacuzzi jets massaging his sore muscles. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious as to what I\u2019ve determined?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell.\u201d She pulled off the access road into the auto-mall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared of car dealers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d Poorly masking her distaste, she stared at the line of dealerships proclaiming holiday sales, multicolor triangular flags flapping in the wind.</p><p>\u201cThen why ask me along?\u201d</p><p>Her knuckles went white, her jaw set, she put the car in park. \u201cBecause you\u2019re supposed to be watching out for me and making this stalker guy think I have a big-ass tenant. And by big-ass, I do mean that you are being an ass today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy thank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d He\u2019d forgotten how prickly women could be. Living alone in a cave had its appeal. Well, except for the no sex and soft womanly curves part. \u201cI do believe we may have more in common than we thought.\u201d</p><p>Her baby-blues eyes went wide. \u201cDid you just insult me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou insulted me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s mature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore and more in common by the second.\u201d</p><p>That spurred a laugh from her, something he enjoyed doing more and more by the hour, enough that it took his mind off his legs for the moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I brought you along because, yes, it will be easier to work with the car dealer if you\u2019re here.\u201d She held up one finger, firmly. \u201cI have absolutely no doubt that I could get the same deal on my own, but it would take longer and be far more exhausting than if I just let you two men do your grunt, grunt, bump chests, circle the fire, macho thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, now that I\u2019m clear on my role.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cUgh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She gave him a regal nod. \u201cHere are some examples of the car I\u2019m looking for, with my hopeful price listed as well as my absolute top-dollar price.\u201d</p><p>Nola passed him a flyer insert from the Saturday paper with three cars circled in red marker, with her notations alongside.</p><p>As they made their way to the dealer of her choice, he asked questions concerning loan lengths and payments until he had a firm grasp of what she wanted. He even did his best not to roll his eyes when she specified color\u2014why was car color so important to women? Must be like the potpourri thing. And maybe somewhat like how he hated bargaining while on crutches.</p><p>Three haggling hours later, he\u2019d landed the deal she wanted, closer to the wish price than the top-dollar price. All they needed was the bank okay to clear the loan and she could turn in the rental for her spiffy new convertible.</p><p>Damn, he felt as if he\u2019d speared the wooly mammoth to haul back to the cave, and double damned if he hadn\u2019t forgotten about his aching legs for more than thirty seconds. Not an evolved kind of thought by a long shot, and surely she would laugh and label it another \u201cugh\u201d moment. Thing was, her laugh would spark another chest-thumping thrill of victory in him.</p><p>What was it about this woman? She could take care of herself, manage this on her own and yet here he sat, waiting to help her.</p><p>There was...something about her.</p><p>Something that made him want to share the Jacuzzi with her for more than sex, but with champagne and strawberries while her laughter rolled with the bubbles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The returning salesperson popped that fantasy faster than any cork.</p><p>\u201cUm, Captain Seabrook, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a problem with your loan application.\u201d</p><p>Back home, Nola stared at her computer screen with disbelief.</p> <p>Still, there was no denying what she saw. Her bank account was empty. Her savings account\u2014also zilch. Her credit cards all canceled.</p><p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>Her fingers hovering over the keyboard, her hands shook as she studied the mess of her financial life.</p><p>She spun in the office chair to face Rick in the extra chair beside her. \u201cAny other ideas I might have overlooked?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his five o\u2019clock shadow. \u201cYou\u2019re a computer whiz lady. Appears to me like you\u2019ve covered every angle here. This guy must be damn good. Still, there\u2019s always a path. I\u2019m sure the bank will be able to straighten this out fairly quickly. There are safeguards out there against identity theft.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd there are nightmare stories about people who never recover from the financial damage.\u201d Her throat started to close up as her mind traveled the path of all the bills she had to meet and couldn\u2019t...</p><p>\u201cNola, breathe. Think.\u201d His hand rubbed along her back. \u201cThis could also be a way to track the person who\u2019s been tormenting you.\u201d</p><p>She sagged back into the wheeled office chair. This totally sucked. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I just feel so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed off!\u201d She kicked back from the desk, in need of distance. It would be too easy to move closer to him again and continue to take that comfort.</p><p>\u201cAtta girl.\u201d</p> <p>And somehow that distance made things worse because she wanted to move closer. This stalker creep had her really on edge. \u201cAnd yeah, violated, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have every right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is so screwed up. This has gotten to the point where they\u2019re going to take me off flying status until things are settled. I just know it because what normal person could think straight right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit focusing on what you can\u2019t do and let\u2019s think about what we can. We can notify the police right away to file a complaint to add to your case. And after Thanksgiving, having the Air Force\u2019s OSI\u2014\u201d Office of Special Investigation \u201c\u2014check into things could be a valuable extra civilians don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d She hated feeling so under a microscope again. She needed to think about something else\u2014anything else. \u201cDid you get settled in with everything rehab wise here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have to go twice a week now. No big deal. The rest is on my own. My disability pay meets the bills, but once we nab this guy of yours, I\u2019m gonna have to start thinking about something to do so I don\u2019t go stir-crazy.\u201d</p><p>She started to ask him what might interest him, but all the memories from her divorce came slamming back down on her. She\u2019d fallen so short of the mark in being supportive for a man she\u2019d claimed to love. How could she be sure she would say the right thing here and now?</p><p>And with those kind of thoughts kicking around in her head, the last thing she needed was to dive back in for a repeat of that kiss, no matter how much her body screamed, \u201cGo for it!\u201d</p> <p>She would stand a better chance at success untangling her messed-up finances.</p><p>Rick popped the DVD into Nola\u2019s player and hoped the movie would help her think about something tonight other than the ill-fated car shopping spree. Since tomorrow was Thanksgiving, nothing could be done until banks reopened on Friday. And probably nothing would be solved until the following week.</p><p>At least they had gotten the report filed with the police to add in with her other information about the stalker.</p><p>He wished he could do better for her than supply the turkey and entertainment, but at least he had an ATM card and a full bank account. There hadn\u2019t been many movies left at the video store by the time he\u2019d talked her into abandoning the computer and making some Thanksgiving plans. So they\u2019d opted for old mysteries.</p><p>Rick commandeered the remote and hit Play, grabbing hold of the chair as he made his way slowly back to the froufy-poofy sofa to sit beside her. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something about the size of your TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the size of my television?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a magnifying glass to see the screen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cbut twenty-seven inches is plenty respectable. I assume you\u2019re one of those wide-screen plasma guys.\u201d</p><p>He grunted a respectable ugh.</p><p>\u201cNow thump your chest. Come on. Give it a good thump along with that grunt.\u201d</p><p>Rick pitched a handful of popcorn in his mouth and fought back the urge to, to...what? Kiss her again? No. More than that he wanted to charge out of here and set things right for her. Instead, he was stuck watching freaking movies and eating chestnut stuffing for the next thirty-six or so hours. But then, keeping her calm had to count for something.</p><p>Damn. He was now her babysitter.</p><p>She had to hate that as much as he\u2019d hated having sitters. Must be the holiday making him so morbid. And the phone call he had to make.</p><p>He looked forward to talking to his daughter...and he didn\u2019t. He would have to lie. That was never fun.</p><p>Not much longer, he promised himself.</p><p>\u201cQuarter for \u2019em.\u201d Nola\u2019s voice cut through.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cQuarter for your thoughts. I figured a penny would only buy me a grunt, what with the way prices have gone up and such. So I hedged my bets with a twenty-five cent request.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of a reason not to tell her. \u201cI have a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty blue eyes blinked fast. She seemed surprised. \u201cOh, I imagine I should have guessed... There\u2019s no reason I shouldn\u2019t have... Um, oh. Anyhow. How old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a picture?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his wallet from his back jeans pocket and flipped it open to one of Lauren a year ago. Poor kid looked like him. He thought she was perfect and knew she would grow into a stunning woman, but his ex had let him know all about Lauren\u2019s self-image struggles\u2014which always translated into requests for more money for a beauty treatment or clothes to make Lauren feel better about herself.</p><p>He thought backing off and letting the kid be a kid would make her feel better. But what did he know?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to beat the boys off with a stick,\u201d Nola proclaimed and won a piece of his heart for seeing his kid the way he did.</p><p>How interesting that Nola could see what Lauren\u2019s own mother couldn\u2019t. \u201cNot as effective as I used to be with the intimidation factor, but yeah, I think I can keep my daughter safe.\u201d</p><p>Or he intended to be able to soon. Focus, dude. Focus.</p><p>She passed his wallet back. \u201cYou must have been young when you had her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay and I got married right out of high school.\u201d He tucked the folded leather into his back jeans pocket and tried not to think about the fact that he\u2019d added a condom to his wallet again this past week.</p><p>\u201cYou worked through college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us did. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d Not by a long shot. But they\u2019d had a lot in common then, same background and family friends. He still didn\u2019t understand what had gone wrong, other than too much time apart. And if he couldn\u2019t understand, then how could he try again? Damn. \u201cWe knew the odds were against us from the start. Then the TDYs piled on and Lindsay met someone else. I\u2019d seen it happen so many times to my pals and still I was surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hurt.\u201d</p><p>Only a robot wouldn\u2019t be hurt when a marriage fell apart and as much as he tried to keep his feelings in check, he was far from robotic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I overstepped there. I\u2019ve been in the divorce war trenches... Well, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. We stopped loving each other a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>She peered down into the bowl as if searching for answers under the pile of popcorn. Finally, she spoke again. \u201cSo tell me more about your daughter.\u201d</p><p>He was embarrassed to admit how little he knew about Lauren. He vowed to make things better... except he\u2019d been vowing that for a long time. Another example of how he sucked at relationships.</p><p>Nola looked up from the bowl. \u201cIs that sacred territory, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t get to see each other all that often.\u201d</p><p>Her pretty arched brows rose.</p><p>\u201cYou disapprove.\u201d And who did she think she was to pass judgment?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to say. I don\u2019t know your life. I\u2019m not a parent.\u201d</p><p>Damn straight. Except she was right.</p><p>\u201cBut you obviously have an opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m of the opinion that you are hogging the bowl of popcorn. Pass it over or pay the fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fine?\u201d Thank God they\u2019d left the other discussion behind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be doing the dishes for the rest of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m recovering from serious injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem totally able-bodied to me.\u201d</p><p>He snitched the bowl from her lap. \u201cTyrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopcorn hog.\u201d</p><p>He scooped kernels up and brought two to her lips. Slowly, she opened and let him feed her. Holy crap. He recognized an invitation when he saw one.</p><p>While she chewed, he kept his fingers against her lips, his eyes locked on hers. Less than a week and they were already getting this close. There was no question that they were headed for n**ed pretty soon. If not tonight, then sometime in the very near future.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure about the wariness in her eyes. Because of the stalker maybe? Hell, he would just have to dig deep for sensitivity and ask. Maybe he would kiss her first and knock down a few more walls and years between them.</p><p>As soon as he formed the thought, a ringing jarred him out of the sensual haze.</p><p>Her phone?</p><p>No. His cell. Rick blinked fast twice. He reached into his pocket for his cell phone. He glanced at the faceplate...Lauren.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nola.\u201d He shuffled the bowl of popcorn to the coffee table. \u201cI really have to take this call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Please, go ahead.\u201d She hit Pause on the remote and grabbed the bowl on her way off the sofa and toward the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ll make more popcorn.\u201d</p><p>Fear. He saw flat-out fear in the woman\u2019s eyes as she backed away from him. He\u2019d been in combat with enough people to recognize the emotion when confronted with it.</p><p>What had happened to her during the past five years? And why was she so frightened of him, a man she\u2019d known all of a few days?</p><p>A few very intense days and sexual nights.</p><p>He could only deal with one crisis at a time, starting with the one in his hand. \u201cYeah, hello, Lauren. Happy Thanksgiving, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Lauren? Who was Lauren?</p><p>Wait. Nola stomped down the initial flash of jealousy she had no business feeling after knowing this man only a few days and thought through the snippets of conversation she couldn\u2019t help but overhear. She forced her feet to keep on carrying her across the living room, through the dining area toward the kitchen.</p><p>He had called Lauren \u201ckiddo.\u201d This must be the daughter he mentioned.</p><p>Emotions tangled in Nola\u2019s stomach like two silver dog tag chains clenched too tightly in a fist. Her feet slowing, she willed her stomach to settle and worked to untwine the emotions so she could understand her feelings.</p><p>She\u2019d learned the benefit of exploring the causes behind emotions during the darkest months of battle with her disease. Sometimes the process of digging for root causes only unearthed stark fears she couldn\u2019t help. But other times, she\u2019d excavated more tangible concerns that she could combat on a concrete level.</p><p>Struggling to recapture the tactic, she realized that relief emerged first, an obvious reaction. Rick wasn\u2019t speaking to another woman. She didn\u2019t have a claim or right to feel that way, but emotions weren\u2019t logical. So there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then? The next silver chain... Far more intricate.</p><p>He had a child with his ex-wife. Nola pressed a hand to her stomach, less clenched but totally churning. She\u2019d come to peace\u2014at least somewhat\u2014with the fact that she wouldn\u2019t have children. Her insides had been so fried from the radiation. She could have had eggs frozen and stored...she\u2019d considered it, and finally been too emotional to make any more decisions.</p><p>She\u2019d been certain she wouldn\u2019t marry again. Even facing life had been more than she could envision and if\u2014a big if, that scared her to even consider\u2014if she lived, a career was all she could consider.</p> <p>So here she stood, with her career rock solid and a hot man in her house, a man who attracted her big-time. Yet she couldn\u2019t bring herself to make a move for something she obviously wanted.</p><p>Sheesh. She\u2019d faced combat in Iraq. Even been taken prisoner by an arms dealer during a mission gone rogue in South America. Still, here she was running from a man she\u2019d already had wild monkey sex with, just because he might give her a warm wonderful kiss tasting of butter and blessed promise.</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d His voice drifted from the other room. \u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Nola hooked her shaking fingers in her back pockets. The kid deal definitely freaked her out. He was a father. That put him in a new light, one that scared her. Why, she didn\u2019t know since she didn\u2019t want long-term.</p><p>Good golly, what a mess she made.</p> <p>He cupped his hand over the phone. \u201cNola, could we put our conversation on hold for a few? It\u2019s my daughter, Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. She hadn\u2019t realized she still stood in the kitchen doorway and he must want privacy. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d left. Yipes. This guy robbed her of awareness of her surroundings, a spooky thought for an independent woman who prided herself on her self-control.</p><p>From the sofa, Rick stared at Nola in the doorway and wondered who she\u2019d thought he was speaking to. He didn\u2019t have time to think that one through at the moment. His daughter\u2019s tone set off alarms in his head.</p><p>Either way, Nola was hotfooting it into the kitchen as if she couldn\u2019t get away from him fast enough and Lauren was waiting on the other end of the line.</p><p>Rick slid his hand from the phone. \u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Lauren? Everything okay?\u201d he asked again, totally unsettled by the quiver in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSure, why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound so good, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just wondering where you are.\u201d</p><p>How strange that she would ask. She never asked, trained from the cradle to know that her military father often couldn\u2019t say where he\u2019d gone. He hadn\u2019t even told his ex about his medical retirement from the service, only that he\u2019d been injured, not how seriously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Charleston, South Carolina.\u201d There couldn\u2019t be any harm in telling her that much.</p><p>She would assume he was TDY to the base there, perhaps on his way out to another assignment. He would explain more soon.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I\u2019d like to write to you, if you don\u2019t mind. Could I have an address?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I\u2019ve got some things from school and all I want to share. Please, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>There couldn\u2019t be any harm in giving her a snail mail address. It seemed petty to hold back. He\u2019d given his kid so little. \u201cSure, kiddo. I\u2019m staying with a friend. But I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least for a week, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least a week, and I\u2019ll leave a forwarding address.\u201d</p><p>Where would he go after that? His mind actually wandered down paths of what-if he hung around here. Lauren would enjoy coming to Charleston. Teens were lured by beaches, right?</p><p>Had it been over a year since he\u2019d seen her? What a crummy excuse for a father. He\u2019d gone that long before because of deployments and he\u2019d worked his ass off to make it up to her when he\u2019d returned.</p><p>He would do the same soon when he was steadily on his two feet again and had an equally steady vision for his future. She deserved a real father.</p><p>There had to be a reason she called. Holidays? He didn\u2019t think so since he always did come through with the holiday calls. \u201cIs there a particular reason for this conversation? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her deep breath rattled through the airwaves, building until the words seemed to roll free from her. \u201cDaddy, Mom\u2019s getting married again to this total dweeb. I can\u2019t stand living with them anymore. It\u2019s going to make me freaking insane if I have to listen to him call Mom \u2018sugar pie\u2019 one more time. Please, I want to come live with you.\u201d</p><p>Sugar pie? Lindsay had obviously found the tenderness she\u2019d always claimed Rick lacked. He was glad for her. That part of the conversation didn\u2019t bother him\u2014beyond reminding him what crap material he was in the relationship department.</p><p>He needed to focus on the important fact here. Lauren wanted to live with him. Now.</p><p>And just that fast, the few props he\u2019d managed to rebuild cracked in two. He heard her request and all the pain in Lauren\u2019s voice as loud and clear as when she\u2019d fallen off her bike at seven.</p><p>Sure he wanted to be the kind of parent his kid could count on to tend to those wounds life inflicted on a regular basis. But he knew straight up, he wasn\u2019t anywhere near ready to be the father his daughter needed.</p><p>\u201cHappy Thanksgiving,\u201d Nola whispered softly, guessing Rick was awake, too, but keeping her voice low in case she was wrong.</p><p>\u201cHappy Thanksgiving,\u201d Rick answered, a large shadow in the moonlit double bed across the garage apartment. He sprawled on his back, hands under his head, chest stretching his brown military T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay with you?\u201d Nola asked from the sofa bed. She tucked her Laura Ashley comforter up under her chin. She might be on a pullout sofa bed, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to leave her froufrou behind, the pampering that made her feel sensually a woman.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fine.\u201d The deep timbre of his voice rumbled across the room and over her heightened senses deprived of full sight.</p><p>\u201cFinished all your prayers?\u201d Prodding him to keep talking might be reckless. She should cocoon herself in her covers and fake sleep until reality took over. A wise woman would. But her usual wisdom rarely came into play around this fellow.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Now I lay me down to sleep\u2019 and the whole bit.\u201d</p><p>More of that rumbly voice of his wrapped around her with more comfort than any luxury spread. She missed those late-night exchanges in the dark and couldn\u2019t resist continuing the conversation. \u201cDid you used to say that with your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was around, which wasn\u2019t often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo make up for it now. You\u2019ve got time on your hands and a full disability paycheck to cover expenses.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and hugged her knees. And yes, she couldn\u2019t deny how much more wonderful it would be to have his arms around her instead. So why was she risking putting more space between them by venturing into the dangerous terrain of giving him parenting advice when she knew it could put them at odds? But his strained relationship with his daughter seemed too important to tiptoe around.</p><p>His feet flexed and stretched rhythmically under the covers.</p><p>Why, she wondered for a moment, then realized his legs must be bothering him. He must have pushed himself pumping those weights in the dining area. He pushed himself with everything. She\u2019d noticed all the little repairs around her house...the door that didn\u2019t squeak anymore. The faucet no longer dripping. A nail on the stairs that didn\u2019t protrude.</p><p>Every time she took a shower or did anything out of his sight, she found something else fixed in her home. The man never rested and apparently his healing body was paying the price.</p><p>He hitched another pillow under his head. \u201cYou\u2019re full of advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwelcome advice by the sound of your voice.\u201d Her chin fell to rest on her knees.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bite your head off.\u201d</p><p>No wonder he flexed his feet\u2014to stretch out his calf muscles. He couldn\u2019t sleep because of the pain racked up from helping her. She\u2019d meant to help him by freeing him from the rehab center he\u2019d so obviously resented.</p><p>Guilt prickled over her. Maybe he\u2019d been better off there with the more assertive care. She\u2019d been so caught up in her car hunting and then her financial mortification\u2014not to mention the whole stalker creepiness\u2014she\u2019d selfishly forgotten that Rick needed to take care of himself. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPushed a little hard. No big deal. I\u2019ll be fine in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She flexed her own healthy toes under and thought of all the times she\u2019d come home from the hospital after radiation, sick as a dog with no one to hold her after she emptied her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m being a bad babysitter then, if you\u2019ve pushed yourself too hard. I really didn\u2019t mean for you to do so much for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult. I know my limits. You\u2019re not responsible for me.\u201d</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t, and he wasn\u2019t responsible for her. They were two loners here together, both of them damaged and wounded, alone to heal, alone for the holidays, for some reason unable to resist taking care of each other now.</p><p>Unable to resist each other. Period.</p><p>Maybe it was the holiday sentimentality. Maybe it was logic or the memories of how amazingly they\u2019d come together before with such compelling combustion. Regardless, time to quit fighting the inevitable.</p><p>She flung aside her comforter and swung her feet to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be taking the place of your nurse. That\u2019s why they let you out of the place, because you were in my care.\u201d</p><p>Conscious of her pajamas, even if they were simply running shorts and a T-shirt with no bra, she made her way across the room and sat gingerly on the edge of his bed.</p><p>Rick went still. Overly so. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>His words carried a wealth of meaning beyond the simple massage of aching muscles. By sitting on the bed with him, she knew she would be crossing a line.</p><p>She rested her hands on the bedspread over his feet, committing herself to the cause by pushing the boundary a little more. Even with covers between him and her, still the jolt of awareness made her shivery all over. \u201cI want to massage your legs for you, if you\u2019ll let me. I want to be here.\u201d</p><p>In bed with him.</p><p>Rick went completely immobile under her touch. He reached out to halt her hand in place so she touched him through the covers, but couldn\u2019t venture further. \u201cI like what you\u2019re doing a helluva lot, Nola, but we both know it would be wiser for me to climb into a Jacuzzi tub instead.\u201d</p><p>Wiser? Who cared about wisdom when it was guts she\u2019d been lacking lately? She needed to take a chance. Gamble with life\u2014her heart\u2014the way that fully healthy people did.</p><p>\u201cI have one in the main house if you would prefer.\u201d Still she didn\u2019t move away.</p><p>Neither did he, fingers gentle and warm on her skin. \u201cI want to know what you prefer and I guess I need to hear why. No pity.\u201d</p><p>She took that as consent to continue. Talk about serious tummy flutter. Time to make the move and climb in bed with a man again after five years.</p><p>\u201cI can assure you that pity has nothing to do with what I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d She sat on the edge, convenient, since her legs weren\u2019t all that steady. Just a few inches of shared mattress, but so damn intimate it thickened the blood in her veins.</p><p>He released his hold on her hand and trailed a broad fingertip up her arm. Before she knew it, her hands were moving, too. Covers still shielded him from her touch. Not that it mattered. Her hands still tingled from the heat of want. Nola squeezed, gently at first, watching his face for signs of pain, seeing none, then working with firmer pressure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slid her hands under the covers to his legs, finding bare skin. Warm flesh that sent prickles of awareness through her fingertips. Traveling higher, she met ridges of scar tissue that in no way detracted from the moment, only made him more human. More of a man, honed in the fiery trials of life. \u201cI do understand your situation better than you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Now she realized the time had come for her to tell him about her injuries...her scars, external and deeper. For so long she hadn\u2019t told people because it seemed none of their business, but perhaps she\u2019d used that as an excuse to dodge thinking about what she\u2019d been through.</p><p>It seemed the most natural thing in the world to say to Rick, \u201cBefore we go any further\u2014and I believe we both know this is going further\u2014there\u2019s something you need to know.\u201d</p> <p>He eased back to look in her eyes. \u201cSheesh, lady, you sound so serious.\u201d</p><p>She tried to offer him a smile. And failed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to say it, so here goes.\u201d She finally told him what she hadn\u2019t told another man in bed. \u201cI\u2019m a breast cancer survivor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Of all the things Rick had been expecting to hear from Nola, \u201cbreast cancer survivor\u201d wouldn\u2019t have even appeared on the list.</p> <p>He had figured from her serious expression she wanted to share something big, but holy crap... Right now, he sure could use some of those psychologically sensitive and appropriate catch phrases. Because it was really important he say the right thing to this woman who\u2019d said more right things to him than anyone in his life.</p><p>Rick rested a hand on her arm, keeping the touch simple, not certain if she wanted a full-out hug, deciding it was best to wait on that one rather than risk pushing too hard. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a conversational jump, but thank you for trusting me.\u201d</p><p>She kept massaging his legs and watching him through narrowed wary eyes. \u201cIs that some kind of counseling talk from your rehab days?\u201d</p><p>He offered her his best charming smile and hoped like hell his best was good enough. \u201cI\u2019m trying my ass off for the right reply here, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about quit trying and just say what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d She slid her hands from beneath the covers and folded them in her lap. \u201cI really hate it when people treat me with antiseptic correctness. I\u2019ve had more than a bellyful of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that, I can identify with. So what am I thinking?\u201d He sat upright and took her hands in his. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019re an even stronger and more amazing lady than I knew.\u201d</p> <p>She met his eyes dead on with a bravado that seemed a hint forced. \u201cI\u2019m also a lady who doesn\u2019t look the same without her clothes as the last time you saw me.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now he saw where this was leading a bit more clearly, and it also explained the mystery about differences in her figure. \u201cYou had a mastectomy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a mastectomy, along with reconstruction, but I\u2019m not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of us is.\u201d And that was the God\u2019s honest truth.</p><p>She avoided his eyes, her gaze skipping around and finally landing somewhere around the door\u2014away from him. \u201cThat weekend we met, it was my last time before...\u201d</p><p>Holy crap. No wonder she was eyeing the door. This was a heavy-duty admission that probably had her yearning to run. Or at least considering the possibility. The weight of what she\u2019d shared settled over him heavier than any of these overstuffed comforters she seemed to prefer.</p><p>He\u2019d been the last man she\u2019d made love with before her mastectomy.</p><p>Along with the weight of that responsibility came an understanding of why she\u2019d left so abruptly with no word five years ago. She could have told him and he would have tried to be understanding, but they hadn\u2019t built any kind of relationship that would have called for him to stand by her side throughout. Yet he would have felt... Obligated? Yeah, definitely drawn at least to see her through the surgery and she would have hated that.</p> <p>She\u2019d used him...and he couldn\u2019t blame her a bit.</p><p>He scavenged deep for something sensitive to say. \u201cI\u2019m honored that you chose me to be with that weekend.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her body a sexy shadow in the moonlit room. She tugged her hands free and he wondered what her verdict would be on his attempt at sensitivity. Finally, she scooched to sit cross-legged, taking his feet into her lap and resuming her massage.</p><p>He exhaled. He must have passed her test. She may or may not be ready for sex, but she wasn\u2019t running for the door.</p><p>He let her fingers soothe him, but his mind still hopped with thoughts about how this new information fit into the relationship they\u2019d settled into, a relationship on the verge of changing.</p><p>Was he ready to sleep with her? Hell, yeah. But should he be having sexual thoughts when a woman just admitted something so darkly personal?</p><p>Still, she looked so right in his bed with her tousled blond curls, her long legs stretching from those shorts, legs he could already imagine wrapped around his waist.</p><p>And her whispery thin T-shirt. Yeah, he could imagine tugging that off, the trust that would come with that and them pressing skin to skin, scars and all, because, heaven knew, he brought his fair share to the party.</p><p>So yes, he wanted to sleep with her, but would take his cue from her and respect whatever she wanted. Most of all, he would pray like crazy that if she did want to sleep with him he could handle things with a sensitivity his ex-wife swore he didn\u2019t possess.</p><p>No thoughts of the past. Focus on the present. The new people he and Nola had become. And the new Nola was giving his legs the most amazing and healing massage.</p><p>How did she know exactly the right pressure to exert? He leaned back on his hands and watched her. Those hospital techs could take lessons from her.</p><p>She slid her soft fingers higher to his knee, firm, sure. Sensual. \u201cWell, don\u2019t get your ego too inflated by my choice. It actually had more to do with the push-ups than your looks. In my crazy messed-up mind, I wanted somebody mega healthy, as if that would make me healthier.\u201d</p><p>Was it her way of saying he was out of the running now? His ego pinched at that. Which pissed him off and made him want to push his legs to the limit, pump some weights, turn her head.</p><p>Then turn her down.</p><p>Whoa. Hold on. He needed to get his ego the hell out of this. He took a mental step back and looked more objectively into her eyes and yeah, he saw it, the deep defensiveness. A protective wall already erected to guard herself against possible rejection.</p><p>With an intuitiveness he never would have had five years ago, he knew. That ex-husband of hers had done one helluva number on her. And with a further insight, Rick suspected she hadn\u2019t been with anyone since. The thought seemed improbable. Five years without sex...</p><p>Rick stared into her eyes. He\u2019d gotten better about that, trying to sense emotions rather than just the physical. He couldn\u2019t dodge the notion that he would be her first since the surgery...which hell...meant... \u201cIs this your first time since we were together?\u201d</p><p>She simply nodded.</p><p>Wow. Talk about pressure to perform.</p><p>Hold on. This was about her. Suddenly he didn\u2019t worry so much about his own legs and what she might think about his differences between then and now. It wasn\u2019t about then for either of them. They were both different people, physically and emotionally.</p><p>He figured the best course of action now was to stay silent and let her talk rather than risk saying something wrong. Besides, her massage felt damn good after so long without a woman\u2019s touch.</p><p>\u201cEven after the doctor told me the results of the biopsy I still couldn\u2019t believe it was true. You know? There\u2019s this surreal feel to things, like you\u2019re stuck in a tunnel and if you hold your breath and blink you\u2019ll be back in the sunlight again.\u201d</p><p>He understood well the need to be back in the light, the sky, the feeling of freedom he\u2019d only ever found in his job. A fulfillment in bringing someone home.</p><p>Where would he ever find that now? At thirty-six years old, he faced the rest of his life with nothing matching up. A darkness so deep, he didn\u2019t know how to claw his way out.</p><p>\u201cI just focused on getting home so I could curl up against my husband. He would put his arms around me. And yeah, I would hold my breath and blink my eyes. Then things would be okay again.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. He couldn\u2019t change the past\u2014and he couldn\u2019t beat up the bastard who\u2019d hurt her all those years ago\u2014but Rick could offer her comfort now, even if it came years too late. He scooped her up from the foot of the bed and draped her over his lap, tucking her head under his chin. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have the address of your ex-husband handy so I could deliver an ass kicking?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, just a little and a bit tight, but a welcome sound. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t tempted. But for the most part I\u2019m over that. My ex wasn\u2019t a totally crass ass. He did hug me, but I could feel his distance. He wasn\u2019t okay with this. The first round of treatments, they removed the tumor and did radiation. To his credit, he stuck it out through that before filing for divorce. But when the cancer came back and the docs insisted on a mastectomy, I was a single woman on my own.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her tousled hair calling to his fingers as strongly as the tears he wished he could have wiped away for her then. He indulged himself and smoothed her hair, held her closer, dropped a kiss on top of her forehead.</p><p>Nola wrapped her arms around his waist. \u201cWell, not totally on my own, because you were there TDY on a weekend that meant more to me than months of fake forced support from my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up. Met his gaze. Held. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been thanked countless times by people he\u2019d rescued in the field. Thanked in other languages. Even had a couple of kids named after him. Only now did he realize how he\u2019d taken those two words for granted. Somehow he\u2019d grown numb to the impact, the power, the emotional weight of those two simple words, only to have them slam into his chest now when he didn\u2019t deserve them.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t give me credit for that.\u201d He\u2019d been an arrogant cuss enjoying a weekend with a gorgeous woman. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>Her hands smoothed over his face in sensual strokes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve learned that character is so deeply ingrained in a person...it\u2019s just something you sense or you don\u2019t.\u201d She cocked her head to the side and winked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it in spades, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He wished he had her faith in him, because he wanted to be the man she envisioned. This woman saw needs where he hadn\u2019t ever realized they existed. Too easily he could get used to being around her. Too easily he could take advantage. What did he have to offer her?</p><p>He could be there now for what her fool of a husband hadn\u2019t been there for five years ago. All right, so he would forge ahead. \u201cDo you want to tell me more? I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time under the knife so there\u2019s not much that can surprise me.\u201d</p><p>A long breath shuddered through her so hard it gusted over him. \u201cI think I do, uh, want to tell you, if you don\u2019t mind. But I need you to stay where you are, okay?\u201d</p><p>Rick tucked her head against his chest, under his chin and held her tight. \u201cCan do.\u201d</p><p>Her arms slid around his waist and held so tight it damn near broke his heart. \u201cI had stage two cancer. It hadn\u2019t moved to the lymph nodes, which was a blessing, but the tumor was so large and aggressive I needed both radiation and chemotherapy.\u201d</p><p>Nola plucked at one of the curls teasing around her ear. \u201cThe curls are new. They came when my hair grew back.\u201d</p><p>The thought of her going through all of that alone was more than he could take. He smoothed a hand over those new curls of hers and wished he could have cupped her head when she\u2019d lost her straighter hair and told her she was beautiful then, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRick, if we\u2019re still going to get n**ed together, I should probably prepare you. The doctors did reconstruction called a tram flap where they take tissue from my stomach to rebuild the breast. They also rebuilt the nipple and tattooed a simulated areola, but it doesn\u2019t look the same. There are scars that run\u2014\u201d</p><p>He tipped her face up to his and brushed her mouth with his. \u201cNola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to scare me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Her voice faltered. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re too smart. Yeah, if I frighten you away then I don\u2019t have to do this thing that\u2019s scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to, but I promise you, you could never be anything but beautiful to me. I have many flaws, but I don\u2019t make promises I can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>And he would make sure he gave her everything he could. He needed to be that man for her tonight. Because all doubts aside, they were going to make love.</p><p>Rick hefted her off his lap and set her beside him. He reached over to click on the bedside lamp, the light casting a hazy, but unmistakable glow over the room. Then he swept aside the covers, his running shorts leaving his ankle on display. His scars on display. A crisscross of red, corded lines from when he\u2019d first stepped through the soggy, rotten wood.</p> <p>\u201cSo, lady, what do ya say\u2014I\u2019ll show you mine if you\u2019ll show me yours?\u201d</p><p>Show hers?</p><p>Nola struggled not to bolt off the bed at Rick\u2019s proposition. The words most definitely would have sent her running for the hills just yesterday. But somehow, Rick had injected just the right amount of humor blended with the reality and yes, even his own vulnerability by showing his scarred leg first.</p><p>She\u2019d been so certain five years ago she needed health and vitality and yet he seemed no less vital now. In fact, seemed stronger somehow for having overcome so much.</p><p>And hey, wasn\u2019t that a revelation for herself?</p><p>If she believed that for him, then she deserved to take ownership of the same for herself. Strength from survival.</p> <p>Her chin went up as her hands traveled to the hem of her tank top, peeling it over her head until she wore only her second tank with spaghetti straps and a built-in bra.</p><p>She\u2019d opted for smaller br**sts during the reconstruction, easier to feel for recurring lumps. That involved reduction on her unaffected breast. And yes, maybe she\u2019d also wanted to make sure any future guy who expressed a physical interest wasn\u2019t a \u201cbreast man.\u201d Lord, she was a mess.</p><p>Just get it over with. Her trembling hands went back to the hem...</p><p>Rick\u2019s hands covered hers. \u201cHold on. This isn\u2019t a race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I understand. All right.\u201d She exhaled a mega sigh of relief. \u201cWait. No, I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe forgot something important here in the need to put the cards on the table, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>She waited, fingers twisting in the hem of her pink ribbed tank, nerves making her even edgier than the bout of lust she\u2019d been battling all evening. \u201cWhat might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForeplay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForeplay.\u201d She shivered in anticipation\u2014and remembrance of their last time together. The fella was good at the foreplay. Lucky her. Lucky them. \u201cI guess it\u2019s been so long I forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never forget about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She grinned weakly. Trust was more difficult that she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Oh. Hopefully there will be some ohs, too.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Laughed? She totally hadn\u2019t expected good old-fashioned giggles in the bedroom when she finally jumped back into sex again. How had Rick managed that? Another wonderful thing about this man. He had such an ease about him, no matter what life dealt.</p><p>He swept the comforter to the floor until they were left with only each other and a tangle of legs in a floral sheet. His legs stretched the length in running shorts, scars crisscrossing over around his ankles, running thick and corded up his right leg, thinner with more precision on his left knee.</p><p>All red and angry.</p><p>But that would fade with time, she reminded herself. She knew too well from experience. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a rough year.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tipped in a wry smile. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re even stronger than I realized when I saw you in the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a way with words, lady. I\u2019m not sure I agree, but thanks for saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a way with the truth.\u201d She rested her hands on his thighs, running her thumbs down steely muscles.</p><p>He rested his hands on top of hers. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough for me tonight. Now tell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>What did she want? Total dark would be nice, to settle the nerves buzzing around like untrained newbie pilots in her stomach, but that was the coward\u2019s way out. She needed to dive in. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be on top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an Abbot and Costello question?\u201d Sliding his hands from hers, Rick lounged back against the headboard. He grinned that craggy smile that blew cobwebs out of corners with its sheer power.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone besides you who brought humor into the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Not that she had that much experience beyond him, but sex with her husband had been such a serious business. And her mind was rambling away from her again to avoid the present.</p><p>Rick unfolded his hands from behind his head and gripped her waist, hefting her up. \u201cHow about we\u2019re both on top?\u201d</p><p>He settled her on his lap so she knelt.</p><p>\u201cComfy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d She adjusted her legs and leaned against him, chest to chest, the core of her nestling against his erection with tantalizing friction even through their clothing.</p><p>Gripping the hem of his brown T-shirt, she inched the worn fabric up and over his honed chest, a very familiar chest. This part of him she remembered well. She whipped the fabric over his head and flung it across the room.</p><p>Nola flattened her palms to the broad expanse of muscles. A sigh puffed from her mouth. His pecs twitched in response.</p><p>Her fingers fisted. \u201cOkay, so now it\u2019s the show mine time. Right?\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, pressing his mouth to hers. \u201cShh. Remember? There\u2019s no timetable here.\u201d He nipped her mouth. \u201cNo rush.\u201d Kissed her again. \u201cWe can keep doing this.\u201d Deepened the contact, tongues touching. \u201cFor as long as you want.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tangled in her hair, he kissed her with a leisure she remembered from dating days, courting. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really mean we could just make out all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d His mouth continued to work over her skin while his hands explored.</p><p>\u201cBut I want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. I want all of you.\u201d He eased back to look at her again. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not ready, then it\u2019s not equal and I\u2019m all about equality here.\u201d</p><p>She rested her forehead against his. \u201cWhat if I said I wanted to leave my tank top on?\u201d</p><p>His exhale swirled between them and she wondered what she would do if he gave her an ultimatum. Except she also wondered how she would feel if he seemed grateful for the out. Oh my, there went those silver chains of emotion tangling up in her stomach again.</p><p>He slipped his hands just under the hem of her tank top, stroking along her midriff. \u201cI realize we haven\u2019t known each other long enough for you to have any reason to give me that level of trust, but I would be lying if I said I wouldn\u2019t be disappointed if you backed out on letting us come together, totally bare.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched, she started to talk, but he pressed his mouth to hers to silence her.</p><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019ll be more disappointed if we don\u2019t do this at all. So bottom line, I\u2019ll take you any way that I can have you.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Wow. His turning over of control to her helped in a way she hadn\u2019t expected. His understanding turned the tide for her. She nodded. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, oh so slowly, he tunneled his hands up the back of her shirt. She\u2019d been prepared for him to go straight for the gusto; she relaxed a little more. The rasp of his callused fingers against her skin caught her by surprise. She sagged against his chest in a warm wash of... \u201cYum.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle rumbled against her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t think my best efforts at seduction have ever been summarized in the same way as a good dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA compliment is a compliment. I like my food.\u201d She writhed against him to increase the friction of his hand against her flesh, a sweet pleasure so long missed. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time to overanalyze.\u201d</p><p>Why think ahead? Enjoy the moment and let the rest take care of itself. She surrendered to his kiss and stroke, and yes, maybe she\u2019d given over control but she deserved this, and doggone it, her hands were having a hell of an awesome time exploring his body, as well.</p><p>And as far as yummy meals went, her mouth enjoyed feasting on his mouth, his neck, his perspiration-dotted skin. So perhaps he\u2019d given over to the moment, as well.</p><p>\u201cShirt on or off?\u201d he asked</p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d she said without hesitation. If she didn\u2019t do this now, she never would.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take his time or give her even a second to think\u2014thank heavens. Her shirt sailed across the room to hook on a lamp in a heartbeat.</p><p>She knew what she looked like now. She\u2019d stared at her altered chest in the mirror often enough.</p><p>And she so didn\u2019t want to think right now.</p><p>He gazed at her for a moment that seemed to stretch forever but probably was all of five seconds. She wondered if he would make some big ceremonial deal out of touching her scars which would make her cry and she so didn\u2019t want to cry.</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands and kissed her, bringing her chest flush with his and holy cow, he was still aroused. Relief beyond anything she ever could have imagined flooded her, followed by joy.</p><p>And desire. Sweet, wonderful, unrestrained pleasure.</p><p>She wriggled closer against him until she could feel the gentle abrasion of his chest hair against her skin. The sensation caught her by surprise. She\u2019d been so caught up in thinking about the feelings she would lose, she hadn\u2019t thought of what she would enjoy. And the way he\u2019d positioned them, she didn\u2019t feel so exposed. How ironic, how delightfully wonderful to find such surprising empathy from a guy with a call sign \u201cLurch.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t made this about cancer or scars, but about enjoying the moment. Perfect.</p><p>Then she stopped thinking at all.</p><p>She inhaled the scent of Rick\u2019s spicy aftershave permeating the room. No more of her potpourri taking over the room. This was a man\u2019s place now, regardless of how many floral sheets or froufrou comforters she brought into the place. The sheer masculinity of it sent a rush through her.</p><p>Rick dipped his head to trail nibbles along her ear with rambling whispers of how much he wanted her, needed her, his heated words as much an aphrodisiac as his touch skimming away her shorts and underwear.</p><p>All righty. Getting down to business. Yes. Her heart rate raced and her greedy hands grappled for his shorts, his h*ps lifting to accommodate, then\u2014oh my\u2014her hand wrapped around the heat of him. Something else so very familiar in this moment.</p><p>She remembered well the size and weight of him in her hand, in her. She remembered too his growl of appreciation in her ear, the sense that she knew instinctively what to do for him just as he knew how to bring her such sweet pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNola...\u201d</p><p>A groan or a question?</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCondom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t string together more than one word at a time, either, which posed a serious problem for finding birth control anytime soon. They didn\u2019t have to worry about conceiving, but in this day and age, condoms were always wise with all the diseases out there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Think.</p><p>\u201cWallet,\u201d he continued in between working serious magic on a newly discovered erogenous zone at the base of her neck. \u201cTable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Right.\u201d Now she saw it resting by the lamp and thank goodness he\u2019d thought ahead because, heaven help her, she surely hadn\u2019t.</p> <p>Leaning, Nola reached, so grateful he stayed with her during the whole stretch of foreplay, never breaking the amazingly shivery contact. Her hand slapped to rest over his wallet, grappled until she fished out the thin packet.</p><p>Straightening again, she ripped open the birth control and sheathed him in a smooth sweep that sent his arm twitching around her, muscles taut.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He slid two fingers home inside her. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Much more.</p> <p>He teased her again and again with a familiarity he couldn\u2019t possibly have remembered from before yet somehow he seemed to know just what she enjoyed most. When she thought she couldn\u2019t take any more without finishing here, now, he slid both hands to her back, down to cup her bottom and grip. A slight shift and lift upward brought her mouth to his again for a deeper kiss, more kissing while they continued. More intimacy. Her heart raced faster along with her breath threatening a hint of hyperventilation, because with the joining of their mouths, she adjusted her body to accept...</p><p>Yes...</p><p>His body moved into her hers again with a familiarity that washed away the awkwardness and yes, the fears, too.</p><p>A second healing pulsed through her veins, throughout her entire body, her mind, her soul. A cure beyond what could be found from any doctor or medicine.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his shoulders, gripped deeper into memorable muscles to anchor her in the moment.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTotally. You?\u201d</p><p>He throbbed inside her.</p><p>She grinned against his mouth, tickled to her toes again that two such chatty people could be reduced to one-word responses by the power of their response to each other. Nola leaned in for another kiss, rocking her h*ps as he thrust up. This would be okay, fun and normal and wonderful. She could have this part of her world and body back.</p><p>More sensations tingled to life again along every inch of skin. Shivery and alive and building as they rocked in synch. Bedsprings squeaked in harmony with their movements, echoing the growing riot within her. She dipped her head to taste his skin, beads of sweat popping along his collarbone, her fingers finding the pebbled hardness of his nipples.</p><p>He throbbed inside her again, his growl rumbling against her oversensitized chest. Power trilled through, knowing that she brought him as much pleasure as he gave her.</p><p>She opened her mouth to give him another of those one-word encouragements only to find even that much speech had dried up in the fire of her response. She could only throw back her head and savor, hold, shake. Surely it was only because she\u2019d gone so long without.</p><p>A little voice in her head told her otherwise.</p><p>But then she told that little voice to hush up. She was busy right now enjoying the most amazing, freeing sex of her life, soon to be the most awesome completion. Building now and she didn\u2019t want to risk dulling the edge from the finish. Or worse yet, lose her focus and lose the moment...</p> <p>\u201cShh...\u201d His voice and hands soothed over her skin as his body thrust. \u201cI\u2019m with you and I\u2019m not finishing without you, like the two of us taking the leap together. Have you ever done a tandem parachute jump? It\u2019s freaking amazing.\u201d</p><p>She liked the image of their bodies locked like a joined freefall jump from an airplane. What a lovely vision of their two worlds mingling. He\u2019d found words when she needed them, when she needed him. She believed him, trusted him.</p><p>And...oh...her body convulsed so completely around his, her arms locking him so tightly to her, she couldn\u2019t draw him any deeper as she soared into the sensation.</p><p>So amazing. Beautiful. World rocking.</p><p>She\u2019d deluded herself once before that she could have a weekend only with this man. Collapsing against his chest, she knew this time she wouldn\u2019t be leaving him a note in the morning.</p><p>And even as she fought to catch her breath from the wonderful pleasure he\u2019d helped her find again, she knew that untangling her mess of emotions for this complex man scared her far more than any combat mission.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Breeze whipping off the marshy water and over him, Rick twisted the screwdriver on Nola\u2019s mailbox, removing the last of the hinges holding the door. He might not have the answer yet for stopping the letter-writing, car-bombing, finance-sabotaging scum. But Rick intended to make damn sure there wouldn\u2019t be any lethal surprises hidden in the U.S. mailbox, like a poisonous snake or spider, not to mention another bomb.</p><p>He\u2019d been working his way through the list of possible dangerous surprises and general handyman fix-its. Aside from wanting to help her, it felt damn good to be out in the world again. Never again would he gripe about mowing the lawn or changing out the heater-AC filters. Nothing like a year in a rehab center to cure a man of grousing about chores around the house.</p><p>If only his body would cooperate with the length of his list. He rested his elbows on the mailbox to ease the pressure on his legs. The night of vigorous sex had tapped his reserves, too.</p><p>He grinned. Well worth every aching muscle.</p><p>So since he was done with the mailbox, why was he hanging out here rather than heading back inside with her? Giving Nola space.</p><p>She\u2019d trusted him with a mammoth revelation, and now she was scared. He\u2019d faced fear\u2014in others, and hell yeah, in himself\u2014enough times in the field to recognize it in a heartbeat. Best thing to do? Watch her and take his cue from her. Protecting her had taken on a lot more dimensions than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>A shapely shadow stretched over him, reminding him of his primary purpose for being here\u2014and it wasn\u2019t about being in Nola\u2019s bed, much as he enjoyed the pleasurable position.</p><p>He needed to remember how easily this woman could distract him from watching the cars driving by, sparse though the traffic might be on the back road, especially on a holiday. All the same, a large blue truck approached, slowing.</p><p>Rick knelt down to pull the hammer from the box and leaned against the mailbox as the truck neared to reveal...her neighbor, the ex-cop, Malcolm Cuvier. The truck pulled over onto the side of the road across the street, crunching downed branches.</p><p>The burly man hopped out of the truck cab. \u201cHappy Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you. What can we do for you?\u201d Had he really just said we in a territorial claim staking of his woman?</p><p>Hell yeah.</p><p>\u201cJust doing a drive-by to make sure all\u2019s well with Nola and that you aren\u2019t having any more trouble from that bastard who\u2019s been bugging her lately.\u201d</p><p>Rick assessed the older man through narrowed eyes and wondered what if... They surely wouldn\u2019t get any support on that theory from the local police since Cuvier was part of the blue wall. This would be better mentioned to someone in the OSI. \u201cAll\u2019s been quiet, other than some snafus with stolen credit cards. Child\u2019s play to straighten out.\u201d</p><p>That would rile him into action if he was the perp, hopefully anger him enough to make a careless mistake.</p><p>\u201cWell, if there\u2019s anything I can do, just let me know.\u201d He backed toward his truck. \u201cAnd tell Nola happy holidays for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d Rick dropped the hammer into the toolbox with a thud as the man drove away.</p><p>And speaking of Nola...</p><p>She strolled his way down the stone walk, watching him through wary morning-after eyes. Her arms crossed over her chest reminded him of the main reason he needed to get his head out of his ass and scrounge up some \u201csensitive guy\u201d stuff to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cMorning, gorgeous.\u201d Not too original, but pretty decent in a pinch.</p><p>And totally true.</p><p>With her blond leggy beauty, she stretched those jeans and the simple green sweater out in all the right places. She continued her sashay down the stone walkway, towering oak trees casting a bower of branches and Spanish moss over her. With an extra kick of sass, she batted away the tire swing swishing in the wind. Rigged to lie flat, the tire swing swirled like a chocolate doughnut.</p><p>He certainly did plan to have a Thanksgiving feast of her later on.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here when you should be propping up your legs?\u201d she inquired with gentle censure. \u201cYou\u2019ve already fixed everything that\u2019s broken and a number of things that weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing major.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the screwdriver into the small toolbox he\u2019d found in her garage. He hadn\u2019t found an elaborate workshop, but she had the basics. Rick mentally made a list of a couple more items he could pick up and teach her to use...for after he left? \u201cJust tying up some loose ends to rig better security for your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent a fortune on my security system after those letters started showing up.\u201d She threaded her fingers through her damp curls, looking left and right down the deserted road. \u201cThe cops are doing drive-bys. What else could you possibly have in mind?\u201d</p><p>He patted the open mailbox. \u201cA few simple techniques I learned in Terrorist Combat 101. And making use of more manpower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManpower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you gotten to know your neighbors?\u201d If they could be called that, all a mile or so down the road in sparsely populated subdivisions.</p><p>\u201cUm. I\u2019m really never here and they all live pretty far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pitching stones. My house is every bit as glass as yours is, lady. I figured it was worth my while to check out the locals in case you had some creepy lech with photos of you plastered to his bedroom wall.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot straight upward. \u201cYou\u2019ve been checking out my neighbors\u2019 bedrooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped in to say hi to a couple of the ones who lived closer when I saw them out doing yard work, wrangled my way inside for a drink of water, which led to a trip to the bathroom and enabled me to scope the house and get a feel for their personality.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not foolproof, but a quick look start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve told them my problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell the divorced dentist next door jack about you because then he might make a move.\u201d He looped his arms around her waist and buzzed her neck.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t as easily put off.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Calves cramping, he shuffled from foot to foot as unobtrusively as possible.</p><p>What he wouldn\u2019t give to have his old body back. He would fling her over his shoulder and haul her inside for all-day sex. \u201cNot your problems exactly, because I did have to take into account that I might be wrong in my estimation. I told a couple of the older ladies who\u2019re home during the day that we\u2019ve had trouble with teenage vandalism. That we\u2019d appreciate it if they would keep an eye out and let us know if they see anything suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sagged back against a towering oak. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d Joining her by the tree, he dropped onto the tire swing and hauled her onto his lap instead of over his shoulder, not too bad an alternative after all.</p><p>He smothered her yelp of surprise with his mouth, lingered. Too easily he could hibernate here with her...</p><p>Rick lifted his head and his thoughts back to the crispy fall moment. \u201cNever discount the obvious help just because it\u2019s not full guns blazing.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Could that be a subliminal slip?</p><p>Sitting crossways on his lap, Nola rested her head against his shoulder while the swing creaked back and forth on the thick branch. \u201cI would have thought you would be all about the firepower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe make use of anything we\u2019re given.\u201d He hated self-pity, but he couldn\u2019t shake thoughts of what he\u2019d lost, memories of the man he\u2019d been when she\u2019d seen him five years ago, pumping push-ups on the floor.</p><p>Heaven knew he was digging deep in his arsenal when it came to impressing this woman. Maybe he needed to take some of his own advice on looking for ways to make a contribution without quite the same level of firepower. His training for pararescue might be parlayed into something less adrenaline-pumping, but maybe just as useful if only he could clear his head from the weight of frustration to figure out what in the hell that might be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nola wriggled on his lap to sit more securely. \u201cOkay, you don\u2019t think any of my neighbors are stalkers. I guess that\u2019s a relief, except we\u2019re not any closer to answers.\u201d</p><p>Something he intended to do his best to change. Somebody needed to push the authorities harder, tap into some of the base intel personnel, none of which he could do until after the holiday.</p><p>Which left him with time on his hands now. \u201cIn the interest of being open and honest and sensitive, I\u2019ll own up to the fact that all this activity has my legs aching and your wriggling has another part of me aching.\u201d</p> <p>She angled her face up to his, her blue eyes as clear as the sky he used to parachute through on a regular basis. \u201cAre you angling for another massage of all your aching parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a peek at that Jacuzzi tub of yours.\u201d That should put them on a more even footing.</p><p>He eyed the marshy shore just beyond her house and wished for warmer weather. Swimming with Nola, making love in the natural watery environment would be awesome. In spite of his injuries, he could seriously hold his own in the water.</p><p>Would he still be in the area in the spring to live out those fantasies with Nola? A weighty thought, premature at that. Right now, he could focus on the Jacuzzi and a more immediate, simple surprise for her.</p><p>\u201cI believe that could be arranged.\u201d</p> <p>Fixing things around her house, getting to know her neighbors. Coming up with ways to surprise her, win her over.</p><p>This felt too much like digging in, planting roots.</p><p>Damn. He missed the old days when the stakes weren\u2019t scary as hell, when he only faced catapulting himself out of an airplane into a jungle full of live fire.</p><p>Nola plunged her body into the churning bathwaters in the Jacuzzi, her body already tingling long before the frothing jets caressed her skin.</p><p>Rick had created an amazing seductive spa setting with a Thanksgiving feast surprise she would never forget. The man certainly had a creative way with making a personal moment from things scavenged during a simple grocery store run.</p><p>Bunches of mixed flowers in large tumblers surrounded the tub interspersed with candles. The scents clung to the humidity, saturating the air and her awakening senses as the tub\u2019s motor hummed softly underneath her. And her own motor was pretty well humming by now, too.</p> <p>Best of all, beside the faucet rested something that meant more than all the candles, flowers or security upgrades in the world. An ice bucket holding four...</p><p>Milk shakes.</p><p>Vanilla. Chocolate. Strawberry. And something green she really hoped was mint because no way would she hurt his feelings by doing anything other than tasting it with a grateful smile and yum.</p><p>\u201cHappy Thanksgiving,\u201d Rick called from the doorway, one shoulder braced, his honed body on display and awesome even in jeans and T-shirt. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure about your favorite flavor, but I wanted to add something to the meal.\u201d</p><p>She scooped the strawberry shake from the bucket, lounged back and enjoyed the view along with a few memories from their night together that she couldn\u2019t wait to repeat. \u201cSo this is what you put in that bag of yours when you snuck off at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce cream and condoms. A man after my own heart.\u201d She put the straw in her mouth and drew on the creamy shake, holding his gaze.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cA woman who doesn\u2019t give a crap about flowers.\u201d His voice went husky as his attention stayed right on her gently sucking on the straw. \u201cA woman after my heart.\u201d</p> <p>She let her laughter float as freely as the bubbles rising toward her chin. How long had it been since she\u2019d had this much fun? She never would have imagined being this lighthearted while some crazed nutcase gunned for her.</p><p>\u201cYou found my blender and everything.\u201d Leaning forward, she traded the strawberry shake for the green. \u201cYou really went to a lot of trouble. I feel guilty. All I did was order the grocery store\u2019s premade Thanksgiving meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the pilgrims would have preferred the premade, hands down, if they\u2019d been given the option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She tasted the green shake\u2014oh, chocolate mint. \u201cHow about you get rid of those clothes and join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since it\u2019s the doctor\u2019s orders and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to play doctor?\u201d</p><p>Barefoot, he shoved away from the doorjamb and lumbered toward her, shucking his shirt. \u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>He popped the top button free on his jeans to reveal his washboard stomach and her mouth dried right up. She brought her drink back to her lips and his pupils widened, his brown eyes darkening to cloudy skies.</p><p>Kicking his pants and boxers aside, Rick shook his head slowly. \u201cLady, your mouth is pure sin.\u201d</p><p>She set her drink aside and held her arms open for him to join her. He lowered his body into the tub behind her, his thighs brushing her legs with tantalizing effect.</p><p>Nola settled back against his chest, sloshing bubbles over the side onto the rag-tie bath mat. \u201cI did plan a more personal surprise for you later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it involve us staying naked?\u201d He nipped her shoulder, his arms looping around her stomach.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that certainly would make the event all the more memorable.\u201d She swallowed back a laugh at the thought of the two of them, naked, while... She couldn\u2019t even finish the thought. It would be too funny. Too much of a fantasy.</p><p>She brought the milk shake to her mouth again and sucked, the creamy drink flooding her senses\u2014and apparently her savoring driving Rick more than a little crazy because the next thing she knew he\u2019d snatched her glass from her.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not gonna stay naked,\u201d he said. \u201cTake back the gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously now. You\u2019ll really like this.\u201d She hoped he would. God, what if she\u2019d made a colossal error in judgment and hurt him with this? \u201cAlthough since I made the reservation with my credit card which is officially frozen thanks to the creep, you\u2019ll have to pay for your own Thanksgiving gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it bankrupt me?\u201d He leaned back and snagged the vanilla shake for himself while his other hand disappeared under the water between her legs and...</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed for a second before she wrapped her hand around his so she could finish talking. \u201cI make less than you do, pal, even with whatever your child support payments must be, so I seriously doubt this will throw you in the poorhouse. And no worries. When we untangle my finances, I fully intend to pay you back.\u201d</p><p>His hand slid from the water and he flicked the water free. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I owe you rent...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping out with the protection factor, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later.\u201d He flipped his hand to link fingers with hers. \u201cWill it freak you out if I call my ex? Something wasn\u2019t right with Lauren\u2019s call yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat parent radar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can claim that. I\u2019m not around her enough to call myself perceptive. Even a moron would know she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And she was. It would be petty to mind him calling his ex, she just wished she didn\u2019t have to listen in. Jealousy made her look petty and she hated such small emotions\u2014not to mention what it said about how tangled her feelings for Rick had become in a short time.</p><p>Okay, they were sleeping together again, not in a one-night-stand capacity.</p><p>Determined to enjoy this Thanksgiving afternoon with Rick, Nola slid deeper into the bubbles, savoring his stroking touch between her legs. Not to mention the firm press of his erection against her, reassuring her that he wanted her every bit as much as she wanted him. As if she didn\u2019t have enough to make her jittery hoping she hadn\u2019t goofed with her surprise present.</p><p>Life would be far simpler if she could just fish out her earplugs and pretend she didn\u2019t care about his phone call to his ex-wife.</p><p>Behind the wheel of the new SUV rental he\u2019d put on his credit card when Nola\u2019s bottomed out, Rick drove while he thumbed numbers on his cell phone. Calling his ex-wife never ranked high on his list of favorites, but they had a child to bring up. They may have sucked as a couple, but they loved their kid and Lindsay was a good mom.</p><p>This new guy entering the picture, however, he didn\u2019t know jack about. Why hadn\u2019t Lindsay phoned to let him know?</p><p>Nola sat beside him in the passenger side, periodically piping up with a \u201cturn left\u201d or \u201cturn right,\u201d but otherwise silent. He wondered about her surprise because he couldn\u2019t plan protection from the stalker when he didn\u2019t have a sense of where they would be. Stubborn woman refused to pony up the info. He grinned\u2014</p><p>The cell phone stopped ringing and his wife answered. His smile faded.</p><p>\u201cLindsay, Rick here. I got a call from Lauren.\u201d Might as well skip the niceties and cut right to the chase. Besides, Nola had said her surprise wasn\u2019t much farther down the dusty county road. \u201cShe said you\u2019re getting remarried.\u201d</p><p>Nola went still beside him and Rick wondered for the first time if perhaps he should have had this conversation in private after all.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello to you, too, Rick,\u201d Lindsay answered with a touch of sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019m doing fine. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of wasting time dressing this conversation up with a bunch of pretty chitchat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDirect and to the point. You haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d</p><p>Nola had said she liked that about him. He found himself smiling and not so totally pissed off about having to play the Lindsay game right now. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you. Very happy right now, as a matter of fact.\u201d At least she had the grace to pause. Awkward silence crackled for the next four telephone poles whizzing past. \u201cI was going to call and tell you about the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have been nice, but it\u2019s not the point.\u201d Although it was a subpoint. He would have liked a heads-up when talking to their kid. \u201cShe\u2019s upset. Actually that\u2019s an understatement. She\u2019s really shaken up enough to say she wants to come live with me.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay snorted. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>He knew it wasn\u2019t possible, but still he bristled at Lindsay\u2019s outright refusal to even consider the possibility. Sheesh. He wasn\u2019t the Antichrist.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Calm the hell down.</p><p>His ex wasn\u2019t a bad person, just ill equipped to handle military life, complete with a husband who hurtled out of airplanes and only spent two or three months a year at home.</p><p>Who could blame her? He never had before. Why the resentment now? He\u2019d stopped loving her long ago.</p><p>Because for some reason he found himself wondering what a real life would be like. The kind of life she was building. Not with her, though.</p><p>Ah damn.</p><p>Nola gestured for him to turn left. He nodded, before resuming his conversation. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Lauren. She didn\u2019t sound happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at her friend\u2019s mountain cabin for the week. Maybe you remember me mentioning Becca Levy to you. Or maybe you don\u2019t,\u201d Lindsay said with one of her traditional not-so-subtle digs at his crappy parenting. \u201cShe\u2019s having a great time skiing.\u201d</p><p>Could be, and Lindsay undoubtedly knew Lauren better than he did. He\u2019d barely spent any time with his own daughter. Although now that he thought back to her call, she\u2019d sounded mighty upset for a girl playing ski bunny with her friend.</p><p>His mother would be ashamed of him. That burned. He was working to be a better man, a better father. Hopefully he would get there sometime soon.</p><p>Starting with being more perceptive\u2014and he could swear his daughter was upset. But he\u2019d learned long ago not to argue with Lindsay once she\u2019d made up her mind.</p><p>\u201cOkay, she\u2019s homesick. Still, I would appreciate it if you would give her a call and check in. Or better yet, you could give me the number and I\u2019ll call her. The number she used didn\u2019t come up on my cell and her cell is out of range.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want the number?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s shock was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what\u2019s so strange about that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI tried like hell for years to get you to call her more often.\u201d</p><p>The censure bugged him more than a little. He knew he\u2019d screwed up in being \u201cFather of the Year\u201d material, but he had made an effort. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it that there were times I didn\u2019t have telephone service. There were times I needed to go silent. Communication is better now with cell phones and e-mail.\u201d</p><p>Not that any of it mattered since he was out of the service anyway, something he would be telling Lauren and Lindsay soon. And maybe he was getting wiser thanks to the insights of a certain pushy\u2014hot\u2014lady pilot.</p><p>\u201cSure, whatever. I\u2019m just glad for Lauren\u2019s sake. I don\u2019t have the number handy, but I\u2019ll text message the number to you after Ben and I finish up our lunch at his partner\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like Lindsay had the life she\u2019d always wanted. \u201cThat would be great. Thanks.\u201d He hesitated, wishing the towering pines lining the road could offer up some help on what he should say to smooth the way with this woman he would be linked to forever through their kid. \u201cAnd hey, Lindsay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Rick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. I hope this guy makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Rick, he does.\u201d Her normally confident voice went tentative, soft. \u201cHe may not be an out-there, big personality like you, but life feels good now. I\u2019m at peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad for you,\u201d he said, and meant it.</p><p>He thumbed the Off button and clenched the phone for a long moment. His feelings for Lindsay had ended over eight years ago. They\u2019d said their goodbyes. But this farewell brought a finality and\u2014he searched for the word\u2014a peace for him, too.</p><p>His past was finally just that, in the past.</p> <p>Nodding to no one in particular, he tucked his phone in his pocket and tossed his best grin to the fascinating woman beside him, determined to make the most of the rest of this Thanksgiving. \u201cSo, lady, what do you have in store for us today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake that right turn up there and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He saw the turn and the sign for...a small county airport? She couldn\u2019t be planning what he thought.</p><p>A tentative smile lit her face even as he sensed a big-ass storm cloud heading toward his day. \u201cJust because you\u2019ve been retired on disability from the Air Force anymore doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t take to the skies.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Yoke in both hands, Nola guided the plane through the late-afternoon sky with none of her usual joy since she waited for Rick\u2019s verdict on her gift. He hadn\u2019t been rude, but his brooding silence worried her.</p><p>She\u2019d been so sure he would enjoy this as she\u2019d made her plans. She had her private pilot\u2019s license as well as her military training, she\u2019d asked a friend to let her use the small craft for a two-hour flight around Charleston airspace. Nothing fancy or hair-raising as they\u2019d experienced on missions. Still, clear blue sky stretched out like a baby boy\u2019s blanket to cushion them.</p><p>She\u2019d expected Rick to absorb the experience, soak it up after so long without. Instead, he\u2019d gone silent since the moment they\u2019d pulled into the airport parking lot.</p> <p>Maybe she was being presumptuous in assuming she\u2019d caused his moodiness. Perhaps his quiet had more to do with his conversation with his ex-wife than the flight.</p><p>She thought about keeping her distance...but she and Rick had slept together, for goodness\u2019 sake. She\u2019d made a promise to herself to start embracing life again. If he didn\u2019t want to discuss it, he could say so. And if he did, then she would have done well in gently broaching the subject. \u201cSo your ex-wife is getting remarried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>Not a resounding endorsement for conversation but then didn\u2019t all those Internet info blurbs indicate that men used half as many words as women to get their point across? If so, then those two words carried a lot of weight. She would toss another open-ended question out there for him to pick up\u2014or not\u2014as he saw fit.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d A simple question, but once voiced, it scared her with how much she wanted to know. Wow, these tangled feelings scared the bejesus out of her.</p><p>He shifted in this seat, leather crackling, his serious face set in hard lines. \u201cI don\u2019t have any feelings for Lindsay if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>Whoosh. She hadn\u2019t even realized she was holding her breath. \u201cWow, you sure don\u2019t beat around the bush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the second woman to say that to me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I like being compared to your ex-wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies.\u201d His expression eased a little, closer to the Rick who romanced her with milk shakes and bubble baths. \u201cI\u2019m still in a mood from the conversation. Our daughter isn\u2019t happy about the marriage and for that reason I\u2019m not okay with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that.\u201d She churned the info around in her head and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhy not have your daughter come live with you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not have noticed, but I\u2019m still recovering from serious injuries.\u201d</p><p>She should shut up. Should. And still she couldn\u2019t stop from opening her mouth. \u201cShe\u2019s fifteen, right? Well past the diaper stage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. His conversation had seriously fallen off. She couldn\u2019t even say those were small words anymore. She\u2019d better taper hers off now, too. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an opinion.\u201d He traced his fingers along the copilot\u2019s yoke in front of him, one that moved in tandem with her hands guiding the controls on the pilot\u2019s yoke. \u201cGo ahead and spit it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already said my bit. It\u2019s not my business, anyway.\u201d There. Now she\u2019d wised up. Hush and enjoy the flight. She gripped the yoke tighter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right.\u201d His jaw flexed so hard he might well crack a crown. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I live in a one-room garage apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for much longer hopefully.\u201d Wait. She wanted to call back those words. She hadn\u2019t meant them the way they sounded but backpedaling would probably only make it sound worse.</p><p>He cocked a brow. \u201cAre you booting me out already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know better. I only mean I hope we catch the creep soon.\u201d Where would Rick go then? Where would their relationship go?</p><p>An emotionally confusing question, especially when she still had the smell of him swirling through her senses. Why did she have to make this complicated? She really had intended this day to be special, but then he\u2019d gone all brooding and silent on her. The confined space compacted the emotions to smothering levels until she had to speak or suffocate.</p><p>\u201cThere was a time I would have given anything to have a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, woman,\u201d he blurted, \u201cyou don\u2019t pull any punches, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? You\u2019re a strong man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Some of the anger smoothed from his angular features. \u201cI think.\u201d</p><p>She stared and realized what was niggling at her. His hands moved in synch with hers. \u201cYou have your civilian pilot\u2019s license, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He jolted. Not hugely, just a hint, but enough for her to notice. She thought at first he wouldn\u2019t answer. Then finally he nodded slightly. \u201cI did, at one point. But it\u2019s not current anymore since I haven\u2019t been able to log airtime with an instructor this past year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an instructor. You can take the controls and it would be legal.\u201d</p><p>His hands flexed. His gaze so hungry no way could she miss how much he wanted this even if he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he go for it? She wouldn\u2019t know if she didn\u2019t ask. \u201cIs it that hard for you to have anything to do with the past?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t overanalyze me.\u201d His voice, a low rumble invited no argument.</p><p>Nola stared out at the late-afternoon sky and found none of the beauty she\u2019d enjoyed just minutes before, instead seeing more of a flattened meringue look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if this wasn\u2019t a good idea after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh hell.\u201d He exhaled the curse. \u201cWomen have to make everything so complicated.\u201d</p><p>He placed his hands on the yoke in front of him, feet on the rudders and she felt control slip away from her as he took over. And lookee there, those clouds poofed right back up, all pretty again.</p><p>Grinning, she lifted her hands away, slid her feet off and the plane continued on its path without so much as a bobble. His jaw flexed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at all happy or peaceful. He looked more like the Biblical Jacob wrestling with his destiny.</p><p>The answers seemed so simple to her. \u201cThere\u2019s not a doubt in my mind that you\u2019re hurting your daughter with this \u2018wait until I\u2019m well\u2019 attitude of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Nola,\u201d he barked without looking away from the horizon. \u201cShe\u2019s my daughter. You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d She lounged back in her seat without once taking her eyes off the controls. \u201cBut I have a brain. I was a teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a few father issues of your own?\u201d</p><p>He was far too perceptive for his own good. This flight was supposed to have been about giving him a moment of peace and here they were jabbing at each other. Maybe the flight and the call\u2014and making love\u2014had left them both feeling too raw for reasonable discussion.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah, I\u2019m strong enough to own up. My father walked and ignored me in lieu of his new bachelor footloose world. I was a messy loose end from his old life. He figured it was better to let me move on with my mom and her new husband, since it was a traditional family setup. Nobody ever thought to ask me. Now they\u2019re all dead and I don\u2019t have the chance to be with any of them.\u201d</p><p>Much as she loved both her parents, she resented being shuffled around like a playing piece during her childhood. Could she help it if she felt a tug of empathy for Rick\u2019s daughter?</p><p>\u201cNola, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve lost your family\u2014\u201d he offered her a nod of sympathy \u201c\u2014but one person can\u2019t compare their life to another\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Fair enough. She searched her mind for other possibilities for reasons for his distance. \u201cIs your daughter some mega athlete?\u201d</p><p>A grin tensed his jaw. \u201cHardly. Throw a ball her way and she puts her hands in front of her face and screams. She\u2019s into theater and dance. She has an amazing voice. She\u2019s more of a romantic.\u201d</p><p>The pieces fell into place for her. \u201cYou want to live up to her heroic ideal of being a superhero Daddy who can save the world.\u201d</p><p>His knuckles went white on the yoke. \u201cDid you study how to go for the jugular or is it a natural instinct?\u201d</p><p>Contrition nipped. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt you. I had a bigger point to make here if you would just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he see the heroism of his survival? Or that daddies were heroes to their little girls simply because they existed? \u201cI would have given anything to have the chance to be a parent.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t pull his gaze from the purpling horizon, but lifted one of his hands from the yoke and rested it on hers. \u201cI\u2019m so damn sorry you didn\u2019t get to have your baby.\u201d</p><p>She tapped the fuel gauge even though it was working just fine. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me how I should consider adoption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to offer advice or platitudes.\u201d And didn\u2019t that comment speak volumes about how he would prefer to be treated?</p><p>The plane\u2019s engines hummed in the stretching silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>God, she\u2019d been rude and he was being nice and perceptive. This really sucked because now she had to be honest when pissed off and sulking would have been so much easier.</p><p>Still, she did keep her eyes averted, thumbing moisture off every gauge. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve considered adoption, but with my health problems I\u2019m a poor candidate. Then there\u2019s my travel schedule. When it comes to motherhood, I believe my time has passed.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t appreciate the way the old hurt came up to bite her now, harder than ever, when she\u2019d successfully stuffed down the heart-shredding regret countless times before. Maybe Rick\u2019s daughter had gotten under her skin deeper than she\u2019d realized if this young woman she\u2019d never even met had the power to elicit so much heartache from the past.</p> <p>His hand skimmed up to her shoulder, a steady weight, squeezing gently. Firmly.</p><p>Unexpected tears blurred the horizon. \u201cI think I could use a platitude now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one to offer,\u201d he said, even as his eyes glinted with a hint of sympathy she couldn\u2019t miss. \u201cWe\u2019ve both seen how unfair life can be, but I swear to you I\u2019m going to see this stalker thing through. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d</p><p>This flight, the sky, the sympathy in his eyes\u2014and yes, making love\u2014had definitely left her feeling more vulnerable than she\u2019d expected. She\u2019d never let her emotions gain control during flight before, a dangerous habit. Rick had a power over her no one, not even her ex, had exerted before.</p><p>This whole surprise gift had backfired on her, because now more than anything, she needed breathing space.</p> <p>Steering the SUV along the dark back roads to Nola\u2019s house, Rick had to acknowledge he\u2019d learned something unexpectedly valuable on that flight.</p><p>Nola had a way of tearing down defenses.</p><p>Once he\u2019d woken up from surgery after the Hurricane Katrina accident, he\u2019d planned to put his Air Force days behind him. He\u2019d done a pretty decent job of that\u2014until Nola strutted into the rehab center with her chocolate chip cookies and killer legs.</p><p>Now, forgetting was damn near impossible while sleeping with a hot lady pilot, not to mention living in her house with all the military gear and photography scattered throughout her cluttered home. Then she\u2019d up and thrown his past into his face with that flight.</p><p>He could still smell the open blue sky even in the murky night. Yeah, that sounded nebulous and all woo-woo. But the clouds and open air up there filled him with a familiarity he\u2019d missed more than he\u2019d been willing to admit.</p><p>Would flying in a little civilian prop plane every now and again be enough for him? Or would it be like dribbling bourbon on an alcoholic\u2019s tongue? Could he turn his old life into a hobby or did he need to cut ties with everything Air Force\u2014including Nola?</p> <p>All moot points at the moment because first he had to call his daughter. As conflicted as he felt about Nola, the woman had dropped some heavy-duty guilt on his doorstep in regard to his parenting. He\u2019d been so sure the kiddo should live with her mother.</p><p>He was such a mess himself. How could he deal with a typical teenager whose moods swung around with about as much regularity as a hurricane? The stakes were so damned high.</p><p>Rick dialed the number and waited for the pickup. Moonlight streamed through the towering trees arching over the road on one side, marshy shore on the other. God, this deserted area left too many places for someone to hide.</p><p>\u201cLevy\u2019s house. This is Joel,\u201d a child\u2019s voice answered. \u201cHappy Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, could I speak to Lauren DeMassi, please? This is her father.\u201d</p><p>He scanned the nearly deserted road, the entrance to the nearby tiny subdivision, the ex-cop Malcolm Cuvier\u2019s house blazing with lights but no cars. Seemed he was alone for the holidays in spite of his assertion he had family flying from the West Coast. Something to file away.</p><p>Rick pulled his attention back to the phone conversation.</p><p>\u201cSorry, you\u2019ve got the wrong number, mister. This isn\u2019t Lauren\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>Wrong number? Dread and a dawning realization gripped his stomach as he neared Nola\u2019s home. \u201cMy daughter goes to school with Becca Levy. They\u2019re spending Thanksgiving together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Becca\u2019s here, but Lauren didn\u2019t come home with her.\u201d</p><p>Sweat popped along his forehead. This dawning nightmare-come-true sucked for a parent.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joel, could you get your mother or father to come to the telephone, please?\u201d He pressed the earpiece more securely in place while the cell phone rested in his lap. He reassured himself Becca\u2019s parents would have answers. The kid Joel was just confused. Could Lindsay and Lauren have gotten their wires so horribly crossed?</p><p>Waiting for the kid to track down a responsible adult to clear up this mess ASAP, Rick turned the steering wheel, maneuvering the car off the road and onto Nola\u2019s tree-bowered driveway. His mind rolled through a hundred possible\u2014positive\u2014scenarios.</p><p>Just as many horrendous possibilities played out in his imagination, as well. Damn it, why didn\u2019t that kid Joel hurry up?</p><p>Headlights swept the driveway, the sleeping lawn, the house. His instincts jolted to life because this time he did see someone waiting. Parked on Nola\u2019s front doorstep sat a teenager with a backpack stuffed full and a familiar face.</p><p>Lauren DeMassi stared back with a defiance betrayed by her trembling chin.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Rick\u2019s daughter? Here?</p><p>Stomach as shaky as her newly rocked world, Nola watched the father and daughter ready to greet each other. Lauren resembled her dad so strongly, Nola recognized the family connection even if Rick hadn\u2019t cursed and explained the second they\u2019d pulled up in the driveway.</p><p>Nola and Rick exchanged a look with a world of meaning. Lauren was in grave danger being here with Nola\u2019s stalker on her tail.</p><p>Rick didn\u2019t grab for his crutches. Nola wanted to chastise him for being reckless with his health but knew she needed to butt out of this father-daughter moment. No easy feat when she longed to tell him not to come down too tough on Lauren, who looked as though she was trying very hard to play it cool while she bit the side of her lip in obvious worry.</p><p>Teeth set, Rick made his way slowly across the walk toward the willowy brunette dressed in shorts that had probably been right for wherever she\u2019d come from, but that gave her goose bumps in the South Carolina autumn night. Although something seemed off in her greeting. The patient way Lauren watched her father make his way across the patchy lawn... Ohmigod, Lauren showed no surprise at her father\u2019s pained progress. What was going on?</p><p>\u201cLauren.\u201d Rick held out his arms and Nola wondered if he noticed his daughter\u2019s calm reception when he had devastating injuries he\u2019d kept from her.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d She shrugged off her backpack and hugged him back, but with little enthusiasm for a kid who\u2019d made her way this far.</p><p>Nola watched the two and wanted to knock some sense into both their heads. She\u2019d known things were strained, but she\u2019d had no idea how much. Their awkward hug just about broke her heart.</p><p>She realized Rick cared about his daughter. Anyone could hear the concern in his voice. And the yearning for affection was obvious in the teenager\u2019s face as she embraced her father\u2014when he couldn\u2019t see her.</p><p>Then they pulled apart and the blas\u00e9 expression was back on the girl\u2019s face again.</p><p>He stepped back and it was all Nola could do not to shove them both inside so the man could rest the legs he pushed too hard every day. \u201cYour mother\u2019s going to have a coronary.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to do better than that. Why aren\u2019t you with your friend? And where have you been for the rest of the week while you were supposed to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been following you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His so-quiet response spoke louder than any lion\u2019s roar.</p><p>Nola hung back, waiting by the SUV, delaying by searching in her purse\u2014nothing actually\u2014to give the father and daughter a moment\u2019s privacy.</p><p>Lauren finally fidgeted. Heck, Nola found herself fidgeting, too. She knew how tense Rick had been about his daughter. This news had to be rough.</p><p>\u201cGawd, Dad, it had been so long since we\u2019d seen each other. You\u2019d never been gone a year without at least coming home for a week. Never. So I called your squadron commander and pretended to be Mom. I found out what happened.\u201d Lauren\u2019s eyes outlined with mascara filled with tears. \u201cYou\u2019re a real jackass for not telling me, ya know?\u201d</p><p>Ouch. Looked as if Rick had raised his daughter to be just as plainspoken as him. That could work in their favor if Lauren was strong enough to wrestle the relationship from her father that she wanted. Or, it could mean there would be a lot of hurt feelings before the two of them were done with each other.</p><p>Either way, Nola couldn\u2019t wait to duck inside the house and take refuge from this battle of wills.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you\u2019re frustrated, but you can\u2019t talk to me that way, kiddo,\u201d he said with just the right amount of parental censure before looping his arm around her shoulder. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bull.\u201d She stared him down, defiant. No question where this kid got her strength. \u201cAnyhow, I decided if you wouldn\u2019t see me, I would see you. So I left New Hampshire and went to Texas. I even got a job as a waitress for a few days where I thought I could watch you. That gave me enough money to follow you here when you left after I\u2019d only been in town a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Fear sloshed over Nola like a tidal wave as she imagined all the things that could have happened to this child during the week she\u2019d spent on the road alone. No matter how steely Rick appeared, she could see the fears seething under the surface for him. A protectiveness she couldn\u2019t squash drew her nearer to the pair.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He cut the air with his hand. \u201cI understand you think you\u2019re being all grown-up, but you\u2019re damn lucky you\u2019re not dead. I love you, kid, but there\u2019s going to be some serious grounding over this stunt. Did you ever consider there might be some things going on that you know nothing about?\u201d</p><p>She furrowed her brow. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola.\u201d He gestured for her to close the rest of the gap between them. \u201cLauren, I would like for you to meet my...friend, Nola.\u201d</p><p>Friend? Nola turned the word around in her head. She could live with that description. Heaven knows she didn\u2019t expect him to announce to his daughter that they were lovers. As a matter of fact, she didn\u2019t know what they were. Friendship almost involved more intimacy and that knotted her stomach all over again at a time she really needed to get her head in the moment.</p><p>She was meeting Rick\u2019s child. This was important. Big-time.</p><p>She extended her hand. \u201cHi, Lauren. I\u2019m Nola Seabrook. Your dad and I met a long time ago when we were both TDY in Texas.\u201d</p><p>The teen offered her hand but her eyes offered no welcome. \u201cYeah. I saw you in Texas this week, too. You\u2019re the cookie lady.\u201d</p><p>Sheesh, the kid didn\u2019t have to make the cookies sound so...lame. How did teenagers manage to reduce competent adults that way?</p><p>\u201cLauren,\u201d Rick said in that low parental tone of his again.</p><p>Nola shook her head and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She shook the teen\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you and I would be glad to make you some of those cookies while you\u2019re here. You\u2019re very welcome in my home. I know you\u2019ll want to talk to your dad, so I\u2019m going to head inside and make up a bed for you.\u201d</p><p>Nola made tracks toward the front door, Rick\u2019s conversation with his daughter drifting on the marshy breeze.</p><p>\u201cLauren, you should have called. I\u2019m here helping Nola because she\u2019s got a stalker threatening her life. Now my attention will be cut in half watching over the two of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her shoulders slumped. \u201cOf course. You want me to go.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and slung his arm around her shoulders again, obviously trying his best in a situation that had no doubt thrown him for a loop. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go. You have to leave for your own protection.\u201d</p><p>Her head spinning with images of Rick with his daughter, Nola trudged up the steps into her house. He\u2019d handled the situation as well as any parent could when faced with a surly teenage runaway\u2014a child so obviously hungry for love.</p> <p>Nola snagged extra sheets from the linen closet. The sleeping arrangements would definitely change since they all couldn\u2019t sleep in the garage. She imagined what Rick would want in the way of security. He would insist on sleeping in her living room after all, and Lauren would sleep on a roll away in her office. He would undoubtedly make arrangements to send her home ASAP.</p><p>The girl\u2019s bravado hadn\u2019t come close to covering her heartbreak.</p><p>Nola clutched the sheets to her chest. She knew Rick would place a call to Lauren\u2019s mom and reserve a plane ticket for the girl. Meanwhile, the three of them would stick together like glue until Lauren had a seat on an airliner home.</p><p>No more hot tub moments. Nola had gotten her breathing space.</p><p>She should be happy. Instead she felt as if she\u2019d screwed up and lost something.</p> <p>Her phone jangled from across the room. She dropped the sheets on the sofa and rushed to snatch up the receiver in case Rick needed something more for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Seabrook.\u201d A low, electronically distorted voice eased over the line with insidious chill. \u201cDid you enjoy your flight today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Nola swallowed down a bilious dread and wished she had made arrangements with the phone company to have her calls traced. There could be no doubt but that her stalker had finally made contact. Did it mean he was getting more serious that he would risk a phone call? Things certainly felt more eerie, more horridly personal.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how you paid for that airplane with all your financial problems lately. Your new man friend, I assume. I watched you both from the field. If only I owned a shoulder-held rocket launcher...\u201d</p><p>He continued to talk about how he\u2019d enjoyed his view from the ground. His words looped over her like an icy noose around her body. Thank goodness her flight had been a last-minute decision. If she\u2019d planned ahead and somehow he\u2019d found out he could have sabotaged the plane in countless ways.</p><p>Her knees folded and she sank onto the sofa arm. She couldn\u2019t bear to think she would have caused Rick\u2019s death. As much as she craved his comfort, she also longed to tell him to leave, go anywhere far away from her, but she knew well nothing would peel him from her side now. His protector instincts were too deeply honed.</p> <p>As deep as her own, because she couldn\u2019t leave his side now that he needed her help with his daughter. Hmm. What an odd thought and God, her mind was wandering when she needed to focus on what this maniac was saying.</p><p>She wished the cops had tapped her phone, or that Rick was in the room with her. Now wasn\u2019t that the ultimate in selfish? She had no idea what she expected him to do, but she hated being alone with the mechanically altered voice. It could be anyone babbling on the other end of that line. A stranger.</p><p>Or someone she knew. \u201cSo you\u2019re finally ready to talk to me rather than hiding behind letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon we will talk face-to-face and you will remember me then. Your time is almost up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say we know each other.\u201d She shivered at the thought. Was it someone she faced on a daily basis? She wanted to scream. This person had filled her life with fear for long enough. \u201cBe a man and show yourself now. Who are you? Other than a coward who doesn\u2019t reveal his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a coward,\u201d he insisted with pompous indignation. \u201cA careful strategist.\u201d</p><p>She forced herself to stay calm and think, not to let fear overtake her. She could use this chance to gain information. \u201cWhat have I ever done to you to warrant you hijacking my life this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am reasonable. You will understand when we meet face-to-face.\u201d</p> <p>She wanted to shout her frustration. She\u2019d learned nothing except that she\u2019d met him. Although with stalkers, they could imagine a connection based on simply brushing arms in a crowd, interpreting an accidental exchanged look as having a secret code.</p><p>In essence, she\u2019d learned nothing. \u201cWhen will that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. Very soon.\u201d He went silent for a few crackly moments and she thought he\u2019d disconnected, then he continued, \u201cYou look quite lovely in that color of green, my dear. You really should choose it more often.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected.</p><p>Nola dropped the receiver as if it carried contamination. He knew what she wore. He\u2019d seen her. He was that close. She raced across the room, toward the front door. She had to tell Rick and Lauren to get the hell into the house. This man was seriously gunning for her, and now she\u2019d not only put Rick in danger...</p><p>But his innocent daughter\u2014a precious teenager whose beautiful eyes mirrored her father\u2019s\u2014was in the line of fire.</p><p>Rick had longed for the days when he had people to protect and save again, but he hadn\u2019t envisioned it quite this way. Now he had both Nola and Lauren to think about right at the time when the stalker seemed ready to make his move.</p><p>He had to keep Nola and Lauren safe as best he could. For the moment a large crowd seemed in order\u2014and on the day after Thanksgiving, an amusement park fit the bill. As much as he hated the crutches, a full day on asphalt necessitated he use the damned things.</p><p>The hot dog stand steamed a tempting smell to his left, a definite must in the very near future. Meanwhile, he made his way alongside Nola, his eyes firmly on Lauren a few steps ahead strolling past the Tilt-A-Whirl.</p><p>Rick had thought he\u2019d put his past behind him.</p><p>Hah.</p><p>All his honed instincts and training had come roaring back to the fore the second Nola had shown up at the garage apartment door, her face pale. Once he\u2019d heard about the bastard\u2019s call and threat, Rick had found his rescue training resurfacing with a speed that let him know he\u2019d been fooling himself. Injuries be damned, he couldn\u2019t deny who he was.</p><p>That Others May Live.</p><p>His only focus now was to keep Lauren and Nola out of the line of fire. The police had sworn there wasn\u2019t anything more they could do. He\u2019d stepped up the pace and spoken with Special Agent David Reis of the Air Force\u2019s OSI. They couldn\u2019t do anything immediate, either. The police were following up on the identity theft, but it was a slow process since the stalker was obviously more skilled than a first-time hacker.</p><p>Still, that phone call changed everything for him. The look on her face after the call had rattled his foundations, something that deeply hit home. She\u2019d battled too hard to survive her bout of cancer to be taken down by a faceless maniac. Rick refused to let that happen.</p><p>Hell. His chest pulled tight. He hadn\u2019t realized until just that moment how much her admission of nearly dying had affected him.</p><p>Breathe, damn it, breathe. He couldn\u2019t afford this kind of emotionalism, not now. He\u2019d made a promise to Nola, and he\u2019d made a promise to his child the day she was born.</p><p>He would keep both females safe or die trying.</p><p>They weren\u2019t staying at her place. First up, he\u2019d told Nola to pack a suitcase and meet him in the SUV. A quick trip to the ATM machine later and he headed out. Making sure he wasn\u2019t followed, he\u2019d found a hotel, paid cash in case the bastard was tracking his credit cards, and checked them in for the weekend until he could get Lauren on a plane back to her mother\u2019s. He\u2019d had to pull strings and stay in a dive to get around using a credit card, but he\u2019d made it work.</p><p>He\u2019d considered staying on base, but he would have to use a credit card there. And the bastard had tampered with her car in the parking lot at a military hospital.</p><p>Lauren had cried her eyes out. Stomped her feet. Slammed a door\u2014kicked the door. He\u2019d told her to save her tantrums. She could come for Christmas and they would talk then.</p><p>She\u2019d called him a liar since he\u2019d missed out on so many holidays in the past and the truth in her words had just about broken his heart. Keeping her alive was more important than hurt feelings.</p><p>So, now he was sticking to overpopulated places. Such as an amusement park.</p><p>Hauling his exhausted butt through thrill ride central, Rick figured if he kept the two females in his life busy and in large crowds, the unpredictability would up the safety odds. He wanted Lauren home safe and sound with her mom, but her mother simply said Lauren would run again, which Lindsay deemed more dangerous.</p><p>Tough. He was putting Lauren on a plane and Lindsay better sit watch over the girl 24-7 until he had Nola safe and could deal with his daughter.</p><p>Rick gritted his teeth against the frustration and the strain of walking through the park all day, even with his crutches maneuvering around tattooed inline skaters and parents loaded down with stuffed animal prizes.</p><p>Nola toyed with the straw in her soda cup after their lunch at the park. \u201cI guess if I mention you should sit down and rest that would fall on deaf ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter isn\u2019t going to love you less if you limp a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not go there again, Nola.\u201d He thumped ahead with his crutches, sidestepping a spilled box of popcorn. \u201cThe weekend dad gig leaves me cramming a lot into a short time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a parent at all. After putting my foot in my mouth yesterday, I\u2019ve vowed to mind my own business.\u201d</p><p>Now she decided on silence after the top had already been blown off his world and he could actually use some extra input?</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned wanting kids.\u201d He watched for her reaction, for her consent to continue. When a passing family caused he and Nola to pause, he skimmed a kiss over the top of her head for reassurance before continuing. \u201cI assume you meant with your ex-husband? Or is that too personal a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you and I stopped respecting each other\u2019s boundaries a long time ago.\u201d She stirred her straw through the ice, reminding him too vividly of how seductively she\u2019d drawn on her milk shake.</p><p>\u201cPretty damn much. Why not go ahead and go for broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I wanted children.\u201d Her eyes lingered on a mother ahead pushing a stroller while a toddler raced alongside with a balloon. \u201cHe kept putting it off. The timing wasn\u2019t right and so on. Thank God, though. We didn\u2019t need to have kids together with the way things ended up between us.\u201d She jerked to look at him. \u201cNo offense meant to you and your ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken. It certainly would have been easier if we could have stayed together.\u201d He gestured for his daughter to hold up while he stopped at a duck-shoot booth.</p><p>Lauren\u2014still sulking and \u201ctorturing\u201d him with the silent treatment\u2014leaned against the corner, feigning disinterest. He wondered what Nola thought of his child and wished he could play home videos of his daughter giggling as she chased bubbles. Smiling as she shared flowers. She\u2019d been such a happy, generous kid once upon a time... Now, she seemed determined to ignore Nola.</p><p>Was this how she treated Lindsay\u2019s Ben, who Lauren labeled a \u201cdweeb\u201d? If she behaved this way, it was no wonder they didn\u2019t get along.</p><p>Rick leaned on his elbows, took the toy gun and began popping the tin ducks.</p><p>Nola chewed her bottom lip. \u201cThere were, uh, other issues with Peter and me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain yourself.\u201d But he hoped she would keep talking anyhow since he found himself drawn to her no matter how much he tried to keep those boundaries shored up. He focused on the worn yellow waterfowl that had seen better days and downed the next, smaller row.</p><p>\u201cI look at your beautiful daughter and I...\u201d</p><p>He glanced over from his toy gun. \u201cThink \u2018what if.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, her blues eyes turning paler with the sheen of tears. She flung the drink into a nearby bin with extra force.</p><p>He only wanted to reopen a dialogue he\u2019d probably been too quick to shut down yesterday. Somehow he\u2019d gotten sidetracked and hurt her, the last thing he ever wanted to do. Time to detour them again.</p><p>Rick cashed in tokens for two medium-sized stuffed monkeys, one pink, one purple. He turned to the two women. \u201cLadies, pick your prize.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren rolled her eyes. \u201cHow lame.\u201d</p><p>He noticed her eyes lingered on the purple, so he passed the pink to Nola and searched for a distraction from the awkward moment caused by his currently bratty daughter.</p><p>Dead ahead waited the perfect distraction.</p><p>Rick tossed the purple monkey to Lauren and jerked his head toward the bullet drop. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He gathered his crutches from where they leaned against the booth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Nola cradled her monkey like a baby.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t catapult my body out of something soon I\u2019m going to go freaking nuts.\u201d An understatement if ever he\u2019d heard one.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t realized how much he missed the sensation until he looked at that ride, something so damn pathetic in comparison to what he used to do on the job. And here he stood, shaking on the crutches in anticipation of climbing onto a kid\u2019s carnival attraction. Talk about a revelation. He hadn\u2019t left his past behind at all. He\u2019d merely buried it under a mountain of determination to get through one day at a time.</p><p>Pausing on his crutches, he pivoted to his daughter, \u201cLauren, come on. The bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead without me.\u201d She stuffed her monkey under her armpit in a stranglehold and held out her hand in the universal \u201cgimme money\u201d plea. \u201cI want a funnel cake. I\u2019ll sit on the bench and wait.\u201d</p><p>Rick considered ordering her to join them, but that would start another eye rolling, slouching, foot stomping, sighing, ad nauseam teenage response of disgust. Why had she crossed multiple states in the first place if she hated him so much? \u201cFine. We\u2019ll meet you back here in five minutes and I\u2019ll be watching you. Stay by the security guard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll get an extra funnel cake for you and Nola.\u201d She wiggled her fingers. Money.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>While Nola settled into the ride, he passed his crutches to Lauren for safekeeping and climbed into the seat. A teenager lowered the safety bars from overhead to lock them in place for the hydraulic lift before they were dropped. He watched Lauren sit with her funnel cake, happily chatting away with a park security guard, then turned to Nola.</p><p>Chalky pale Nola? The afternoon sun beating down on them left no room for misinterpretation.</p><p>She pulled a wobbly smile. \u201cHave I mentioned that I hate heights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Nola. I just assumed you would like this too. You\u2019re a pilot for crying out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to land with wings. Not a nylon pillowcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me no. I could have ridden by myself\u2014or not at all. I\u2019m not a kid who would pitch a tantrum if I didn\u2019t get my treat.\u201d He looked around for a way to call this off, but the ride was already full ahead and behind them. They were seconds from launch. Still, he cupped his hands around his mouth to shout\u2014</p> <p>Nola put her hand on his arm. \u201cI want to share this with you. Let it go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been with enough newbie jumpers to know distraction worked best, so he started talking, while periodically checking on Lauren. \u201cI love to jump so much, sometimes I forget that others aren\u2019t as addicted to it as I am. My mother vowed I gave her a heart attack when I was only two. She found me on top of the garage, ready to jump. I leaped off fences, swing sets, slides, car tops, balconies...and that was before first grade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poor parents.\u201d Her eyes lit as brightly as her grin.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. I broke so many bones, they knew me on a first-name basis in the emergency room.\u201d He reached surreptitiously to take her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure my parents lived in fear of investigation by child services since I got hurt so often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you came by your call sign? Lurch\u2014like lurching forward?\u201d</p><p>The ride jerked as if in tandem with the word lurch. Her hand jerked in his. He linked their fingers tighter.</p><p>\u201cI wish. That would be far more dignified.\u201d The capsule started its ascent upward. \u201cOn my fifth jump, I started feeling\u2014how should I put it?\u2014too confident. I made my way toward the open hatch, ready to roll, certain I could take the elements...and I knocked myself unconscious heading out the door.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders jerked upward with a burst of laughter.</p><p>He nudged her foot with his as they rose higher and higher, the people below growing smaller. \u201cHey, at least my call sign\u2019s not \u2018Sewer.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmigod, I\u2019m not sure I want to know the story of how he got that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his defense, the coordinates were off so it wasn\u2019t his fault he landed in the sewage plant.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her head along the rest to stare at him with serious eyes as blue as the sky he missed. \u201cYou really do miss it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the jump.\u201d Or was there? He stared into those endless blue eyes of hers and\u2014</p><p>The bottom fell out. The capsule fell and his stomach welcomed the fall. Nola screamed, but a happy yelp so he allowed himself to savor the moment. His head thunked back, his eyes closed and...</p><p>Swoosh. The ride slowed as it eased to a stop all too soon. And that was it? Everything was over. He told himself the letdown came from the ride being so short, not a dissatisfaction from the experience. Parachuting took longer. That was the difference.</p><p>But inside him a voice niggled that there was something...missing. Something he didn\u2019t have time to explore now because he had to haul his butt out of the seat for the next person to take his or her turn.</p><p>He followed Nola onto the landing and forced a smile he didn\u2019t feel. \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>She kept her hand linked with his. \u201cPretty much like the first time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d And did he really want to know right now when he was chin deep in questions about his own response to this experience?</p><p>She pivoted on her heel to face him, no smile in sight but unflinching. \u201cMy stomach jolted and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was in a good or bad way, but there was no denying the reaction.\u201d</p><p>He might have a number of questions, but on this he completely agreed. \u201cAmen, lady.\u201d</p><p>Rick tucked a knuckle under her chin and tipped her face up as he ducked to skim his mouth over hers. Thing was, though, that he couldn\u2019t just taste. He always needed more when it came to this woman. The ride was never long enough, and he didn\u2019t mean sex.</p><p>Pulling back, he stared down into her eyes and wondered what to do with that revelation. Luckily, he had time to ponder it a while longer since Lauren served as one helluva chaperone. \u201cLet\u2019s find Lauren.\u201d</p><p>He took the steps slowly, arm looped over Nola\u2019s shoulder as he made his way back to the bench. His crutches rested exactly where he\u2019d left them...</p><p>But there was no sign of his daughter.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Nola thanked God and more than a few saints that Lauren was sleeping soundly in her hotel roll-out bed, her long dark hair splashed out over the pillowcase. Rick would take one of the double beds, while Nola slept on the other.</p><p>The ten minutes spent looking for the teenager at the amusement park had been the longest in Nola\u2019s life. She and Rick had notified the park authorities, called the police. Just as the all-out search kicked into high gear, they found Lauren walking out of one of the restrooms.</p><p>The cops and park officials gave Rick and Nola indulgent looks. Too protective, overreacting, hyper- vigilant. She\u2019d heard them whispering the judgmental assessments.</p><p>They didn\u2019t know the fear of being kidnapped. She did. And she\u2019d been an adult. She couldn\u2019t even bear the thought of that hell being lived out by a child. Rick\u2019s child.</p><p>Nola\u2019s hands trembled around her cup of instant hot cocoa from the hotel\u2019s coffeepot as she sagged into one of the chairs in the kitchenette area of the upscale dive crowded with bags since they didn\u2019t know how long they would be gone. She puffed cooling breaths into her mug while Rick adjusted the lighting, darkening the sleeping area and leaving only a small lamp on in the kitchen area.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked softly, dropping to sit in the chair beside her and propping his feet on the nearby mattress.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nudged a second mug of hot cocoa toward him, blown away anew by how much he\u2019d accomplished in a short time. It would be so easy to lean on a fella like this. \u201cNo. I\u2019m still freaked out from this afternoon. I know you\u2019re the one who should have the corner on the market for that since you\u2019re her father and I\u2019ve only known her a day. But ohmigod, Rick, I was so afraid I\u2019d caused something to happen to your precious child.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to grip her shoulder, his finger slipping inside her tank top to caress her bare skin with a hint of intimacy, even if they couldn\u2019t take things further with Lauren in the room. \u201cShe\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t need to worry. I won\u2019t let anything happen to either one of you.\u201d</p><p>She should be consoling him. His daughter had been missing. Still, she couldn\u2019t stop the shakes and guilt over the danger she\u2019d brought into his life. \u201cI appreciate your presence and your dedication. But you can\u2019t know that. Bad things can happen so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, babe. I know.\u201d He stroked back her hair. \u201cIs there something else going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile we thought Lauren had been kidnapped... it brought back some bad memories, more fallout from the job.\u201d She sipped a bracing drink from the generic black mug. \u201cI was taken captive on a mission in South America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly hell. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too long after you hurt yourself, actually. We were sent to Cartina to aid in a smash and grab, to bring out someone from a drug lord\u2019s compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your usual trash-hauling mission.\u201d He took the mug from the table and knocked back a swallow.</p><p>\u201cNot by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what went wrong?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t miss the dual intent in his eyes, concern for her and assessment, a need to understand on a professional level what had gone wrong as if perhaps he could have saved her. Would she have been rescued right away if someone like Rick had been sent out? She felt the shift inside her, the tiny voice whispering, Trust him.</p><p>\u201cOur squadron commander went for a walk and didn\u2019t come back. I got worried, didn\u2019t follow orders, went looking for him. Everything went to hell when a rival drug lord staged an attack. I was caught flat-footed there in the middle of a jungle war.\u201d</p><p>She downed the rest of her cocoa. \u201cDefinitely not my finest judgment moment, but you would have to know this commander. He was one of those who...well, he wasn\u2019t the warm fuzzy type. He micromanaged the hell out of us. Then all of sudden we hear he had this wife who died, except maybe she was alive after all. Suddenly he had this vulnerable chink like the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you worried when he didn\u2019t come back and went searching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And got caught in the middle of a turf war between two of the biggest badasses in Cartina.\u201d</p><p>The horror of it washed over her again.</p><p>\u201cWhich group caught you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group, but rather the leader of one group fleeing after his compound was overrun. Luckily, he didn\u2019t know I was military. I ditched my flight suit and just kept on my running shorts and the tank top I was wearing underneath. The last thing I wanted was to be identified as military to these guys.\u201d</p><p>Nola shivered. She\u2019d been under the knife so many times during her surgeries. She\u2019d never imagined landing in the hands of amoral animals who cut people for pleasure. \u201cI pretended to be an escaped captive of the other guy. I figured things would go better for me that way since I would have some value as a hostage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou think well on your feet.\u201d He set his mug aside and rested his elbows on his knees, leaning closer. \u201cYou\u2019re a tribute to the uniform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She shoved her mug out of the way and cupped his face. \u201cAnd no, I wasn\u2019t raped, in case you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>A long exhale rattled through him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask, but thank you for letting me know. I also know, though, that there are plenty of other horrors. It must have been a hellish time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRamon Chavez was a strange man.\u201d She sagged in the wingback chair. \u201cA brute on the one hand, but with these old world values on the other. He didn\u2019t think twice about slapping me around, but he never laid a sexual hand on me. It was as if he saw me as a rebellious daughter type and he was a tyrannical father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA father with a gun to your head.\u201d He gripped the arms of his chair with barely contained rage.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime was so weird, surreal, but basically about three days.\u201d Those days rolled through her memory again, the determination and the fear. Silence stretched now and she appreciated that Rick gave her the moment to digest those memories in this quiet room with nothing but the sound of the dripping faucet and Lauren\u2019s gentle snoring.</p> <p>Eventually\u2014she had no idea how much later\u2014he turned his mug around and around on the table and looked at her again.</p><p>\u201cHow were you rescued?\u201d More of that professional assessment gleamed through, but with a steely determination that he would have rescued her faster.</p><p>\u201cRescued? I got away from Chavez myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He blinked hard and fast. \u201cI apologize for underestimating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI managed to stay alive long enough to find a time to overpower him and escape.\u201d</p><p>She remembered well the thrill of that fight, the need for vengeance. It wasn\u2019t a pretty feeling to realize how vulnerable she was to someone like Chavez. She\u2019d been so close to plunging a knife between the man\u2019s ribs while he lay there unconscious.</p> <p>In the end, she\u2019d palmed the blade, hog-tied him and run for the nearest city where she knew a safe house waited. \u201cI bided my time and kicked Chavez\u2019s butt. He died later in a tunnel collapse trying to infiltrate an airbase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is justice in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d The death seemed too easy for all the grief he\u2019d caused so many. \u201cAlthough I would have preferred to see him stand trial for all the havoc he wreaked on people\u2019s lives. I figure that just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were denied your closure,\u201d he offered with an insight she hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a perceptive comment, especially for a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a man? And that\u2019s quite a sexist remark, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d Yipes. Open mouth, insert foot. \u201cI have to confess I haven\u2019t had much experience with men in touch with their emotions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll \u2019fess up. They made me go through all sorts of brain-probe sessions during rehab. I\u2019m full of cool, psychologically sensitive catch phrases.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be flip about this, please. It feels good to have you say something like that, to have someone understand, because, you\u2019re right.\u201d She could get used to having someone like Rick around. \u201cI didn\u2019t get my closure with the jerk who held me hostage. I may have knocked him out and run away, but I wanted to kick the crap out of him for how helpless he made me feel.\u201d</p><p>It had been like a return to the hospital, at the mercy of cancer, not knowing if she would live or die, her options of fighting back limited. A totally hellish trot down memory boulevard.</p><p>Her hand fell to rest on his thigh. \u201cWe military types don\u2019t deal well with the whole helpless thing.\u201d</p><p>They shared a silent understanding, a link.</p><p>She could see that, all sensitivity aside, he wouldn\u2019t outright admit how much it bothered him. So she would say the words for him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible experience losing control that way. But in a really strange, twisted way, it was also a liberating experience because I found my strength again.\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cNo. Wait. I learned to trust my strength. I would wish that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you deliberately being dense or you just slow today? We\u2019re in two different situations. I\u2019m not going to have my old life back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll build a new one.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Sensitivity was long gone. Rick looked downright pissed. \u201cHow would you have felt if someone said that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I can still fly an airplane doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m the same person. I lost a part of myself during that process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss. I know you went through hell and you\u2019re an amazing woman to have come back. But that\u2019s you and this is me. I\u2019m not comfortable with the preaching. So if you value our roomie status, we need to end this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a long speech for a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take it to heart.\u201d He shoved to his feet, his eyes already on his bed and apparently leaving her to hers. \u201cI must really mean it.\u201d</p><p>How strange that just when she realized she didn\u2019t want her space after all, Rick decided to rebuild his walls again.</p><p>Even a year later as he lay in the comfort of his hotel bed in historic downtown Charleston, Ramon Chavez could still taste the mud of the collapsed tunnel pummeling him. Even with the luxury of the high-class accommodations he\u2019d sprung for, he couldn\u2019t rid himself of the suffocating stench of fear as he\u2019d clawed his way through to daylight. Having people think he\u2019d died proved quite beneficial, however. He could move around with stealth to gain his revenge on those who\u2019d caused him such pain.</p><p>One person in particular topped his list, a woman who had emasculated him, stolen his honor by taking him down in a fight. Honor, his manliness, those were everything to him and until he killed Nola Seabrook, he couldn\u2019t regain his true self.</p><p>Once Rick DeMassi\u2019s daughter had arrived, Ramon thought he would have a new tool to torture them, then...poof. They\u2019d disappeared. His frustration had grown since that Rick had lost him with his fancy driving techniques. Where were they while he cooled his heels?</p><p>Ramon clicked off the remote control and tossed it aside onto the end table. He still couldn\u2019t believe his bad luck in seeing the teenage girl from the diner in Texas show up here. What if she remembered him? If she saw him here and recalled him from before, the mention could set off alarms to Nola and her friend. Time to lie low and quit trying to follow them around.</p><p>He snorted. A convenient plan since he\u2019d lost them anyway.</p><p>Still, he could set some additional traps in place for the final showdown, because eventually, they would have to return home. And when they did he would be ready for Nola.</p><p>This time away had actually played right into his hands.</p><p>Ramon grabbed the other pillow and stuffed it under his head, simply for comfort, not because his body nearing sixty years old was starting to creak. He kept in prime condition with workouts in the hotel gym and swimming pool.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t underestimate Nola as he had in South America. She was a strong woman. This time, he would weaken his opponent. He didn\u2019t know where they were now, but he did know\u2014thanks to his skill at charming a secretary in Nola Seabrook\u2019s squadron\u2014that her unit had planned a Thanksgiving weekend party at a local hangout, Beachcombers Bar and Grill. He only needed to poison Nola with a mild dose, just enough to slow her and dip the odds in his favor so she couldn\u2019t fight back so fiercely.</p><p>This time, he would accept nothing but total victory. And he would take down anyone who stood with her.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Keeping his emotional distance from Nola proved tougher and tougher when she looked so damn hot. Rick lounged against the dock outside of Beachcombers Bar and Grill and watched her throw back her head and laugh with her flyer pals.</p><p>The Saturday-night noise swelled with the engagement party for the Squadron Commander, Carson Hunt, and his fianc\u00e9e Nikki Price. Her friends made him feel welcome, but he could only take so much of this world before he needed to pull his head together.</p><p>He could take a free moment for himself, knowing his daughter was safe with Nola and all her crew dog buddies at the party. Nola had kept his daughter glued to her side regardless of where she went and musical Lauren would enjoy the band pulsing away beach tunes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the water called to his soul, moonlight stretching a silvery channel for him to swim, to slice his arms through for hours on end. The ocean, the place where he\u2019d felt most in control since he was a teenager diving into the surf to drown out the sound of his arguing parents. His ability to swim had stayed with him, even after the accident. In rehab he\u2019d been able to outswim his therapists. The discovery had been a bright spot during months of hell.</p><p>Memories rained down on him like the gentle mist falling from the sky. Of dropping out of a helicopter into a stormy ocean to rescue an unconscious fighter pilot who\u2019d ejected. Icy water, waves engulfing him.</p><p>He\u2019d lost count of how many he\u2019d lifted free over the years.</p><p>A thud, thud, thud on the dock interrupted his thoughts. He glanced over his shoulder and saw one of Nola\u2019s crew members walking toward him, the in-flight mechanic...Rick searched for the guy\u2019s name and could only come up with his call sign. Mako.</p><p>Mako called, \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind if I join you.\u201d</p><p>More like Nola must have sent the guy to look out for him and make sure he felt included.</p><p>\u201cJust checking out this peaceful place.\u201d It was all he could do not to dive off the dock right now. With any luck the storm clouds overhead would open and churn up the ocean for a wilder ride. \u201cGreat spot for fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace is in short supply these days for us folks in uniform.\u201d The easygoing guy pulled up alongside him and leaned against the dock, drinking his beer.</p><p>\u201cNot for me. I\u2019m out of the field for good.\u201d When would that get easier to say?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me sir anymore. These legs won\u2019t be holding me up out in the field.\u201d But in the water he could hold his own. Except his job called for more than the water.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, sir.\u201d</p><p>They shared a laugh, then clanked drinks together\u2014his soda, Mako\u2019s beer. Rick sure could have used one but couldn\u2019t afford to dull his senses so he settled for a plain Coke tonight.</p><p>\u201cFor an easygoing guy, you\u2019re surprisingly stubborn, Sergeant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my mama says.\u201d Mako rolled his beer bottle between his hands. \u201cYou earned the sir for life. No bum leg\u2019s gonna take that away.\u201d</p><p>Rick grunted, flicking a shell from the dock railing into the murky water below. Plop.</p><p>\u201cSir, no disrespect meant, but I was in a barracks bombing over there. My best friend left behind a widow and two little girls who don\u2019t have a father to walk them down the aisle some day.\u201d</p><p>Rick stayed quiet, winging a prayer for that family. Too easily it could have been Lauren without a father. He\u2019d worked his butt off to get back on his feet again so he could walk her down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cI met your daughter up there. She\u2019s a great kid.\u201d</p><p>Unspoken message received. He would get to walk his daughter down the aisle. \u201cI\u2019m guessing your call sign was never \u2018Subtle.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. And I apologize if I\u2019m overstepping. It\u2019s been a helluva year for all of us.\u201d Mako scratched a thin scar just beside his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve learned time is too precious to waste even valuable minutes being subtle.\u201d He elbowed Rick in the side. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re in any shape to whup my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\u201d Rick stared him down with his best whup-ass glare while ever-so-slowly bringing his glass to his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>About ten seconds later Mako fidgeted. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re good with that psychological ops crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo PSYOPS about it. I may not be much on land, but I\u2019m betting on even odds if I knock you into the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn. I actually believe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSmart man.\u201d Rick couldn\u2019t help but look at the scar that man carried. They all had burdens to work through. \u201cAbout a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>Mako\u2019s shoulders relaxed as he went off attention mode and took a swig of his beer. \u201cI take it to mean we\u2019re not going swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d He clinked drinks again as the rain picked up pace. \u201cWe\u2019d better head back inside.\u201d</p><p>Mako nodded and Rick turned his back on the open water with no little regret.</p><p>He got the message that he needed to be there for his daughter now, no more waiting for perfect legs. He would never be the perfect man, perfect father. But where did he fit into her world? Hell, where did he fit into Nola\u2019s world, for that matter? Just being here tonight made him burn for things he could never have again. The water made him think he could do more.</p> <p>Except until he could figure out how to fit into her world, he needed to stick to his original thoughts going into this night. He couldn\u2019t afford to take things further with her.</p><p>And for some reason, that stabbed at him more than it had at the beginning of the evening.</p><p>Nola picked at the plate of chili-cheese fries in front of her as she sat with Lauren. The whole engagement party had been a blast\u2014heavy finger food, live music and dancing. Noisy and fun, just the sort of squadron party they all enjoyed. She could see Lauren\u2019s foot tapping under the table even though the teen kept her standard \u201clife sucks\u201d expression plastered on her face.</p><p>And gauging by Rick\u2019s wandering off down the dock now that the rain muted the stars, apparently Lauren inherited her moodiness from her dad. Thank heavens for good old Mako, who\u2019d enticed him to head back once the storm kicked up. The two were now ambling back along the pier toward the party.</p><p>Nola shifted her attention to Lauren again. \u201cSweetie, can I get you something else to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even want me here,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>Nola struggled for the right thing to say, but she didn\u2019t have any experience with teens. And why did teens layer three spaghetti strap tops that still showed their bra straps? \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p><p>Lauren simply stared at her with that same \u201cduh\u201d look her father got. \u201cI show up and the first thing he does is book me a flight home.\u201d</p><p>Nola leaned forward and pointed with a French fry. \u201cBe reasonable, kiddo. I\u2019ve got a stalker gunning for me and because of me, your dad\u2019s in the cross-hairs, too. He doesn\u2019t want you to get hurt. You can\u2019t fault him for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe barely even hugged me.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>The kid had a point there and Nola wanted to kick Rick. \u201cOkay, his reception wasn\u2019t the warmest, but you have to admit you caught him off guard\u2014and you scared the bejesus out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBejesus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an old, out-of-style lady. What can I say? But you get my point. Think about it.\u201d Nola popped the fry into her mouth.</p><p>Lauren\u2019s arms relaxed along with her practiced expression. \u201cYou aren\u2019t even going to try and fake me out?\u201d She actually reached for a fry, shaking her head. \u201cWow, you just won cool points on that alone. Okay. Yeah. My dad ignores me and it hurts.\u201d</p><p>The teen stuffed a fry oozing cheese in her mouth, then another, taking her time chewing. Nola stayed quiet, giving her time to think and gather her words rather than pushing.</p><p>Finally Lauren swallowed and reached for her fork to stab up some of the chili...or rather just stab at the pile and not lift anything. \u201cBut I\u2019m like him. If something hurts, I just get right up in that hurt\u2019s face and stand it down. I\u2019m not quitting. I want my dad in my life and not that lame-butt stepdad my mother has picked out for me. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a lot like Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough luck for me, huh?\u201d Lauren dropped her fork with a clank.</p><p>\u201cNo, Lauren.\u201d Nola reached across to take her hand before the kid could wrap her arms around herself defensively again. \u201cIt\u2019s the luckiest break you ever got. You\u2019re a fighter and a winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met me, like, two days ago.\u201d She didn\u2019t hold hands back but she didn\u2019t pull away, the long-fingered hand with nails painted alternating colors of pink and green to match the teen\u2019s shirts\u2014two of the three tank tops, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a quick people reader.\u201d She squeezed Lauren\u2019s hand with a reassurance she hoped the girl would accept and believe. \u201cAnd your father has told me a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>Her eager look just about tore Nola\u2019s heart in two. Then Lauren went all blas\u00e9 teen again. \u201cSo, like, what did he say?\u201d</p><p>She started to share the things she knew Lauren wanted to hear, things that would make the girl like her as the bearer of good news... Then she stopped. This wasn\u2019t her place. As much as she wanted to bond with Rick\u2019s daughter, it would have to be done another way. She knew the right words to say now.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you and your father have spoken through intermediaries and telephones far too often, in my opinion. If you want to know what he said, you should go right to him and ask him. Not call him. Talk to him face to face. Because he doesn\u2019t use a lot of words, but those eyes of his speak darn near soliloquies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoliloquies? My old man? Are you sure we\u2019re talking about the same person? Rick DeMassi, big fella. Weight lifter, military dude who thinks conversation involves \u2018pass the potatoes, please.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be him. My guess would be if you looked at him when he said that, you would see those big brown eyes saying he was sorry for all the meals he missed.\u201d</p><p>And that was as much as she would reveal. Hopefully enough to nudge the girl into a real, face-to-face conversation with her father.</p><p>She\u2019d tried her best to help them both rebuild their family. But would they have a place for her?</p><p>Rick thunked himself down in a chair beside Nola, not a hundred percent comfortable with the fact that his teenage daughter was dancing with the lieutenants. But they weren\u2019t putting hands on her. Their dancing seemed appropriate.</p><p>And they seemed very aware of his glaring.</p><p>Scowl on.</p><p>He wanted to blame his daughter\u2019s dancing for the itchy sensation along his neck, but his instincts blared something more was going on here.</p><p>They were being watched.</p><p>Not something concrete he could call the cops and report. He searched the crowd, the perimeter, the trees, and could see nothing amiss. He could only sit and go quietly nuts.</p><p>\u201cRick?\u201d Nola nudged his elbow. \u201cHello? Are you in there?\u201d</p><p>He forced a smile. No need worrying her about something neither of them could change. He would just keep Nola and Lauren under close watch at all times. \u201cJust reminiscing. Here we are, back in a bar again. I wish I could take you dancing.\u201d</p><p>Her hand closed over his, her eyes so full of caring his neck crinked up. \u201cI don\u2019t need to dance. I have crummy rhythm and look pretty much like a gangly duck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. I\u2019ve seen you dance before, if you recall, and you\u2019re graceful and sexy as all get-out, lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She met his eyes straight on and let him see the unveiled emotion in her eyes. \u201cI would rather sit here with you than dance, and that\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, wanting things lighthearted the way they\u2019d been that first night. Just for now. \u201cMust be the chili-cheese fries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found me out.\u201d She reached across the table to take his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve already said all the wrong things. What does that leave for us to say this go-round?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let him off that easy. But then that was one of the things he\u2019d always liked about this woman, her grit.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d He flipped his hand to link fingers with hers. \u201cMore of that honesty I guess.\u201d</p><p>Even under the cover of the bar porch, the mist clung to her skin, giving her a glow he wanted to taste. She shivered\u2014from his watchful eyes or the chill, he didn\u2019t know, but he shucked his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.</p><p>She burrowed deep into the denim coat. \u201cWell, we both are certain you won\u2019t leave me unsatisfied in bed.\u201d</p><p>Memories of making love snapped between them, along with the fact that they couldn\u2019t be together that way again as long as Lauren shared a room with them.</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cI like your bluntness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God somebody does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ex didn\u2019t?\u201d He wanted to find the bastard, tie him to a tree and leave him there to be afraid for a good long time. Some things were worse than punches.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about him. Even thinking about him makes me ill.\u201d</p><p>She looked pale in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d This whole ordeal with the stalker had to be wearing on her. \u201cWe should probably wrap this up and take Lauren home anyway.\u201d</p><p>Nola rubbed her thumb over his knuckles in a teasing caress. \u201cYou don\u2019t care for how the lieutenants are checking out your daughter.\u201d</p><p>She had that right.</p><p>He tried to make light. \u201cI refuse to acknowledge it\u2019s even happening.\u201d</p><p>At least she would be back at her mother\u2019s tomorrow, which would take a huge burden of worry off his shoulders.</p><p>Nola jabbed her fork into the cheese and chili congealed on top of the leftover fries. \u201cHave you considered letting Lauren live with you at the start of second semester? Once things have settled out here and you\u2019ve got a place of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not equipped to be her father full-time,\u201d he answered with his standard response.</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that, but what if you don\u2019t have a choice?\u201d Nola set aside her fork. \u201cYou are her father and she needs you. Maybe you could settle close to her mother in...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Hampshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you lived there, it would be easier with her mother close by.\u201d She leaned on an elbow, closer to him, peering into his eyes. \u201cHey wait, you big fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He tipped back his chair, away from her too perceptive gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou do so want her to live with you. You\u2019re just scared to death.\u201d</p><p>Scared? He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. Or the niggling sense that she might be right.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scared of failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, it took you this long to figure that one out.\u201d The woman was too observant for her own good. Being around her would be work on his part. He wouldn\u2019t get away with jack. \u201cYou must be a flipping rocket scientist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be an ass just because I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d As well he should, but damn, couldn\u2019t she cut him some slack?</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. I know it hurts when someone hits a nerve. Rick, you\u2019ve been given a second chance, not to live the life you had before, but to start a whole new one. Make it count.\u201d</p><p>She was right. So right it cut deep. He needed time to let her words shuffle around in his mind until he could come up with a plan. He wouldn\u2019t make promises to Lauren until he was certain he could keep them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s table this discussion for now.\u201d He scraped back his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s late, and Lauren\u2019s flight leaves early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me say goodbye to the happy couple and I\u2019ll join you at the car.\u201d</p><p>He did a walk-around of the car, checking the undercarriage and beneath the hood for a bomb. Deciding all looked clear, he joined Nola waiting by her door. \u201cWe\u2019re set.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd safe. Thank you for all you\u2019re doing for me. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve said that. You\u2019ve certainly gotten more than you could have known when you signed on.\u201d</p><p>He skimmed his fingers over her unbelievably soft curls. \u201cYou\u2019re more woman than anyone could have known.\u201d</p><p>He braced his hands on either side of Nola and leaned in to kiss her. The familiarity, the rightness of it all caught him square in the gut.</p> <p>Was this a second chance, too? He\u2019d been so certain he should keep his distance, but what if...</p><p>He eased back and stared at Nola\u2019s beautiful face that offered him sky-blue eyes to dive headfirst into for as long as he chose....</p><p>The sound of revving cars reminded him they stood in a public place, with people all around. Not the time for these thoughts or to carry this any further.</p><p>Rick stepped back and shouted over his shoulder. \u201cLauren, hurry up, kiddo, we\u2019re ready to roll outta here.\u201d</p><p>He opened Nola\u2019s door for her, closed it behind her and made his way around the hood. Just as he reached for the door handle...</p> <p>Nola\u2019s scream split the night.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Fiery pain lanced up her foot. Had she stepped on a needle? No. It felt too deep. Too horrible.</p><p>A knife?</p><p>But the agony felt more like fire flaming from her foot up her ankle.</p><p>\u201cTurn on the light,\u201d she panted, even as the overhead dome already blazed.</p> <p>Rick leaped across his seat. Before she could gather herself to search the floorboard, Rick\u2019s curse filled the vehicle. He grabbed her by the shirt and hauled her across the seat, out his side, shouting, \u201cLauren, get away from the car. Now! Scorpions.\u201d</p><p>Scorpions?</p><p>No wonder her foot hurt. She\u2019d worn open-toed shoes out of vanity to show off her painted toenails. Her mind raced. Thank God, Lauren had worn those clunky\u2014ugly as all get-out\u2014boots. Had she even gotten in the car?</p><p>Were there scorpions in the dirt? But they didn\u2019t have the creatures here. Her mind fogged. From the fear or toxin, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Still, she forced herself to think of the others. Rick always wore boots these days, too, for the extra support. They would hopefully be fine.</p><p>By the time she finished those thoughts, the three of them were in the parking lot and Rick was barking instructions. \u201cCheck your pants. Be sure nothing crawled up inside.\u201d</p><p>Her skin fired at the mere thought.</p><p>His hands began patting her down. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, Nola. You\u2019re going to be okay. I\u2019ll get you to the hospital in minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Already a crowd gathered around her and Mako rushed to the front holding out his keys for them to use, while Rick barked instructions to secure the area in case any scorpions had crawled out of the vehicle. How long did she have? She tried to remember from her instruction in survival school after pilot training, but holy crap, there had to be like a thousand different kinds and just breathing evenly took all her energy as Rick scooped her up in his arms. One fact blared through the panic.</p><p>Her stalker had struck again.</p><p>The next morning, Rick wished he could pace in the hospital\u2019s waiting area. That would work off some of his nervous energy, but his legs wouldn\u2019t cooperate. Instead he was stuck waiting in one of the uncomfortable industrial chairs that was half a size too small for him while he waited for Nola to finish her release processing after her night spent in the hospital.</p><p>At least he\u2019d gotten Lauren on a plane home with hurried, but surprisingly comfortable goodbyes. And Lauren had seemed nearly as shaken as him by Nola\u2019s trip to the E.R.</p><p>He\u2019d spoken to Lauren the minute she\u2019d landed in Atlanta. Now he just needed to hear that she\u2019d made it to New Hampshire and back into her mother\u2019s safekeeping.</p><p>The electric doors swished open, a cool burst of air from outside swirling in along with three of Nola\u2019s squadron friends he\u2019d met at the party the night before.</p><p>The in-flight mechanic, Mako; the wiry genius junk-food-junkie pilot, Crusty; and the football-player-looking pilot, Bronco.</p><p>Rick shoved to his feet, determined to meet them on even footing.</p><p>Crusty pulled up to a stop in front of him. \u201cHow\u2019s Nola doing?\u201d</p><p>Rick nodded toward Bronco. \u201cHis flight doc wife has cleared her to leave, but stay on bed rest. Nola\u2019s checking out now.\u201d</p><p>The three men eyed him, chests puffing like a line of overprotective brothers. Yeah, they were all posturing, but he could see the genuine concern in their eyes, and since he cared what happened to Nola, too, he couldn\u2019t fault them. Suddenly he realized one of these guys wasn\u2019t married. Sure, Mako was enlisted and that was taboo for dating, but that didn\u2019t stop plenty of people in the military.</p><p>Possessiveness pumped through him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her from here.\u201d Rick stepped forward, pulling himself to his full height, only Bronco matching him in inches, but not a chance did the easygoing guy equal him in intensity when it came to seeing to this woman\u2019s well-being.</p><p>Mako nodded slowly. \u201cSo that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p><p>Rick narrowed his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not answering that and I don\u2019t want any gossip about her.\u201d</p><p>Bronco grinned and clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cWell hell, now we have to like you.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Apparently, he\u2019d been accepted into their brotherhood. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her you stopped by. I\u2019m sure it will mean a lot to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait.\u201d Crusty nodded and the Three Musketeers found their seats.</p><p>Uh-huh. They were curious about him. He could see it in their eyes. He understood about squadron unity. He\u2019d lived it and he missed it every single day.</p><p>Right now more than ever the craving for his old life razored through him.</p><p>Everyone sat around, no one speaking and Rick wasn\u2019t ponying up information until he had a handle on what they wanted from him. A TV droned in the background. A phone rang at the nurses\u2019 station. The low buzz of conversations hummed in corners of the industrial chairs.</p><p>Finally Bronco leaned forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with this stalker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really should talk to David Reis at the OSI, or better yet, Nola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t talking to us. Out of misplaced pride or sheer recklessness, I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re worried for her.\u201d</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t she tell them? That didn\u2019t make sense. These were obviously her friends. He sorted through the events of the night and he was certain none of them could have planted the scorpions. They\u2019d arrived before he and Nola and they\u2019d been a fixture at a table near Carson and Nikki all evening.</p><p>Why then would she depend on a watchdog she barely knew with a broken body over her able-bodied friends? More of the pride?</p><p>Misplaced pride. Her life could well be at stake. Sure she would probably be pissed with him if she found out, but he didn\u2019t intend to bypass help that could well keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cThe guy\u2019s ramping up his threat level. He started out with letters. Then rigged her car to blow. When she got home, she found a box of candy on her bed, opened so that only her favorites were left in the box.\u201d</p><p>Crusty\u2019s foot propped on his knee twitched in perpetual itchy motion. \u201cSounds like this bastard is a master at psychological torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even close to finished. Next he rigged all her credit cards and bank account so she had no money. That threw me because I expected his next move to be another attempt on her life. This seemed like a step back. That made me think. Nola is very much a woman of habit. She always does things the same way. So perhaps he knew she would turn on her car by the remote control. Maybe he didn\u2019t mean to kill her then because he knew she would use the remote. He merely wanted to scare her. That made sense, because then taking her money was a step closer because she couldn\u2019t replace her vehicle.\u201d</p><p>Crusty\u2019s twitchy foot paused. \u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called, using a voice-altering device, but clearly sounded male. He made it doubly clear he\u2019s done playing and is ready to move.\u201d</p><p>Bronco cracked his knuckles. \u201cSomehow he knew about the squadron gathering. God, it can\u2019t be one of us.\u201d</p><p>Crusty\u2019s foot picked up its nervous energy pace again. Did the guy mainline sugar? \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Reis regardless. We\u2019ve worked together on some...uh... projects before,\u201d he finished vaguely. Apparently there was more to this guy than met the eye.</p><p>All that aside, Rick had to focus on today. A lot could happen in the twenty-four hours until Monday morning. \u201cI want this bastard caught. I\u2019m tired of waiting around for the cops to do nothing. And I\u2019m tired of watching for him to make his move when Nola\u2019s at risk every second this guy remains free.\u201d</p><p>Bronco finished cracking the knuckles on his other beefy fist. \u201cDude, I\u2019m with you on that. This sicko sounds like he enjoys the game a little too much.\u201d</p><p>An idea came to life in Rick\u2019s mind. His hands clenched in fists in anticipation of leveling the bastard, face-to-face.</p><p>Crusty\u2019s foot dropped off his knee. \u201cWhoa, are you thinking what I believe you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you want to lure this bastard out and catch him on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t kill him.\u201d Rick held up his hands in defense\u2014even though he wanted to throttle the stalker. But he wasn\u2019t a lawless creep like the man who\u2019d made Nola\u2019s life a living hell. \u201cThat would be illegal, after all. And I\u2019ve sworn to uphold the beliefs of my country.\u201d As much as he wanted the man dead, he couldn\u2019t turn his back on his honor. But he would protect those he loved.</p><p>Loved?</p><p>Loved.</p><p>Hell yes, he loved her. He loved her grit, her humor, her tender heart, her passion. Most of all he loved the way she challenged him. She was one helluva woman. And he couldn\u2019t let another day go by without doing something to make sure this bastard left her alone.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t kill him unless the bastard guns for Nola first.\u201d He thought of the sheer agony this criminal had put Nola through these past weeks. \u201cBut I will make his life hell before turning him over to authorities.\u201d</p><p>Crusty nodded. \u201cThen you are thinking exactly what I imagined.\u201d He looked at pensive Mako on his left and oversize Bronco on his right. Both nodded. \u201cWant some help?\u201d</p><p>The camaraderie kicked right over him in a way he hadn\u2019t felt since his days as a part of a pararescue team. He\u2019d known he missed it. He just hadn\u2019t realized how starved he was until this second.</p><p>A man didn\u2019t operate as well alone as he did in a team. He knew that, damn it. So what had he been trying to accomplish this past year in turning his back on his family? His child?</p><p>What if Nola had shown up on his doorstep twelve months ago? He would have been too much of a moron to recognize the best thing to ever walk into his life all because of his messed-up view of what made a hero.</p><p>A solid team built itself on the strengths of a cohesive group. He had something of value to offer. He was one helluva leader and here were men asking to take on the task.</p><p>Rick extended his hand to the three men in front of him, sealing the deal one handshake at a time. \u201cI welcome the help, but I don\u2019t want to worry Nola while she\u2019s recovering.\u201d He remembered how close Nola had come to dying, a thought that shook him in his boots. \u201cLet me get her checked out of the hospital and settled in at the hotel again where I know she\u2019s safe. We can meet outside her room by the pool and map out some plans while she sleeps.\u201d</p><p>A cleared throat sounded from across the room. A distinctively feminine sound.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>Rick didn\u2019t need to be a master detective to realize they were busted. He pivoted on his heel and sure enough, there stood Nola, pale but still totally curvaceously hot in surgical scrubs with tousled hair. Her bandaged foot reminded him again how close he\u2019d come to losing her\u2014permanently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She perched a hand on her hip. \u201cExcuse me, but Nola\u2019s already awake and very much pissed off over being excluded.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Nola hobbled on her heel toward the cluster of males. She hated how her aching foot put her at a disadvantage. She wanted to stride, act confident, be in control, but doggone it, the scorpion sting hurt.</p> <p>Her brain stumbled over the notion that Rick must feel this way all the time\u2014at a disadvantage as he limped through life, robbed of the physical edge he\u2019d worked so hard to achieve in his chosen profession.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very curious about these \u2018plans\u2019 of yours.\u201d Nola swatted Rick on the back of the shoulder. \u201cAnd very curious about why you felt the need to keep this a secret from me.\u201d</p><p>What was up with their testosterone dance? These three flyboys were supposed to be on her side.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the big brother act, guys, but it\u2019s not needed. I\u2019m feeling much better now.\u201d A bit of an overstatement, but at least she was on her feet again. \u201cRick\u2019s not here to do anything but scare off the bogeyman.\u201d</p><p>Crusty hooked an arm around her shoulders. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he know you\u2019re quite capable of fighting bogeymen on your own?\u201d</p> <p>Rick slid his arm around her shoulders and inched her away from the man. \u201cYes, he does, but there\u2019s strength in numbers.\u201d</p><p>His words took her by surprise, this different style of thinking from Rick than she\u2019d heard since they reconnected that week. Was he starting to see possibilities for himself after recovery? A way back to really living again? Something wonderful to consider.</p><p>Nola elbowed him in the side. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to ditch me in the hotel room while you \u2018boys\u2019 make your plans.\u201d</p><p>His three cohorts pretended a sudden interest in a televised church service on the waiting room TV.</p><p>Rick tucked her closer. \u201cYou almost died last night. If you\u2019d been alone, you very well could have died before help arrived and transported you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>She heard the concern in his voice and it touched her heart in places that had been cold for far too long. Except she couldn\u2019t let him take over her life. She could accept his help\u2014all of their help\u2014but she had to be a part of the process. \u201cI\u2019m a lot stronger than I look, and this is my life we\u2019re talking about. Maybe I don\u2019t want you putting your life in danger for me any longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>She stepped away from his protective hold. \u201cI\u2019m not backing down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, neither am I.\u201d Rick\u2019s smile faded.</p><p>Bronco grinned and slung an arm over Mako\u2019s and Crusty\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAh man, this is gonna get good. I wish they served popcorn with the show.\u201d</p><p>Nola silenced them with her best glare, then continued. \u201cI appreciate the help, but here\u2019s how I predict this is going to shake down. Since Lauren\u2019s no longer in the picture here, now that she\u2019s on the plane to her mother\u2019s, we\u2019re going back to my place.\u201d</p><p>Rick started to step forward, paused, sighed. Put his hands on his h*ps and hung his head. \u201cDamn it, you have to realize this bastard is ready to make his move. The police aren\u2019t going to offer any more protection than before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d And of course it scared her. Only a fool wouldn\u2019t be frightened. \u201cBut I believe this maniac will find me no matter where I go. Why prolong the torture of waiting and wondering?\u201d</p><p>Rick put both his hands on her arms and pulled her to his chest. \u201cTo give the cops more time to figure out who this guy is. You\u2019re safer at a hotel. We\u2019re going to arm ourselves and be ready. It\u2019s all we can do.\u201d</p> <p>His chest felt so good and broad and a perfect resting place after weeks of being on her own facing this fear. Her foot hurt. Her heart hurt. But she wouldn\u2019t be shoved aside.</p><p>She pushed back. \u201cYou\u2019re not cutting me out, Rick.\u201d</p><p>His jaw jutted. \u201cYou\u2019re a wounded trooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m wounded, not incapacitated. Don\u2019t you remember how it feels not to be able to get into the action? Don\u2019t do this to me. If we\u2019re back at my house, at least we have the familiarity of the terrain on our side and you gain the advantage of having an extra warrior. Me.\u201d</p><p>She stared him down and she could see that he would agree, but only because she\u2019d given him no choice.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Rick said. \u201cYou can have a role\u2014within reason. But one sign of wavering on your feet and I\u2019m tossing your butt in bed.\u201d</p><p>Her heart throbbed even more than her wounded foot\u2014and that was pretty damn bad. What kind of future would she have with this man if he always insisted on pushing her aside? Would he be able to open up to his daughter? And what if the day came when the adoption issue arose...</p><p>Ohmigod, she was thinking marriage and he wasn\u2019t even able to allow her anything more than a begrudging role because she\u2019d left him no choice. Still something about this man called to her. His inner strength, a depth of character that Peter hadn\u2019t come close to possessing. It had nothing to do with muscles and everything to do with Rick\u2019s great big heart. He simply couldn\u2019t hide behind that gruff exterior.</p><p>None of which she could afford to think about now. They had plans to make, her lover and her friends who were putting their lives on the line for her. They needed to come up with a strategy to trap her stalker before he could make his move. And after they made their plan?</p><p>They would wait.</p><p>Rick had been prepared for the bastard to strike fast, but he hadn\u2019t expected the guy would make his move on the first night Nola got out of the hospital. Her home phone rang with an \u201cunknown number.\u201d His gut told him right away it wasn\u2019t a telemarketer.</p><p>Their guy was on the move.</p><p>He nodded for her to pick up while he made quick calls on the cell phone to their buddies out in the woods to alert them.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Nola answered, then shook her head at him to signify...it wasn\u2019t their guy after all? Damn. \u201cYes, this is Nola Seabrook. Rick\u2019s right here.\u201d</p><p>She passed him the phone and before it even reached his ear he could hear Lindsay\u2019s hysterical voice sobbing on the other end. Holy crap. He forced the knot in his throat down with a heavy swallow.</p><p>\u201cLindsay, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren,\u201d she gasped between sobs, \u201cdidn\u2019t get off the plane. They said she never got on in Atlanta. That means she\u2019s been missing for over six hours with the layover, Rick. Oh my God, where is our baby?\u201d</p><p>The bottom dropped out of his gut, his whole world sinking, sliding out from under him faster than the ground had given way beneath his feet the day his legs had gone to hell.</p><p>He knew. Nola\u2019s stalker had made his move after all. He had outthought them in a way they should have foreseen. Rick never should have let Lauren fly alone. Damn it. Why hadn\u2019t the attendants stayed with her as they were supposed to? He\u2019d paid the extra fee to have her watched over and hand escorted to her next flight.</p><p>All a moot point now.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d he insisted to Lindsay, even as he feared all sorts of nightmares.</p><p>Nola\u2019s eyes met his while he continued to talk, her hand closing over his with comfort.</p><p>\u201cShe could be anywhere.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s thoughts echoed his own, the first time they\u2019d agreed on anything in years.</p><p>\u201cI realize that. But is there anything else you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she wailed. \u201cThe police are investigating. The cops here will be contacting the authorities there and I didn\u2019t want you to be surprised by that visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d And please, Lord, they still wouldn\u2019t have a visit from cops with far worse news. He refused to accept that could happen.</p><p>Nola swayed on her feet. Rick reached for her but she collapsed into a chair. Already he could see the guilt building to irrational proportions in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLindsay, is Ben with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Hang tough and I\u2019ll let you know if we hear anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs, too.\u201d</p><p>They disconnected. He met Nola\u2019s gaze and held, injecting as much steadiness as he could under the circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have time to waste discussing this. Let\u2019s get the search moving.\u201d</p><p>Odd how she knew as well as he did Lauren wouldn\u2019t be in Atlanta long. The bastard who had been stalking Nola would bring Lauren back here to taunt them.</p><p>He reached for his cell phone again to recall Bronco, Crusty and Mako from their posts in the woods and up the road.</p><p>Within seconds they were in Nola\u2019s living room, too, pacing, while Rick hung up from calling the police. He dropped into a chair, his brain racing.</p><p>Crusty plowed his hand through his mess of hair. \u201cI\u2019ll head over to check in with the OSI. We\u2019ve already got things rolling with David Reis so here\u2019s a good place to start. He got a lead on the Internet crimes and traced the server to a local hotel. We\u2019ll see if there\u2019s more to follow up on that.\u201d</p><p>Bronco\u2019s eyes lit with a parental concern, obviously a father himself. \u201cMako and I will make an end run to the airport. It\u2019s a long shot that we can catch him there, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>Rick clenched his cell phone. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here and wait for the police. I don\u2019t want to leave in case she shows up here again. Let\u2019s hope she\u2019s just run off.\u201d</p><p>As her squadron comrades drove out onto the street, Nola slid her arm around Rick\u2019s waist in comfort. She sat on the arm of the chair beside him. \u201cI am so sorry. I can only imagine what kind of hell you\u2019re going through right now.\u201d</p><p>Hell didn\u2019t even come close to describing this. Hoping at best Lauren was alone on the run. Fearing at the worst she was in the hands of a maniac who blew up cars and planted scorpions. He lost track of how long they sat there letting everything sink in, but they both needed a moment to gather their thoughts before...doing what?</p><p>\u201cRick! The window.\u201d She nudged him. \u201cYour gun. Get your gun.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from the rug and saw...hell come to life in front of his eyes. An older man stood in the middle of her front yard, framed by the curtains\u2014</p><p>Holding a gun to Lauren\u2019s head.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Nola blinked, hard. And still the unbelievable nightmare stayed in front of her eyes.</p><p>The man outside the window was supposed to be long dead, smothered in a collapsed tunnel in South America. But her vision didn\u2019t lie. Ramon Chavez, the drug lord who\u2019d taken her hostage a year ago, had somehow survived and now had a gun to Lauren\u2019s head.</p><p>The teen appeared dazed, as if she\u2019d been drugged with a mild sedative. Apparently the bastard wasn\u2019t underestimating women this time. Suddenly the scorpion sting made sense, too. He\u2019d taken time to import the deadly critters from his part of the world, a message she hadn\u2019t understood, damn it.</p><p>Guilt sliced deeper than any poisonous sting. How could she have brought this hell to Rick\u2019s daughter? Every tear streak down the girl\u2019s face made Nola\u2019s heart squeeze tighter. And a coat. The child needed a coat to cover her in those little tank tops she favored.</p><p>What a silly thought as the teen shivered in fear with a gun pressed to her head, but the maternal instinct flowered to life so fiercely, it was all Nola could do to keep from launching across the lawn to rip out Chavez\u2019s throat.</p><p>Nola couldn\u2019t imagine why in hell the man would come here for her, but then he hadn\u2019t been sane in those days she\u2019d spent with him before. Time for musing would come later. Only Lauren counted now.</p><p>\u201cRick,\u201d she whispered under her breath, trying not to move her mouth in case it upset the man outside. Slowly, she moved toward the door with him. \u201cHis name is Ramon Chavez. It\u2019s the South American drug lord who held me captive a year ago. We all thought he died. He\u2019s wily and he\u2019s strong. Don\u2019t underestimate him because of his age.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGot it.\u201d Rick tucked his weapon out of sight in the small of his back. \u201cWe can\u2019t go out with it showing. He\u2019ll only make me throw it down.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere in his fifties, the man looked as if he stayed in shape. She\u2019d fought hard to escape Ramon Chavez, a narrow thing a year ago when she\u2019d been in top condition, and now she could barely walk after the scorpion sting. Rick had an amazing amount of upper body strength, but one swipe to his legs...</p><p>She couldn\u2019t afford these negative thoughts.</p> <p>Her hand closed over the doorknob.</p><p>Rick\u2019s hand rested on her waist. \u201cStay on the other side of me, away from him. I can\u2019t worry about you and Lauren. I love you.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door.</p><p>Good God. He dropped the \u201clove bomb\u201d like that and expected her to keep her cool? Nola scrambled for her scattered wits and\u2014what do you know?\u2014Rick used her hesitation to put himself between her and the gunman.</p><p>Rick braced a hand on the porch post.</p> <p>Nola pulled up alongside him. \u201cSo you\u2019ve finally decided to show your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided the time had come.\u201d He caressed the gun along Lauren\u2019s forehead in a sadistic show of force. \u201cMy timing. My control. You may have gotten the better of me once, but I will be the victor this time.\u201d</p><p>Nola sifted through his words and could hardly believe how the pieces fit together. The man had come after her because of a wounded ego?</p><p>She stepped onto the porch, staying behind Rick, not because she felt she needed his shielding but because she didn\u2019t want him distracted with worry. \u201cHow did you survive the tunnel collapse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a strong man, stronger than anyone gave me credit for.\u201d He hitched his arm harder against the terrified teen\u2019s gut. \u201cI clawed my way to freedom. Revenge can give you more strength than you could imagine.\u201d</p><p>She hoped he was right because the need for a slice of vengeance for herself gnawed deep.</p> <p>At the show of force against Lauren, a vein popped along Rick\u2019s temple. \u201cHow did you get to my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Chavez tut-tutted. \u201cYou two are so predictable. I knew you would send the child away. I am an Internet genius. When you booked her flight, I booked my own on her flight. It was no problem to overtake her in Atlanta when she went to the restroom on her own. I simply waylaid Lauren and told her that her father had been in an accident. Your daughter is truly too trusting.\u201d</p><p>Nola rested her hand on Rick\u2019s back in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cI do not want to hurt this pretty young child. She has done nothing to me, but you know as well as I that there are casualties in war. It is up to you as to whether she will be one of them. Will you come quietly with me now? Or will you make this a fight?\u201d</p><p>Their first order of business had to be securing the safety of Rick\u2019s daughter. Nola knew that. She had beaten this man once before, she could do it again. She refused to think about what the scorpion\u2019s poison had done to her system. Of course that would have been the man\u2019s plan, to weaken her this time. Now it all made sense.</p><p>She came level, shoulder to shoulder with Rick, then moved down to the first step.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d she whispered as she passed, and ohmigod what a time to make this realization.</p><p>They should have had more time... She had to think positively. Put one foot in front of the other.</p> <p>Chavez eased his hold on the girl. Nola wondered if she could trust his word. What if he took them both hostage? But this man had always entertained a twisted sense of frontier justice. Somehow she believed he would let Lauren go. He meant what he said about his vendetta being with her alone. His reasons for killing her were bizarre to say the least, but his obsession was with her alone.</p><p>She also knew Rick\u2019s code of honor was unbending. He would not leave with her still held hostage. He would die first. Without question.</p><p>Her feet faltered. How could she guarantee both the father\u2019s and daughter\u2019s safety? She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Her heart squeezed.</p><p>Lauren walked past her, tears streaking mascara down the young girl\u2019s no-longer-jaded-face. Their hands brushed. Then Lauren ran for her father.</p><p>Nola closed the last few steps between herself and the man who\u2019d held her hostage a year ago. Helplessness threatened to swallow her. Her worst fears came to life again. Battling free of him before had been so liberating. Why did she have to go through this again?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let the negativity show through or it would distract Rick.</p><p>Chavez gripped her upper arm, his fingers a steely, unforgiving band. \u201cYou won\u2019t get away this time.\u201d He jabbed the gun deeper into her waist. \u201cMajor DeMassi, I\u2019m sure you have a gun tucked somewhere. Toss it aside. Now please, or I will start shooting.\u201d</p><p>Nola watched Rick calculating until finally, he reached behind him and took the weapon from the small of his back and placed it on the porch banister, carefully. She made note of it, hoping one of them could use it later.</p><p>Soon, hopefully. She shivered against the stench of Chavez\u2019s breath and the sheer evil and hatred radiating from him. She wanted to fight him again. She assessed the strength of his hold on her. He obviously still worked out. He\u2019d been strong before\u2014and seemed more so now. Getting away from him before had been a near thing with her at full speed. She had to be honest with herself. The scorpion sting had drained her. Even now, lethargy stole over her.</p><p>Could Rick hold his own against the man? Would his legs support him? She saw the determination in his eyes as he wordlessly shoved Lauren behind him. She saw the implicit instruction there. He had a plan. He wanted her to see to Lauren and he would take care of Chavez.</p><p>Then it hit her. Rick trusted her with his child. Something fluttered to life inside her that she hadn\u2019t even realized was dead. Her ex-husband had refused so many times to have children with her, only to start a family right away with his new wife. That had hurt in a way she\u2019d never fully acknowledged. And now Rick trusted her with his child.</p><p>A small moment. A big step. One she would savor later, because yes, she intended to have a later with this man and his child, and her own second chance at life.</p><p>Nola looked him in the eyes and let him read her implicit message, her joining in his plan. The communication flowed freely between them in a way she\u2019d never felt with her ex-husband. She hadn\u2019t even known what she was missing.</p><p>Chavez yanked her arm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave now. I am a man of honor and I meant what I said about only wanting Nola.\u201d He nodded to Rick. \u201cHowever, if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t try starting that car of yours anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>Time to put this plan into action. She let her eyelids grow heavy, her body sag ever so increasingly in Chavez\u2019s grip.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Huh?\u201d She shook herself a little as if trying to shore herself up, then drooped again.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, woman.\u201d</p><p>Rick frowned, taking a step forward. \u201cIt must be the scorpion bite you inflicted on her. You wanted her weakened. You did this to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo closer,\u201d Chavez warned. \u201cShe and I are going to leave now.\u201d</p><p>Like hell.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open and made direct contact with Rick\u2019s.</p><p>Now! her unspoken message shouted.</p><p>Rick shoved Lauren to the right as Nola chopped Chavez\u2019s gun hand down. The gunshot split the air, sending rock and dirt flying as Rick launched forward. Chavez\u2019s weapon skittered away and into the water.</p><p>Nola dropped and rolled out of the way, toward Lauren. She covered the child\u2019s body with hers. Watching. Praying.</p><p>Rick and Chavez exchanged punches and ohmigod, the older man seemed to be gaining ground. Blood poured from a cut above Rick\u2019s eye. Another punch landed in his gut. Grunting, Rick stumbled backward a good five steps...</p><p>Backward?</p><p>Toward the watery drop-off.</p><p>Realization dawned. Rick wasn\u2019t losing the fight at all. He was taking it to his playing field where he knew he stood better odds of winning. Two more punches put Rick\u2019s heels on the edge of the water while Lauren screamed in fear as she tried to run for her father. Nola pinned the hysterical teen to the ground even as she, too, longed to run and offer help.</p><p>In a flash, his fist shot out and gripped Chavez\u2019s shirt and they both went over backward. The splash swallowed both men, the water deep from the recent swell of rain.</p><p>She held her breath as if in sympathy. The murky waters churned with action. Bubbles roiled with no signs of a victor or loser. What if she was wrong and Rick couldn\u2019t pull this off? His injuries had been extensive. How long could they stay under? How long had passed? The cooler temperatures would play havoc with their bodies.</p><p>Lauren whimpered under her.</p><p>Nola sat up and hugged her close. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie, your daddy\u2019s an expert at this. He\u2019s trained for these kinds of waters. This is exactly where he wanted the fight to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>A hero. But also a man who had entrusted his child to her. Keeping a hand firmly locked around Lauren\u2019s wrist, Nola jerked her up to run to the porch and retrieve Rick\u2019s gun, because as much as she prayed that he would come out of those waters alive, she knew that life wasn\u2019t fair and predictable. She\u2019d made him a promise to keep his daughter safe.</p><p>Nola pulled her cell phone from her pocket and passed it to Lauren. \u201cCall the police again and update them.\u201d</p><p>Then she wrapped an arm around the teen\u2019s shoulder and gripped the gun in her other hand. Waiting for the man she loved. The power of it didn\u2019t come over her in some gentle breeze or pretty flowering. It smashed her over the head then squeezed tight, a strong emotion as big and powerful as the man who\u2019d brought it.</p><p>In a gush upward, Rick exploded from the water, alive. Thank God, alive.</p><p>Vital.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>Emotions swirled inside her, bubbling higher and higher until tears flowed down her face and the gun shook in her hand. His angular features wet, his hair streaming and jet-black. In his fist, he held the limp body of her captor.</p><p>\u201cUnconscious, not dead,\u201d Rick gasped, then grinned. \u201cGod, you look hot holding that gun, all fired up and protecting my kid. Wanna get hitched?\u201d</p><p>Choking back the tears of relief, Nola launched forward with Lauren while Rick tossed the unconscious Chavez onto the bank. Rick took the gun from her shaking hand and trained it on the bastard sprawled on the sandy shore, gathering up Nola and Lauren with his other arm.</p><p>Nola let the tears of relief flow and hugged Rick back, Lauren, too, this unexpected child who had come into her life. A stepdaughter. Wow. Mind-blowing. Exciting.</p><p>Sirens whined in the distance, but Nola barely noticed with her cheek pressed to Rick\u2019s wet chest, his heart thudding in her ear. A heart she would listen to for the rest of her life.</p><p>Leaning against a tree by the marsh, Rick wondered at the hitch in his throat that lingered long after the cops had cleared out with Chavez in handcuffs. Lauren and Nola were inside cleaning up.</p><p>He\u2019d already called Lindsay and told her he would send Lauren home tomorrow. His ex-wife had gone a little hysterical after hearing what happened, but her husband-to-be had taken the phone and offered an awkward thank-you. Something that meant a lot coming from the guy who would be spending so much time with Lauren over the next few years.</p><p>Rick figured he would use the time-out near the water to gather his thoughts. The water had served him well in the end, always his friend. Always home.</p><p>Except that wasn\u2019t quite true anymore. He\u2019d found a new home.</p><p>With Nola.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He pivoted to find Lauren waiting at the bottom porch step, her long hair wet from her shower. She wore her standard sleep pants and a raggedy T-shirt... Wait. Wasn\u2019t that...? It was. An old T-shirt of his from an air show they\u2019d attended together.</p><p>And she still wore it.</p><p>He had two choices right now. He could stand here and feel guilty. Or he could move forward on his battered legs and fix things with his daughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rick took a step, not bothering to grab for a tree to hide the limp. He just let it show, the reality of his injuries, and walked to his daughter. He also looked into her eyes with the new way of seeing that he\u2019d learned from Nola and saw...</p><p>The same hero worship he\u2019d found when he\u2019d swept her up at five years old. It had been there all along.</p><p>He held open his arms.</p> <p>Lauren ran into them without hesitation and sobbed against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Daddy, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, kiddo, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make things worse here, I just wanted to see you, I just...\u201d She babbled on and on and he let her, stroking her hair the way he had when she was little and scraped her knee.</p><p>The instincts to parent were there. He\u2019d just been too scared to listen because messing this up came with stakes higher than any out in the field.</p><p>Finally, her tears slowed, but he sensed the need to talk more. Inspiration struck. \u201cHow about we step over here.\u201d</p> <p>He gestured to the tire swing. Her eyebrows knit together, but she shuffled over to sit. Rick planted a hand between her shoulder blades and gave a gentle shove to launch her just as he\u2019d done hundreds of times when she\u2019d been a toddler.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>She swished back, her face wary. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thoughts. No worries.\u201d He gave the swing another nudge, higher. He remembered she enjoyed higher, like him. The rope creaked on the branch. \u201cHow about you come see me for Christmas break? Two full weeks of no pressure, no stalkers and we see how it goes. If everything works out, we can talk to your mother about your staying with me for a semester.\u201d</p><p>She swung back toward him. Her feet dragging to slow the momentum. \u201cDo you mean it? Really?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the rope to bring the swing to a complete stop. \u201cI may not have always been there for you, but I kept my promises when I made them.\u201d</p> <p>She rested her head on the rope and grinned. \u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>A resounding endorsement from a teen. He didn\u2019t delude himself that it would be all smooth sailing, but he was learning. Lauren was trying.</p><p>He was scared as hell\u2014and so damn excited to have more time with his child.</p><p>She leaped from the swing and gave him a quick, almost bashful kiss on his cheek so quickly he nearly missed it.</p><p>\u201cNight, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Lauren bolted across the yard and up the steps and into the house. Rick dropped into the swing, the tire laying flat, tied in three places.</p><p>Damn. This parenting gig was more exhausting than battling a South American drug lord.</p><p>And the strangest thing of all, he wanted to share this moment with Nola. He needed to hear her feedback on what he\u2019d said to his daughter. How amazing that the woman could have become such an integral part of his life in such a short time.</p> <p>Still he could hear the words they\u2019d exchanged in the heat of battle.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>He\u2019d meant it.</p><p>Then there she was, framed in her doorway with her hair damp, curls clinging to her face in swirls. Lord, she did things to jeans with those long legs of hers that should be illegal out in public.</p><p>\u201cWanna hitch a ride, lady?\u201d He patted his lap.</p><p>\u201cThat ride looks far better than that bullet thing you lured me into trying.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she hobbled across the porch, one foot bandaged from the sting and in a flip-flop. She limped across the sparse lawn, her foot apparently still throbbing from the scorpion sting. Residual anger stirred in him that wouldn\u2019t go away anytime soon, probably not until the trial ended with Chavez locked up for life. But Rick refused to let it spoil his plans for tonight.</p><p>She settled across his lap, looping her arms around his neck. Her head fell to rest on his shoulders. \u201cHmm... Yes, this ride I like. How bizarre to feel so content and exhausted at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d He rested his chin on her head, the sweet smell of flowery shampoo teasing his nose. He scuffed his boot against the dusty ground and set the swing into motion.</p><p>\u201cYou were something, the way you brought him down in the water.\u201d She wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cI figured the water was my best bet at leveling the playing field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw that in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought they communicated there in that moment, but he hadn\u2019t been sure. Now he knew she felt the same connection. They had something special and he intended to hold it fast.</p><p>She hugged his waist tighter and pressed a kiss to his neck, snuggling closer. They stayed linked like that for...he wasn\u2019t sure how long but the familiarity felt so good he went with it until the moment seemed right to continue.</p><p>\u201cI like your place here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She smiled against his neck. \u201cAre you angling to take up a permanent residence?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already asked her to tie the knot in the adrenaline surge after knocking out Chavez, but he understood this practical woman needed details. Grounding. And maybe because she was a warrior, too, she understood the primal desire to stake a claim on life after a battle with death. Maybe she didn\u2019t know if she could trust his off-the-cuff proposal.</p><p>She would find out soon enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not much for being a kept man. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking out here tonight. It\u2019s amazing how fast plans can come together when you think you might lose everything that counts.\u201d</p><p>His arms convulsed around her, though he tried not to hold her too tightly. It was tough when his brain kept replaying the horror of seeing a gun pressed to her head, to his daughter\u2019s head. His whole world had almost been blown away tonight.</p><p>He forced himself to relax and continue. He wouldn\u2019t let this second chance slip away. \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan for my future. Or at least the start of one. I\u2019m in a unique position. With my disability pay, I don\u2019t need to make big bucks. I can pick any profession. I want to train volunteer search-and-rescue teams out of that small airport where we flew on Thanksgiving. I\u2019ll even be able to do some jumps on occasion once my body finishes healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does that leave us with moving in together?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers traced over his heart, shaking ever so slightly. He clasped her hand and brought it to his mouth for a kiss, linking their fingers before continuing.</p><p>\u201cI would have to contribute something to the equation. I spent so much time on the road, I never spent much on myself. I\u2019ve got some money saved up.\u201d He gestured out to the water\u2019s edge. \u201cMaybe I could put in a dock there.\u201d Then over to the large stretch of patchy lawn where grass never seemed to grow well. \u201cPerhaps a pool here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren would like that,\u201d she said with unmistakable nudging.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she would.\u201d And here things got complicated. \u201cWhat would you think if she came to live here for a trial semester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that would be great for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about for you?\u201d He wanted her to be a part of his life and still she hadn\u2019t mentioned his impromptu proposal when he\u2019d hauled himself out of the water.</p><p>\u201cThat girl has a way of working her way into a person\u2019s heart very quickly.\u201d Nola eased back to look up into his face with what he hoped was love in her eyes. \u201cVery much like her father.\u201d</p><p>Time to take a leap bigger than any he\u2019d ever attempted, and he\u2019d managed some mighty death-defying jumps in his time. \u201cI meant what I said there at the end. That wasn\u2019t adrenaline talking.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze skated out to the murky waters. \u201cIt surely made for a memorable proposal.\u201d</p><p>He mentally thumped himself as he realized perhaps he should have given this more thought. \u201cWould you like something more romantic?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her damp curls beginning to dry and rustling around her face. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything conventionally from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me there, lady.\u201d He\u2019d read her eyes so well in bringing down Chavez and Rick thought he could read her now, still he wanted to hear the words. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered.\u201d</p><p>Then it hit him. He still hadn\u2019t given her much of a real proposal, either. Just the under-pressure \u201cI love you\u201d they\u2019d shared in passing.</p><p>He stopped the swing. Stared into her eyes. He needed to make this count. \u201cAll of these plans, they feel right, being a part of a group, something big again. But without you, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to wrap my brain around the possibility. God, Nola, you\u2019ve given me so much. I just hope I can give you as much in return, because without you none of it means anything.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face. \u201cNola, I love you. I wish there were fancier words, but I\u2019m a plainspoken man. I\u2019m also a man you can count on. I don\u2019t quit. My love for you is forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve made you speechless. That\u2019s quite a feat.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hands to his chest and kissed him on the mouth, \u201cI love you,\u201d on the cheeks, \u201cI love you,\u201d on the eyes and the forehead, \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thank goodness you weren\u2019t speechless for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess this means we are officially and fully engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. We had milk shakes for Thanksgiving.\u201d He took her hand in his, linking their fingers and holding on tight. For a lifetime. \u201cI was thinking perhaps we could shop for a diamond for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me, my love. Definitely sounds like a plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
