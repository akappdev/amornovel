How can I help you?\u201d I answer on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cI found a phone, and this is the number that comes up on the screen when I turn it on,\u201d a deep male voice answers. His smooth Southern drawl makes the hairs on my arms stand on end. I pull my handbag out from under the desk and dig through it, looking for my phone. \u201cHello, did you hear me?\u201d the guy on the other end says more impatiently. I forgot he was even on the line during my search.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m here. Sorry. It\u2019s my cell,\u201d I tell him, holding the desk phone between my shoulder and ear.</p><p>\u201cLook, I gotta get out of town and won\u2019t be back for a week, so can you meet me somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d I reply, worrying my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cDo you want your phone or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I want my phone,\u201d I say, becoming annoyed. What kind of stupid question is that?</p> <p>\u201cThen you need to meet me so I can give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get off work for another hour. Can you meet me after that?\u201d I cross my fingers, hoping he can. I don\u2019t know what I would do without my phone for a week\u2014not that I want to call or text anyone, but I was kicking ass in Candy Crush and wanted to beat my last score.</p><p>\u201cJesus, where the f**k do you wanna meet?\u201d he grumbles, making me smile. I don\u2019t know why, but it kind of makes me happy I am annoying him.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me out front of Jack\u2019s Bar-B-Que in an hour and a half?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, fine.\u201d I can tell by his tone that he\u2019s completely irritated, and I smile even bigger.</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I mummer.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d he asks, making the grin slide off my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he huffs out, \u201cI have your phone, which means you don\u2019t have a phone, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I repeat like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cThat means I can\u2019t call to tell you when I get there. Therefore, I need to know what you\u2019re wearing so I can spot you on the street, right?\u201d I can hear the smile in his voice now.</p><p>\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d I say, and he chuckles, the deepness of his laughter making my belly flutter.</p><p>\u201cSo, let\u2019s try this again. What are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look down at myself, feeling stupid about what I\u2019m going to say to him. \u201cUm...a grey skirt, a white silk blouse... Oh! And I have brown hair,\u201d I add at the end, since I don\u2019t know how many women might be wearing the same kind of thing I am.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart. I\u2019ll see you in an hour and a half,\u201d he says, and before I have a chance to say anything else, the line goes dead.</p><p>I hang up the receiver and toss my bag back under the desk before putting all the books that have been checked in throughout the day back on the shelves.</p><p>I started working at the school library a year ago when I moved to Nashville from Seattle. I work here three days a week, and the rest of the time, I work from home as a medical insurance specialist. I like working here; it\u2019s quiet, and the pay is good\u2014and it doesn\u2019t hurt that I spend most of my day alone.</p><p>I finish out my shift by updating the computer system, and after making sure that no one is still browsing the shelves, I lock up. When I leave the building, I notice that most of the staff has left for the day. The parking lot is empty except for my red Audi. I get in my car, turn it on, and flip the button for the convertible top, which takes a second to go back accordion-style and lock into place. The sound of Addicted to Love by Florence and the Machine starts playing as I head downtown.</p><p>When I reach the area I\u2019m supposed to meet the guy with my phone, it takes a few minutes to find parking. This part of town is always crazy around this time of day. By the time I reach Jake\u2019s, I\u2019m about ten minutes later than I planned on being. I look around, wondering what this guy might look like. There are so many people walking around, so I feel like an idiot for not having asked him what he was wearing too. I pick a spot next to the building and cross my arms over my chest. I want to sit down so badly; my feet are killing me. I have a sick love for heels, and the ones I wore today are paying me back for wearing them for more than a few hours.</p><p>I look around and see a guy staring at me. He\u2019s about my age, not much taller than my five feet five inches, cute, and wearing a suit and tie. I start to wave to see if he\u2019s the one I\u2019m meeting, but then another guy catches my attention. He\u2019s about six three and huge, and I don\u2019t mean just in height; his body looks like it\u2019s been chiseled from stone. He\u2019s wearing black boots, washed-out blue jeans, and a white t-shirt, and every piece of skin exposed is covered with tattoos. His ears have those gauge thingies in them. His dark blond hair is cut low on the sides, and the top is in a fauxhawk. His jaw is strong, with a few days of stubble, and his eyes are so blue that they almost look like contacts. He is beautiful in a way that is unusual but no less gorgeous.</p><p>His eyes come to me before looking away quickly, and the next second, they come back to me and do a head-to-toe sweep. I gulp at the intense expression on his face. I glance past him to the other guy\u2014or at least try to\u2014but Mr. Tattoo starts towards me, blocking my view. I want to take a step back, but I can\u2019t go anywhere. Then I see my phone in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThis yours?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod like an idiot. He shakes his head, running his free hand down his face, and then his eyes sweep over me again.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be f**king kidding me,\u201d he says, seeming upset.</p><p>I look down at myself, wondering how I could\u2019ve offended him. I look normal\u2014or my working-outside-the-house normal. When I\u2019m at home working, I wear baggy sweats I cut off to make shorts or pajama pants that hang off of me along with tank tops or T-shirts. The few days a week I get out of the house, I like to dress up or at least wear heels.</p><p>\u201cThis cannot be f**king happening,\u201d he growls, and I wonder if he is completely crazy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, finally finding my voice. I have to tilt my head way back; even in my four-inch heels, he still towers over me.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, what?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Who is this?\u201d He presses the button on my phone, the screen lights up, and a picture of Jamie Dornan wearing nothing but a pair of jeans takes up the screen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm...that\u2019s Jamie,\u201d I reply, wondering why he is asking but too afraid to ask him; the look on his face isn\u2019t very inviting for conversation.</p><p>\u201cHe your man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish,\u201d I mumble under my breath and hear him growl.</p><p>My head flies back as I search his face; his jaw is ticking, and his knuckles of the hand holding my phone are turning white.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jamie Dornan. He\u2019s playing Fifty. I don\u2019t know him.\u201d I feel my cheeks heat up and look down at my feet.</p><p>What the hell\u2019s wrong with me? Why am I not afraid right now? I have been scared of virtually everything my whole life, and now, when I should be running for cover, I\u2019m not scared at all. Just a little embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d he says, and I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, but I all of a sudden really want my phone out of his hand before he crushes it to smithereens.</p><p>When I look up again, I see that he is walking away. My eyebrows come together, and I wonder what he is doing. Then I realize he still has my cell.</p> <p>\u201cHey! You can\u2019t steal my phone!\u201d I run after him, grabbing his arm.</p><p>He looks down at me then stops short. I\u2019m completely caught off guard when he wraps an arm around my waist, pulling me flush against him. His free hand goes into my hair and pulls my head back, and then he kisses me. No, not kisses\u2014he consumes me. My body starts to buzz like someone just plugged me into an electrical outlet, and I start to feel lightheaded. When he pulls his mouth from mine, I gasp, my fingers going to my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I whisper, looking into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks, still holding me close.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d I tell him, my answer spoken behind my fingers.</p><p>His body is as hard as a rock against mine; I can feel every muscle, every contour, and it takes everything in me to keep breathing. I realize this is the first time in my life I have ever felt small, my curvy figure never having allowed it before.</p> <p>\u201cSophie,\u201d he repeats, standing up to his full height and pulling me with him. I look around and wonder if time has stopped for anyone else. \u201cMy name is Nico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d I say, staring into his amazing eyes, thinking that a guy who looks like him would have a name like that\u2014cool and hot, something that rolls easily off your tongue but is hard to forget.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back into town, Sophie,\u201d he says as he lets me go, making sure I\u2019m steady on my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, looking around again.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your phone.\u201d He hands me my cell, and I\u2019m still a little lightheaded when he starts to walk off again. I watch in a daze as he leaves, but then he turns around to face me from a few yards away. \u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChange the picture on your phone,\u201d he demands before he turns and disappears into the crowd.</p><p>I stand there for a few seconds wondering what just happened. Eventually, I pull myself together enough to make it to my car. When I get there, I realize that I didn\u2019t even put the top up or take my bag with me because I had been in such a hurry. I turn quickly to look in my backseat, seeing that my bag is still there. I breathe out a sigh of relief, start my car, and head home.</p> <p>I live in a small, two-bedroom house just outside of Nashville. I bought it cash with the money I got from my mom\u2019s life insurance policy after she passed away. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s home. I pull into my garage and hop out, dragging my bag with me. I need a beer...or a shot of something. I unlock my door, and as I step inside, I kick my shoes off so they go flying down the hall towards my room.</p><p>After dropping my bag by the door and the infamous phone on the table, I head to my kitchen, open my freezer, and pull out the bottle of vodka I keep there in case of emergencies. I don\u2019t have time to find a shot glass, so I pull a coffee mug down from the cupboard, fill it half full, and shoot it back. Practically coughing up a lung as I try to catch my breath, I fill the glass up again and shakily take another shot. This time, I\u2019m prepared for it, so I hold my breath as the burn fills my chest. I put the bottle away, feeling more relaxed already.</p><p>I head to my room, strip off my clothes, and put on a T-shirt. It\u2019s early, so I head to the living room, grabbing my phone along the way. I plop down on my couch, put my feet up on the coffee table, turn the TV on, start up the DVR, and press play on The Big Bang Theory. I sit there for a few minutes in a daze, not absorbing even a single second of my favorite show. I look at my cell in my hand, and clicking on the screen, I look at the picture of Jamie. I don\u2019t know why, but I can\u2019t help but smile as I think of Nico\u2019s reaction to it. The tattooed stranger is hot, slightly scary, but definitely interesting.</p><p>Nico</p><p>I am happy to be home. I have been gone for four days chasing a skip, and I thought it would have taken me a little longer to catch up with the guy, but luckily for me, he was half moron. I\u2019m shutting off my car in front of my townhouse when my phone rings. I look at the caller ID hopefully; I know it\u2019s not going to be sweet Sophie, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want it to be. Kenton\u2019s number flashes on the screen. I\u2019m sure he has another case for me, but right now, that\u2019s not happening. I\u2019m going to have a beer and go to bed, and then tomorrow, I\u2019m going over to the local middle school.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, pulling my bag out of the backseat.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t take you long to catch Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s an idiot,\u201d I tell him. \u201cHe hid out at his mom\u2019s house. You would think he would\u2019ve learned his lesson after the last two times I\u2019ve gone after him. Most of the time I was gone was spent on the road getting there and then getting home. When are you going to get a private jet so I don\u2019t have to put miles on my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop bitching. You made fifteen hundred dollars in two days.\u201d</p><p>He isn\u2019t wrong. Between selling my part of the construction business back to my brothers and chasing after skips, I am sitting on a nice stack of cash.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you calling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t just call to see how my cousin\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I sound stupid to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right... The thing is, I need you to help me out with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shake my head, making my way up to my door.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine from Vegas called. He has a girl that needs a place to crash for a little while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd what does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan she stay with you until Cassie gets the rest of her shit out of my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d I bellow as I shove my keys into the lock.</p><p>The second the door opens, Daisy starts going wild. I scoop her up in one hand as she begins licking my chin and any other piece of me she can get to.</p> <p>\u201cYou still have that dog?\u201d He laughs, hearing Daisy through the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I growl. All the f**kers in my life think it\u2019s funny I own a little fur-ball for a dog. I rescued Daisy from a flophouse. She was so small at the time that she could fit in the palm of my hand. I was going to give her to one of my family members, but I couldn\u2019t do it. After a week of having her with me, I grew attached to her.</p><p>\u201cLook, man, I just need your help this one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you should have put that bitch\u2019s shit out months ago,\u201d I remind him. I hated his ex; she was one of those women who tried to lead you around by your dick.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make it seem like I haven\u2019t wanted to. She swore she was coming this weekend to get all her stuff, but until then, I don\u2019t have room for this chick who\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou know my friend Link who works as a bouncer in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He works at a strip club, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well, I guess this stripper saw some shit go down. He called and asked me to keep an eye out for her until it\u2019s safe for her to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, your own personal stripper living with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could live with you first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing someone, so you\u2019re gonna have to find something else to do with this chick or toss your ex\u2019s shit outside. Or burn it behind your house for all I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeing someone?\u201d I can hear the disbelief in his voice. I\u2019m not surprised\u2014I don\u2019t date; I hook up and go home.</p><p>\u201cI just got home. I don\u2019t have time for this right now. Call your ex and tell her she needs to come get her stuff tomorrow or you\u2019re burning it. And honestly, if she doesn\u2019t show up, I say we have a bonfire with that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you and I both know she isn\u2019t gonna come get her crap. She thinks, if it\u2019s here, she has a reason to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo put it in your car, take it to her house, and put it on her lawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have done that, but I need a truck and haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been out for almost a year. How the hell haven\u2019t you had time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve had time. I just haven\u2019t wanted to deal with all the crying that comes along with seeing her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAw, you cry when you see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTears of joy that she\u2019s out of my life, f**ker.\u201d</p><p>I laugh along with him as I set Daisy on the ground and grab a beer out of the fridge, popping the top and taking a swig. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t come by this weekend to get her stuff, let me know and I\u2019ll go with you to take it to her. I\u2019m sure we can borrow Cash\u2019s truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good. So who\u2019s this chick you\u2019re seeing? Is it the redhead you were talking to at the bar the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and you don\u2019t know her.\u201d Shit, I don\u2019t even know her.</p><p>All I know about her is that she smells like apples and cinnamon and she has the softest brown hair I\u2019ve ever seen or felt, brown eyes that darken to almost black when she\u2019s kissed, and skin the color of milk that turns pink when she\u2019s nervous or embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I growl, annoyed that he interrupted my daydream of beautiful Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI asked if you were up for another job this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Just let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. Later, cous\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>I clicked off the phone before tossing it onto the counter. I glance down at Daisy, who is sitting at my feet looking up at me. I open up her treat jar, and her eyes follow my every move. I hold the treat a few inches above her head as she stands up on her hind legs to dance around before I drop it to her. I wander from the kitchen into my room, pull off my shirt, and toss it onto the floor, followed by my jeans and boxers.</p><p>After going into the bathroom, I start up the shower and let the glass stall steam up before stepping inside. I let the hot water run over me. My head tilts back as I think about Sophie and her big brown eyes looking up at me with nervousness and hunger but without even a hint of real fear\u2014something I have never seen on a woman\u2019s face before but will forever be etched into my brain. I knew the minute I saw her that she was it. How I knew? I don\u2019t know, but it was like my soul lit up\u2014cheesy as f**k, but also true. I don\u2019t really have time for her right now, and she is not a woman who looks like she would ever be interested in someone like me, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to try.</p><p>She has a look of innocence about her; I guess it could be a front, but something tells me it\u2019s not. I feel myself getting hard thinking about those f**king heels she had on; they should be illegal. She looked like every man\u2019s naughty secretary fantasy, or maybe a dirty librarian. I palm myself, moving in long, steady strokes. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing her on her knees in front of me, her skirt up around her waist, her legs spread out to show off her pu**y, her top open with her br**sts hanging over the top of her bra, and her ni**les hard and dark pink from being sucked, licked, and bitten. I would stand in front of her, feeding her my cock. My hands would fist her hair, dictating her pace. I feel my balls draw up, my strokes moving faster. One of her hands would cup them gently while her other hand would grip the base of my c**k as I f**ked into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I groan, echoing into the empty shower as long jets of cum hit the wall in front of me. I haven\u2019t jacked off to the thought of a woman I know since I was thirteen, when Margret Jenkins showed me her tits in the boys\u2019 bathroom on a dare. I catch my breath before I wash up and head to bed. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.</p><p>When I walk into the middle school, I\u2019m not surprised when the security guard asks who I am and what I\u2019m doing here. I explain to him that I\u2019m looking for a librarian by the name of Sophie. He doesn\u2019t know who she is, so he sends me to the principal\u2019s office so someone there can help me out. I\u2019m used to being judged by my appearance. I\u2019m covered in tattoos, and I have a fauxhawk and gauges in my ears. Basically, I look like a person you should run from. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>I look down at an older woman with light-purple hair and a large smile. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sophie who works in the library?\u201d she questions, her smile becoming wider.</p><p>\u201cYes.

He\u2019s dressed like he works here\u2014most likely a teacher\u2014his khaki pants and button-down shirt giving him away.</p> <p>\u201cShe has me,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His eyes look me over before he speaks again. \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I raise a brow.</p><p>\u201cHoney, she will be here tomorrow,\u201d the lady says. I look at her and smile, and she beams back at me.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I reply, tapping on the top of her desk before walking past the guy, out the door, down the hall, and out to my car. I have to wait another day, but I know it\u2019ll be worth it when I see her again.</p><p>When I get to the school the next day, I go directly to the office.</p> <p>\u201cYou came back,\u201d the same lady as before greets me. \u201cI\u2019m Sue, by the way.\u201d She leans forward then, like she is going to tell me a secret. \u201cMr. Rasmussen was not happy yesterday.\u201d She wags her finger at me then smiles like the cat that got the canary before sitting back in her chair and clapping her hands together once. \u201cSo I guess you need directions to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be helpful.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cYou sure are pretty.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIf I was a few years younger, I\u2019d be a jaguar for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA jaguar?\u201d I ask on a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou know, an older lady with a younger man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cougar, you mean,\u201d I correct her with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSure. Whatever you say, honey. All I know is I would have given Ms. Grates a run for her money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSue, if you want me, you\u2019ve got me,\u201d I tell her, leaning in the way she did before.</p> <p>\u201cOh no, honey. I wouldn\u2019t even know what to do with you.\u201d She smiles, her eyes sparkling. I shrug and she laughs. \u201cAll right, mister. I gotta hang on to your ID while you\u2019re on school property, but just sign in here and you can go to the library. Take a right out the door, walk until you get to the end of the hall, and take a left. It\u2019s the last door on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, doll,\u201d I reply, smiling as I hand her my driver\u2019s license, sign the visitor\u2019s sheet, and walk out of the office. I have to say, that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever been hit on by a woman my grandmother\u2019s age.</p><p>When I get to the library\u2019s doors, I look through the small window and spot Sophie right away as she stands on her tiptoes to put away books. Today, she is wearing navy-blue slacks with wide legs and a high waist that ends just under her br**sts, which are covered in a bright red, short-sleeved, button-down top that matches her heels.</p><p>Jesus. Sophie is in heels and looking like she does is going to be the death of me. I push open the door and am bombarded by the smell of books. Sophie turns her head to look at who has come in, and when she sees that it\u2019s me, her eyes go wide and her mouth opens and closes a couple of times.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she finally asks before looking around like she is waiting for someone to jump out at her.</p><p>\u201cI told you I would see you when I got back to town. I\u2019m back in town,\u201d I state the obvious.</p><p>\u201cUm...okay, but what are you doing here?\u201d she repeats, pointing to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have your number, and I want to take you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a meal you eat at the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what dinner is. I just don\u2019t do that,\u201d she mumbles, looking adorable.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t eat dinner?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t do dinner with other people,\u201d she replies.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t do dinner with other people?\u201d I tilt my head to the side, watching her.</p><p>\u201cLike...date\u2014I don\u2019t date,\u201d she huffs out, crossing her arms over her chest, which only accentuates it. My eyes are drawn there, and she immediately lowers her arms to her sides.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a date. It\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what would you like to eat on our non-date dinner?\u201d I ask, taking a step towards her, the smell of apples and cinnamon growing stronger the closer I get.</p><p>\u201cNothing. We\u2019re not having dinner together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you get off work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She chews her lower lip, her cheeks turning a pretty shade of pink.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so no dinner then.\u201d I shrug. \u201cCan I get your number?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head no, her cheeks growing even darker. Fuck me, she\u2019s cute. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispers, looking away.</p><p>For some reason, alarm bells start going off in my head. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d I beat back the urge to touch her, my mind warring with my body. I watch her for a second and then start to come up with a plan.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to work,\u201d she says, looking at the floor.</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweet Sophie. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Nico,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>I turn after giving her a chin lift, my chest feeling tight at the sound of my name leaving her mouth. After getting my ID back from Sue and signing out, I leave the school knowing that this isn\u2019t over. Not by a long shot.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>For the second day in a row, I\u2019m waiting outside the school. It\u2019s 6:02 when the door opens and Sophie comes walking out. Each time I see her, she looks even more beautiful than before. I watch her expression go from surprise to shy happiness as she spots me standing next to my car...just like yesterday.</p><p>Yesterday when I left her in the library, I went to the grocery store, bought a pint of Phish Food ice cream and a set of plastic spoons, and took it back to the school, where I waited for her to get off work. She said she didn\u2019t do dinner; she never said anything about dessert. When she saw me standing there with the frozen treat, she said that she really shouldn\u2019t, but I told her that it wasn\u2019t a date and I was just meeting her after school for ice cream. Then I explained how my fragile ego couldn\u2019t bear her denying me her company, making her laugh lightly and give in. We stood outside her car for an hour with a pint of ice cream between us. She was shy but also cute and funny. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, I watch as she gets closer and closer, her eyes looking me over then landing on my hand. Today, I stopped at the gas station and got two ice cream cookies. She told me yesterday these are her favorite. I hold one out to her, and she smiles as she shakes her head, making my heart beat a little faster. Yes, I know I\u2019m a f**king pu**y, but I couldn\u2019t give a f**k.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here\u201d\u2014she pauses\u2014\u201cagain?\u201d she asks, taking the ice cream from my hand and unwrapping it.</p><p>\u201cSomeone told me you like these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has a big mouth,\u201d she says, taking a bite out of the giant frozen cookie.</p> <p>\u201cShe does,\u201d I agree, looking at her mouth.</p><p>She laughs and smacks me on the chest. She covers her mouth with her hand, chewing while holding up one finger. \u201cWhat are you really doing here?\u201d she asks after she swallows.</p><p>\u201cJust in the neighborhood.\u201d I shrug and take a bite of my cookie before immediately spitting it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cHey! What the hell?\u201d she asks, offended, grabbing the rest of the cookie out of my hand.</p><p>\u201cThat tastes like shit.\u201d I wipe my mouth before reaching into my car for a bottle of water.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she defends with an exasperated look on her face.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it tastes like cardboard,\u201d I tell her, watching as her face goes soft at my endearment.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I like eating cardboard then.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, looking at her smile. \u201cSo are you working tomorrow?\u201d I ask her, leaning against my car.</p><p>She finishes off her cookie, and mine is halfway to her mouth when she answers, \u201cYes, but tomorrow I work from home.\u201d She puts her bag on top of my car, leans her side against the door, and takes another bite of her ice cream.</p><p>I watch her movements, noticing that everything is so fluid and graceful. The urge to touch her is so overwhelming I have to cross my arms over my chest to keep myself in check.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you? Do you work tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I have some time off,\u201d I reply, watching her closely.</p><p>She nods her head and looks around. \u201cI never asked you\u2014what kind of work do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bounty hunter,\u201d I answer smoothly.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she says, her eyes getting big. \u201cLike Dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the TV show Dog the Bounty Hunter?\u201d I ask, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYeah! I used to love that show!\u201d She smiles and her cheeks turn pink. She lowers her head so her hair falls in front of her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that, but yeah, that\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d she asks, her eyes meeting mine and her face losing some of the color.</p><p>\u201cIt can be if you\u2019re not smart,\u201d I confirm with a nod.</p><p>\u201cAre you smart?\u201d Her words are quietly spoken.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d I watch in fascination as her eyes go from worried to respect.</p><p>\u201cHow often do you work?\u201d she asks while taking another bite of the cookie.</p><p>\u201cIt depends. Sometimes once a month, and others, three times a week.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. I mean, it\u2019s cool if you like doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I used to work construction with my brothers, but then I got into this by helping my cousin. I found I had a knack for it and haven\u2019t been able to stop. And you, do you like what you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not exciting, but I like it, and it pays the bills, so that\u2019s a plus.\u201d</p><p>I nod in understanding. \u201cWhat about here? Do you like working at the school?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I love doing.\u201d Her face lights up, her voice becoming animated. \u201cI love books. Have since I was a little girl. I used to go to the toy store with my mom and walk out with a book. I guess I\u2019m still like that to this day. I can\u2019t go to the store without buying one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling, doing something you love,\u201d I tell her, knowing how important it is to do things that make you happy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is,\u201d she says and licks her fingers, and it\u2019s in this moment that I know how unaware of herself she really is. She did that not knowing the effect she\u2019s having on me. I doubt she even understands the way she affects men in general. It could be an act, but I seriously doubt it. She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s trying to be seductive; she\u2019s just being herself.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from? You have an accent I can\u2019t place,\u201d I say, trying to clear the image in my head of her licking something else.</p><p>\u201cI have an accent?\u201d she asks, pointing to herself and laughing. Then she shakes her head and replies, \u201cNo, you have an accent. I sound normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may sound normal to yourself, but to me\u2014and I\u2019m sure to a lot of other people around here\u2014you have an accent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought of that.\u201d Her head tilts to the side, her smile getting bigger. \u201cI feel kinda cool. I always wanted an accent, though I wished it was a European one, but hey, I\u2019ll settle for this.\u201d She giggles, and my head goes back and I laugh harder than I have in a long time. When I lift my head and our eyes meet, hers are soft and her smile is gentle. \u201cYou have a really great laugh,\u201d she says almost to herself.</p><p>Words are caught in my throat. I don\u2019t know what it is she\u2019s doing to me, but I feel completely off-kilter. I\u2019m not used to the feelings I\u2019m having. That\u2019s why I tried to walk away from her the first time I saw her, but then she grabbed my arm and I looked down at her, and something in me shifted. I knew if I walked away I would regret it for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cSo I should probably go,\u201d she tells me, looking away quickly.</p><p>My chest tightens in response. I don\u2019t want her to leave, but I don\u2019t want to scare her off either. \u201cCan I get your number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I...\u201d She studies me, her eyes searching my face. \u201cYeah, okay. Sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Just program it into my phone.\u201d I pull my phone out of my back pocket and hand it to her.</p><p>\u201cOh...okay.\u201d She presses the button on my phone, and in her concentration, her bottom lip gets a workout from her teeth.</p><p>My fingers automatically curve under her chin, pulling her lip down with my thumb so she releases it. Her head lifts and her lips part. Our eyes lock, and I fight the urge to lean forward and press my mouth to hers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that, baby,\u201d I say quietly before cupping my hand around hers, pulling her concentration back to my phone in her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispers, the pink tip of her tongue coming out to lick her lip, making me groan.</p><p>When she is done plugging in her number, I take the phone from her and press the call button. Her phone starts ringing and she pulls it from her bag. I slip it from her hand to look at the picture on the screen, and this time, it\u2019s a picture of the ocean at sunset.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d I tell her, and I smile when her eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t change it because of you. I just got tired of looking at that picture,\u201d she says defensively, pulling the phone from my hand. I smile bigger, and I know it\u2019s cocky, but I can\u2019t bring myself to care. She slaps my chest with the back of her hand again, but I catch it before she can pull it away. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d she cries, making me laugh.</p> <p>I tug her hand and she steps towards me. \u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s standing so close that her apple-cinnamon smell floods my system. This close, I can see a small scattering of freckles along the ridge of her nose, and I also notice that her eyes have small golden flecks near the center but are almost black around the edges.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot of tattoos.\u201d Her softly spoken words pull my attention from her face to where she\u2019s touching me.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>I watch as her finger traces a few of the tattoos on my hand that\u2019s holding hers. Her skin is completely unmarked. She\u2019s so pure I don\u2019t even want to touch her; something about her is too sweet for someone like me.</p> <p>\u201cI use to want a tattoo,\u201d she says, sounding far away. Her face is still bent down, watching as her fingers wander over my skin. I\u2019m so hard I\u2019m surprised my dick doesn\u2019t bust through my jeans to get to her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t anymore?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Her head comes up, and she swallows, shrugs, and shakes her head.</p><p>Those alarm bells are going off again, but I don\u2019t understand why. \u201cSo you never told me where you\u2019re from,\u201d I say, wanting to know as much as I can about her from just talking to her. I can have her background checked, and I will, but I still want her to open up to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Seattle,\u201d she answers quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought you here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was just ready for a change.\u201d She shrugs and steps back. Someone who isn\u2019t used to reading people may not have noticed the wobble of her chin or the way her little fist clenched at her side, but I did. \u201cI really need to go. Thanks for the ice cream.\u201d She pulls her bag closer to her body, almost as if she\u2019s trying to protect herself.</p><p>I don\u2019t move; I know she\u2019s running, but I just don\u2019t know what from. I definitely don\u2019t want her to run from me.</p><p>\u201cAny time, sweet Sophie,\u201d I tell her gently. \u201cSend me a text when you get home.\u201d</p><p>She nods and opens her door. When it\u2019s shut, she rolls down the window. \u201cBye, Nico.\u201d</p><p>I lift my chin and watch her take off. I\u2019m still standing there watching when she pulls out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t date.\u201d Fuck. My head drops, and I know exactly who\u2019s speaking. \u201cI tried, and a few other guys have tried, so don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to date you?\u201d I turn around to face the guy from the office.</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear me? I said she didn\u2019t want to date me or anyone else that\u2019s asked her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? All that means to me is she\u2019s got taste,\u201d I tell him with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he says, walking off.</p><p>I shake my head in revulsion. I have known guys like him my whole life; they think if a woman doesn\u2019t want them, then there must be something wrong with her, when in reality, it\u2019s them.</p><p>I get in my car and watch as he gets in his. He puts on a pair of sunglasses and looks at himself in the mirror before taking off. I pull out my cell and dial Justin, our computer guru. He knows how to find information on anyone and anything.</p><p>\u201cHey, man. How\u2019s it hanging?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cA little to the left,\u201d he says, laughing at his own joke. I smile but don\u2019t laugh along with him. \u201cSo, I guess your calling for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have a phone number I need you to run for me.\u201d I give him the number, listening as he plugs it in on his keyboard.</p><p>\u201cIs this about the girl you\u2019re seeing?\u201d he asks with a grin in his voice.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you f**kers need a f**king life.\u201d I lay my head back against my headrest.</p><p>\u201cHey, I just know because Kenton said you turned down the chance for a stripper to stay with you. I offered him my place and told him she could share my bed with me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, shut up and run the number. You wouldn\u2019t even know what to do with a woman if she sat on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve watched plenty of educational material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have.\u201d I can\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so on a soft run, it says her name is Sophie Grates. She\u2019s twenty-three, owns her house, which she paid in full, and has a credit score of seven twenty. She drives an Audi and owes six thousand on it. She has two credit cards in her name\u2014one American Express and one Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2014both paid on time. Her mom passed away in a car accident when Sophie was fifteen. She got emancipated when she was sixteen and went into Job Corps.\u201d My stomach is in knots. Her mom passed away when she was so young, and not long after that, she moved out on her own. \u201cDid you hear me, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if you wanted me to do a hard run on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Thanks, man. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he says and hangs up.</p><p>I pull out of the parking lot thinking about sweet Sophie being on her own for so long. When I reach my house, my phone buzzes, and I pull it out after shutting off my car.</p><p>Sophie: Home ?</p><p>I feel my heart thud in my chest when I see it\u2019s her.</p><p>Me: Where\u2019s home?</p><p>Sophie: Nice try.</p><p>I grin when she doesn\u2019t give in so easily.</p><p>Me: If I don\u2019t know, how can I bring you ice cream?</p><p>Sophie: You can\u2019t.</p><p>My eyebrows pull together as I try again.</p><p>Me: What about taking you out?</p><p>Sophie: I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s a good idea.</p><p>She clearly doesn\u2019t like the idea of going out anywhere, so I try a different tactic.</p><p>Me: What about dinner at my place? Or yours?</p><p>Sophie: How do I know you\u2019re not a serial killer? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laugh aloud as I type out my response.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m not.

I could be a crazy person.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to scare her away, but I give her a little taste of the intensity I feel when it comes to her.</p> <p>Me: I never run, Sophie. NEVER.</p><p>Sophie: Oh.</p><p>Me: All right, sweet Sophie. Get some sleep and message me tomorrow.</p><p>Sophie: Night, Nico.</p><p>I swear I can hear her whisper those words to me, and I let out a deep breath I didn\u2019t realize I was holding and finally make my way inside my townhouse.</p><p>Sophie</p> <p>Oh God, what was I thinking? I put down my phone and look around my bedroom and then at my bed. I doubt Nico could even fit on the thing. Wait, why the hell am I thinking about him fitting in my bed? We\u2019re not going to be in bed; we\u2019re going to be eating in the kitchen. An image of me sitting on the counter and Nico in front of me with his head between my legs has me groaning and covering my face. Dinner... Think about dinner. What could I make him to eat? I don\u2019t think he would be impressed with a meal consisting of Lean Cuisine.</p><p>I pull out my laptop and type in \u2018food that men like to eat.\u2019 Half the things on the list of guy-food has me gagging, like lamb. There was no way I could make lamb without thinking of a cute little lamb face. Other things on the list\u2014like calf liver and hog trotters\u2014just leave me feeling nauseated and wondering if men really eat that kind of stuff. After thirty minutes of searching, I decide to just make pasta with meat sauce, which seems to be a common ingredient in all the meals I\u2019ve looked through. Meat, meat, and more meat. I lie down on my bed and start giggling. Men with meat like meat. Okay, I need help. I\u2019m definitely nervous about tomorrow.</p><p>I haven\u2019t dated; I have always been too scared. My mom passed away when I was fifteen, leaving only my dad to raise me. Not long after her passing, my dad started drinking. At first, it was a beer here and there, but then it turned into an every-night thing. When I was sixteen, he started going out nightly to a local bar. The bar closed at one, and thirty minutes later, my dad would come home, bringing the party with him. I never felt safe; I was constantly on edge, never knowing if someone would stumble into my room drunk or high. I told my dad that I didn\u2019t feel safe, but he just waved it off as me being a dramatic teenager.</p><p>Then one night, I was sick\u2014like really sick. I had a fever and needed water and Tylenol. I got up and made my way into the kitchen, and once I was there, a guy who often attended my dad\u2019s parties cornered me in the kitchen. I remember the fear I felt when he shoved me into the corner near the fridge, away from the view of all the others. I tried to get free from his hold, but he only held me tighter, and when I attempted to scream, he covered my mouth with his as he tried to force me to kiss him. I fought back as much as I could, and when another man showed up, I felt relief\u2014until he started helping the guy who was holding me. They were both mocking me, telling me all the horribly disgusting things they were going to do to me.</p><p>I can still remember seeing people coming in and out of the kitchen, either oblivious to what was going on or not caring. When one of them stuck their hand between my legs, I reared my head back, busting the guy who first cornered me in the nose. Blood went everywhere. His hands let me go, as did his friend\u2019s, and I ran out of the kitchen to my room, locking the door behind me. I hid in my closet with my phone and called the police. Not long after that, my dad came into my room and found me in the closet. He looked distraught, apologizing for everything that happened, but I couldn\u2019t care anymore. I was done making excuses for him.</p><p>Two weeks later, I got emancipated from my father and joined Job Corps. It\u2019s what I needed at the time, the environment almost military. We had schedules we had to keep, things we were responsible for, and school, which I excelled at. I\u2019ve never regretted what I did. The only thing I have ever regretted is losing contact with my father, but part of me felt like if I were important to him, he would have gotten into contact with me.</p><p>My phone rings, bringing me out of my thoughts. I look at the name and roll my eyes, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHello, Maggie,\u201d I answer my phone, exaggerating a put-out voice. She\u2019s always teasing me that I lead the most boring life ever, so I play it up for fun.</p> <p>\u201cHey, bitch. What are you up to?\u201d she asks.</p><p>We were roommates in Job Corps and have been the closest friends ever since. She still lives in Seattle and is getting married in a couple months to her longtime fianc\u00e9, Devon, who was also in JC with us.</p><p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, girl. It\u2019s always \u2018nothing much\u2019 with you. When the hell are you going to have some good gossip for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone is a gossip slut like you,\u201d I tell her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cHey, now. I\u2019m not a gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you aren\u2019t.\u201d Maggie knows everything about everyone, and because of her, I know things about people I have never even met in my life\u2014and a lot of those things are details I wish I never, ever knew.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it if people want to open up to me. I\u2019m like Dr. Phil or Oprah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is true,\u201d I say as I lie down on the couch, and I can\u2019t help but laugh when I think about the position I\u2019m in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Dr. Phil, I met someone, and I\u2019m now sprawled on my couch, so you wanna shrink me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d I hear the shock in her voice. Maggie has been trying to get me to date for years, but I have never felt comfortable with anyone before. That\u2019s why it surprises me that Nico\u2014Mr. Tattoo\u2014is the one to make me feel this way. \u201cWell, spill it, girl. Who is he? Tell me everything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Nico, and he is gorgeous, funny, and sweet. He asked me out and I turned him down, but then the last two days, he\u2019s been waiting for me by my car with ice cream when I got out of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you turned him down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re going out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tomorrow he\u2019s coming over for dinner,\u201d I clarify. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she whispers, knowing how big this is for me.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whisper back, smiling.</p><p>\u201cGirl, I\u2019m so happy for you. Even if things don\u2019t work out with him, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re at least going to get out of that bubble you\u2019ve placed yourself in and try to live a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m doing, and I doubt he will stick around for long after he realizes I\u2019m a crazy, but I want to see what happens,\u201d I tell her, meaning it from the bottom of my soul.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crazy, Sophie. You had a traumatic experience. You just need to realize you\u2019re not broken and that the past has made you a stronger person. I love you, and Devon loves you. You deserve to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d I say, feeling a little defensive.</p><p>\u201cI know you think you\u2019re happy, honey, but you\u2019ve been locking yourself up for way too long. Living a life in solitude is not happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten better,\u201d I whine.</p><p>\u201cYou have. I agree,\u201d she concedes.</p> <p>\u201cI just need time,\u201d I add quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had plenty of time, girl,\u201d she says, sounding frustrated.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I ask exasperatedly.</p><p>\u201cI want you to talk to someone about what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve told me everything, but this is something I can\u2019t help you with. You need to talk to someone who deals with this kind of thing,\u201d she says gently.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t go out with him until I figure things out for myself,\u201d I say, my stomach pitching. The feeling surprises me, making me realize I how much I do want to see him again.</p><p>\u201cDo not use your past as an excuse to not live your life. This guy is the first one you have been interested in. To me, that says it all. Date him and see what happens. Maybe you can open up to him about your past, but while you\u2019re doing that, find a professional to talk to as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re right, but I\u2019m afraid,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cWhich tells me you\u2019re still living in that moment. Honey, that was years ago. Yes, it was a horrible thing that happened to you, but luckily it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could have been.\u201d</p><p>Her words make me shudder, but I know she\u2019s right. I think my mom\u2019s death and the events that happened after I lost her are still plaguing me. It\u2019s hard to get close to people when you realize how quickly they can be taken away.</p><p>\u201cI know it could have been a lot worse, and I need to start living again... I just don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day at a time. Every day, push yourself to do something you\u2019re afraid of. And find a group or a counselor to talk to!\u201d She practically yells the last part.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d I promise.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try. Do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I sigh.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you still coming home for your fitting?\u201d she asks, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I smile. \u201cAnd my dress better not be ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, you should know by now your dress is going to be hideous. I do not want you to outshine me at my own wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that could ever happen.\u201d I laugh.</p><p>Maggie is one of the most beautiful people I know. Her long, lean body with skin the color of dark chocolate makes her honey-colored eyes pop; that, along with her long reddish-brown hair she has kept in thin dreadlocks since she was little, makes her even more exotic-looking.</p><p>\u201cOh please, girl. You know you\u2019re hot,\u201d she says, growling the end.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I tell her, feeling tears sting my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you too, girl. Okay, enough of this mushy shit. Tomorrow, when this guy leaves, I expect you to call me and tell me every detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise. Talk to you then,\u201d I say, listening to her goodbye before hanging up.</p><p>I close my eyes and then open them up, looking at the ceiling feeling a sense of hope when I say aloud to myself, \u201cDon\u2019t try. Do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Nico</p><p>I pull up in front of Sophie\u2019s house and look around the neighborhood. It\u2019s a quiet area where the people\u2014mostly middle class\u2014who work in downtown Nashville live. I pick up the flowers I bought for her off the passenger\u2019s seat and make my way up to her front porch, noticing the flowers that line the walkway and the hanging plants along the front of her house. I stretch my neck before knocking once. I can hear music playing on the other side of the door and then some kind of banging. After a few seconds, I hear a couple of locks turn. Then the door is opened and Sophie is standing there. Her hair is up on top of her head, her cheeks are flushed, and my eyes travel down her body to see that she\u2019s wearing a plain black tank top and jeans with bare feet, her toes painted a deep purple.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says softly, and my eyes leisurely come back up her body to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I greet as she opens the door farther, stepping back for me to enter.</p><p>\u201cDid you find it okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>My brain takes a second to process her words; I\u2019m still stuck on her bare feet and how sexy she looks dressed in jeans. \u201cYeah. I don\u2019t live far from here.\u201d I watch as her eyes look me over, and I see nervousness, but also hunger. We both stand there staring at each other, but then her eyes travel down to my hand and get humorously big. \u201cThese are for you.\u201d I lift my hand, righting the flowers and awkwardly holding them out to her.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. Thank you,\u201d she says breathily, taking the flowers from my hand and bringing them to her face to smell them. After a few moments of just watching her appreciate my simple gift, my dick is already trying to inch closer to her through the roughness of my jeans. She seems to shake herself and tells me, \u201cUm...dinner is cooking. I hope you don\u2019t mind pasta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells great,\u201d I say, breathing in through my nose, the smell of garlic and freshly baked bread assaulting me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think to ask you if you could eat carbs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re all muscles. I know that a lot of weight trainers don\u2019t eat pasta,\u201d she says matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a weight trainer,\u201d I tell her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I work out because my job requires me to stay in shape, but I eat whatever the hell I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good.\u201d She smiles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Once again, we\u2019re both just standing here watching each other. I run a hand through my hair and laugh when I see her eyes drop to my waist. She jumps, her head flying up. \u201cUm...I-I\u2019m just going to put these in some water. Do you want a beer or something?\u201d she rushes out.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, taking a quick look around her house.</p><p>It\u2019s small, maybe two bedrooms, and the living room is comfortably snug, with a TV, a small loveseat, and a matching chair. I follow her into the kitchen, my eyes watching her hips and ass as she walks. The kitchen is a decent size, with a small dining area attached.</p><p>I study her as she pulls a chair from the table, carrying it over to the fridge. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask, seeing the unstable chair wobble as she begins to climb up on top of it.</p> <p>\u201cMy vases are up here,\u201d she says distractedly as she tries to keep her balance on the chair. I walk over to her and pick her up with my hands around her waist. \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d she screeches, her fingers digging into my arms.</p><p>\u201cSaving you from breaking your neck,\u201d I tell her, setting her down and squeezing her waist once before placing my hand on her belly to push her back a step. I move the chair out of the way and open the cupboard. \u201cWhich one do you want?\u201d I look down at her.</p><p>\u201cYou just picked me up,\u201d she mumbles almost to herself.</p><p>\u201cYes, so you wouldn\u2019t accidentally off yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just picked me up like I weighed nothing,\u201d she says in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t weigh much,\u201d I inform her. \u201cSo, which one do you want?\u201d I repeat my question, watching her face.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she replies, and I pull down the first one I touch. \u201cNot that one,\u201d she says, so I put it back in the cupboard and grab another. \u201cNot that one either,\u201d she states, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cBabe, this will go a lot faster if you just tell me which one you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tall, clear pink one,\u201d she answers then bites her lip, and I know she just changed her mind again.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d I ask teasingly.</p><p>She shakes her head. \u201cThe blue one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d My hand hovering over the blue vase.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She nods.</p><p>I pull it down halfway and she reaches up, taking it from me. I close the cupboard and put the chair back.</p><p>\u201cThe beer is in the fridge. There is also tea, juice, and pop. Just help yourself,\u201d she says, picking up the flowers from the counter.</p><p>I grab a beer and lean against the counter to watch her as she measures the flowers, pulls a knife out of the butcher block, lays the flowers over the sink, and then starts to saw the ends off. It takes everything in me not to snatch it away from her and do it myself to make sure she doesn\u2019t cut herself. Once she\u2019s done, she fills the vase with water from the sink\u2019s faucet, drops the flowers in and arranges them, and then sets the bouquet on her table. When she turns around, she jumps like she\u2019s startled.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, pressing her hand to her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou forgot I was here, didn\u2019t you?\u201d I smile.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, looking sheepish. She walks over to the stove and checks the water in the big stainless-steel pot.</p><p>\u201cNot used to having people in your house?\u201d I question, taking another sip of beer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know too many people around here.\u201d</p><p>I watch as she measures out some pasta before dropping it into the boiling water. \u201cHow long have you been in Nashville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months. I wanted to buy a house, and I couldn\u2019t do that in Seattle, so I decided to move down here.\u201d She pulls the lid off another pot, grabbing the long-handled wooden spoon from the spoon rest sitting between the burners and starts stirring whatever it is inside.</p><p>\u201cYou moved by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She shrugs her shoulders and lets out a long breath.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been hard to leave your friends and family behind to move to another state where you didn\u2019t know anyone,\u201d I say gently, not knowing if this topic of conversation will send her shutting down.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I have always kinda been a loner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family?\u201d Even though I already know some about her past, I want her to open up to me.</p><p>\u201cMy mom died when I was fifteen,\u201d she whispers, \u201cand my dad isn\u2019t in my life. My mom and dad were only children, my grandparents are all dead, and I don\u2019t have any siblings.\u201d She bites her lip and continues to stir the pasta sauce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I take a step towards her, running my hand down her back trying to comfort her. Her body stiffens under my touch, and I watch as she forces herself to relax. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask softly, feeling like I need to treat her like a skittish cat I really want to pet.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just... I\u2019m not used to people touching me,\u201d she says, making my heart squeeze. I don\u2019t move away from her. She never said she didn\u2019t like or want people to touch her, just that she\u2019s not used to it. I want her to get used to me touching her.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you making?\u201d I change the subject, using the excuse of seeing what she\u2019s stirring in the pot to move closer to her.</p><p>\u201cSpaghetti with meat sauce,\u201d she replies with a small laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d I smile automatically.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She looks at me over her shoulder, her eyes widening when she sees how close I am to her. \u201cWh\u2014\u201dShe clears her throat. \u201cWhat about you? Does your family live around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey live about forty-five minutes away. I drive to see them every few days.\u201d I lean back against the counter so I can see her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you close to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. My mom and dad are still married and still very much in love. I have three brothers\u2014Asher, Trevor, and Cash. Asher is married and has four girls, Trevor is married and has both a daughter and a son on the way, and Cash has one of each too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCash isn\u2019t married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be getting married again soon. His story is long and contains a lot of drama. His ex-wife is certifiably insane. Now he\u2019s back with his first love, and they have their daughter and my nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You\u2019ve never been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looks at me, and I can see that she wants to say more. \u201cI\u2019ve never been married.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All I can think is, Thank f**k. Her eyes get big, like she\u2019s read my mind, and I smile as I watch her cheeks turn pink.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to help you with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can strain the pasta, that would help.\u201d</p><p>She walks to the sink and puts the colander down inside it before going to the fridge, where she pulls out a salad. Then she walks over to put it on the table. She makes her way back to the stove to turn off all the burners, and as I finish straining all the water from the noodles, I watch her, mesmerized, as she leans close to the sauce, inhales deeply, and lets out a soft moan. Again, she\u2019s completely unaware of how f**king sexy she is.</p> <p>I have to force myself to unlock the death grip I\u2019ve unintentionally clamped onto her plastic colander. Luckily, I haven\u2019t snapped it yet. When we have everything ready, we both sit at the table, where she starts putting the pasta on each of our plates.</p><p>\u201cThis is awkward,\u201d she says, catching me off guard.</p><p>\u201cReally? You think so?\u201d I ask, not feeling the least bit out of place.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d she asks in response, her eyes meeting mine.</p><p>\u201cNo. Do you feel uncomfortable around me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I guess not,\u201d she says, taking a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable, awkward is okay.\u201d I run my fingers over the top of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d she concedes with a little shiver.</p><p>I unwillingly force my hand away from hers to pick up my fork, and while we eat, the conversation is light and easy. After we finish the simple but delicious dinner she cooked, we both stand in the kitchen, me with my hip to the counter, and her sitting across from me next to the sink after we finished washing the dishes.</p><p>\u201cSo, your dog is named Daisy?\u201d She laughs as I pull out my phone to scroll through my pictures so I can show her some of Daisy.</p><p>\u201cHere she is.\u201d I hold my cell out to her.</p> <p>She looks at the screen and her eyebrows rise. Then she brings her focus back to me with a curious look on her face. \u201cShe\u2019s adorable. And so not the kind of dog I would expect you to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I ask with a straight face, knowing the reason. Daisy is a cream-colored miniature Pomeranian who weighed about four pounds the last time I took her to the vet. She looks like she should be some blond-haired, blue-eyed valley girl\u2019s lapdog.</p><p>\u201cYou just seem like you would own a Rottweiler or Doberman,\u201d she says with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I raise an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. that was rude.\u201d She looks back down at the phone.</p><p>I put a finger under her chin, bringing her eyes back to me. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I know she doesn\u2019t fit my image, but she\u2019s mine. I rescued her while I was on a job when she was just a pup, and I had to bottle-feed her. She was so small she fit right in the palm of my hand,\u201d I tell her, holding up my hand and smiling.</p><p>\u201cAww...you\u2019re a proud papa.\u201d The smile she gives me has me wanting to lean in and taste it.</p><p>\u201cI guess I am.\u201d</p> <p>She goes back to looking at my phone, and I go back to watching her. She is beautiful in a way that is completely natural; none of it is fake or for show. It\u2019s just her\u2014who she is. She hands me my phone back, looking around before putting her eyes back on mine. \u201cSo, um...do you want to watch a movie or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, if you\u2019re up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I have Netflix and On-Demand, so you can pretty much pick whatever.\u201d</p><p>I follow her into the living room and sit down on the sofa to watch as she sets up the TV before coming back to sit next to me. Her couch is small, so it forces her to sit close.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to watch?\u201d she asks, turning her head to me.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I twirl a small piece of her hair that has fallen out of her messy bun around my finger.</p><p>\u201cHow about The Breakfast Club? I haven\u2019t seen it in a long time,\u201d she suggests, unconsciously tilting her head towards me.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>I want to kiss her. My brain is battling against my body, wanting to get closer to her, wanting to taste her mouth again; it\u2019s taking everything in me not to close the small gap between us. I watch her eyes flare slightly, and then she licks her bottom lip, making me wonder if she is thinking the same thing.</p><p>Sophie</p><p>I take a deep breath, trying to calm myself. Looking away from Nico takes all my power; I\u2019m so drawn to him that I wonder if it\u2019s normal or healthy, and it makes me second-guess things. I don\u2019t want someone just so they\u2019ll fill the hollow places inside of me.</p><p>\u201cSo, The Breakfast Club it is, then,\u201d I say, trying to be casual about it in an attempt to cover how nervous I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he replies, sitting back against the couch and getting comfortable. Now I\u2019m wishing I would have paid the extra one hundred dollars and gotten a bigger couch instead of the loveseat.</p><p>I start the movie and sit back against the cushion, and I\u2019m so close to him that I can feel the heat from his body. I don\u2019t know how to sit, so I move my legs under me and start to lean against the armrest.</p><p>\u201cCome \u2019ere,\u201d he says with a smile teasing his lips as he pulls me by the arm.</p><p>My body moves into his, his arm sliding around me and holding me to him. He smells like leather and musk, and I want to explore him to find out where the smell is coming from. I bite the tip of my tongue hard, trying to find something else to think about other than how hard his body feels against mine.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispers, running his hand down my arm. I shiver against him\u2014not from cold, but from the way it feels when he touches me. \u201cYou warm enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whisper, taking another breath as my belly goes crazy with butterflies. I feel his chest moving and I think he\u2019s laughing, so I turn my head to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re really adorable,\u201d he says when our eyes meet. I scrunch up my face at him. I don\u2019t want to be adorable; I want to be beautiful or sexy, not adorable.</p><p>\u201cRelax, sweet Sophie. We\u2019re just watching a movie.\u201d His hand cups my cheek, his thumb sliding over my lower lip as his eyes follow.</p><p>My breath catches and I nod. His hand drops and slides around my shoulder, pulling me snug against him. I can\u2019t help but to relax as he slides it gently up and down my arm. We watch the movie in comfortable silence, and at some point, I fall asleep.</p><p>I wake to the room being cast in a blue glow. It takes a second to remember where I am and who I\u2019m lying on. I put my hand to my mouth, knowing that I probably just drooled all over his shirt, and when I turn my head to apologize, I see that he\u2019s asleep. His arm tightens around me like he doesn\u2019t want me to move. I watch him closely, taking in every contour of his face and the slight stubble along his jaw. Even in sleep, he looks dangerous, but then I think about how gentle he is with me and I wonder how it\u2019s possible for someone to be so complicatedly beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he showed up tonight, I wanted to fall into his arms. He looked hot standing there, wearing a plaid shirt with the sleeves rolled up, showing off his tattoos and his black jeans hugging his thighs. Then I saw the flowers. They were such a complete contrast to the way he looks, and I almost laughed when he held them out to me, looking unsure about them.</p><p>My fingers twitch; I want to trace the outline of his lips with my fingers. I lift my hand slowly; my finger touching his bottom lip causes him to jerk his head away. My hand freezes then moves on its own accord when he stills. His lip is smooth and warm, and I can still remember how it felt against my own when he kissed me. My finger moves slowly as I watch its trail, mesmerized, captivated... Then I scream when his mouth clamps down around my finger, his teeth biting down, not hard, but enough so that I can\u2019t pull away.</p><p>My eyes jump up to meet his as his hands go under my arms, his mouth not releasing my finger, and he pulls me on top of him. He runs his tongue over my fingertip behind his teeth as he situates himself underneath me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I breathe.</p> <p>\u201cI think I should be asking you that,\u201d he says, smiling, and I can feel a large bulge against my belly.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just...\u201d I try to get away, but he holds me a little tighter, making my pulse spike.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe with me,\u201d he says, reading my face.</p><p>I force myself to relax, reminding myself that he has been nothing but kind to me.</p><p>\u201cI like that you want to touch me.\u201d He gently pushes my hair away from my face. My eyes close at the contact then open to see him smiling. \u201cWe both fell asleep?\u201d he asks as his hand continues to run over my hair and down my back.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how tired I was,\u201d I say with a nod. My eyes start to feel heavy as he strokes me, so I lay my head against his chest, wondering not for the first time why I feel so safe with someone I don\u2019t know all that well.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d he whispers, pressing his lips to the top of my head.</p><p>I snuggle closer, enjoying his warmth and the way he smells. In the back of my head, I keep thinking about the things Maggie said along with the way Nico makes me feel and how much I want to explore things with him, but I wonder if I should wait until I\u2019m in a better place mentally.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep again, because I\u2019m suddenly aware that I\u2019m being carried into my room. Nico lays me on the bed then pulls a blanket up over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the worst date ever,\u201d I say tiredly as I snuggle down into my bed.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a date, remember?\u201d he says quietly.</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah. I don\u2019t do that.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cIf this was a date, it was the best one I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d His hand slides gently down the side of my face. I think he is going to kiss me\u2014I want him to kiss me\u2014so I turn my head slightly, but his nose skims my cheek, and his lips go to my forehead. \u201cSleep, baby. I\u2019m going to head home. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow,\u201d he tells me, kissing me once more; this time, his lips touch the corner of mine. I watch his shadow leaving the room.</p><p>I can hear the doors close, and I know I need to get up and lock my deadbolt and set the alarm, but it takes a minute for me to get out of bed. I pull off my jeans and bra before wandering into the living room to make sure everything is off. I turn on the hall light and start setting the deadbolt when there is a knock on the door. I look through the peephole, seeing Nico standing on the other side, which makes my belly flutter once again.</p><p>\u201cHey. Did you forget something?\u201d I ask when the door is open.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replies, his body suddenly pressing me against the wall. \u201cJesus,\u201d he groans, looking down my body.</p><p>I forgot I\u2019m almost naked, wearing nothing but a tank top and a pair of boy shorts. When his hand grabs my ass and his mouth lands on mine, I\u2019m instantly reminded of my state of undress. My mouth opens under his, my tongue following what his is doing. My fingers fist into his T-shirt to hold him to me. His hand on my ass squeezes, making me moan into his mouth. He presses me harder into the wall, and I can feel his excitement through his jeans and my thin tank top.</p><p>I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing, so I follow his lead and give up everything I have to that kiss. He rips his mouth away before placing his forehead to mine. We\u2019re both breathing heavily, and it takes a second to come back to myself. I slowly loosen my hands, which have wrapped around his shirt so tightly that my fingers now have impressions on them. He tightens his hand on my ass, his fingers digging into my skin. When I open my eyes, his eyes are on my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep tonight if I didn\u2019t come back and do that.\u201d He presses his lips to mine again, this time just a touch before moving away.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back for that.\u201d I feel my cheeks heat up, and I start to look away, but his fingers go under my chin. His eyes roam my face, and I don\u2019t know what he sees, but I feel exposed and want to pull away.</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweet Sophie. Get some sleep.\u201d His hand drops from my ass, and as his body pulls away from mine, he takes his warmth with him. He kisses my forehead and then tilts my head back to kiss my mouth once more before heading out the door he just barged through. \u201cLock up, babe,\u201d he says over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, Nico,\u201d I say softly, closing the door behind him. My fingers touch my mouth and I smile as I lean back against the door. I could definitely get used to him kissing me.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Nico</p><p>I pull up to the front of my house, exhausted. It\u2019s been four days since I\u2019ve seen Sophie. I got a call for a run I couldn\u2019t pass up not long after I left her standing inside her house wearing nothing but a tank top and panties, her mouth still swollen from what mine did to it. My phone buzzes, and thinking that it\u2019s her, I look at the screen, but instead, I see that it\u2019s a text from Asher. I groan, opening the message; all I want to do is take a shower and sleep before I see Sophie.</p><p>Asher: You busy?</p><p>Yes, busily about to pass out, I think.</p><p>Me: Why?</p><p>Don\u2019t say you need me; don\u2019t say you need me... I chant to myself with my fingers crossed as I wait for his reply.</p><p>Asher: I need your help setting up the pool fence.</p><p>\u201cShiiit,\u201d I groan out loud. I scrub my eyes with my fists and let out a sigh before I respond.</p><p>Me: On my way.</p><p>When I pull out onto the highway and hit dial on my phone, the loud ringing fills my car.</p><p>\u201cHey. Did you make it home already?\u201d Sophie answers, making me smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did, but then my brother messaged me, so I\u2019m heading to his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept. Are you going to be okay?\u201d The concern in her voice only solidifies why she is the one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay. I was hoping I could see you at some point tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she replies quietly, making my eyes draw together.</p> <p>\u201cOh? Baby, you know you\u2019re a killer on a man\u2019s ego, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>I listen as she takes a breath, but when she doesn\u2019t continue, I ask, \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever dated anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, a virgin?\u201d I joke, expecting her to laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI should let you go while you\u2019re driving,\u201d she says quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d I grip my steering wheel tighter.</p><p>\u201cI really should,\u201d she argues.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to tell me exactly what\u2019s wrong with you,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m getting off the phone,\u201d she snaps, and the phone goes dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d I press dial on the phone again, and this time, it goes right to voicemail.</p> <p>She\u2019s lucky I have to meet my brother; otherwise, I would be at her house dealing with this shit face to face. I drive the rest of the way to Asher\u2019s with my music on full blast, thinking over our conversation. I have never let a woman affect me, never given a f**k what they think, say, or do. I have been told the same shit my whole life about the boom and used to think it was a bunch of bullshit. That is, until Asher met November, Trevor pulled his head out of his ass and claimed Liz, and now Cash with Lilly. Then I felt it for myself when I saw Sophie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such an ass**le,\u201d I say aloud as everything clicks into place. Her shyness, the way she carries herself, how her body reacts when I touch her\u2014 either she\u2019s had very little experience or is a virgin, and I just threw that shit in her face. \u201cFuck me,\u201d I whisper into my empty car. I shake my head and drive the rest of the way, coming up with a plan. No way am I letting her push me away.</p><p>I pull up to Asher\u2019s house twenty minutes later, shut off my car, and hop out.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nico\u2019s here!\u201d July yells over her shoulder before running down the steps straight into me.</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d I swing her up into my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring Daisy,\u201d she pouts, looking over my shoulder and into my car.</p><p>\u201cNope. She\u2019s at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww! But I wanted to see her,\u201d she whines.</p> <p>\u201cHow about the next time I go out of town, you babysit her for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d she squeals.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I say, kissing her head before setting her down once we get into the house.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re here,\u201d November says as soon as she sees me. I raise an eyebrow, and she shakes her head as she gives me a hug. \u201cThose three\u201d\u2014she points out the glass backdoors towards the pool where Asher, Trevor, and Cash are all standing\u2014\u201chave been trying to get the kid gate put up around the pool for the last three hours. I tried to help them, but they refused to listen. Hopefully, now that you\u2019re here, they will stop arguing like a bunch of old ladies and just get it done already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d I laugh when she rolls her eyes. Then I walk out to the back patio and down to the pool area where\u2014just like November said\u2014Asher, Trevor, and Cash are all arguing.</p><p>\u201cYou do know that, if you guys stopped bitching for a few minutes, you would probably already be done, right?\u201d I ask, walking up to join the circle.</p><p>\u201cYou think this shit\u2019s easy? There aren\u2019t even instructions in English! All this shit is in Chinese,\u201d Cash complains, shoving the piece of paper at me.</p><p>I don\u2019t even bother looking for English directions; I just look at the picture, glance at the pieces, and immediately start to assemble the fence.</p><p>\u201cYou have always been a f**king show-off,\u201d Trevor says in disgust, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just mad I\u2019m smarter than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wish, motherfucker,\u201d he replies, helping me put pieces together.</p><p>\u201cYou girls going to stand there and watch, or are you going to help us out?\u201d I ask Asher and Cash, who are both just standing over us in identical poses with their arms crossed over their chests.</p><p>Realizing they\u2019ve been called out, they immediate jump into action. It takes thirty minutes to get the last piece attached, but once we\u2019re done, we all stand back to appreciate our hard work.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t take long to do once y\u2019all stopped bitching,\u201d I pointed out, just to rub it in their faces.</p><p>\u201cWe would have figured it out...eventually,\u201d Cash says, smiling\u2014something he does a lot more these days.</p><p>\u201cHow are Lilly and Ashlyn doing living with you?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cGood. They\u2019re settling in. Never thought I\u2019d be thankful to Jules for anything in my life besides Jax, but she proved to be useful getting Lilly to live with me, even if the situation was f**ked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I agree; Lilly is the best thing to happen to Jax and Cash. Every time I\u2019m around them as a family, I see the love she has for my brother. In the beginning, I was worried about her intentions, but now, I know she is exactly what Cash said she is\u2014a good woman.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s work been?\u201d Trevor asks. He always asks me the same thing, and I know they all want me to go back to working with them, but I can\u2019t; I love what I do.</p><p>\u201cGood. Busy.\u201d I give him the same vague answer I always do.</p><p>\u201cGuess there\u2019s never a short supply of criminals. At least you have job security,\u201d Asher says, laughing.</p><p>I look at my brothers and chuckle. I\u2019m blessed to have such an awesome family, and I can\u2019t wait for everyone to meet Sophie.</p><p>I pull up in front of Sophie\u2019s house a little after ten; all of her lights are out, but that\u2019s not going to stop me from seeing her right now. I\u2019m about to get out of the car when I see movement. It\u2019s dark out, but I can see someone in all black walking around the side of her house. I reach over and open my glove box, grabbing my Glock. I get out of my car and put the gun in the waistband of my jeans at my back. I pull my hoodie down over it before heading towards her house.</p><p>I stay in the shadows, watching as the guy walks around to her backyard. I follow but then stop long enough to send a quick text to Kenton with the address, along with a code telling him that I need backup. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watch the person as they walk from window to window, and I can tell that whoever it is is trying to find a way inside.

Just as they are getting ready to climb inside, I put my hand to the back of their sweatshirt and yank them back.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d a male\u2019s voice cries as I place my gun to his head.</p><p>Rage like I have never felt in my life consumes me. I feel out of control and know I could kill this guy without a second thought.</p><p>\u201cI was just going to ask you the same question, motherfucker,\u201d I say near his ear.

I fight to take back control of the muscles in my body that have been seized by the voltage from the Taser.</p><p>\u201cNico?\u201d I hear Sophie\u2019s voice behind me. I look over my shoulder and our gazes meet before she looks down at my side, her eyes going wide. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, go back inside,\u201d I tell her through gritted teeth. I don\u2019t want her out here if the guy is still around.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, go back inside. Now,\u201d I say, watching as she does what she\u2019s told before I pull out my phone to call Kenton to let him know what just happened.</p> <p>After I finally get control back, I check around the house to see if I can catch the guy\u2019s trail, but there is no sign of him. I\u2019ve circled the house three times when Kenton pulls up and parks behind my car.</p><p>\u201cCops are on the way,\u201d he says as soon as he gets out.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I run my hands down my face.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did he get the drop on you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting him to have a Taser,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cYou know the rules, man. Expect the unexpected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me that shit,\u201d I growl, already completely pissed off at myself. Thinking that something could\u2019ve happened to Sophie when I was right here because I wasn\u2019t on my game has me mad as f**k.</p><p>\u201cIs that her?\u201d Kenton asks, looking over at the house.</p><p>I turn to see Sophie standing just inside her open front door. \u201cIt is.\u201d I take a deep breath as I look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhere the f**k did you find her?\u201d</p><p>My head turns to him, and I can see the appreciation on his face. \u201cCousin or not, I will f**k you up,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cJust a question,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>I shake my head, not in the mood for bullshit right now.</p><p>It takes a few minutes for the cops to show. Luckily for us, we\u2019re in good with the local precinct and know most of the men who show up. As soon as I\u2019ve told them what went down, I head up to the house where Sophie is standing on the front porch, her face free of makeup, her hair down around her shoulders, her legs covered in pajama bottoms with cupcakes all over them. She has a sweatshirt pulled tight around her middle.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I pulled up, I saw someone walking around the back of your house. I followed him and watched as he tried to open a few windows until he got to the last one\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cuts me off. \u201cOh my God! What was he going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019re safe, baby,\u201d I tell her, closing the distance between us. I pull her into my chest, not giving her a choice but to take comfort from me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make a statement to the police about what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand what happened,\u201d she whispers, and I can hear the fear in her voice, which only serves to make me angrier. I squeeze her a little tighter, reminding myself that she is here and safe, but my mind knows what could have happened. \u201cHow did you know to come?\u201d she asks into my chest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I just wasn\u2019t going to let you push me away,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>Her body goes tight, and then I hear the faint whisper of her words spoken against my T-shirt as her body relaxes against mine. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply; I don\u2019t need to. She couldn\u2019t have kept me away if she\u2019d tried.</p><p>It\u2019s almost midnight by the time the police leave. Sophie is a mess after learning that the person who tried to break into her house had gotten away without anyone having a clue about who he was. I close the door behind the cops and turn to see Sophie biting her lip and looking around her living room.</p><p>\u201cYou should pack a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack a bag for what?\u201d she asks, taking off her hoodie, leaving her in nothing but a light-blue tank top. My eyes drop to her br**sts, seeing her ni**les through the thin material.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay with me for the night,\u201d I say, watching as she paces around the living room. My eyes and dick follow her every move.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s not happening. I appreciate you being here for me, but I\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she says, and I can tell she\u2019s still worried, even though she\u2019s trying to cover it up.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not staying at my house with me, then I\u2019m staying here with you,\u201d I tell her firmly.</p><p>\u201cUm...no,\u201d she replies, turning a little pink.</p><p>\u201cSophie, I don\u2019t have time to argue with you about this shit. I\u2019m f**king tired. I just got off the road, dealt with family shit, and then showed up here to talk to you, only to have to deal with some crazy-ass motherfucker trying to break into your house,\u201d I growl, losing patience.</p><p>She looks at me and her eyes go soft, and she takes a breath before looking around her small living space. \u201cWhat are we doing, Nico? We don\u2019t even know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing. This is part of dating. We\u2019re going to get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNico, this is just...\u201d She pauses, lifting her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s just... I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of it haven\u2019t you done, baby?\u201d I question while taking a step towards her.</p><p>\u201cI have never done any of this.\u201d She motions between us with a flick of her wrist.</p><p>\u201cI have never done this before either,\u201d I say softly, approaching my skittish kitten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She lets out a long breath.</p><p>\u201cHave I f**ked women before? Yes, I have. I\u2019m not going to lie and say I\u2019ve saved myself, but this\u2014me pursuing you, wanting to spend time with you in and out of bed, getting to know you and your likes and dislikes? All of this shit is new to me, sweet Sophie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou might regret trying to get to know me,\u201d she mumbles, looking down at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you with one hundred percent certainty that the only thing I would regret is not trying,\u201d I tell her with a finger under her chin as I force her eyes up to meet mine. \u201cNow, are we staying here, or at my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNico\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie, if we stay here, I need to go get Daisy. I\u2019ve been gone. She doesn\u2019t like to be alone all the time, and I told my neighbor she didn\u2019t need to go over there tonight because I would be home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m sleeping on the couch.\u201d She breathes out a whoosh of air, blowing some hair out of her face. I smile, and her eyes narrow. \u201cWhy do I feel like I just got screwed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, when you get screwed, you\u2019ll know it,\u201d I smirk.</p><p>\u201cNico.\u201d She glares as she says my name, sounding like a warning. I smile, making her growl.</p><p>\u201cSophie, relax,\u201d I say soothingly.</p><p>\u201cHow can I relax when you say things like that?\u201d</p> <p>I walk over to the couch, sit down, and then grab her hand, forcing her into my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d she cries, trying to get up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk,\u201d I say, squeezing her hips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to sit on your lap in order for us to talk,\u201d she complains, squirming and trying to get away.</p><p>\u201cI want you here. Stop wiggling your hot little ass around on my lap or we\u2019re going to end up doing something else.\u201d</p><p>Her body stills immediately and she crosses her arms over her chest. \u201cFine. Talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I tell her. She doesn\u2019t, so I turn her face with my fingers. \u201cYou said you haven\u2019t done this before, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she growls, and I catch myself before I laugh.</p><p>\u201cAll right, baby. I want you to be honest with me. Are you a virgin?\u201d I ask gently.</p><p>\u201cThat is none of your business!\u201d she snaps as she tries to get up again.</p><p>\u201cI plan on being well-acquainted with your body, so yes, it is my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! Why do you say things like that?\u201d She wiggles on my lap again, causing my already-hard c**k to turn steel under her.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth. I want to know you, Sophie, but I need to know what I\u2019m dealing with so I don\u2019t go too fast for you,\u201d I say, looking into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is too fast,\u201d she mumbles, making me smile again.</p> <p>\u201cI will never force you to do something you don\u2019t want to do, but I will always encourage you when I know you\u2019re just afraid to try. You can\u2019t let your fears hold you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she whispers, her eyes getting big, making me feel like I just hit the nail on the head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to you that made you lock yourself away, but I know that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done. I hope you can open up to me about it someday, but until you can talk to me about whatever it was, I need you to be open with me about other things. I don\u2019t want you to be afraid of me, and I\u2019m not going to know if it\u2019s just nerves or something else unless you\u2019re honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m a virgin.\u201d She pulls her face away from my hand. \u201cAre you happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing wrong with that, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. What other twenty-three-year-old woman do you know who is a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone, but I\u2019m not going to complain that you are. The thought of another man touching you makes me wanna f**k something up.\u201d My grip around her hips tightens slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201d I pull her face towards me and then tilt it down so I can kiss her forehead. \u201cNow go pack a bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, you\u2019re bossy,\u201d she grumbles, getting off my lap.</p><p>I sit in the living room, waiting on her for a while. I\u2019m not really sure how long it\u2019s been, because I start to doze, and my eyes are closed when I hear her enter. I open one eye to see her standing across the room, watching me.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she says, walking into the kitchen to grab her keys and purse off the counter. We head out the front door. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow you in my car so I\u2019ll have it there in the morning when I go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Now let\u2019s go. I\u2019m ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you,\u201d she says from beside me as I tug her keys out of her hand and lock the door.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, sweet Sophie,\u201d I tell her, leading her to her car and not saying anything else about it. I make sure she\u2019s in before I make my way across the street to my own.</p><p>Once we pull up to my house, I pull into the right side of my driveway so she can fit her car next to mine. I hop out, meeting her at the front of her car, where I take her bag from her and then put my hand on her lower back to guide her up to the front porch.</p><p>\u201cThis is your house?\u201d she asks in awe.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I tell her, trying to see what she sees.</p><p>I live in a 2,2,000-square-foot two-story brick townhouse with a two-car garage at the end of a cul-de-sac. My brothers hate where I live, preferring to have lots of land, but for me, I don\u2019t need all that. I like having neighbors and a sense of community.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, opening the door, and immediately, Daisy starts jumping around at our feet.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Sophie squeals as she bends down, plucking Daisy, who is all too happy to have someone to lick and pay attention to her, off the floor.</p><p>I set Sophie\u2019s bag down on the couch before walking into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water out of the fridge. \u201cYou want something to drink?\u201d I ask, watching her as her eyes move around the house to take everything in.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m just ready for bed.\u201d She yawns, and Daisy takes the opportunity to lick into her mouth. \u201cEwww.\u201d She laughs, kissing Daisy\u2019s head before setting her on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou finally see me, huh?\u201d I ask, scooping up my dog. I pet her for a minute before grabbing her a treat and setting her down again. \u201cI\u2019ll show you to your room if you\u2019re ready to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d She yawns again, covering her mouth.</p><p>I walk to the couch, getting her bag before heading to one of my spare bedrooms. I want her to sleep in my room, but I know without even trying that it would be pushing it. \u201cI\u2019m right across the hall if you need me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says, looking around, seeming a little unsure of herself.</p><p>\u201cThis is the bathroom,\u201d I tell her, tapping my knuckles on one of the doors. I go to the closet to get down an extra blanket and set it on the bed. Daisy runs in excitedly and jumps up on the bed, looking between us for a second before curling up and lying down. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, girl.\u201d I pick her up, bringing her to my chest.</p><p>\u201cShe can stay in here with me if she wants,\u201d Sophie says, looking at Daisy with a small smile.</p><p>I unconsciously give the pup a peck on top of her head, eliciting wet licks under my chin when I look up and ask, \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind,\u201d she says, looking at me with soft eyes.</p><p>I set Daisy back on the bed, and then pull Sophie into me. \u201cRemember, I\u2019m across the hall if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cAll right, baby. Get some sleep.\u201d I bend down, kissing her forehead and then her mouth before heading out of the room.</p><p>I walk across the hall, take off my clothes, and get into bed. I lie there, hands under my pillow, looking at the ceiling, thinking about my life and what I do for a living, and wondering how that could affect the girl across the hall. It takes a while for sleep to take me even though I am completely exhausted, but when it does, I dream about a brown-eyed girl.</p> <p>What I didn\u2019t know was that, for the first time ever, the girl across the hall felt something other than fear when she went to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\u201cHey, you need to wake up.\u201d</p><p>The voice close to my ear makes me scream out, and I roll away and sit up, looking around and not recognizing where I am. Then my eyes land on Nico, and last night comes back to me. I flop back down on the bed and cover my face with my hands while trying to get my heart back under control.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you, but your alarm has been going off for the last twenty minutes.\u201d</p> <p>I uncover my face, look over at Nico, and inhale deeply. He\u2019s only wearing a pair of loose basketball shorts. His whole body is perfect\u2014from his defined arms, the expanse of his wide chest, his abs, and the deep V leading into his shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou were working out?\u201d I ask like an idiot, seeing sweat covering his entire torso.</p><p>He smirks, running a hand over his head. \u201cYeah. I needed to burn off some pent-up energy,\u201d he says, and I see his eyes drop to my br**sts, watching as they heat before meeting mine again. \u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to be working out a lot,\u201d he mumbles.</p><p>I bite my lip to keep from laughing. Daisy decides then to crawl out from under the covers, where she slept the whole night. When she finally wiggles free, she runs back and forth between the two of us before deciding that she wants Nico. I watch as he lifts her to his face just far enough away that she can\u2019t reach him with her tongue, and then he flips her to her back and holds her against his chest like a baby so he can rub her belly. I swear I can hear music playing and see little hearts dancing around my head with how swoon-worthy he is standing there with his tiny dog who, I can tell without a doubt, he adores. I never thought I would be jealous of a dog, but what I wouldn\u2019t give to have him pet me like that.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. What time is it?\u201d I mumble, distracted by his abs.</p><p>\u201cJust after seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d I yell, throwing back the covers and hopping out of bed. \u201cI have to get ready for work or I\u2019m going to be late.\u201d I run to the end of the bed to grab my bag and make a run for the bathroom when I\u2019m tugged backwards. I look back and see Nico with his hand around the strap of my bag.</p> <p>\u201cYou can get ready as soon as you tell me good morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Morning,\u201d I say in a rush, trying to tug free.</p><p>\u201cTell me good morning with your mouth, Sophie.\u201d The command in his voice has a tingle building between my legs, and I watch nervously as he puts Daisy down on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathe, and he laughs, pulling me closer with his hand on my bag.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I need to brush my teeth,\u201d I say, looking at his lips.</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to kiss me,\u201d he says, tugging until I\u2019m standing in front of him.</p><p>I fidget there for a second, just looking at him, not really sure how to do this but surprisingly wanting to. Then I remember that movie with Will Smith, when he tells the guy that, if he\u2019s going to kiss someone, he should only lean in halfway and make the other person close the distance. I drop my bag, stand on my tiptoes, lean in my half, and close my eyes. When nothing happens, I open one eye and then the other.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d he says before his mouth comes down on mine in a light kiss that makes my insides flutter. \u201cI always want you to know it\u2019s me kissing you,\u201d he says against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d I say without thinking.</p><p>I groan and start to look at the ground when his hands circle my neck, his thumbs going under my chin to tilt my head back. His face lowers to mine, his tongue touches my bottom lip, and I lean closer, my hands landing on his chest, feeling the heat of his skin under my palms. My mouth opens, and he groans when my tongue touches his. I\u2019m so lost in the kiss that I whimper when he pulls his mouth from mine.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how I want you to say good morning.\u201d His hands travel down to mine, which are still on his chest, and he grabs them to pull them back behind his neck. Then his hands travel down along my sides and to my waist, pulling my hips closer to his.</p><p>\u201cI have to get ready for work,\u201d I say softly, my hands running up the back of his longer hair to run it through my fingers.</p><p>His hands palm my ass, pulling me even closer to him. \u201cI like you here,\u201d he says as his fingers travel up the back of my tank and run along my back. I like it here too. I don\u2019t know what this is, but I like it, and I want more. \u201cYou get off at six, right?\u201d he asks. It takes a second for me to answer; the warmth of his skin, his scent, and the way his hands feel on me all have my body buzzing with something I\u2019ve never felt before. \u201cYou wanna have dinner at your house or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to cook?\u201d I ask, tilting my head to the side studying his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, nipping my neck and making my breath hitch.</p><p>\u201cI really need to get ready for work,\u201d I say again, my hands going down the back of his neck from his shoulders to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to let you go, but I know you need to get ready,\u201d he says, bringing his face to mine and kissing me once more on the mouth before turning me around to face the bathroom; he pats my ass, sending me on my way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walk into the bathroom before remembering I left my bag. I go back out to grab it, and he has it in his hand, holding it out to me with a smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, reaching out to take it. I squeak out when he drops the bag, grabs my hand, and pulls me back to him, hearing the thud at the same time his mouth lands on mine. His hands go to my ass, lifting me closer to him, and this time, the kiss is a lot deeper and rougher than the ones before.</p><p>I\u2019m panting and trying to crawl up his body when he pulls his mouth away from mine, muttering a quiet, \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, bringing my fingers to my lips.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need to work out a lot,\u201d he growls, making me smile at his words. \u201cAll right, now,\u201d he says, picking up my bag. \u201cGo get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>I look into his eyes, seeing that they\u2019re heavy with lust. My heart skips a beat as I take my bag from him and stumble into the bathroom, shutting the door behind me. I lean back against the cool wood and take a few deep breaths. Once my heartbeat calms, I look into the mirror; my lips are dark pink and swollen, my cheeks are flushed an attractive shade of pink, and I see a happiness in my eyes that looks foreign to me.</p><p>After I finish getting ready in the bathroom, I slip on my heels\u2014four-inch cream-lace peep-toe booties with bows going up the center. I straighten out my navy-blue pencil skirt and make sure my top is tucked in before heading into the kitchen. I walk across the living room carpet, watching as Nico types away on the laptop in front of him at the counter. He\u2019s still shirtless; his golden skin covered with tattoos is so gorgeous that I really want to trace every single one with my tongue and fingers as he tells me the history behind each of them.</p><p>As soon as my feet hit the tile floor, his head comes up and turns towards me. I watch him shake his head when his eyes travel down my body to my feet. When our gazes meet again, my step falters at his heated look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to be able to cope knowing that men are looking at you when you\u2019re out. I don\u2019t even want to think about the times I\u2019m out of town, leaving you alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMen don\u2019t look at me.\u201d I scrunch up my eyebrows and shake my head.</p><p>\u201cFuck yes, they do! You just don\u2019t notice, and they\u2019re too chickenshit to talk to you. No man wants to give a woman the power to crush his ego, and baby, I hate to tell you this, because I like that you don\u2019t realize how beautiful you are, but you are the kind of woman that could make a man feel like he has it all or make him feel like he has absolutely nothing.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been holding my breath; I can\u2019t believe he just said that. I\u2019m not stupid. I know I\u2019m considered attractive, but I\u2019ve never had anyone make me feel like he just did with those few words.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some coffee?\u201d he asks like he didn\u2019t just turn my world upside down. I look at the clock, seeing that I have time, so I nod once, walking the rest of the way into the kitchen. \u201cHow about some toast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>I sit on one of his barstools and watch as he moves around the kitchen, first putting bread in the toaster then pulling out a coffee cup and pouring me some. He pulls the milk out of the fridge and holds it up in question; when I nod, he pours some in the mug and then does the same with the sugar. When he\u2019s done, he places the cup in front of me. Then he gets the toast, spreads butter on it, and places it in front of me, where I\u2019m sitting at the island.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have any honey?\u201d I ask, picking up a piece of toast.</p><p>\u201cSure, babe,\u201d he says, handing me a bear-shaped bottle of honey from one of his cupboards before coming back to sit next to me.</p><p>\u201cDid you decorate?\u201d I ask, squeezing a giant glob of honey onto one of the pieces of toast.</p><p>I love his house; I\u2019m surprised at how well it\u2019s decorated. All of his furniture is modern and edgy. In the living room, he has low black carpet and a dark-grey suede couch with black and red pillows, and the entertainment center, coffee tables, and side tables are all the same black-lacquered finish. The kitchen is all dark wood and black granite, with gleaming stainless-steel appliances. Even in his guest room, the furniture was well put together. I could see him in everything, but have a hard time believing he decorated it on his own.</p><p>\u201cNo, Liz did,\u201d he says so affectionately that my stomach drops.</p><p>I watch as he takes a drink of coffee; I never even thought that he might have a girlfriend. Oh, shit\u2014what if he still has a girlfriend? My stomach rolls, and I drop my piece of toast to my plate.</p><p>\u201cLiz is my sister-in-law,\u201d he says, catching me off guard. I turn to look at him. He has a look on his face that makes me feel like an idiot. \u201cI like that look on you though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look away, trying to hide my face with my hair.</p> <p>\u201cYou, looking like you lost something...but only because it was me you were thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of yourself,\u201d I say, trying to cover how I really feel.</p><p>\u201cNope. I know I want you. Now, seeing that look, I know you feel the same,\u201d he says in a tone that is so serious I hold my breath for a second before recovering.</p><p>\u201cI may not have any experience dating, but I\u2019m pretty sure that this,\u201d I say, pointing between the two of us, \u201cisn\u2019t normal.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cBaby, if I was normal, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting here right now. You would be at work or at home doing what you do every single day after you pushed me away the first time,\u201d he says, taking another drink of coffee.</p><p>He is right. I hate that he is right. I hate that I am so transparent to someone who is a virtual stranger. Everything Maggie said keeps running through my mind\u2014which reminds me that I never called her after our dinner the other night. I look over at Nico and my stomach drops. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to explore this thing with him when I\u2019m not even sure who I really am.</p><p>His eyes meet mine, and he shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in that pretty little head of yours, but know this\u2014you run and I will find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask nervously.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d he says, turning towards me, his knees caging me in. \u201cWhat do you feel when we\u2019re together?\u201d</p><p>I want to say, \u201cSafe,\u201d but know that sounds stupid, so I keep my mouth closed.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he urges, leaning towards me.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d I look down at my hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do know. Say it,\u201d he demands.</p><p>\u201cSafe,\u201d I whisper, still looking at my hands. I feel his fingers at my chin as he lifts my face so our eyes meet.</p><p>\u201cYou are safe with me, Sophie.\u201d His fingers run along my jaw. \u201cWe are going to explore this thing between us. We are going to take it as slowly as you need, but you are not going to push me away. It\u2019s not going to work. You push me, and I will push back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know,\u201d I tell him, looking over his shoulder before meeting his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nods, his thumb running over my bottom lip. \u201cBut we have time. Tonight, I\u2019ll make dinner here and we can work on getting to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I sigh, starting to understand something about him\u2014he is relentless.</p><p>\u201cFinish your toast,\u201d he says, picking his coffee back up and turning slightly away from me, his legs still boxing me in.</p><p>I start eating again, trying not to think about the way it feels every time his hand rubs along my arm or back like he can\u2019t stop touching me. I finish my toast then stick my finger into my mouth to suck the honey off. I start to put my thumb in my mouth when he grabs my wrist, bringing my hand to his mouth, and his eyes meet mine as his lips close around my thumb.</p><p>I\u2019m paralyzed. The space between my thighs starts to tingle. I bite my lip to avoid the moan I feel in my throat. I watch in fascination as he pulls my thumb out of his mouth, placing a light kiss on the tip, and I swear I feel it on my clit.</p><p>\u201cSweet.\u201d He leans in, placing a kiss on my lips before picking up my plate and walking into the kitchen, leaving me in a gooey mess sitting on the barstool.</p><p>I stand on shaky legs, taking a breath before walking over to my bag to pick it up off the couch.</p><p>\u201cDo you have everything?\u201d</p><p>I nod; I can\u2019t seem to talk anymore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out.\u201d He places his hand on the small of my back, leading me to the front door.</p><p>He opens it, and I stop to look up at him. \u201cThank you for...you know...last night...and this morning,\u201d I say, my cheeks heating up, making me feel like a dork.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He smiles before lowering his head to kiss me.</p><p>I lean into him, loving the way it feels when he is so close to me. He pulls his mouth away after just a small touch of his lips, leaving me feeling disappointed. \u201cBaby, as much as I want to really kiss you, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m hanging on by a very short thread and know that, if I kiss you like I want, you won\u2019t be going to work, and we will be doing a whole lot of stuff you\u2019re not ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I whisper, reading his face.</p><p>\u201cNow, come on before all my good intentions go out the window,\u201d he says with one more small kiss.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I bite my lip to keep from grinning, liking that I affect him so deeply. I turn and walk out the door and down the steps, and make my way to my car. I start to turn around to give him a wave, but I\u2019m startled when I bump into his solid, still-naked chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a shirt on,\u201d I tell him shakily, looking around and wondering how many women are peeking through their blinds trying to get a glimpse of him.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d he prompts, sliding my car key from my hand and opening my door.</p><p>\u201cPeople can see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe?\u201d His eyebrows draw together in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cNico?\u201d I hear a feminine voice call, and I turn my head and watch as a woman with black hair pulled up into a high ponytail, pink shorts, and a pink hoodie unzipped to show off her tits runs across the lawn to Nico\u2019s driveway. \u201cOh God, I\u2019m so glad I caught you!\u201d she cries, her long, fake nails digging into his arm. \u201cHenry left this morning and the darn sink in our bathroom won\u2019t shut off. Can you come over and look at it?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but glare at her. Is she serious? I watch as her eyes travel over his body and she licks her lips. That\u2019s when I\u2019ve had enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but can you give us a second please?\u201d I ask with my sweetest smile before grabbing Nico\u2019s hand so I can drag him back into the house without giving him a choice.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks as I open the front door.</p><p>Daisy starts going crazy like she\u2019s been alone for a year instead of just a few minutes. I don\u2019t even stop to explain myself. I go to the room across from the one I slept in last night, knowing that it\u2019s Nico\u2019s. Then I open the door and look around. Spotting his dresser, I walk to it and start opening drawers.</p><p>\u201cSophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a second,\u201d I say, finally finding a drawer with shirts and pulling out the first one my hand lands on. \u201cHere. Put this on,\u201d I demand, shoving the shirt at him. When I hear his laugh, I turn around to see him smiling, and it\u2019s not a normal smile. That\u2019s when I realize what I just did.</p><p>\u201cYou done?\u201d he asks, his fingers running along the underside of my jaw. I can\u2019t speak; I can\u2019t even look at him. It\u2019s official\u2014I\u2019m crazy.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I mumble, looking over his shoulder. His hand on my cheek brings my eyes back to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really f**king beautiful when you get all territorial.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I just dragged him inside to get a shirt. I didn\u2019t even think\u2014I just hated that that woman was looking at him like he was her next meal. \u201cUm...\u201d I mumble again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making it really f**king hard for me to not kiss you,\u201d he groans before taking a step back and pulling the shirt over his head. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s try this again,\u201d he says, taking my hand and leading me back outside to my car.</p><p>The woman, Deb, is still here; her eyes go to our hands and narrow before she lifts them and plasters a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cDeb, this is my girlfriend, Sophie.\u201d My stomach flips over at the word \u2018girlfriend.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to correct him in front of Deb though. \u201cSophie, this is Deb. She lives next door and watches Daisy when I\u2019m out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so nice of you, Deb,\u201d I say, my smile matching hers in fakeness.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you have a girlfriend.\u201d She takes her eyes off me, looking at Nico.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to look at your sink today, Deb,\u201d he says, ignoring her comment.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s going to work and I have some stuff to do. You should call George and see if he can come by.\u201d He opens my car door, waiting while I get in. It\u2019s already eighty degrees out, so I start my car and flip the switch for my top to roll back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGeorge always takes forever to get here. Are you sure you can\u2019t come over and have a quick look?\u201d she pouts.</p><p>\u201cDesperate much?\u201d I mumble to myself while tying my hair up into a ponytail. I look up at Nico, who is watching me closely with a small smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight for dinner, baby. Just come here when you get off,\u201d he says, leaning his body into my car.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper, mesmerized by the flecks of gold in his eyes, the way he\u2019s looking at me, and the way my chest feels every time he calls me baby in that sexy, deep voice of his.</p><p>He leans in more, his mouth touching mine. When he goes to pull away, I capture his head with my hands in his hair, holding him to me and taking the kiss I wanted earlier. He growls into my mouth, his hand on the door going to my knee then up my thigh under my skirt. My skin tingles where he touches. I feel one finger slide across the seam of my panties, causing me to gasp and pull my mouth from his. Our eyes meet, and his finger travels over the seam again, this time with a little more pressure.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be mine, sweet Sophie.\u201d I lick my bottom lip, and his mouth comes back down on mine in a soft, teasing touch before pulling away. He looks at me before standing to his full height. \u201cSee you later, baby.\u201d He smiles and taps the door of my car before taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day. Bye, Deb,\u201d I say cheerfully and smile. He shakes his head and grins bigger.</p><p>I back out of the driveway before putting my car in drive and taking off, watching in the rearview mirror as he says something to Deb, who looks like she\u2019s begging him. I shake my head. I can\u2019t blame her; I would beg him too.</p><p>I turn my gaze in the mirror to myself and smile. Luckily for me, I don\u2019t need to beg. Then I think about everything I have been through and how much help I need, and I decide that today is the day. I can\u2019t put it off any longer. If I want to be with Nico\u2014and I definitely want to be with Nico\u00ac\u2014I need to try to fix myself.</p><p>I push Nico to his back and climb on top of him, my mouth going to his neck and my hands going up his shirt. I love everything he\u2019s been showing me about making out. I feel the smoothness of his skin under my palms and want more, so I tug his shirt over his head before pressing my hips down, feeling his erection hit perfectly every time I move my hips. He groans, and his hands slide up my sides under my shirt, dragging it up and over my head. I sit back so he can unhook my bra. His mouth moves to my neck, nipping and licking as his hand unclasps my bra.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most beautiful tits.\u201d</p><p>His words cause a moan to climb up my throat as his lips lock around one nipple, his free hand pulling on the other one. My head drops forward to watch him. His hand travels down my back and into my jeans, grabbing my ass and pressing me harder into him, causing me to whimper again.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I moan, tossing my head back.</p><p>He rolls us over so I\u2019m under him. His hand moves to the front of my jeans. The sound of my zipper being lowered fills my ears. Then his fingers press into me, causing me to lift my head and latch on to his bottom lip with my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet\u2014so f**king wet. I can\u2019t wait to sink into your tight little pu**y and have you dripping around me, gripping me tight while I f**k you hard.\u201d This is something else I\u2019ve learned about myself\u2014the dirtier he talks, the hotter I get. \u201cI want you to come for me, Sophie. I want to feel your tight, hot little pu**y pull my fingers deep inside of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNico! Oh...God...\u201d I whimper, my fingers digging into his arm.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, sweet girl,\u201d his lips whisper across my ear.</p><p>My hips lift higher; my heels dig into the bed as I shatter, my orgasm taking me into another world before sending me back to earth. When I come back to myself, I\u2019m wrapped tight in his arms with my head pressed into his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I nod, listening to his heart beat rapidly against my ear. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better,\u201d he tells me sincerely.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d I start to tell him that he hasn\u2019t gotten off. Actually, since he started introducing me to sex, he has never even taken off his pants.</p><p>\u201cWe will get to that, baby. But for now, it\u2019s about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to make you feel good too,\u201d I tell him, burying my face into his chest.</p><p>\u201cWatching you get off makes me feel good,\u201d he says while stroking my hair.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you. You never let me touch you,\u201d I whine.</p><p>\u201cYou will one day, but right now, I need to keep my boy away from you. It\u2019s important I take my time with you. I want you to be ready when we finally go there. If you touch me, all my good intensions will go out the window,\u201d he explains.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I pout. I am happy he is giving me time to get used to foreplay and building up to sex, but I still want to touch him like he touches me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re adorable when you pout.\u201d He smiles before kissing me. \u201cSo how was your day? Did you go to your meeting?\u201d he asks, running his hand along my back.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I hold my breath.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t know the kind of meetings I am going to. I never told him what happened to me; I don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m tainted or something, even though I know it\u2019s stupid to feel that way. I just told him that I\u2019m going to meetings to help with the loss of my mom. I feel bad about lying, but I don\u2019t know how to tell him what the meetings are really for.</p><p>I started going to meetings two months ago, gathering all the information that first day he called me his girlfriend, and have gone once a week since then. I like having a group of women to talk to who understand what I\u2019m feeling, even though I kind of feel like an imposter sitting with them. The things most of them have been through make me feel weak.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you ever want to talk to me about how you\u2019re dealing with the loss of your mom, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d He hugs me closer, the ball of guilt in my stomach getting heavier by the second.</p><p>\u201cI know. Thank you,\u201d I choke out. \u201cI\u2019m so sleepy,\u201d I whisper, wanting to get away from talking. \u201cI\u2019m gonna head home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay with me.\u201d He hugs me again, making me feel sick. \u201cYou don\u2019t work at the school tomorrow. We can sleep in.\u201d</p><p>I want that. I want to sleep next to him, to have him hold me and make me feel better, but I just can\u2019t. \u201cI think I should go home,\u201d I repeat more softly this time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, sweet Sophie,\u201d he whispers, making me feel worse. He always does exactly what I want; he never pushes me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I get off the bed and put on my bra and shirt before watching him pull his shirt back over his head. He follows me out into the living room, grabbing his keys. He always follows me home when I\u2019m over here late. He walks me into my house to check everything out and then kisses me before leaving for the night, telling me to lock up after him while reminding me to set the alarm.</p><p>\u201cI really wish you would stay,\u201d he says gently.</p> <p>\u201cI just need time,\u201d I tell him. Seeing the look on his face has me wanting to kick my own ass, but I don\u2019t know what to do; I feel stuck.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you need, Sophie.\u201d He hands me my keys.</p><p>I hope he\u2019s not lying and doesn\u2019t give up on me. I want to be better; I hate that I\u2019m hurting him. I walk to him, wrapping my arms around his waist before lifting up on my toes while pulling his mouth down to mine for a kiss. I try to tell him everything with that one kiss. When I pull away, he looks at me and I can see that he\u2019s searching my eyes, trying to understand. I wish I understood myself.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get you home.\u201d He kisses my forehead before leading me out to my car.</p><p>I bite my cheek the whole way home, and I bite it harder as he kisses me goodnight. When the door finally closes behind him, I let the tears I\u2019ve been holding in fall.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p><p>Nico</p><p>I quietly open the door to my house, not wanting to wake Sophie, who stayed over to watch Daisy. We have been seeing each other for a few months now. I\u2019m head over f**king heels in love with her crazy ass, yet only Kenton and Asher know about her. This is not by choice; I want my family to get to know her. The day Asher found out about Sophie, he, Kenton, and I had spent the morning moving Kenton\u2019s ex\u2019s shit to her house. As soon as we got back to my place, Kenton and Asher pulled a bottle of Jack out of my cabinet, claiming they were toasting to crazy bitches. Kenton looked at me and smiled right then, and I knew he was going to start some shit.</p><p>\u201cHow are things going with Sophie?\u201d he asked, and Asher looked at me with a what-the-fuck-is-he-talking-about expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cThings are fine,\u201d I gritted out. Kenton knew I had my reasons for not telling my family about Sophie yet.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Sophie?\u201d Asher asked Kenton, completely cutting me out of the conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Sophie? Now isn\u2019t that the million-dollar question?\u201d Kenton asked, tapping his chin.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Sophie?\u201d Asher turned his attention to me, and I glared at Kenton, who shrugged before I looked at Asher.</p><p>\u201cSophie is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie is his boom,\u201d Kenton said, cutting me off and laughing like this was the funniest shit in the whole world.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Asher asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. Why do you think he has been taking jobs that are closer to home and hasn\u2019t been going to see y\u2019all as often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, do we need to go to the store so I can buy you some f**king tampons?\u201d I growled at Kenton.</p><p>\u201cAt some point, you need to tell people what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said, making my temper flare.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I will when I\u2019m f**king ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something?\u201d Asher asked, and I could see him slipping into big-brother mode. I shook my head before looking at him again.</p><p>\u201cThings with Sophie aren\u2019t easy, and I need time before I bring her around everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I will bring her around. Just not yet,\u201d I told him firmly.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s going to flip the f**k out,\u201d Asher said, smiling.</p><p>I smiled back. He is right; my mom is going to be happy as hell I am settling down, but she is going to flip because I haven\u2019t told her anything. I know my mom will love Sophie, and it kills me every time I have to go to my parents\u2019 without her.</p><p>I\u2019m brought back to the present by Daisy, who\u2019s jumping around at my feet. \u201cHey, girl.\u201d I drop my bag to the floor before crouching down to scoop her up. \u201cWere you a good girl while I was gone?\u201d I ask, flipping her onto her back so she can get a tummy rub.</p><p>When I walk into the kitchen, I see the note Sophie left on the counter. Like always, if she knew I was coming home late, she would leave a note letting me know where I could find dinner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>I turn at the sound of her voice to see her standing at the opening of the kitchen. She\u2019s wearing one of my shirts, her hair is up, and her face is makeup-free. I love that she stays here when I\u2019m out of town. I love even more that she wears my tees to bed when I\u2019m gone.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d I turn away from her and start the microwave.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>I take a second, trying to think of a way to answer that question. Am I okay? Fuck no. Do I want to talk to her about why I\u2019m not okay? Again, f**k no.</p><p>I turn to look at her. Jesus, she is so f**king beautiful that just looking at her makes my gut get tight. I want to do what she needs. I always want her to be happy. She told me she needs time, that she\u2019s trying to work through some things from her past. I understand that. I know her mom died when she was young, and I know it had to have left a scar on her. She opened up to me about some things, but a lot of information she shared about her past is either from before her mother\u2019s death or after she left home and went to Job Corps. There\u2019s a huge chunk of time she always skims over. I know that whatever it is she\u2019s holding in is the thing keeping us at a standstill.</p><p>I want to be with her; I want a future with her, but I need her to want it too. That\u2019s why last night, after getting off the phone with her, I called Justin and had him do a hard run\u2014also known as an extensive background check\u2014on her. What I never expected was for him to tell me about a police report from right before she was emancipated from her father shortly after her mother\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I tell her, setting Daisy on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She shuffles her feet, not looking at me.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Sophie,\u201d I repeat more firmly this time. I hold out my hand, and she finally walks to me, her steps slow and unsure.</p><p>\u201cI feel like something\u2019s wrong,\u201d she whispers, searching my face when my hand wraps around hers pulls her to me.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she whispers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pick her up, placing her on the counter, where I stand between her legs, not giving her any room to run when I say what I have to say. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She nods, her hands balling into fists on her thighs.</p><p>\u201cI had your background ran a few months ago. And again yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she breathes, her eyes widening.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t open up to me, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you did that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me much choice,\u201d I say calmly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d she asks, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d I growl.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just force me to talk to you.\u201d She pushes my chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not forcing you,\u201d I argue, not budging.</p><p>\u201cYou had my background ran, you jerk. What do you call that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to know what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You don\u2019t need to deal with it anymore!\u201d she yells, shoving my chest, trying to get off the counter.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d I grab her wrists, bringing them around her back and caging her in. \u201cNo more bullshit, Sophie. Talk to me. I need you to tell me what happened,\u201d I say, softening my voice.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s stupid,\u201d she says quietly, her body finally sagging against mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask surprised.</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve been going to my group and hearing stories from other women who have really been hurt, my story seems stupid,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid.\u201d I pick her up off the counter, and her legs wrap around my hips as I carry her down the hall to my room.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asks as I lay her on the bed then climb in next to her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to talk. You\u2019re going to tell me what happened,\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I really don\u2019t like it when you completely ignore what I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby. Talk to me,\u201d I tell her, adjusting her so that we\u2019re face to face.</p> <p>\u201cGahhhh, you\u2019re so annoying,\u201d she whines.</p><p>\u201cTalk, Soph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She sighs, closing her eyes.</p><p>I listen quietly, running my hand through her hair as she tells me everything I already learned from her police report. Hearing it from her mouth has me ready to kill someone, and by the time she\u2019s done talking, I have mentally planned my trip to Seattle.</p><p>\u201cSo, you see, it\u2019s really not that bad,\u201d she says, looking up at me.</p><p>I know it could have been much worse, but I also know that what happened to her changed the course of her life even more than it had already when she lost her mother. And even if she doesn\u2019t want to admit it, I know that the loss of her mom when she was so young has a lot to do with her avoiding any type of relationship with people.</p><p>\u201cSophie, what happened to you was bad,\u201d I confirm.</p><p>\u201cNot as bad as it could have been,\u201d she says softly. \u201cI always knew it could have been worse, but I never understood to what extreme. After hearing what happened to some of the women in my group, I understand now, and I\u2019m even more thankful. I hate that I\u2019ve been so weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what you had to do to protect yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t though. I hid out in my house, afraid to meet new people or even date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved to another state all alone,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cOnly because I wanted to buy a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say you did it because you wanted to buy a house, but I think you did it because you were ready to change your life. You\u2019re a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she mumbles, nervously playing with the pocket of my T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cI do. Look at how you are with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sweet.\u201d She smiles, running her fingers along my jaw.</p><p>I\u2019m glad she sees me that way; I never want her to be afraid of me \u201cYou tryin\u2019 to ruin my street cred?\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t answer. She just looks down at Daisy, who\u2019s now cuddled up between us. When her eyes come up, mine narrow on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou tryin\u2019 to say my dog isn\u2019t badass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She starts to laugh, \u201cI never said anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it all with your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. I swear!\u201d She laughs, and I run a finger down the center of her face, feeling my eyes go soft before leaning in to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cYou are a lot stronger than you think, and that\u2019s why, tomorrow, we\u2019re going to my parents\u2019 house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she says, and I\u2019m done talking about this.</p><p>I roll her to her back, pinning her underneath me. Her chest begins rising and falling rapidly, and I slide to the side, keeping her hands where they are with one on mine. My eyes stay locked on hers as I slowly slide my T-shirt she\u2019s wearing up until her tits are exposed. I have been gradually teaching her about sex. When I take her for the first time, I want her to know what to expect. I never want her to be afraid of me for any reason.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I whisper, looking at her tits\u2014large, over a handful, ni**les firm and dark pink. I lean forward, pulling first one then the other into my mouth, licking and biting. Her body starts wiggling under mine, her moans becoming louder, her nails digging into my scalp. \u201cYou want me to make you come?\u201d I ask, biting down on her nipple while pinching her other one.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moans, her head pressing back into the pillow, her body arching.</p><p>I squeeze her breast before running my palm down her stomach along the edge of her shorts and dipping under, my fingers meeting smooth skin the whole way. Knowing she is completely bare has me gritting my teeth. I slide one finger over her clit, circling as I watch her face; her eyes pop open and meet mine. She looks gorgeous like this\u2014her face flushed, her bottom lip tucked between her teeth, her br**sts quickly rising and falling. Sliding one finger lower, I enter her slowly, studying her expression. She\u2019s so tight and wet that my already-hard dick jumps, wanting to see for itself what she would feel like wrapped around it.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Nico,\u201d she moans, her eyes closing again.</p><p>I start to move my finger a little quicker, and then I add another one, using my thumb to press and roll her clit. When I suck her nipple into my mouth, she cries out as her pu**y pulls my fingers deeper, her body grinding down on my hand before shaking and going limp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoly cow,\u201d she breathes, opening her eyes.</p><p>I lean forward to kiss her, my fingers still between her legs moving in slow stokes.

I hold her for a few minutes, just enjoying her smell and the way she feels tucked next to me.</p><p>\u201cI need to eat.\u201d I watch her eyes heat. \u201cFood, baby,\u201d I tell her, smiling before fixing her shirt and pulling her out of bed.</p><p>\u201cBut...I want to touch you,\u201d she says, tugging against my hand that\u2019s pulling her towards the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou will, just not tonight,\u201d I tell her, fighting my body for control.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to eat, and then tomorrow, we\u2019re gonna have a busy day when I introduce you to my family, so we\u2019ll need a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready,\u201d she whimpers, and I just shake my head, guiding her down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done talking about this. You\u2019re going to meet my family,\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts, baby. It\u2019s past time.\u201d I lead her into the kitchen, where I heat the food she left out for me for the second time. She watches quietly; I can see the wheels in her head spinning. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t meet your family,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can, and you are going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I have a breakdown or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there with you,\u201d I say, looking her straight in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour family will think I\u2019m nuts.\u201d She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re nuts, so they won\u2019t even notice that you\u2019re nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nuts. Don\u2019t say that.\u201d She smacks my arm.</p><p>I grab her hand, bringing it to my mouth and kissing it. \u201cSophie, relax. They will love you,\u201d I say soothingly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do.\u201d</p> <p>We sit in the kitchen while I eat and she watches me closely. When I finish, we go back to my room. She gets into bed, while I make quick work in the shower before pulling on a pair of sweats and climbing into bed with her.</p><p>\u201cIt will be okay,\u201d I reassure her, kissing the top of her head and pulling her closer to me.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>I listen to her breathing even out before I follow her to sleep.</p><p>When I wake up, the sun is just starting to shine through the window. I look around, seeing that Sophie isn\u2019t in bed; I listen, trying to see if I can hear her somewhere in the house.</p><p>\u201cSoph?\u201d I call, and nothing. I feel my eyebrows draw together, and I sit up in bed. \u201cSoph?\u201d I call again, and this time, Daisy comes into the room. That\u2019s when I know she took off.</p><p>Getting out of bed, I walk into the kitchen. The house is quiet; her bag, which was on the bar last night, is now gone, along with her keys.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I whisper, running my hands down my face. I can\u2019t believe I slept through her leaving. I have always been a light sleeper, and the one time that shit would have come in handy, I f**king slept like the dead.</p><p>I walk back to the room, pick up my phone, and hit dial on her number. When it goes right to voicemail, my blood pressure starts to rise. \u201cCall me back,\u201d I demand then toss my phone on the bed before pulling a pair of jeans, a shirt, and boots on. Once dressed, I head to the kitchen, feed Daisy and grab the keys for my bike, go to my garage and pull the tarp off my Harley, and hop on before using my feet to back it out of the driveway.</p><p>I stop at her house first, knowing full-well she won\u2019t be here. I get off my bike and let myself inside using the key she gave me a few weeks ago. She\u2019s had a key to my place almost from the start. After our first run-in with my neighbor, Sophie decided she should be the one watching Daisy when I go out of town. I\u2019m cool with that; Deb is harmless, but still. If it makes Sophie feel more secure, I am down with it.</p><p>I walk into her house, seeing that everything\u2019s the same as it always is. She keeps her place in order, except for her bedroom, which, as usual, has clothes and shoes scattered all over the place. I look around, trying to gauge if she\u2019s been back here since leaving my house. Her overnight bag is on the bed, and I take a few steps and open it up. The first thing I see is my shirt. I shake my head, digging around for a few more seconds. Not finding anything helpful, I shove everything back inside before heading out to search around town.</p><p>The longer I look, the more pissed I become. I have called her on and off all day, and she hasn\u2019t answered or returned my calls. The more hours that pass without hearing from her, the more tightly wound and worried I become. When I left her place this morning, I placed a piece of tape on the edge of the door to let me know if she returned home, and so far, she hasn\u2019t. I decide to go home and feed Daisy before going back to Sophie\u2019s to camp out until she gets there.</p><p>I look at the clock on the wall when the front door opens. It\u2019s after three in the morning. I sit forward on the couch, watching as she puts her bag down near the door then kicks off her shoes so they go flying towards her room. When she finally sees me, she screams out and backs up into her closed door, holding her chest. I notice that her eyes are red and puffy. Knowing that she has been crying all day about some dumb shit she talked herself into only pisses me off more.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asks, pushing a hand through her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I doing here? Is that really the question you want to f**king ask me right now?\u201d My eyebrows come together.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think we should see each other anymore,\u201d she says as I stand.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think we should see each other anymore,\u201d I repeat, walking towards her in measured steps.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I just said. I just... I just don\u2019t think this is working out,\u201d she stutters, looking past me, probably wondering if she could make it if she bolts.</p><p>My eyes narrow on her before I reply. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Sophie. I don\u2019t give a f**k what you think or what the excuse is you try to give me, but you are mine.\u201d I let out a growl as I press her into the wall. I\u2019m so pissed I can\u2019t even see straight. \u201cYou snuck out of my bed then out of the house. Do you know how worried I\u2019ve been?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d she says shakily.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be worried about my woman when she sneaks out of my bed and is gone until three in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I\u2014\u201d She tries to look away, so I force her face back towards mine with my hand on her jaw.</p><p>\u201cThat was f**ked up,\u201d I tell her, pronouncing the last two words clearly and slowly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

I\u2019m done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready!\u201d she yells in my face, catching me off guard.</p> <p>\u201cWhen, huh?\u201d I ask, pressing her deeper into the wall. \u201cWhat do you need? Ten more years? In ten years, will you be ready to try to live again? Or will you find some other excuse?\u201d I roar my questions.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she says softly, tears filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sophie, I\u2019m not going to stop. I need you with me, but in order for that to happen, I need you to want us as much as I do. I need you to stop letting your fears run you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid!\u201d she cries.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? I won\u2019t let anything happen to you,\u201d I tell her gently, pulling her body against mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I lose you too?\u201d She whispers the words, and my heart cracks open. I knew that this was one of the things holding her back, and I am f**king happy that she is finally realizing it.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d I hold her tight as her body sags against mine, and I say a silent prayer that she is finally getting it. \u201cNo more running, Sophie,\u201d I say, running my hand down her back. \u201cFrom now on, we figure this out together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I ran and that you were worried,\u201d she apologizes quietly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d I hold her a little tighter, breathing in her smell. \u201cYou need to pack some shit so we can go home,\u201d I tell her after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to my house, where you will be staying more often than not from now on,\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just decide that,\u201d she says, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t just decide that. I decided it a long time ago.\u201d I step away from her, turning her towards her room. \u201cNow, go pack so we can go home. I\u2019m f**king exhausted after searching for your ass all over the city today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very annoying,\u201d she says, walking to her bedroom.</p><p>I follow behind her, watching as she dumps the stuff in her overnight bag onto the bed. \u201cYou stole my shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou stole my shirt,\u201d I repeat, picking up my shirt off the bed and showing it to her.</p><p>\u201cI must have forgotten about it.\u201d She looks away quickly, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it, baby. You were taking a piece of me with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so full of yourself,\u201d she says with fake exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d I laugh when her cheeks turn pink. I watch her put some stuff in the bag and notice how little she\u2019s bringing. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough,\u201d I tell her when she starts to zip it up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, pack more.\u201d</p><p>I walk to her closet, grabbing another bag down from a high shelf. As I\u2019m pulling it down, something hits me on top of my head before bouncing off and hitting the floor with a rubbery thud. Sophie squeaks before running towards me, grabbing whatever it is that hit me and putting it behind her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she answers, walking backwards.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I place the bag on the bed before slowly following her.</p><p>\u201cNico, stop right there,\u201d she says, her face becoming bright red.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s behind your back, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she says, her eyes growing bigger the closer I get to her. She starts to turn, and that\u2019s when a big purple dildo fumbles out of her hands, bouncing once before rolling under the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not mine, I swear!\u201d she says, looking distraught, holding up both her hands in front of her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your dildo?\u201d I ask, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my friend\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have your friend\u2019s dildo?\u201d I c**k my head to the side.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says, her shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you keep a dildo...for your friend...in your closet?\u201d I start to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh God, that sounds really stupid.\u201d She covers her face. \u201cI mean, my friend got it for me.\u201d</p><p>I bend down, picking it up from underneath the bed. The thing is not only bright purple with sparkles, but it has to be at least a foot long and three inches across.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill Maggie,\u201d she whispers with her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I seriously hope you never tried to use this,\u201d I say, turning it over in my hand.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. Kill me now,\u201d she groans, her eyes still closed.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I laugh so hard that tears start to fall from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretending that if I can\u2019t see you, then this isn\u2019t really happening,\u201d she says, making me laugh harder than I have in my entire life.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I finally wheeze out.</p><p>\u201cNuh-uh...\u201d she mumbles, eyes still closed.</p><p>I drop the dildo to the bed before I put my hands in her hair and stop laughing. \u201cOpen your eyes, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, please open your eyes.\u201d I push her hair away from her face. \u201cHey,\u201d I say when she finally opens them. \u201cYou know, with me, you never have to be embarrassed, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou say that, but a giant purple dildo just fell out of my closet and hit you on the head. That is the definition of a reason to be embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit it\u2019s pretty damn funny.\u201d I chuckle, and her eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really going to kill Maggie,\u201d she growls.</p><p>\u201cIs that the only toy you have?\u201d I ask, watching her eyes get wide.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she breathes, searching my face.</p><p>\u201cFinish packing,\u201d I tell her without saying anything else. My dick\u2019s hard as f**k thinking about the things I\u2019m going to show her. The image of f**king her with her wrists bound to my bed and clamps attached to her ni**les has me groaning and shoving my face into her neck. \u201cPlease just finish packing.\u201d I kiss her once on the side of her neck before stepping back.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispers shakily before going back to her bed to finish packing.</p><p>It\u2019s after five in the morning by the time we reach my house. I park my bike back in the garage before helping Sophie carry her bags inside.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl.\u201d Sophie stops to pick up Daisy, who is bouncing around at our feet. She follows me down the hall to my bedroom, talking to Daisy in a baby voice the whole way. I drop her bags into my closet, walk to Sophie to take Daisy from her hands, and set her outside the bedroom door before closing it. \u201cWhat are you doing? She always sleeps with me when I\u2019m here,\u201d she says, her eyebrows drawing together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but we\u2019re not going to sleep right now,\u201d I tell her, walking her backwards towards the bed.</p><p>My mouth drops to hers and I lick the seam of her mouth before pulling her bottom lip between my teeth and biting it. I feel her fingers digging into my chest as my hands slide her shirt up and over her head. I\u2019m done holding myself back. I pull away from her long enough to drag my shirt over my head. I can hear her breathing increase as my hands go to the button of her jeans, unsnapping it before dragging her zipper down.</p><p>Our eyes are locked; her hands go to my shoulders, her nails digging into my skin. I shove her jeans down her hips before pushing her back to the bed, grabbing them by the ankles, and pulling them off completely. I toss them to the side, running my hands up her calves to her thighs before taking her mouth in another deep kiss. I move between her legs, spreading them wider with mine. I slide my hand around her back, flicking the clasp of her bra and popping it open.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispers, her eyes widening as I slowly drag her straps down her shoulders, exposing her tits.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d I drop to my knees on the floor so her br**sts are level with my face. Keeping our eyes locked, I pull one nipple into my mouth. Hers opens on a silent moan, her head falling back. \u201cWatch me, baby,\u201d I demand. My hands run up her thighs and my thumbs trail over her pu**y on the outside of her panties before traveling up to her hips. \u201cLift.\u201d</p><p>She does as she\u2019s told, her hips lifting slightly off the bed enough for me to pull them down. I lean back to drag them down her legs. Once off, I go back to my original position between her legs. Our eyes meet again, and hers look nervous.</p><p>\u201cTrust me to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I pull her mouth up to mine, my fingers fisting in her hair as I kiss her once more before dragging my mouth away to kissing a trail down her neck, cupping both br**sts. Then I lick and bite both ni**les before kissing down her stomach. I nip the skin above her pubic bone and see the muscles of her abdomen tighten.</p><p>\u201cSit up and watch me.\u201d</p><p>Her arms go behind her to prop herself up on her elbows, pushing her br**sts out. I spread her thighs farther apart before licking her pu**y from bottom to top.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d she cries out, one of her arms coming out from behind her. Her hand grabs my hair.</p><p>I keep at her, licking her, f**king her with my mouth. I put one finger inside her then add another, her hips lifting as she screams my name. I feel her pu**y already clamping down hard on my fingers.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, baby, you\u2019re so hot.\u201d I pull her limp body up the bed before leaning back to pull off my jeans and positioning myself between her legs. Leaning forward, I kiss her deeply as her fingers dig into the muscles of my ass, trying to pull me inside. \u201cYou want my cock?\u201d I ask against her mouth, biting her bottom lip. My dick is throbbing, my balls pulling up tight, ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d she begs, her hands moving up to claw my back. Her nails burrowing into my skin causes me to shift my hips forward, the head of my c**k rubbing against her wetness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna give it to you, but I gotta go slow. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She nods, her eyes widening when she looks down between our bodies. I can see fear on her face now. I\u2019m not a small guy to begin with, and having a Prince Albert piercing makes look that much more intimidating, which is why I didn\u2019t show her before.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asks. If it weren\u2019t for the scared sound of her voice, I would have laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a piercing, baby. Look at me.\u201d I hold her face; her eyes lock on mine. \u201cI promise it will feel good.\u201d</p><p>She nods, and I hold my c**k in one hand, sliding through her folds before pressing myself slowly inside her. Her wet, tight heat wrapping around me has my head dropping forward, my teeth gritting.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d I lift my head so I can watch her face; her eyes close, and I can feel the barrier proving that she is mine and only mine. I run my finger along her cheek, and her eyes open at my touch. \u201cYou know, the moment I saw you, I knew you were the one for me,\u201d I say gently, watching her eyes get big. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Sophie. Every beautiful inch of you is mine.\u201d</p><p>I thrust completely inside her, wanting to get it over with. She cries out, and I stop moving, just watching her face as she adjusts to me. She feels so good that it\u2019s taking everything in me not to slam into her like a madman.</p><p>\u201cI gotta move, baby. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She brings her fingers up to my face, running them down my jaw. The look on her face is so gentle, and it holds so much emotion that I know she feels it too.</p><p>I start to move slowly at first, my hand traveling down her side to lift her thigh around my waist. Our mouths meet again in a slow kiss. My strokes are slow and gentle, not wanting to hurt her. Her pu**y starts to pull me deeper, and I\u2019m so close that my balls start to pull up tight from the way her walls are squeezing me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need you to come,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she pants.</p><p>I circle my hips, hitting her g-spot. Her head falls back, and a loud moan leaves her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou can. I can feel it. I need you to let go, baby.\u201d I pull back, rolling my thumb over her clit before pinching it, causing her to clamp down harder. \u201cShit,\u201d I breathe, trying to hold off my own orgasm.</p><p>\u201cNico!\u201d she cries, rolling her hips up to meet mine.</p><p>\u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, pulling her nipple into my mouth before biting down. Our bodies are both slick with sweat, our breathing heavy. She cries out, her head lifting and her mouth locking down on my shoulder, causing my own orgasm. I can feel my release all the way to my toes. With her pu**y squeezing my cock, I slow my strokes, taking her mouth in another deep kiss before laying my forehead against hers as I try to catch my breath.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispers, her eyes closing. I know she\u2019s half asleep and probably won\u2019t remember saying it, but I will. I feel the same. I knew from the moment I saw her that she\u2019s it\u2014my boom.</p><p>I slide out of her, hating to lose that connection. My head falls forward when I realize I didn\u2019t wear a condom. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asks, running a hand through my hair, down the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cNothing, baby. Stay here; I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I slide down the bed, kissing her stomach before going into the bathroom.</p><p>I turn on the hot water in the sink, grabbing a couple of washcloths and cleaning myself up quickly before walking back into the room. I take a second to appreciate her\u2014her hair spread out across my pillow, her body glistening with sweat, her legs still slightly parted, showing off her pu**y.</p><p>I walk to the side of the bed, trying to figure out exactly what I want to say to her. I f**ked up. She was a virgin, and chances are she\u2019s not on the pill, but I can\u2019t bring myself to be disappointed if she got pregnant. I want that. I know I\u2019m clean; I get tested every couple of months. I got checked right after I met her.</p><p>Her eyes slightly open as I bend, placing the warm cloth between her legs.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Sleepy,\u201d she replies with a small smile, her eyes heavy with sleep.</p><p>\u201cYou want a shirt?\u201d I ask, knowing that she always sleeps in something. Someday, I will get her used to sleeping naked, but not now.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d She sits up, watching as I grab a shirt from the dresser for her, and a pair of boxers for myself, pulling them up on the way to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI really hate covering you up,\u201d I tell her, helping her into the shirt.</p><p>She laughs, flopping back onto the bed. \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d She yawns through her words.</p><p>\u201cWell, sneaking out of the bed this morning before spending the day hiding from your man will do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that,\u201d she says, her voice quiet and her eyes soft. \u201cI hate that you were worried. I just didn\u2019t know what to do. I feel like ever since I met you, I have wanted something I\u2019ve never wanted before, and that scares me. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, and my head is all messed up. I just want to make sure I\u2019m good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m looking at her like she\u2019s crazy. Sophie\u2019s not being good enough for me is laughable, but I can tell by the look on her face that she\u2019s serious. I sit down on the side of the bed before pulling her around into my lap.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy, you know that?\u201d I push the hair out of her face.</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that,\u201d she snaps, slapping my arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. If you think for one second that what you just said isn\u2019t completely whacked, then you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, first of all, you\u2019re way too good for someone like me, but I\u2019m way too f**king selfish to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too good for you.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for me. You make me feel safe, and that makes me worry. I don\u2019t want to use you as a crutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, when you\u2019re in a relationship, it\u2019s give and take. It\u2019s only right that I make you feel safe, because you make me feel whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis seems like it\u2019s moving really fast,\u201d she whispers, laying her head on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what fast is. We have been together for a few months, and I\u2019ve been going slow, wanting you to be comfortable. But like I told you yesterday, I\u2019m done. I will make sure you\u2019re happy, but I won\u2019t let you continue to put things on hold just because you\u2019re afraid.\u201d I run my hand down her back and kiss the top of her head. \u201cI need to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d She buries her face into my chest. \u201cThe last time you said that you needed to tell me something, you told me you had my background ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you on birth control?\u201d I ask, ignoring her last remark.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says quietly.</p><p>\u201cI forgot the condom. I\u2019m clean. I got checked right after we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could still get pregnant,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cYou could.\u201d I pull her tighter against me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re the crazy one.\u201d She looks up at me, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cI know what I want. I keep telling you this, baby, but you\u2019re just not getting it. You are it for me.\u201d I lean forward, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cHow is it possible that you can scare me and make me feel safe at the same time?\u201d she asks, looking up at me, her finger running across my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Sophie, but I do know that what we have is good. No more running.\u201d I run a finger down the center of her face.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run again.\u201d She yawns, cuddling closer to me. I bite back a smile, wondering how one chick can make me crazy happy then make me just plain crazy.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I settle her back on the bed before letting Daisy into the room. I climb in next to her, and Sophie shifts, her head going to my chest, her arm around my waist, and her leg over mine. I hear her light snore a few minutes after she relaxes. Daisy jumps up on the bed, pushing her way under the covers before settling in. I close my eyes and smile as an image of Sophie, round with my child, flashes through my head.</p><p>I know what I want. I always get what I want. And that\u2019s the last thought in my head before I fall asleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 7</p><p>Sophie</p><p>I wake up when I hear a loud ringing. I\u2019m so comfortable that I don\u2019t want to open my eyes. I pull my leg higher over Nico\u2019s hip, trying to let sleep take me away again. I can feel the slight ache between my thighs, and last night comes back to me, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, bro?\u201d I hear Nico say right before I feel his lips at the top of my head and he slides out from under me. \u201cYeah, I was up late,\u201d he tells the person on the phone. My eyes open, and I see that he\u2019s leaving the room.</p> <p>\u201cNico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a second, baby. My brother\u2019s on the phone,\u201d he says, walking out of the room.</p><p>I get up and swing my legs over the side of the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some water if that\u2019s okay?\u201d I say when I see him standing in the hall when I open the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some. Go lay back down, baby. I\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he says, pulling my chin up and kissing me softly on the mouth before turning me back towards the bedroom. After a few minutes, he comes back in the room smiling at me. \u201cSoon. She\u2019s just starting to accept that she\u2019s mine.\u201d He laughs, handing me a glass of water.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, smiling into the cup.</p> <p>\u201cYou are. Do you need me to prove it again?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I feel my face heat up, but between my legs starts to throb.</p><p>\u201cSure, man. I\u2019ll call you soon,\u201d he says into the phone before hanging up and tossing it on the nightstand. \u201cDo we need to have another talk?\u201d he asks, crawling across the bed to where I\u2019m lying.</p><p>\u201cNo. No more talking.\u201d I rub my legs together; the look on his face has my whole body primed.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t had sex before. Sex is awesome, something I definitely want to do a lot more of. Then I remember his piercing and how it felt when he was inside me. I want to get a good look at it. I have never even seen anything like that before; it is strangely beautiful on his cock, and it fits him perfectly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We don\u2019t need to talk to have this conversation,\u201d he states, his body coming over mine, caging me in.</p> <p>His mouth takes mine in a deep kiss, and before I know it, my shirt is off and his mouth is on my breast, tugging at one of my ni**les. I arch into him, dragging my nails down his back.</p><p>\u201cAre you sore?\u201d he asks, looking at me, his eyes dark.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I tell him a half-truth. I am a little tender, but nothing will stop me from wanting him again.</p><p>\u201cWho does this beautiful body belong to, Sophie?\u201d he asks, clamping down on my other nipple.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d I say with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d he growls, biting down on my nipple, causing me to cry out. \u201cThis is all mine.\u201d His hand runs from my neck, down between by br**sts, over the roundness of my stomach, to between my legs, cupping me there. \u201cYou see this?\u201d His fingers wiggle between my legs then up and around my clit. \u201cThis is all mine.\u201d His mouth opens on my neck before kissing up to my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, sweet Sophie.\u201d</p><p>Two fingers plunge into me, causing my head to bend back and my hips to lift up. I don\u2019t argue with him; it\u2019s pointless. I\u2019m his, just like he says I am. I love this man. As crazy as it is, I\u2019m in love with him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Come for me,\u201d he says, his fingers moving more rapidly.</p> <p>I do as he says and come with a cry, clinging to him as his hips move to between my legs, and with one thrust, he is inside me, making me yell out.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes. This is mine,\u201d he groans, pulling out before sinking back in.</p><p>My legs wrap around him, his mouth comes back down on mine, his tongue sweeps into my mouth, and then his teeth bite my bottom then top lip. It\u2019s all too much. My body is overwhelmed by the feelings he\u2019s causing. His hips roll again, his hands going under my ass and lifting it higher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I breathe into his mouth.</p><p>His breaths mix with mine as I feel myself clamp down around him. This time, the feelings consume me before we roll and I\u2019m on top, looking down at him. His hands go to my hips, rocking me back and forth. I sit up, my hands going to his chest and our eyes locking.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans. His head falls back as my hips roll and lift, hitting my g-spot every time I slide down.</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, but judging by the look on his face, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing it wrong. I sit back, my hands going to my br**sts, trying to recreate the feeling he gives me when he sucks on my ni**les. My eyes close, and I bite my lip, tugging hard.</p><p>\u201cJesus, baby.\u201d My eyes open at the sound of his rough voice; I look down to see his eyes darken, his bottom lip between his teeth, and his muscles flexing. His hips start lifting up to meet mine. \u201cShit.\u201d His thumb goes to my clit, sending me over the edge. I fall forward, my breathing erratic. I can feel him pulsing inside me, and I remember that we didn\u2019t use a condom again.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use a condom,\u201d I say, panting.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, running his hand down my back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious,\u201d I groan, rubbing my face against his chest.</p><p>\u201cDeadly.\u201d He holds me tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d I lift my head to look into his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you pregnant within the next couple of months. Hell, you could be pregnant right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just plan that. And I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust did, and you never know. You could be carrying my son right now,\u201d he mumbles against my mouth before kissing me again.</p><p>I know this isn\u2019t normal, but it feels right. The image of a sweet baby boy goes through my head, and I can imagine Nico and his hard exterior being so gentle and sweet with a tiny baby. Knowing how he is with Daisy only makes me want to see the vision come to life. I pull my mouth away from his and lay my head against his chest. I must\u2019ve fallen asleep, because the next thing I know, the doorbell is going off, causing me to jump.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s at the door,\u201d I mumble sleepily.</p><p>\u201cI know. Let me up, baby,\u201d Nico says, rolling us to the side.</p><p>I feel him slide out and can\u2019t believe I slept with him inside me. Pulling the covers up over my shoulder, I watch as he goes to the dresser, pulls out a pair of sweats, and puts them on before leaving the room. Daisy makes her way out of the covers, scaring me half to death before she jumps off the bed to follow Nico. I roll to my back and lie there for a second. Then I remember that Nico left the room without a shirt and wonder if it\u2019s Deb stopping by. Since I\u2019ve been seeing Nico, that woman has stopped by at least three times under the ruse of needing something. I know that Nico isn\u2019t interested in her, but for me, I can\u2019t help but feel a little territorial where he\u2019s concerned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I get out of bed, find a shirt for him, and pull another one on over my head. It\u2019s so long that it hits me just above my knees, so I figure I\u2019m covered enough. I walk into the living room and see Nico in the kitchen with his hip against the counter and a cup of coffee in his hand. Another guy is there with him; his back is to me, but he\u2019s big\u2014even a little bigger than Nico. I pause where the hardwood floors start when Nico\u2019s head turns my way and our eyes lock. I feel nervous seeing this other guy in the kitchen, and not knowing who he is makes my hands begin to sweat and the need to run take over.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Sophie,\u201d Nico says, his eyes watching me closely.</p><p>I swallow hard, trying to fight my own fears, trusting Nico to take care of me. The guy in the kitchen has turned his head and is now watching me, and I tug at the bottom of Nico\u2019s shirt I put on.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d Nico repeats, and I look at him and see that he has stepped away from the counter. \u201cThis is my cousin, Kenton. Remember you saw him with me when the guy was trying to break into your house?\u201d</p> <p>His cousin. This guy is part of his family. I take a breath then let it out. \u201cYeah, hi. Nice to meet you,\u201d I say, smiling shyly at him as I wipe my sweaty palms off on the shirt.</p><p>His eyes look me over then go soft. \u201cYou too, doll,\u201d he says gently.</p><p>What is with these big scary guys and their gentle souls? I wonder.</p><p>\u201cYou want some coffee, babe?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>My eyes go to him and I nod. \u201cYes, please. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d I say, walking quickly back to the room; I need to put some pants on. I already feel uncomfortable being around people, and being half dressed won\u2019t work in my favor.</p> <p>When I get back to the kitchen, Nico has a cup of coffee and toast with honey waiting for me. I hand him a shirt, and he smiles, kissing my forehead before setting the shirt on the counter. Suddenly, he lifts me at my waist and sets me on the counter near the corner so that he is between me and Kenton. I\u2019m not sure if he knows what he\u2019s doing, but I suspect he does it on purpose, and I want to cry with relief that he gets it.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you guys doing this weekend?\u201d Kenton asks, looking between the two of us.</p><p>I know what I want to do\u2014I want to go back to bed and maybe have a good look at that piercing. I feel my cheeks heat up when I think about the way I felt when he was inside me, how alive my body felt when he made me orgasm with it, and how I really wanted another couple million of them.</p><p>\u201cBaby, stop,\u201d Nico says, his mouth next to my ear, \u201cI can tell exactly what you\u2019re thinking, and you\u2019re gonna make me be rude to my cousin, \u2018cause I\u2019m about to pick your sexy little ass up, carry you to the bedroom, slam the door, and have my way with you again whether he can hear your screams or not.\u201d</p><p>I bend my head forward, blocking my face with my hair. My face feels like it\u2019s on fire. Apparently, I am now a super slut. \u201cSorry,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he whispers back, his hand running along my thigh as he kisses my forehead. \u201cI think we\u2019re just going to hang around here,\u201d Nico says, leaning his hip against the counter between my legs and picking up his coffee cup.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going home?</p><p>\u201cNah. Cash, Lilly, and the kids just got home from Alaska. Asher\u2019s praying over November\u2019s belly for a little boy, and Trevor is keeping Liz at home, waiting for her to go into labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, you guys are like a baby-making factory,\u201d Kenton says, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with that,\u201d Nico mumbles, and I look at him and see that he is serious. His eyes meet mine and go soft before he leans in, kissing me once again.</p><p>\u201cShit, you too?\u201d Kenton asks.</p><p>Nico nods before leaning back again.</p><p>\u201cI knew, but I mean... I didn\u2019t know how serious you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat serious, my man,\u201d he says, rubbing my thigh again.</p> <p>I feel a nervous laugh climb up my throat; I cover my mouth, trying to hold it in, but I can\u2019t. Kenton looks at me and smiles, and Nico shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head before bursting out laughing. \u201cSorry.\u201d I laugh again and cover my face.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna let us in on the joke?\u201d Nico asks, pulling my hands away from my face, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cBaby factory,\u201d I say, repeating Kenton\u2019s words, and I can\u2019t help but laugh again. I\u2019m not even sure why I find it so funny.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, doll. My cousins are tryin\u2019 to take over the world with their offspring,\u201d Kenton says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah? You wanna start your shit? How are things going with you and Autumn?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>Kenton\u2019s face changes completely. The smile he\u2019s wearing slides off his face, and he growls, \u201cDon\u2019t start, Nico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want me to tell you that you\u2019re a stupid f**k?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Kenton says, glaring at Nico.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I came over here to get a break from that drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to put an end to that drama, man, and just do what you both need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I when the damn woman won\u2019t listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake her listen,\u201d Nico says, and Kenton glares, shaking his head. I feel sorry for him for some reason; he looks like he\u2019s really upset about whatever it is they\u2019re talking about. \u201cFix your shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t tried?\u201d he asks softly, looking guilty.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you have. I know you. I know that, when you want something, you make it happen. So you can sit there all day feeling sorry for yourself and talking bullshit, but I know if you wanted to, you would be at home with her right now instead of drinking my coffee and interrupting my day off with my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I hit him in chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s true.\u201d Nico shrugs like he wasn\u2019t just a giant jerk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nice,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be nice to anyone but you.\u201d His eyes meet mine and go soft, and I shake my head at his logic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna head out,\u201d Kenton says, standing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go,\u201d I tell him quickly, feeling guilty that he\u2019s leaving because I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, doll. I got stuff to do anyways,\u201d Kenton says, taking one last drink from his coffee cup and putting it on the counter near the sink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, it was nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d He smiles, making my heart do a little flutter.</p><p>Nico is hotter, but Kenton has his own brand of handsome with his shaggy dark hair, tan skin, blue eyes, and scruffy jaw\u2014a look that says if you happened to get lost in the woods with him, he would be able to build you a house with his own hands then go out and find dinner with nothing but what he could find in the forest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you around,\u201d he says, heading to the front door.</p> <p>Nico follows him, talking softly. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying, but Kenton shakes his head before giving a chin lift as Nico closes the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d I tell him as he walks back into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI told you before\u2014I don\u2019t need to be nice to anyone but you. Besides, he needs to get his shit straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat stuff?\u201d I ask curiously.</p><p>\u201cHold that thought, baby.\u201d He picks up his phone from the counter when it starts to ring. He looks at the screen and his eyebrows shoot together before he answers.</p> <p>\u201cDrake. What\u2019s up, man?\u201d he asks, his hand rubbing absently along my thigh. \u201cLike I told your dad, there isn\u2019t much you can do unless you can prove that shit.\u201d He shakes his head, looking off in the distance. \u201cDon\u2019t do that crap; you will regret it, and it will give him the upper hand. Just do as I told you before. I got your back. Call if you need me,\u201d he says before hanging up.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask, not liking the worried look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He pulls me forward on the counter until we\u2019re hip to hip. \u201cYou done eating? You want more coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I tell him as he pulls my legs around his hips and then my arms around his neck. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathe as he nips at my neck and walks us towards the bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re telling me you lost your virginity when you were twelve?\u201d I ask in shock.</p><p>I look at Nico, who is sitting across from me on the bed, wearing nothing but a sheet. We had a shower, and then he brought me back to bed and did some crazy things to my body that had me screaming out his name before he was even inside me\u2014once again, without a condom. When we were done and I reminded him we hadn\u2019t used one, he informed me that it was too late and there was nothing I could do about it. I\u2019m not quite sure why it turns me on every time he says it, but it does.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s after ten at night. We\u2019re sitting in bed with a giant pepperoni pizza he ordered an hour ago for delivery between us. When it arrived, he quickly pulled on a pair of sweats, told me I better not get dressed, and left the room to answer the door, only to come back and get naked again.</p><p>\u201cI lost my virginity at twelve. I had no clue what I was doing, but that was the first time I had sex,\u201d he says, taking a bite of pizza.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He shrugs, taking a drink of beer.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to do it,\u201d I tell him, wiping my mouth. \u201cI\u2019ve just been too afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you hadn\u2019t done it before; I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve handled it if I wasn\u2019t your first. I don\u2019t even like thinking about anyone else looking, let alone someone touching what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I shrug this time. \u201cI think it would be good to have experience. I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>I hear him growl, and my head flies up from where I was looking at the pizza.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even f**king say that shit,\u201d he says, his eyes going hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you need to know, I\u2019ll teach you. You won\u2019t be having sex with anyone else. The only person you need to please is me, and I\u2019m f**king thrilled with the way you take me,\u201d he says with a glare.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to go out and start ho-ing around.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou better not even think about what it would be like to be with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d I frown, watching as he moves the pizza box from between us and sets it on the bedside table. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He pulls my paper plate from my hand, setting it on top of the pizza box. His hands go to my ankles, dragging me so I\u2019m flat on the bed underneath him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I repeat as his hands pull both of mine above my head.</p><p>\u201cGoing to make sure I\u2019m the only one you think about,\u201d he says, rolling his hips into mine, making me gasp as his head bends forward, Then he takes one of my ni**les into his mouth. I\u2019m pretty sure every woman in the world would be thinking about him, and only him, if they knew him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d I moan, shoving my head back into the pillow.</p><p>Suddenly, the doorbell starts going off. Daisy, who was asleep on one of the pillows, jumps up and runs into the living room barking.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Nico clips. \u201cDo not f**king move.\u201d He kisses me once before jumping off the bed and leaving the room while pulling on a pair of sweats. After about five minutes, he comes back into the room with a scowl on his face.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d I ask, putting on one of his T-shirts and a pair of my cut-off sweats.</p><p>\u201cSven. I gotta go out of town for a couple days, babe. You gonna be good here?\u201d he asks, and I can hear the concern in his voice. I know he hates leaving me alone. I hate when he leaves for any length of time, but I know he loves his job.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Sven?\u201d I ask, cleaning up our mess on his nightstand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend of the family who recently moved out of town to Vegas. He needs me to fly back with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cHe opened a club and has been having some trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you doing to help him?\u201d I ask, getting nervous.</p><p>I watch him as he goes to the closet to pull out his black duffle bag. He shoves some clothes inside before walking over to the dresser and pulling out a black box, putting it in the bag too.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need that?\u201d I ask him as he pulls his gun out from the nightstand and checks the clip.</p><p>\u201cYou know I always have my gun.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I know he always carries his gun, but I don\u2019t like that he\u2019s going to Vegas and taking a gun with him when he just told me a friend of the family has been having problems at his club. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d I say, voicing my fear out loud.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you know this is what I do,\u201d he says, coming to stand in front of me, his hands going under my jaw and tilting my head back. \u201cI will be home before you know it, and we can get back to baby-making.\u201d He gives me a naughty grin before getting closer to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy. Stop trying to distract me.\u201d I bat his hands away from my br**sts, where his fingers started toying with my ni**les through his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m pissed I finally got you where I want you and now have to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to leave. You could stay home with me,\u201d I say, sliding my hands up his chest and watching as his eyes darken with my touch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**k around. You know I will have you bent over the side of the bed before you can say \u2018Nico,\u2019\u201d he growls, kissing me.</p><p>My clit pulses at his words. I want him to do that, and I really don\u2019t want him to leave.</p><p>\u201cYo! You ready or what?\u201d is yelled from the living room, startling me and breaking the moment.</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up and sit down!\u201d Nico shouts back before placing his forehead against mine. \u201cBe a good girl while I\u2019m gone. Make sure to call me when you get home from work in the evenings, and don\u2019t forget to set the alarm when you\u2019re in the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d I roll my eyes. I get the same lecture every time he goes out of town.</p><p>\u201cAll right, baby. Come walk me out,\u201d he says, picking up his bag and the pizza box.</p><p>I follow him out of the room carrying the rest of the mess to throw away. When we reach the living room, the guy who must be Sven stands and runs a hand through his dark hair. He\u2019s pretty\u2014like model-pretty\u2014with dark hair, tan skin, brown eyes, and eyelashes any woman would be jealous of.</p><p>\u201cWho do we have here?\u201d he asks, his eyes doing a head-to-toe sweep, making me feel naked. I automatically grab the back of Nico\u2019s shirt for comfort.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Sophie. She\u2019s mine and none of your damn business, so take your eyes off her,\u201d Nico growls, and the guy looks at him before smiling big and crossing his arms over his chest while rocking back onto the heels of his boots.</p><p>\u201cShit, you too, huh?\u201d He shakes his head, laughing. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, but he seems to think it\u2019s funny.</p> <p>\u201cShut the f**k up and go sit down,\u201d Nico tells him again, shaking his own head.</p><p>I wonder if he talks to everyone like this. I have seen him talk to not only Kenton, but now Sven too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very nice to your friends,\u201d I tell him when we reach the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, setting the pizza box on the counter before taking the garbage from my hand and putting it in the trash can.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mean to your friends. You told Kenton he\u2019s stupid, and just now, you told that guy to shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenton needs a wake-up call, and Sven is the biggest player this side of the Mississippi and was looking at you. Again, as I told you before, I don\u2019t need to be nice to anyone but you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family? Are you nice to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love my family. I also love Kenton and Sven, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to hold my tongue. If someone pisses me off, I let them know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlrighty then,\u201d I mumble, not wanting to piss him off. It suddenly dawns on me I have pissed him off a few times already, and he had never said anything mean to me, so maybe I\u2019m the exception to the rule. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hold your tongue with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes! My mom is the one person on the planet I\u2019m afraid of,\u201d he replies seriously.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, surprised.</p><p>\u201cReally. She can put the fear of God in anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I bite the inside of my cheek, not very excited about meeting her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get back home, you will meet her,\u201d he says, setting his bag down before crowding me against the island, \u201cand when you meet her, she will love you.\u201d His face goes soft.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I look up into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to love you.\u201d His soft words make my heart beat a little faster. His mouth touches mine in a soft kiss before he pulls his lips away, holding my face gently in his hands. \u201cNow, be good while I\u2019m gone.\u201d He smiles, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I tell him, getting up on my tiptoes to kiss him again. \u201cBut you be careful, and please don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always careful.\u201d</p><p>This time when he kisses me, it takes my breath away, and I have to unwind myself from him before he can pick his bag up. I follow him to the door, wanting so badly to tell him that I love him but not wanting to sound like I\u2019m saying it because I\u2019m afraid. He kisses me once more before he pulls the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper, laying my forehead on the cool wood. I tried fighting what I\u2019m feeling for him, and I tried to push him away even when I hurt myself in the process. He\u2019s right; I need to start living again. I don\u2019t want to push him away and one day have him finally give up on me. I know if I did, I would hate myself for the rest of my life.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Nico</p><p>\u201cSo, you really done for, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Sven asks as we make our way onto his private plane. Sven is from old money\u2014his father\u2019s father\u2019s father found oil in Texas on their family\u2019s farm at the start of the oil rush. Since then, his family\u2019s role in the oil industry has only grown.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Sophie\u201d\u2014I look over my shoulder\u2014\u201cever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, it never takes you guys long to get pu**y-whipped, does it?\u201d He chuckles, sitting down across from me.</p><p>A stewardess in a small blue dress walks up the aisle towards us. Her eyes light up when she looks at me, and I shake my head. Chicks are all the f**king same. They all talk about how men only want one thing from them, but they are constantly throwing themselves at me, yet I never hit on them first. They want the bad-boy experience. Before Sophie, I would have been happy to take this chick into the bathroom to see what she could do with that mouth of hers\u2014hell, I might have pulled out my c**k and let her take me right here\u2014but now, the thought of her anywhere near my junk has my shit shriveling up.</p><p>\u201cHello. Welcome aboard. Can I get you anything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I tell her dismissively.</p><p>\u201cNothing to drink or eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t need anything?\u201d she asks seductively leaning forward and giving me a shot of her breast.</p> <p>My jaw clenches when I see the smile on Sven\u2019s face. I can\u2019t wait for him to find a woman. I hope when he finds someone that she puts him though hell.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything,\u201d I repeat, making each word clear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, Stacy. Tell the pilot we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Sven says, fixing his suit jacket.</p><p>She nods and walks to the front of the plane behind a small curtain.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really gonna to pass up Stacy? She used to work for the circus,\u201d he says, and I shake my head, not even bothering to entertain him with that conversation.</p> <p>\u201cTell me about what\u2019s going on with the club and why you need my help when you have bodyguards and people you pay to deal with this kind of shit,\u201d I say, leaning back in my seat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone right now, especially those I have to pay. I don\u2019t know if someone\u2019s paying them more than I am,\u201d he answers, squeezing the bridge of his nose between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never trusted anyone,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but you forget I have a good reason. My mother\u2014the one person my dad should have been able to trust\u2014tried to kill him, and then she was going to do the same thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was also crazy.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>When we were young and Sven and his family moved into the area my parents still live in, his mom would make it her daily mission to come to the school and cause a scene. She was constantly accusing her husband and son of trying to kill her or being possessed by the devil; it was always some kind of drama. My father was repeatedly called to their home to settle some kind of domestic dispute. Then one night, Sven\u2019s mom went completely over the edge and stabbed Sven\u2019s dad six times in his sleep. He was half dead when Sven, who was ten at the time, heard what was happening, hid, and called 911. His dad was in the hospital for six months, and during that time, Sven lived with us. He became one of our brothers.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he repeats, rubbing his forehead.</p><p>\u201cDude, what\u2019s really going on?\u201d I ask, seeing the stress evident on his face.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s bringing drugs into my club. Not only are they dealing, but on seven different occasions, women have been roofied. I don\u2019t want or need that shit in my place of business. The guy I had asking questions ended up dead on my doorstep with a note telling me that they knew he was working for me.\u201d He looks out the window before his eyes come back to me. \u201cNow you\u2014no one knows you, and you sure as f**k look like you could hang with the guys who are dealing in the area. I need you to talk to them and find out who\u2019s behind this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ignore the fact you just said I looked like a drug dealer.\u201d I narrow my eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cBro,\u201d he laughs, \u201cyou and I both know you look like you belong on the other side of the law.\u201d He shakes his head, looking me over. \u201cThat\u2019s why\u2014I have to say\u2014I was surprised to see your girlfriend. She couldn\u2019t be more opposite of you if she tried. Does she even have her ears pierced?\u201d he questions with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you again. You don\u2019t need to know anything about Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I state immediately.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019ve known her for what\u2014a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months, but I knew the moment I saw her,\u201d I tell him, watching his eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I just learning about her then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, there is not one damn reason for you to know about her. Second, I know you bitches love to sit around and gossip like a bunch of women in a knitting club, but unlike you f**kers, my business is my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Mom know her?\u201d He smirks, and he knows she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>If my mom knew about Sophie, the phone chain would have been activated, and everyone and their mothers would know about her. That\u2019s why she will meet Sophie as soon as I get back into town; it would be f**ked up to introduce Sophie to my mom after I\u2019ve already married her and knocked her up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be meeting her soon enough.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou are so f**ked.\u201d He laughs, and I couldn\u2019t agree more.</p><p>Ma is going to be pissed that she is just finding out about her. I send Sophie a quick text telling her we\u2019re getting ready to take off in a few minutes and will call her when I land. She sends back a text telling me to be careful, with a small heart and some X\u2019s and O\u2019s.</p><p>I know she loves me; I have been waiting for her to figure it out. I have never been known for my patience, but with her, I want her to have time to accept things. Okay, that\u2019s a f**king lie; as soon as possible, I\u2019m planting my kid in her whether she\u2019s ready or not. Shit, she could be pregnant now for all we know. I can see her behind my closed eyelids, holding our son or daughter and smiling down at them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smile?\u201d Sven asks.</p><p>I don\u2019t even open my eyes to reply. \u201cSomeday, dude, you\u2019ll understand,\u201d I tell him before zoning out and falling asleep.</p><p>\u201cSo your telling me that one of the biggest pimps in Vegas has been filtering drugs through my club...in hopes of recruiting new girls?\u201d Sven asks, running his hands through his hair.</p><p>I have been in Vegas for over a week now. I didn\u2019t think it would take as long as it did to find out what was going on, but I hadn\u2019t realized how big this was. I thought for sure this was just some local drug dealer trying to sell his product in the perfect location.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. I also talked to local drug enforcement officers, and they said this has been happening all over Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is not really much you can do. There\u2019s no way to know who is bringing it in. Unless you hire some extra security and tighten that up, there isn\u2019t anything you can do at this point. People are always going to find a way to buy drugs, even if they do it outside the club. All I can tell you to do is keep an eye out and make sure the women who come into the club know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I can put up a poster saying \u2018You may be roofied. Drink at your own risk.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying, f**ker.

She tries to hide it, but I know it bothers her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say you\u2019re pu**y-whipped and want to go home to your girl?\u201d he goads.</p><p>\u201cWhen you find someone, you\u2019ll understand. Until then, f**k off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I want to settle down when I have endless pu**y at my disposal?\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust like you say you\u2019re ready to settle down with one woman for the rest of your life.\u201d He lifts an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo, man. You think you will be happy banging some random chick every day for the rest of your life, but I can tell you now\u2014eventually, that shit will get old. You\u2019ll start thinking about starting a family and having someone to go home to, someone who isn\u2019t after what you can do for them, but what they can do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou start working for Hallmark?\u201d he asks with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cSay what you want, man, but I know when I get home, Sophie will be waiting for me with open arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get home, the hot blonde I met today will be waiting for me with open legs,\u201d he remarks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying to yourself if you think that kind of life will satisfy you forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever, man,\u201d Sven grumbles, but I can see it in his eyes that he knows I\u2019m right, even if he doesn\u2019t want to admit it to himself. \u201cYou know you\u2019re a brother to me. Thanks for coming out here on such short notice to help me out.\u201d He sighs, running a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always got your back,\u201d I tell him, meaning that shit. Sven is family, even if it isn\u2019t by blood.</p><p>\u201cAll right, before you start getting all sappy and shit, let me call and have the plane readied to take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be appreciated.\u201d I smile, ready to get home to my girl. After I make it onto the plane, I send a quick text to Sophie, letting her know I\u2019ll be home soon.</p><p>The cab pulls up in front of my house a little after seven that night. I start to make my way up the sidewalk when the front door is thrown open and Sophie\u2014wearing a pair of sweats, a tank top, and her hair down, lying against the tops of her breast\u2014runs to me at full speed. I drop my bag to the ground as she crashes into me so hard I\u2019m forced to take a step back to catch her without toppling backwards. She wraps her arms around my neck and her legs around my waist. Her mouth crashes down on mine as one of my hands goes to her ass and the other to her hair so I can control the kiss. I pull her head to the side, opening my mouth under hers, her taste exploding in my mouth as soon as her tongue touches mine. Both of her hands move to hold on to my face as she kisses me back.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d she breathes, pulling her mouth from mine to look down at me.</p><p>\u201cMissed you too, baby,\u201d I tell her, pushing her hair out of her face. That\u2019s when I see the bags and dark circles under her eyes and know that she hasn\u2019t been sleeping. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you haven\u2019t been sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I didn\u2019t want you to worry,\u201d she says, looking over my shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, even when I know you\u2019re okay, I worry about you.\u201d I pull her face back down for another kiss. When I pull my mouth from hers, I whisper against her lips, \u201cYou should have told me you needed me.\u201d I crouch down and pick up my bag.</p><p>\u201cLet me down,\u201d she says, trying to unwrap her legs from around my waist.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I growl as I squeeze her ass, pulling her tighter against me. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you down until I get you to bed, and then I\u2019m going to f**k you so hard you won\u2019t have a choice but to fall asleep afterwards,\u201d I say. Her hips shift, rubbing against my erection. I can feel the heat coming off her pu**y through my jeans and her sweats. \u201cAre you wet for me?\u201d I ask, dropping my bag just inside the front door. Daisy starts jumping around at our feet. I\u2019ll come back out and give her some attention, but only after I\u2019ve gotten inside my girl and put her to sleep.</p><p>Sophie moans, her tongue licking up my neck to my ear before biting down. I stumble slightly before running us into the wall, holding her up with my hips.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby,\u201d I groan, my hands ripping the front of her top down the middle, baring her tits to me. My head drops forward, pulling one nipple into my mouth while pulling and pinching the other between two fingers. I hear her head fall back against the wall with a soft thunk as her hips roll into me. \u201cYou wet now?\u201d I ask, looking up at her.</p><p>She nods, and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wet enough. I want you drenched when I eat you.\u201d I press into her harder; hearing her soft moan is music to my ears. \u201cYou want me to eat your pu**y?\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d I ask, surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you.\u201d She bites her bottom lip, shifting her hips against me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna get me, but I haven\u2019t had your taste on my tongue for a week. I need it, so you\u2019re gonna be a good girl and lay back and let me eat your hot little pu**y until I\u2019m full, and then I\u2019ll give you the dick,\u201d I promise.</p><p>She moans again as I pull her away from the wall, walking into my bedroom. Laying her on the bed, I look down at her for a second before pulling my shirt over my head and tossing it behind me, toeing off my boots and pulling off my jeans and boxers in record time. She watches my every move with her beautiful eyes clouding with lust, her lower lip caught between her teeth, and her thighs rubbing together.</p><p>Once naked, I go to the bed, and my hands go under her ass to pull her sweats off, along with her panties. Her eyes roam over me; I can feel them burning into my skin. I toss her clothes over my shoulder before my hands go to her thighs to spread them wide. My mouth lands right on her center, licking deep the first time. I missed her taste; I could never get enough of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bury my face in her pu**y, placing one hand on her stomach to hold her down when her hips try to buck me off. \u201cCome in my mouth, baby. I want to taste it,\u201d I tell her before going back to licking and biting. I know she\u2019s on the edge by the way she\u2019s thrashing around on the bed.</p><p>I suck her clit into my mouth as I enter her with two fingers, scissoring them inside her. She comes on a scream, her taste flooding my mouth, her body convulsing around my fingers. I lay my forehead against her stomach, trying to calm down enough so that I won\u2019t hurt her when I take her. I feel her body stop shaking as her hand goes to my hair, running through it softly.</p><p>\u201cNico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a second, baby.\u201d I take a breath; I can feel my c**k throbbing. Having her taste in my mouth is not helping to calm me. It\u2019s been too long.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asks softly.</p><p>My eyes meet hers, and I take another deep breath before moving up her body. Her legs open wider, making room for me. I run my hand up the smooth skin of her thigh as the other cups behind her neck to bring her closer.</p><p>\u201cFine, I just need to be inside you.\u201d My mouth opens over hers as I slide in deep. Her tight, warm heat has me pulling my mouth from hers to grit my teeth. \u201cFuck, your pu**y is too f**king hot.\u201d I swivel my hips, keeping our bodies as close as possible. Her legs wrap around me, her hands going to my hair, holding me close.</p><p>\u201cNico,\u201d she whimpers, her legs pulling me closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby.\u201d I hold her tighter, sinking into her, pulling out slightly, and sliding back in. I keep my strokes even, pressing into her fully and grinding my pelvis against her clit.</p><p>We\u2019re both breathing heavily, our breaths mixing between kisses. I can feel her heart beating rapidly against my chest. A thin sheen of sweat has started to slicken our skin. Her hands roam over me, her nails digging into my skin on each thrust. I can feel her getting closer as her hips tip, making me slide deeper. I know I\u2019m close when I start to feel that deep tingle and my toes start to curl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, cutting her off, thrusting my tongue into her mouth as her pu**y squeezes my cock. I bury myself balls-deep inside her, letting her orgasm pull me over with her. I hold her close as I roll, pulling her on top of me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask once my breathing returns to normal.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispers, cuddling closer. \u201cI hated that you were gone, but hated it even more when you had to stay gone longer. I was really worried about you,\u201d she confesses softly. I can feel her tracing one of the tattoos along my ribs.</p><p>\u201cI hated being away from you too. You know that, right?\u201d I tip my head down to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She nods, her eyes meeting mine, \u201cI\u2019m just glad you came home,\u201d she says, and my heart squeezes at the word home. She is my home now.</p><p>\u201cI will always come home to you. I won\u2019t lie and tell you what I do isn\u2019t dangerous sometimes, but I\u2019m always careful, and now, with you, I have a whole new reason to stay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take care of whatever it was you were doing in Vegas?\u201d she asks, and I feel my muscles tighten at her question; I\u2019m not used to sharing things about my job with anyone but Kenton.</p><p>\u201cI did as much as I could. Hopefully it won\u2019t take long for the police to get the situation figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asks, and I let out a long breath, wondering how much I should say. \u201cYou can tell me,\u201d she encourages.</p><p>\u201cThere are bad people in the world. You know that, Sophie. I just don\u2019t want you to know how bad some of them are, and I really don\u2019t want to talk to you about this right after I just got home and I\u2019m still inside you in our bed. We should make a pact now to never talk about work stuff while we\u2019re in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She sighs before lifting her head and putting her chin on her hand. \u201cYou know how you want me to talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different. You and I both know it is.\u201d I run my fingers through her hair. \u201cThere are going to be times I can\u2019t or won\u2019t tell you about my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asks, shifting, making me groan and my dick jump.</p> <p>\u201cThere are things I will always shield you from, and my work is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s better for me to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. If it\u2019s something you need to know, I will tell you. Otherwise, you\u2019re just going to have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if something happens to you, I\u2019m going to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>I smile and flip her to her back, making her scream out in surprise. \u201cHow are you going to kick my ass when you can\u2019t even get out of this position?\u201d I ask, bending down to pull one of her ni**les into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI could if I wanted,\u201d she breathes, pulling my mouth closer to her breast.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d I ask before moving to her other nipple.</p><p>\u201cI know I could,\u201d she says, wrapping her legs around me; her hips rise up higher, causing me to sink deeper into her.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I groan, surprised to feel myself hardening inside her.</p><p>Her hands go under my arms, her fingers running along my back before hooking around my shoulders. She moans before licking up my neck, breathing into my ear. \u201cReady?\u201d she says, biting down on my earlobe.</p><p>I\u2019m so lost in her that I\u2019m caught off guard when one of her legs unwinds itself from my waist and goes to the bed. Her arms shift, and then I\u2019m suddenly on my back with her standing over me on the bed and looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I say in shock.</p><p>\u201cTold you I could get out of it.\u201d She smiles down at me before sitting, straddling my hips.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn that?\u201d I ask, running my hands up her thighs.</p><p>\u201cDevon, Maggie\u2019s fianc\u00e9, is a cop and taught me some moves. He said it would help build my confidence back if I knew I could put someone on their back if they ever got me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awesome, baby. I\u2019m proud as f**k of you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She smiles.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she says shyly.</p><p>\u201cCome here, sweet Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I can see that she\u2019s tired. I pull her down to lie against my chest, running a hand over her hair and down her back. I hold her until I hear her breathing even out and know she\u2019s asleep. I roll her over and make sure she\u2019s covered before I leave the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daisy\u2019s sitting outside the bedroom door when I open it. \u201cHey, girl.\u201d I scoop her up before going to the kitchen. \u201cThings are going to change around here.

Now, I don\u2019t care. There will be no more of her not doing shit because she\u2019s afraid. I refuse to let her live the rest of her life like that.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey. Are you home?\u201d my mom asks as soon as she picks up.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I got in a couple hours ago.\u201d I walk into the kitchen, setting Daisy down before washing my hands and going to the fridge to grab a bottle of water.</p> <p>\u201cHow was your trip? Did you have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was work, Ma. I wasn\u2019t partying it up in Vegas,\u201d I tell her with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were in Vegas. Why wouldn\u2019t you try to have some fun while you were there? You think I don\u2019t know what you do in your free time?\u201d I can see her in my head rolling her eyes. \u201cI know how you and your brothers act when you\u2019re single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ma, but I\u2019m not single anymore,\u201d I declare, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are such man-whores. I swear\u2014it\u2019s a wonder one of you didn\u2019t end up on that show 16 and Pregnant,\u201d she says, completely missing what I just said.</p> <p>\u201cMa, stop talking for a second and listen to me,\u201d I say, waiting for her to stop rambling.</p><p>\u201cI swear\u2014Trojan owes me royalties for all the condoms I bought for you boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa, listen.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she says, sounding annoyed.</p><p>\u201cI found my girl, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018found your girl\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean I found the girl I\u2019m going to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it April Fool\u2019s Day?\u201d she asks jokingly, but I can hear shock and happiness in her voice.</p><p>\u201cNah. I wouldn\u2019t joke with you about something like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you meet her? Who is she? When can I meet her?\u201d she yells so loud I have to pull my phone from my ear.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Sophie.\u201d I laugh. \u201cI met her when I found her phone and retuned it to her. She is beautiful, smart, and so sweet, Ma\u2014so sweet I don\u2019t even know how I got so lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d she whispers in awe.</p><p>\u201cMore than love her.\u201d I can\u2019t even begin to explain the way I feel about Sophie, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal love. It\u2019s something more. I love my family, and I love my life, but what I feel for the girl who\u2019s asleep in my bed right now goes beyond that.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, I\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d she says quietly, \u201cbut you should try to take it slow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d I look down at the ground. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing her for a while now, Ma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long is a while?\u201d she asks</p><p>\u201cA few months,\u201d I tell her softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d I can hear the hurt in her voice. I knew this question was coming.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t had the easiest life, Mom. I needed to give her time to trust me without overwhelming her with everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t overwhelm her,\u201d she argues.</p><p>\u201cMa...\u201d I say, the \u2018who are you trying to kid?\u2019 implied in my tone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she concedes. \u201cSo when do I get to meet her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d I smile. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow and we can set up a time for us to come for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey. I love you. And I\u2019m so happy for you,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Ma. Talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d I hang up, setting my phone on the counter before looking at Daisy. \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed, girl.\u201d I go back into the room and climb into bed with Sophie, who automatically curls into me. I hold her to me, kissing her hair before following her off to sleep.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I smile at David as he walks into the library. He\u2019s a pleasant-enough guy; he asked me out a couple of times, but I just couldn\u2019t go out with him. It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t good-looking\u2014he is\u2014but he seems like he has to try too hard to be nice. It\u2019s odd.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sophie. How are you?\u201d He leans on the counter in front of me.</p><p>\u201cGood, and you?\u201d I ask, typing in the call number for another book a teacher asked me to check out for their classroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. I was wondering if you\u2019d want to go out and get a bite to eat after work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d I don\u2019t even look up from what I\u2019m doing when I respond.</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard for you moving to a new state all by yourself, living alone, and not having anyone around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d I ask, finally looking up at him.</p><p>His eyes appear darker, and something about him just seems...off. A shiver slides down my spine, and I sit back in the chair. Something is telling me to get away from him.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I\u2019m sorry. You look scared.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything, Sophie. Just that, if you need me, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I wheeze out, finding it hard to breathe.</p><p>\u201cSee you around,\u201d he says, smiling. He taps the top of the desk before leaving the library, and as soon as he\u2019s out of sight, I grab my keys and bag, turn out the library lights, and lock the door before rushing down the hall and out to my car.</p><p>My hands are shaking as I open my door, and once inside, I engage the locks. I start my car and lift my head when I feel eyes on me, my eyes landing on David\u2019s car a few spaces over. I can just barely make out David sitting in his car as he waves. I lift my hand quickly, put my car in drive, and speed out of the parking lot. By the time I reach Nico\u2019s, the strange encounter with David is just that\u2014a strange encounter. David\u2019s always been nice. He knows I moved to Tennessee alone and was probably just worried about me being on my own all the time, and since he doesn\u2019t know about Nico, that would be understandable, I convince myself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turn the key in the door and open it to complete silence; this catches me off guard. Daisy always greets me when I get home. I walk into the kitchen to set my bag on the counter. I lift my foot behind me, ready to take off my shoes before searching for Daisy.</p><p>\u201cLeave them on,\u201d is growled, and I look over my shoulder at Nico, who is shirtless, wearing a pair of jeans and nothing else. Seeing him makes me forget about everything. My heart kicks up when I see his face; his eyes are dark and hungry. \u201cBeen home all day, worked out three times, and still couldn\u2019t get the image of what you\u2019re wearing out of my head.\u201d He takes a step towards me.</p><p>I look down, confused. I wore a high-waisted pencil skirt with a white blouse, sheer stockings, and black suede stiletto pumps to work today. This is my normal attire when going out of the house to work. He has seen me in these kinds of outfits a million times.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, my head tilting to the side, studying his expression.</p> <p>His hands come up to pull the pins out of my hair, tossing them onto the island in the kitchen. Then they go to my top, unbuttoning it and pulling it to the side before undoing the front clasp on my bra, releasing it so my br**sts are free. \u201cYou have this whole naughty-librarian thing going on.\u201d His hands lift my br**sts as his head dips so he can lick each nipple before biting and sucking them, making me grab his hair. \u201cEvery time you leave the house in one of these getups, all I can think about is you on your knees in front of me, your skirt up around your waist while I watch you suck me off,\u201d he says as his hands begin to pull my skirt up my thighs and his teeth bite down on my earlobe.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I breathe, feeling his fingers pull my panties to the side and then two fingers fill me.</p><p>\u201cLook at how wet you are,\u201d he groans, pulling his two fingers up between us. He\u2019s not wrong; I can feel the wetness between my legs, and my clit is now throbbing. He puts his fingers in his mouth, his eyes on me the whole time. \u201cSo sweet.\u201d His hands go to my waist. Then I hear material tearing, and I realize that he is ripping off my panties. \u201cI\u2019ve had this fantasy since the first moment I met you. You were on your knees in front of me, your tits out,\u201d he says, rubbing his thumb over one nipple and then the other, \u201cand your skirt up around your waist.\u201d He looks down, and I feel a hand on my bare ass. \u201cThe stockings... Those are a bonus,\u201d he growls, trailing his hand around before one finger slides over my clit. \u201cDo you want to make my fantasy reality?\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip, nodding my head. Without thinking, I sink to my knees in front of him. I look up, running my hands up his thighs before unbuttoning his jeans and pulling down his zipper. I hear a low rumble and my eyes lift to his, and then I watch as his nostrils flare. The second his jeans are unzipped, he springs free, bouncing against his stomach. Commando\u2014so hot.</p><p>One of my hands goes to the back of his thigh, the other to the base of his cock, pulling it down towards me. Seeing his piercing makes my mouth water. Knowing the way it feels when he\u2019s inside me causes a whole new surge of wetness to spread between my thighs. I lick the head before closing my mouth over it. I can\u2019t get much of him into my mouth. He\u2019s too thick and long, so I use my hand, moving it along his shaft along with my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cGive me your eyes, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>I lift my eyes to his; watching his expression as I work him makes me want to please him that much more. I stroke him fast, and then his hands are in my hair at the sides of my head.</p><p>\u201cThis is better than any fantasy I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he groans, his head falling back and his hips pumping himself in and out of my mouth. \u201cShit, baby,\u201d he says, and before I know what\u2019s happening, he pulls out of my mouth, turns me around, and sinks into me from behind.</p><p>My hands go to the hardwood in front of me, my head bowing forward. Nico\u2019s hands go to my hips, lifting me higher, forcing himself deeper. He plows into me hard and fast. His hand slides around my waist, his fingers zeroing in on my clit. He circles it as his other hand goes to my breast, pinching my nipple. I cry out as I feel the first wave of my orgasm wash over me.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he groans, planting himself balls-deep and grinding his hips as he spills into me. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks after catching his breath, sitting me up on my knees.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I whimper as he pulls out of me.</p> <p>His hands remove my shoes before wrapping an arm around my waist to help me up. \u201cShit, baby,\u201d he says, looking down.</p><p>I look at him then follow his eyes to my knees, which are red from the hardwood floors. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I smile, feeling my cheeks heat up. I\u2019m still so dazed by that orgasm that I wouldn\u2019t notice any pain.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s shower.\u201d He picks me up, carries me to the bathroom, and then helps me get undressed and into the shower before stripping his jeans off, following me in. \u201cI have another fantasy,\u201d he whispers in my ear as his hands massage my br**sts from behind.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d I ask, tilting my head to the side.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says, nipping my neck before showing me a few other fantasies he\u2019s had. All of them are awesome, but my favorite has me with my thighs wrapped around his head.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow we\u2019re going to dinner at my parents so you can meet everyone.\u201d</p><p>I try to lift my head to look at him, but I\u2019m just too exhausted. \u201cWas this your plan? Wear me out so I don\u2019t argue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it sounds smart.\u201d I hear the smile in his voice and can\u2019t help but to smile back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous about meeting them, but I also can\u2019t wait,\u201d I confess quietly.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he asks, making me feel like a jerk.</p><p>I hate that he thinks I don\u2019t want to meet them. It\u2019s never been about not wanting to meet them. It\u2019s always been about being afraid of what would happen if I had a panic attack or something. I don\u2019t want them to think that their son should find someone else who\u2019s normal.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d I run my hand along his abs. \u201cI want to see where you come from and meet the people who raised you. Plus, you\u2019ve talked about your brothers and their families so much that I feel like I already know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for doing this. I know it\u2019s not easy for you, but my family\u2019s cool. They\u2019re gonna love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d I tell him, my eyes feeling heavy. I don\u2019t care who else loves me. I just want him to.</p><p>\u201cSleep, sweet Sophie,\u201d he whispers, his lips on my forehead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2019Night,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>I feel his laughter against my cheek, making me smile before I drift off to sleep, completely forgetting to tell him about my strange reaction to David.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d a woman yells, running outside and down the front steps to where I\u2019m exiting Nico\u2019s car. I stumble back as she embraces me in a tight hug. \u201cWelcome,\u201d she says breathlessly before her hands go to my face, her eyes soft as she looks at me.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I can\u2019t help but smile as she pulls me back in for another hug. She doesn\u2019t seem so scary anymore. I almost laugh at my own fear.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d Nico says, walking towards us. The smile he\u2019s wearing is one I haven\u2019t seen before, but I have to say\u2014it\u2019s probably one of my favorites.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d She lets me go and walks to where he\u2019s standing, her hands going to his face this time. I hear her whisper something to him, but I can\u2019t make out what it is. His face goes soft, looking a lot like his mom as he nods before kissing her cheek. \u201cSo, I hope you two are hungry.\u201d She smiles, linking her arm with mine as we make our way into the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>She turns to look over her shoulder to answer him. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon. He called to tell me he would be late,\u201d she says as we make our way inside.</p><p>The house is a beautiful two-story farmhouse. The outside is painted a pale yellow with white trim, and a large front porch sporting two rocking chairs completes the picture. As we walk inside, all I can think is how welcoming their home feels. The warm wood floors and country-style decor make me feel like I should be drinking a glass of lemonade while putting my feet up.</p> <p>\u201cI love your house,\u201d I tell Susan as we make our way into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThank you, honey. Nico\u2019s grandparents bought this house when they moved into the area. When they told James they were going to sell it, he bought the house from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to live in an area like this. The drive out here was beautiful. When I moved to Tennessee, I wanted to buy a house in the country on a couple acres, but I just couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d I explain with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked living in a neighborhood close to the city?\u201d Nico states as a question, wrapping his arms around my waist from behind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind it.\u201d I turn my head and look back at him. \u201cBut when I was little, I read all of the Little House on the Prairie books and dreamed of living in a house in the middle of nowhere with my husband and filling it up with tons of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can definitely have tons of kids,\u201d he says, his eyes going dark.</p> <p>He is on a baby-making mission. Since he got back from Vegas\u2014unless I\u2019m working\u2014we\u2019ve been in bed, and he\u2019s been doing everything in his power to put a baby in me. Not that I have been putting up much of a fight about it. After opening up to him about everything, I know that he is everything I want and need. I know that, deep down, even the night I ran away, I would have gone back to him; I wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay away.</p><p>\u201cNico, you wanna come help me out?\u201d a guy yells into the house, my heart rate automatically kicking up.</p><p>We talked about this. This morning, he told me that everyone was meeting at his parents\u2019 for dinner. Like it told him last night, I am excited but still nervous. I know that I put this off for as long as I could. And honestly, it wasn\u2019t fair to Nico to keep pushing him away even if it was unintentional. When I told Maggie what was going on, I could hear her clapping and jumping up and down while we were on the phone. She loves that Nico is forcing me to step outside of my bubble. She is happy for me and excited to meet Nico.</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d he yells back before kissing my neck and whispering into my ear, \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree nervously. I just don\u2019t want to have some kind of breakdown in front of his family. Once, in Job Corps, I passed out when I was with a group of people at lunch. After that, I tried to just stick to myself.</p><p>\u201cSo, Nico said you work as a librarian?\u201d Susan asks, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, I do that part time. My real job is as a private insurance specialist.\u201d I watch as she goes to the stove and pulls out a giant ham, the kind you would have at Thanksgiving, with the pineapple and cherries on top of it.</p><p>\u201cWow, that sounds fun,\u201d she says sarcastically and giggles, making me laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s no fun, but it pays the bills.\u201d I shrug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, really, the thing is\u2014my shoe addiction isn\u2019t going to pay for itself,\u201d I say with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou too, huh? I had to take a job working for my boys when their dad told me he wasn\u2019t going to give me any more money for shoes unless I got rid of some first. I told him fine, I didn\u2019t need his money, and bribed my boys with cookies and started working for them. Needless to say, James had to build me a bigger closet.\u201d She laughs and shakes her head, and I burst out laughing too. I can\u2019t help it; she\u2019s so sweet and totally puts me at ease. \u201cCan you help me out with the rolls and put them in the oven?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, going to the counter and putting a pan of Hawaiian rolls into the oven.</p><p>\u201cThanks, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I smile, feeling warm inside. I wonder if my mom would have been like her if she were alive. All of the memories of my mom are happy; she was always laughing and smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Nico\u2019s arms wrap around me. I hug him back, breathing him in before bringing my hands to my face, wiping my eyes. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d he says against my ear before kissing it.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just thinking about my mom and wondering if she would be like yours,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He tilts my head back with a finger under my chin. \u201cYou gonna be okay being here? If not, we can go,\u201d he says quietly, searching my face. Hearing him say that only makes me love him that much more. I know how much his family means to him. I know how much he wants me to get to know them, so his asking if I need to leave says more than words ever could.</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d I whisper. It isn\u2019t a question; I know he does because I can see it in his eyes. I don\u2019t know how I missed it before.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He smiles, his mouth touching mine. \u201cI love you, Sophie,\u201d he says softly for only me to hear.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I whisper, closing my eyes. I feel him smile against my lips before he kisses me again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, shit.\u201d He lifts his mouth from mine and I turn my head. \u201cIt is true. Fuck me\u2014I thought Mom was kidding,\u201d a guy says, looking between Nico and me.</p><p>\u201cTrevor, this is Sophie. Sophie, this is my brother, Trevor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d I tell him, pressing closer to Nico.</p><p>Trevor is big, and we were in a kitchen, so I can\u2019t help but feel some fear as the thought of my attack in my childhood home\u2019s kitchen drifts into my mind. I try to fight it, remembering what my counselor said about not letting it control me, and I take a deep breath and put my hand out to Trevor, who immediately takes it. I scream when he suddenly pulls me to him, and it takes a second to realize that he\u2019s hugging me. My heart is pounding in my chest, but my breaths, which were coming in rough pants, slow, and I return his hug for a second before being pulled back by Nico\u2019s strong, tattooed arms.</p> <p>\u201cAw, now you get it.\u201d Trevor smirks, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI get it, and you got your own woman, so keep your hands off mine,\u201d Nico says, tucking me back under his arm.</p><p>Then a very pretty woman with long blond hair comes into the kitchen holding a little girl\u2014well, trying to; it appears more like the girl is being detained, and the woman looks like if she moves wrong, her very pregnant stomach would explode.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about picking her up, babe?\u201d Trevor scolds her, taking the little girl from her and whispering something into her ear, making her laugh and yell out, \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either pick her up or have your mom\u2019s house destroyed. She\u2019s just like you. She never wants to listen when I tell her no,\u201d she snaps at Trevor.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like telling me no,\u201d Trevor tells her with a smirk before gently pulling her forward by the back of the neck and kissing her. When his mouth leaves hers, she smiles then looks at Nico and me.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d she mumbles, and I can\u2019t help but giggle. I totally get it; Nico has the same effect on me.</p><p>\u201cSophie, this is my wife, Liz, and my daughter, Hanna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I greet softly, lifting my hand in a small wave.</p><p>Nico pulls me fully against him until Hanna reaches out from Trevor\u2019s hold, latching on to Nico. I love seeing him with the little girl, who seems so fascinated by him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, they were telling the truth,\u201d Liz says quietly.</p> <p>My eyes go to hers, and she starts to laugh, making her whole belly bounce. I\u2019m starting to wonder if she should even be out of bed with how large she is.</p><p>\u201cShould you be doing that?\u201d I ask her, watching her belly, afraid the baby is going to somehow become dislodged and come flying out.</p><p>\u201cDo what? Laugh?\u201d she asks, my eyes returning to hers as she smiles and shakes her head, laughing even harder. \u201cI still have a ways to go, but this guy here is apparently going to be the biggest baby in the history of babies.\u201d She starts rubbing her belly, and I really want to rub it too to see what it feels like. \u201cHe\u2019s kicking. Do you wanna feel?\u201d she asks, reading my face.</p><p>I take two small steps towards her, gently placing my hand on her belly. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It feels strange and uncomfortable, but never really painful, except childbirth. Now that is horrible, and anyone who says differently is a liar.\u201d She grabs my hand, pulling it around to her side and holding it there. That\u2019s when I feel a small kick, and then another, this one much harder.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s going to be a soccer player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be a football player,\u201d Trevor says, narrowing his eyes on his wife.</p> <p>\u201cSure, honey.\u201d She smiles then rolls her eyes. \u201cHow long have you been seeing Nico?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Shit. What should I say? I look at Nico; he\u2019s so caught up trying to control the little girl in his arms and talking to Trevor that he\u2019s basically no help at all.</p><p>\u201cYou are seeing him, right? I mean, he\u2019s not just joking, is he?\u201d she asks, confused.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not a joke.\u201d I shake my head, my eyebrows coming together in concentration as I try to figure out what to say.</p><p>\u201cHey, I was just curious. You don\u2019t have to tell me anything,\u201d she says gently.</p><p>\u201cI...I just feel bad. We\u2019ve been seeing each other for a few months, but I just couldn\u2019t meet you guys yet. I was trying to work through some stuff first,\u201d I tell her quietly.</p><p>\u201cI understand that. I had to work through some stuff for a while as well, so I know how you feel. Nico\u2019s a good guy though, so he\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s kind of relentless,\u201d I reply, scrunching up my nose.</p><p>She smiles genuinely, transforming her whole face from pretty to stunning. \u201cWell then I guess I should say welcome to the family.\u201d She shocks me, pulling me in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, now you\u2019re stuck. There\u2019s no way out of this. Even if you tried, he would hunt you down.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>\u201cYikes,\u201d I say with a fake grimace.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She nods, and then I hear the front door bang open.</p><p>I jump and look at Nico. Then loud voices fill the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cMa?!\u201d is bellowed. I look at Susan, who smiles and rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy oldest has no manners. Don\u2019t mind him,\u201d Susan says, walking around us and out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d she asks with a laugh, and then there\u2019s a chorus of \u2018Grandma!\u2019 being yelled with happy squeals from what sounds like a troop of little girls.</p><p>\u201cCome meet everyone,\u201d Nico says, walking me out into the living room with one hand against my lower back, the other full of a very excited little girl.</p><p>Once we make it around the corner, I stop dead in my tracks when I see two more beautiful men, a pretty red-haired woman, a beautiful woman with long brown hair, four little girls, and one little boy all gathering around Susan and yelling for her attention. The other two couples in the room are standing off to the side, watching and laughing while Susan\u2019s mauled by the group of kids.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nico!\u201d a little girl wearing a tutu screams, running towards us at full speed. All the other kids in the room follow her lead and surround us.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I look down to see the only boy in the bunch looking up at me curiously. \u201cSophie. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d he says, tilting his head to the side and studying me. \u201cI neber met you before.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNope, you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looks at where Nico\u2019s hand is wrapped around my waist, and his little eyes narrow slightly. \u201cYou said girls are weird and that you didn\u2019t want one,\u201d Jax says, looking at Nico accusingly.</p><p>\u201cI did, little dude, but that was before I met Sophie,\u201d Nico explains, and I want to laugh, but Jax looks very serious about this topic.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s a girl,\u201d he argues, looking around at all the girls then back at Nico. \u201cWe already hab too many girls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, you know. You are the one who\u2019s always said girls are gross,\u201d a guy in a baseball cap says, walking across the room and holding a woman\u2019s hand, both of them wearing wide smiles on their faces.</p><p>\u201cHi, Sophie, it\u2019s nice to meet you. This is my wife, Lilly. I\u2019m Cash. This little guy here is Jax, and he is ours, along with Ashlyn,\u201d he says, pointing out one of the little girls.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too,\u201d I say as all the little girls it the room start running around us, yelling in their high-pitched singsong voices, \u201cUncle Nico\u2019s in love!\u201d I can help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the insanity,\u201d Lilly says, smiling, and that\u2019s when I recognize her from school.</p><p>\u201cYou used to work at the middle school, right?\u201d Her hair is different, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s her.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I recognize you!\u201d She smiles excitedly. \u201cAre you still working in the library?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wondered what happened to you,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. One day when you have time, we\u2019ll meet for coffee so I can tell you all about it,\u201d she replies just as quietly.</p><p>I\u2019m taken aback by her offer; even when she worked at the school, we never socialized. Well, I never socialize with anyone.</p><p>\u201cI would like that,\u201d I say sincerely, liking the idea of having some friends here.</p><p>\u201cIt really is a small world.\u201d She shakes her head, looks at Cash, and smiles as he leans forward, kissing her forehead.</p> <p>Then the other guy who arrived comes over, scooping up one little girl along the way. \u201cSophie, it\u2019s nice to finally meet you. I\u2019m Asher, this is November, and those three girls are ours\u2014July, June, and May,\u201d he says, pointing to each daughter as he says their name. If Nico hadn\u2019t prepared me for their names, I may have laughed, but thankfully, he warned me.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you guys.\u201d I smile at both of them before taking a second to look around. Nico\u2019s whole family\u2019s beautiful...like, really beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, babe?\u201d Nico whispers next to my ear, sending a small shiver down my spine. I nod and lean into him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, everyone. I need your help getting dinner on the table. Who wants to help Grandma?\u201d Susan asks, and all the kids start yelling about who gets to help set the table, who gets to butter the rolls, and all sorts of other tasks they clearly do often.</p><p>\u201cWe call it controlled chaos,\u201d November says, watching as all the kids follow after Susan.</p><p>\u201cI just call it insanity,\u201d Trevor says, walking into the living room with Liz, who he helps sit down before putting her feet up on a pillow.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I told you I\u2019m fine,\u201d she grumbles, but seeing the size of her ankles has me wincing and thankful she\u2019s off her feet.</p><p>\u201cWell, be fine sitting your pretty little ass in here with your feet up,\u201d he replies, kissing her hard before going back into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so bossy,\u201d Liz says, but I can tell she really doesn\u2019t mind that he\u2019s bossy with her.</p><p>\u201cSo, you sure you\u2019re ready to be a part of this craziness?\u201d Asher asks me, wrapping an arm around November\u2019s waist.</p><p>I look at Trevor, who comes in to give Liz a glass of water, and then Cash, who is whispering something into Lilly\u2019s ear making her smile. I glance at November, who is looking at Asher like he holds the secrets of the universe, and as I feel Nico\u2019s hand on my side, his fingers running along the skin between my shirt and jeans, in his touch alone, I feel love.</p><p>\u201cIt may take some getting used to, but yes, I\u2019m ready,\u201d I tell Asher, and Nico\u2019s fingers give me a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to get used to it, but as long as you have a backbone and don\u2019t let these guys boss you around too much, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d November says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t boss you around,\u201d Asher says, glaring at November.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t.\u201d She pats his chest then rolls her eyes, making me giggle.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s home,\u201d Nico says as we hear a loud diesel engine pulling up outside, and before I have a second to gather my thoughts, \u201cGrandpa\u2019s here!\u201d is yelled and a swarm of children run into the living room then out the front door.</p><p>My heart swells as we walk out onto the front porch. There\u2019s obviously a rule in place and the kids must do this often, because they all stay on the porch until the truck is shut off. The second the engine dies, the kids all run full speed down the steps. An older man\u2014who is still very handsome and looks a lot like his sons\u2014hops out of the truck. Then chaos ensues, and the kids are on him, jumping up and down, and all of them talking to him a million miles a minute at the same time. He takes his time, greeting each one, picking one up, and giving them a second of his time before kissing them on their head and putting them down until every single one of them has had their turn.</p><p>I fall in love with Nico\u2019s family right then and there\u2014his mom, brothers, sisters-in-law, and now his dad\u2014and I can tell without a doubt that they all genuinely love each other. They are the definition of family and exactly what I never knew I wanted for myself.</p><p>After all the kids have their time with their grandfather, he makes his way up the porch steps with a wide smile on his face holding Jax.</p><p>\u201cSo I hear Nico\u2019s in love. That right?\u201d he asks, looking at Nico and then at me.</p><p>I bite my lip to keep from smiling at Jax, who looks utterly annoyed with his uncle. \u201cUm...\u201d I don\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cHe is, Grandpa. He was wookin\u2019 at her all funny and everything,\u201d Jax says, crossing his arms over his chest with a huff.</p><p>\u201cWell then, I\u2019m James, but you can call me Dad. Welcome to the family.\u201d I\u2019m about to put out my hand and introduce myself, but I\u2019m suddenly pulled into a bear hug that forces Jax between us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Sophie,\u201d I tell him, hugging him back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice to meet you, Sophie,\u201d he says, pulling away to set down a wiggling Jax.</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d I smile up at him, seeing that his eyes look exactly like Nico\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you guys. Come inside. Dinner\u2019s ready,\u201d Susan says as she comes outside, wiping her hands on a dishcloth.</p><p>James pulls her to him with an arm around her waist and kisses her once before patting her butt and sending her inside in front of him. Now I know where the Mayson boys get it from, I think, looking up at Nico with a smile as we follow his parents into the house.</p> <p>\u201cSo how\u2019s work been, son?\u201d James asks Nico.</p><p>We\u2019re all sitting around the table and eating, and the conversation has mostly been about my history. I\u2019ve tried to steer things away from what happened after my mom died and before I went to Job Corps. I feel a little like I\u2019m lying, but there are some things I just can\u2019t bring myself to talk about. I look at Nico curiously when he avoids the question his dad just asked him and completely changes the subject.</p><p>\u201cHow do you guys feel about the fact that Cash and Lilly ran off and got hitched?\u201d he asks with a smirk, and everyone at the table stops looking at him and turns to stare between Cash and Lilly. I look at Nico funny, knowing he\u2019s avoiding talking about his job. I\u2019m happy to know I\u2019m not the only one he keeps his work-life separated from, but I really hope he talks to someone about it. I can\u2019t imagine doing what he does and not having someone to vent to.</p><p>The rest of dinner is spent talking about Cash and Lilly, their time in Alaska, and their quickie Vegas ceremony. I also spend most of dinner with different kids in my lap, each asking me questions of their own. First, it is July asking me about my nail color and if she could borrow my polish. The next is June, who has a hundred questions about me and Nico, and then May wants to know why she\u2019s never met me before and asks me every question under the sun, from my favorite food to if I had any pets. By the time Hanna comes to sit on my lap, I am thankful for the little girl because she only wants to talk about books. Ashlyn is the last to sit with me. I tell her all about Daisy, who she has only met a couple of times but has fallen in love with her. Jax is quiet during most of dinner. He sits on the other side of Nico, who I guess from their talks is his idol\u2014well, until I came along. Apparently Nico broke his trust when he got a girlfriend.</p><p>After we\u2019ve finished our dinner and each had a piece of homemade lemon meringue pie, it is almost nine and time for us to go home.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t hab a sleepober wif me?\u201d May asks, bending her little head backwards so she can look up at my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey, but your uncle Nico would be sad if I didn\u2019t have a sleepover with him,\u201d I tell her. Leaning forward, I can\u2019t help but kiss her head. \u201cI promise you we will have a pajama party soon though. We can watch movies, paint our nails, and do all kinds of fun things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy! I get to have a sleepober wif Aunt Sophie!\u201d May yells, jumping down off my lap, and then all the kids run into the dining room and swarm me, asking if they can have a sleepover too.</p><p>\u201cYes, you can all come and have a sleepover.\u201d I laugh as they all run off to their parents, yelling about a sleepover at \u2018Uncle Nico and Aunt Sophie\u2019s house.\u2019</p><p>\u201cWhen you have this sleepover, I\u2019m gonna make sure I gotta work,\u201d Nico says, making me narrow my eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, I figure this will be good practice for you, Mr. I-wanna-get-you-knocked-up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d He smiles, kissing my nose. He wraps his arms around my waist, and I lean into him. \u201cYou ready to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you are,\u201d I tell him before getting up on my tiptoes to kiss him. Today has been awesome. I now know that I have nothing to worry about. His family is sweet. I\u2019m happy to know them and glad Nico has them at his back, and I can\u2019t wait to spend time with them again soon. \u201cI love your family,\u201d I tell him as I kiss the underside of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cThey love you too baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I tell him with a smile.</p><p>He leans forward and kisses my forehead before leaning back his eyes meeting mine. \u201cLove you too, sweet Sophie.\u201d I smile and shake my head. \u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get out of here. I need to be inside you,\u201d Nico says, making me tingle.</p><p>I nod and make quick work of saying goodbye to everyone, including all the kids, who make me promise again that we will have a sleepover soon.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Jax and Ashlyn are missing?\u201d I ask, watching as Nico pulls on a pair of jeans and boots, and I immediately hop out of bed and start to get dressed.</p><p>Not long after I met everyone, Lilly was arrested, and Nico worked hard to get her released. This morning, he found evidence proving that Lilly had been wrongfully accused. I hate that they are being forced to deal with more drama, and I feel nauseated just thinking about something happening to the kids.</p> <p>\u201cCash couldn\u2019t say much, just that he and Lilly had been home with her parents and the kids. Lilly noticed that the kids were quiet and went out to check on them. He said they\u2019ve searched everywhere and still came up with nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so we can help them look,\u201d I tell him, pulling on a hoodie along with my Chucks.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, what?\u201d My eyebrows draw together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going with. I won\u2019t be able to focus if you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna help,\u201d I tell him firmly. There is no way I\u2019m going to be sitting here worried out of my mind while he is searching for the kids.</p><p>\u201cNo. No way.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you for permission.\u201d My hands go to my hips.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue with you, Sophie,\u201d he growls, pulling a shirt on.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t argue.\u201d I leave the room and head to the kitchen to grab my bag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not f**king coming!\u201d he yells behind me. Once he comes into the kitchen, he grabs his keys and heads for the front door. I quietly follow behind him, thinking maybe he won\u2019t even notice I\u2019m there. \u201cBaby, serious as f**k, I don\u2019t have time for this shit right now. Please put my mind at ease. Stay here and wait for me,\u201d he says, turning around, his hands going to my face. I can see in his eyes that he is stressed, and I don\u2019t want to add to it. As much as I want to go with him to help look for the kids, I know I can\u2019t add to his worry.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I agree reluctantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d His mouth drops to mine, and before I can kiss him back, he\u2019s opening the door.</p><p>\u201cCall me the minute you find them!\u201d I yell as he\u2019s getting in his car. He gives me a chin lift, so I figure that\u2019s basically an affirmative.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I pace back and forth between the living room and the kitchen, but it must be a couple of hours. I give in and call Lilly, who\u2019s a wreck and can\u2019t even get a word out without breaking down into tears. I can\u2019t imagine what she\u2019s going through, but I tell her that, if she needs anything at all, I\u2019m here.</p><p>After I get off the phone with her and another hour passes, the phone rings and I jump to answer it, thinking it\u2019s Nico with good news. I\u2019m disappointed when it\u2019s November and Liz calling to see if I\u2019ve heard anything. They both know as much as I do, which is nothing at all. Halfway into our conversation, November gets a call from Susan, who says they found Jax and are on their way to get Ashlyn. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of information, but I feel better knowing that they are on the right track. I want to help, and I hate that I\u2019m stuck at home and can\u2019t do anything. By the time Nico calls to tell me they have Ashlyn and that Cash is heading to the hospital with both of the kids in an ambulance, I\u2019m a mess.</p> <p>\u201cShould I meet you there?\u201d I ask, holding my breath.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I\u2019m just going to take care of a couple more things and then I\u2019ll be home. We can go and see the kids tomorrow, but right now, I think Cash and Lilly just want to be alone with the kids,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>I want to cry; I feel horrible not being there with him. \u201cAre you sure? I can meet you at your parents\u2019. That way, if they need us, we\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I swear if I thought for one second that would be best, I would have you come here, but as of right now, everyone\u2019s going home. Asher wants to go sit with his girls, Trevor told me he needs to be with his, and I want you at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper, hearing the stress in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cBe home soon,\u201d he says, hanging up.</p><p>I sit there for a few minutes, going over everything that happened to Lilly\u2014and now the kids\u2014and also what November told me about her story and what Liz explained about hers while we were on the phone. I look at the picture of Nico and me on the screen of my phone and swear to myself right then that I will do everything in my power to be worthy of Nico. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t still have fears, but knowing how life can change so drastically in the blink of an eye makes me want to live my life completely. I\u2019m in love with an amazing man who looks at me like I\u2019m his reason for breathing when, in reality, he\u2019s mine. I want to be the strong person he sees me as. He deserves that and more.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so cute,\u201d I tell Nico, looking from Trevor and Liz\u2019s new son to his smiling eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe is, babe,\u201d he agrees, his face soft as he looks at his nephew.</p><p>\u201cHere. You hold him.\u201d I hand Cobi over to Nico, helping to situate him in his arms before smiling up at him.</p><p>His eyes drop to my mouth before he leans forward to kiss my forehead. I feel warmth flow through me. I love Nico\u2019s family. That\u2019s why, when Trevor called to say that Liz had gone into labor, I freaked out and ran around the house in a hurry, wanting to get to the hospital as soon as possible.</p> <p>By the time we arrived, Liz was already seven centimeters. Two hours after we got there, a smiling Trevor came out to tell us that baby Cobi had arrived and he was nine pounds and six ounces. When he made this announcement, my first thought was, Oh my God, I can\u2019t wait to see him! Then my mind wandered to the bag of flour I had to carry around in junior high during sex education that weighed ten pounds. And then I thought about something that size coming out of my vagina and wanted to stop having sex altogether. The idea of that coming out of something so small made me feel uneasy.</p><p>The second I had Cobi cuddled to me, all thoughts of teeny, tiny vaginas and giant babies left my head, and I knew that, no matter what, when you\u2019d hold your child, whatever you went through would be completely worth it.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Nico</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to go with you?\u201d I look at the GPS, seeing that I should be in the Nashville area in about two hours.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. I just need to get some clothes and check the mail. I won\u2019t even be there for more than thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait for me and I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d I try again.</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know that, when you get home, you\u2019re not going to want to leave the bed, let alone the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit,\u201d I groan, getting hard just thinking about being inside her. \u201cYou say it like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing. That\u2019s why I want to go to my house. I don\u2019t want to leave the house either once you get home,\u201d she says shyly.</p><p>\u201cBe naked in bed,\u201d I demand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I want you naked, spread eagle on the bed so when I get there, I can get my taste before f**king you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNico,\u201d she breathes, but I can hear the hunger in her voice.</p><p>I\u2019ve been out of town for three days. The whole time I was gone, all I could think about was the news we found out right before I left. Sophie had woken up sick a couple of days in a row. I had my suspicions, but there was no way to know for sure without her taking a test. On the third day, I said f**k it, got up, and went to the pharmacy near the house. I knew she was afraid to take the test after the last few times she had taken one and they\u2019d come back negative.</p><p>I sat there with her in the bathroom, refusing to leave even when she peed on the thing. I knew in my gut that this was it; just like I knew she was my forever, I knew our child was growing inside of her. Those three minutes were the longest of my life. All I could think was, How the f**k can a piece of plastic that probably costs one cent to make in China hold such an important message? When the screen flashed and the word \u2018pregnant\u2019 appeared on the screen, I looked at Sophie, who was staring at the screen in complete shock. The only thought in my head then was how much I f**king loved her.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she whispered, her eyes meeting mine. I could see tears beginning to form. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d I confirmed as I pulled her against me, burying my face in her neck. \u201cI love you, baby. Thank you for giving us this,\u201d I whispered against her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby,\u201d she repeated, this time sobbing into my chest.</p><p>I pulled her face away so I could look at her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared, but so happy,\u201d she cried and smiled at the same time.</p><p>\u201cMe too, baby. But I know everything\u2019s going to be perfect.\u201d She nodded, and then she smiled a smile that lit her whole face\u2014a smile that, even thinking about it now, makes me feel like king of the f**king world.</p> <p>Knowing that Sophie is pregnant\u2014fuck me, if that shit doesn\u2019t make f**king her even hotter. I can\u2019t keep my hands off her. I love knowing that my kid is growing inside her. After that shit with Cash\u2019s ex and the kids going missing, I spent all my free time trying to get Sophie pregnant. Not that I hadn\u2019t been on a mission before that, but knowing how short life is only made it that much more important. Next on the list is giving her my last name. Yes, I\u2019m doing shit ass-backwards, but I don\u2019t give a f**k.</p><p>\u201cBabe, seriously\u2014when I get home, you better be in bed, butt naked, and ready for my mouth,\u201d I tell her, coming out of my daydream.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that and expect me to get anything done,\u201d she cries, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cYou better hurry. You have a little less than two hours to get your shit done before I\u2019m home and you\u2019re mine. Besides, what do you even have at your old place that you could possibly need? The last time I walked into our bedroom, all your shoes, clothes, and other shit were spread from one side to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that bad,\u201d she says low, probably looking around the bedroom at the disaster she has turned our room into. \u201cI have to get my suitcase and the stuff for Maggie\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to just put that house on the market and stop saying the market\u2019s shit. Who cares if you take a loss? You know I got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me to take a loss on my house,\u201d she huffs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this right now.\u201d Every time we discuss her house situation, she gets upset. \u201cJust get you\u2019re shit and then be naked when I get to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she says, but I can hear the smile in her voice and can\u2019t help but smile too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**k with me, Sophie,\u201d I growl before gentling my voice. \u201cHow\u2019s my baby doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Making me tired, but good.\u201d She sighs.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with him when I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be a girl.\u201d She laughs. I swore up and down to her that it is going to be a boy, but something keeps telling me it\u2019s going to be a girl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d she says quietly, making my heart squeeze like it always does when she says those words to me.</p><p>\u201cYou too, babe. See you soon,\u201d I tell her, hanging up.</p><p>I\u2019m about twenty minutes outside of Nashville when my phone rings. At first, I think about not answering it, knowing that I will be home soon, but I know that, if my friend Leo\u2014a cop in Nashville\u2014is calling, he probably has a job for me or needs my help with something. I reluctantly answer on the third ring.</p><p>\u201cYo, Leo. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMayson, I need you to meet me at your girlfriend\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I ask, dread creeping up my spine.</p><p>\u201cLook, I wanted to give you a heads-up. I don\u2019t want you to get here and flip your shit. Therefore, I\u2019m telling you now so you have time to calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is going on?\u201d My adrenalin surges; he\u2019s f**ked if he thinks I can calm down before I get there when he starts a conversation out like that.</p><p>\u201cI called Kenton. He\u2019s on his way. Someone got into her house when she was inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Has a couple scratches, a bump on her head, and she\u2019s pretty shaken up, but she\u2019s all right, man.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, my heart is beating out of my chest. I press down on the accelerator, needing to get to my girl. \u201cPut her on the phone,\u201d I bark.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second. She\u2019s in the ambulance,\u201d he says, and my f**king fingers feel like they\u2019re going to make dents in the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k is she in the ambulance? You said she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a precaution. You know that shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, she\u2019s f**king pregnant,\u201d I bellow into the phone. I do not care about anything except her and finding out she\u2019s all right.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he growls. I can hear the wind moving down the line, indicating that he\u2019s running. \u201cSophie, Nico\u2019s on the phone,\u201d I hear him say, and then the line is quiet for a second.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Her sweet voice is like a balm to my rage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says quietly, and I want to f**king scream because I can hear the fear in her voice. She\u2019s been so good\u2014no freak-outs, no worries. She\u2019s settled in and started coming around...and now this.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, baby,\u201d I say soothingly.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m okay.\u201d I can feel her anxiety through the phone. My foot eases off the gas as I exit off the highway.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my son?\u201d I ask, hoping to get her to relax a little.</p><p>\u201cIt could be a girl,\u201d she tells me quietly before taking a deep breath. \u201cI think she\u2019s okay. I...I didn\u2019t hit my stomach or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy, babe. I keep telling you this,\u201d I prod.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she replies, sounding annoyed, making me smile slightly as I turn onto her street.</p><p>I park on the curb, seeing not only an ambulance, but three squad cars. The minute I shut off the car, I hop out and jog to the ambulance. Leo\u2019s standing in front of the open doors of the ambulance with his arms crossed over his chest and his feet planted apart. I can\u2019t see her until I\u2019m right on them. The minute my eyes lock on her, my slightly calmed rage erupts once again.</p><p>There\u2019s a scratch down the side of her face and a dark mark under her jaw that looks like a bruise, and the top she has on is ripped at the neck. I take a second to get myself under control before she sees me. I don\u2019t need her feeding off the anger I\u2019m feeling. The second her head turns and our eyes lock, tears fill hers to the brim. Fuck, I hate seeing tears in her eyes, and knowing that she\u2019s scared isn\u2019t helping settle my rage any. I hop in the back with her, getting down on my knees in front of her. The EMT starts to say something, but I give him a don\u2019t-fuck-with-me glare and he backs off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d I hold her face between my hands. She\u2019s so fragile, so f**king breakable, and the most important thing in my life. If something happened to her, I don\u2019t know what I would do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d She presses her face deeper into my hand.</p><p>\u201cTold you I was close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m gonna need you to wait outside,\u201d a different EMT says, hopping into the back with us.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna need you to cut me some f**king slack. My woman was attacked, and I need to see for myself that she\u2019s okay. As soon as I\u2019m done, I will let you do your job, but don\u2019t f**k with me right now,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cGive him a minute, man,\u201d I hear Leo say from outside.</p><p>The EMT looks at me and nods before jumping out. My eyes go back to Sophie\u2019s; I study the marks on her, swearing that whoever did this to her won\u2019t be able to walk again after I find them.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay? No cramping or anything, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. My head just hurts.\u201d Her hand goes to the back of her head, and mine follows her movement. The second I touch the bump on the back of her head, she flinches, and I let off a string of expletives. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t cuss like that when the baby gets here, right? The last thing we need is for his first word to be f**k,\u201d she says softly.</p> <p>\u201cYou finally admitting it\u2019s a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She rolls her eyes then winces. I lay my forehead against her stomach, just taking a second before asking her more questions. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... Fuck no,\u201d I choke out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d She runs her fingers over my hair, down the back of my neck. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s trying to comfort me right now.</p><p>I finally build up the courage to ask. \u201cWhat happened, baby?\u201d I hear her take a deep breath, and I lift my head to look at her.</p><p>\u201cI was getting all my stuff together for the wedding when I heard someone in the living room. At first, I thought it was you getting home early and you stopped by to help me. I called out your name and you didn\u2019t reply, and then I thought maybe you were trying to scare me. It took a second to realize you would never do that to me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI started heading for my phone when a person wearing a ski mask and all black clothes came and stood in my bedroom doorway. As soon as I saw them, I started screaming and put the bed between us. I looked for a weapon, but there was nothing near me. I was so scared.\u201d I can hear the fear in her voice again, and I run my hands up and down her arms, trying to calm her. \u201cThe guy grabbed me and started dragging me out of the room. I wiggled out of his hold and got in a good kick to his crotch. I was almost to the front door when he grabbed for me again; that\u2019s when I got this scratch,\u201d she says, pointing at her face. \u201cHe got ahold of the neck of my shirt and it ripped, which made me fall backwards and hit my head on the coffee table. Then someone started pounding on the front door and he took off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, baby.\u201d I pull her closer, needing to know she\u2019s safe, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have made you wait for me,\u201d I insist.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d she says quietly, her arms squeezing a little tighter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna let the EMT finish checking you out. I\u2019ll be right outside talking to Leo.\u201d She nods, and I put a finger under her chin, lifting her face up so I can look in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re safe. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She rests her head against my shoulder, and my hand goes to her stomach, where my child\u2019s growing.</p><p>\u201cAll right, baby. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I kiss her forehead then her lips. I give the EMT a chin lift, letting him know he can get back to checking her over as I hop out the back of the ambulance. \u201cTalk to me,\u201d I say to Leo, handing him his phone back. He starts to take a step away from the ambulance, but I shake my head no. I need to have an eye on Sophie.</p><p>\u201cAll right, man. I heard what she told you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I prompt.</p><p>\u201cThe neighbor who pounded on the door told us they were walking their dog when they heard her scream. At first, they were just going to ignore it, not wanting to get involved in a domestic dispute. When they heard the second scream though, they decided to act.\u201d</p><p>Fuck me. I know many times people ignore a scream or yell thinking it\u2019s nothing or not wanting to get involved. Who knows what would have happened to Sophie if someone hadn\u2019t knocked on her door and scared the person away? I shake my head, not allowing myself to think like that. I look into the back of the ambulance at Sophie, who\u2019s talking with the EMT. She\u2019s a little roughed up but safe, and that is all that matters.</p><p>\u201cThe neighbor said he banged on the door before trying the handle, which he was surprised when it opened. He found Sophie in the living room. She was out of it but talking. He said he helped her to the couch then called the cops.\u201d He shakes his head, running his fingers through his blond hair. \u201cWhen we got on the scene, she asked us to call you first. I thought she was a client or something, so I had one of the guys call Kenton. That\u2019s when I found out she\u2019s yours.\u201d I watch as he looks in on Sophie, his eyes going soft. \u201cHow did you find this chick?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>I know we don\u2019t look like we match\u2014she\u2019s the soft to my hard, the light to my dark, the blatant innocence to my roughness\u2014but I couldn\u2019t give a f**k if people look at us and wonder why we\u2019re together. I don\u2019t like the softness in his eyes when he looks at her. Leo is a good ol\u2019 boy. He grew up on his family\u2019s farm, comes from old money, played high school and college football, and could have gone pro if he wanted to, but he always dreamed of being a cop. He\u2019s about six foot two and two hundred and eighty pounds of pure muscle. He\u2019s the kind of guy a sweet girl like Sophie could take home to her parents, or vice versa. Too bad for him she\u2019s mine and will be until God sees fit to take her from Earth.</p><p>\u201cDo I seriously need to tell you not to check out my girl right now?\u201d I glare at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s not that. She\u2019s just so not your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I raise a brow at him, ready to put my fist in his face. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my kid growing inside of her tells you just how much of my type she is,\u201d I say through my teeth. \u201cBesides, you have your own woman,\u201d I tell him, missing the way his jaw ticked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeo, shut the f**k up. Don\u2019t dig yourself any deeper. My cousin\u2019s a little sensitive where Sophie is concerned,\u201d Kenton says, walking up on our conversation. \u201cYou good man?\u201d I lift my chin before looking in on Sophie again. \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d Kenton asks, looking at Leo.</p><p>I half-listen as he retells what happened and what Sophie told me. \u201cHow\u2019d they get into the house?\u201d I ask, focusing back on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cThere was no forced entry, so at this time, we\u2019re unsure. Sophie said she locked the door when she entered her residence, but she never checked the back door to make sure it was secure as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone see anything or anyone?\u201d Kenton asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo one saw anything. The person who stopped the assault when he entered the residence didn\u2019t see anyone but Sophie,\u201d Leo says.</p><p>\u201cSo basically, we got nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so. Unless you have someone you suspect, then we got nothing to go on,\u201d Leo says.</p><p>I\u2019m frustrated as f**k. This is not what we need right now. \u201cJesus, this is so f**ked,\u201d I growl. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time someone has tried to break into her house, so this isn\u2019t some random act,\u201d I tell Leo.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw the previous report. She got any enemies?\u201d Leo asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo. No one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe an ex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, man. Nothing. There is no one in her past. She hasn\u2019t even been in Tennessee long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure she doesn\u2019t have an ex? That\u2019s normally the first person we suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d I repeat, starting to see red. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve thought about this shit, but no one stuck out to me. The only person who kept popping into my head was Sophie\u2019s dad. \u201cI need to make a call,\u201d I say, looking between Kenton and Leo.</p><p>\u201cSure, man,\u201d Kenton, says.</p> <p>\u201cKeep an eye on Sophie for me.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his chin as I make my way to the side of the ambulance. I pull out my phone, find the number, and hit dial.</p><p>\u201cYello,\u201d Justin answers, and I shake my head; this kid is a f**king mess.</p><p>\u201cJustin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got me, daddio. Congrats on that, by the way,\u201d he says cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you guys really do love to f**king gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends. Friends share happy news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stop yappin\u2019 like a forty-year-old housewife for a second?\u201d I run a hand over my head, my eyes dropping to my boots.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, man? Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone broke into Sophie\u2019s old place while she was inside. I need you to do a background on her dad. I want everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, man. Is she okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s fine. A little shook up, has a scratch and a couple bumps, but for the most part, she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, dude. Give me the name you want me to run,\u201d he says seriously, a tone I rarely hear out of him.</p><p>\u201cHis name is William Grates, and his last known place of residence was Seattle, Washington. He\u2019s Sophie\u2019s dad, so maybe you can trace him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got this. I\u2019ll call you later with what I find out. Just go be with your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he says, hanging up.</p><p>I walk back to where Kenton and Leo are still talking and look inside the ambulance. When Sophie\u2019s eyes meet mine, she gives me a small smile before turning back to talk to the EMT. Something about that smile lets me know that everything will be okay. I look back at Kenton and he nods. My cousin is crazy as f**k, and as long as he\u2019s in my corner, I know Sophie will be safe.</p><p>\u201cGet back here.\u201d I pull Sophie back under me after she tries to roll away. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I kiss the skin of her neck. My hand runs along her thigh, up under my shirt she has on, along the smooth skin of her stomach, and then up to cup her breast.</p><p>When we got home last night, I helped her shower\u2014even though she insisted she was fine\u2014and carried her to bed so I could hold her close. I haven\u2019t let her out of my grip since.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breaths, and I watch as her head tilts back, giving me better access to her neck.</p><p>\u201cSensitive?\u201d I question, running my thumb across her nipple. Last night, she said that her ni**les were extra sensitive when I was washing her in the shower. She nods as I tilt her face towards mine so I can take her mouth in a deep kiss. \u201cWhat about this one? Sensitive?\u201d I ask, traveling my hand to her other breast, tugging on that nipple.</p><p>\u201cYesss...\u201d she hisses out, pressing herself deeper into my hand. Her hand closest to me travels down my abs and grips my erection, pumping once before her thumb slides over my piercing at the tip. My hips automatically shift, wanting closer to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about this? Is it sensitive?\u201d I ask, running a finger over her folds before dipping in and then circling a finger outside her entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she cries, making me smile. Her head turns, her eyes open, and they lock on mine as her fingers dig into my bicep.</p><p>\u201cHow did I get so f**king lucky?\u201d I lean forward, kissing her mouth before kissing her chin, each nipple, and below her belly button, where I kiss my child.</p><p>I look up at her, pulling one of her legs over my shoulder before licking her in one long stroke. She\u2019s gotten sweeter since becoming pregnant. Her taste hits my mouth and I can\u2019t hold back; I take her aggressively, burying my face in her pu**y until I can hear her screaming my name.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cBut where are you going? Where in Seattle? Have you ever even been here before?\u201d Sophie asks in rapid-fire succession.</p><p>We got to Washington yesterday for her best friend\u2019s wedding. I hate f**king lying to her, but there is no way I\u2019m telling her that I\u2019m going to meet her dad. She doesn\u2019t even know he\u2019s in prison, and the last thing I want right now is her worrying.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u201d\u2014I finish tying my boot and grab her hand before sitting back so I can pull her onto my lap\u2014\u201cI go to cities I know nothing about at least once a month. Don\u2019t worry about me. I won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d I run a hand down her back, the other lying over her stomach.</p><p>Her eyes go to her lap before meeting mine again. \u201cI hate being away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe here,\u201d I tell her. Since the attack, she hasn\u2019t left my side. I hate having her away from me, but because we\u2019re so far away from Tennessee, I know I can relax a little. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always safe. Besides, I\u2019m not working. I just need to go out and pick something up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could you need to pick up in Seattle?\u201d she asks, obviously frustrated.</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Now go back to sleep. You need your rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d she huffs.</p><p>\u201cI can see the bags under your eyes, Sophie. I know you\u2019re tired.\u201d I run my fingers under her jaw. Yesterday was a long day of traveling, and I pray we won\u2019t have to do it again while she\u2019s pregnant.</p><p>\u201cSheesh, you\u2019re a charmer.\u201d She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cYou know you\u2019re beautiful. Now stop being difficult and lay down. I\u2019ll be gone three hours tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you owe me cake\u2014chocolate cake. Wait, no, chocolate cheesecake. No\u2014just chocolate cake.\u201d She bites her lip, and I burst out laughing, pulling her closer to me.</p> <p>\u201cHow \u2018bout I get you both? That way you don\u2019t have to choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be as big as a house by the time this is over.\u201d She sighs.</p><p>\u201cYou will always be beautiful,\u201d I assure her.</p><p>\u201cEven if I weigh four hundred pounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d I smirk. \u201cBig girls are hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks, searching my face.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t discriminate, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d she asks, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>This is one thing about Sophie being pregnant\u2014she is moody as f**k. One minute, she\u2019s happy-go-lucky, and the next, you would swear she\u2019s possessed by the devil.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t before you. Women of all shapes and sizes are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d She nods, looking off in the distance before her eyes come back to me. \u201cI totally feel that way about guys. You know, skinny, muscular, jock, nerd\u2014they all have something I find attractive,\u201d she says, and I growl deep in my throat. I do not ever want her to check men out...ever.</p><p>\u201cYou better not be checking dudes out,\u201d I tell her, watching her try to hide her smile. \u201cYou f**king with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would I do that?\u201d she asks innocently, batting her lashes.</p><p>\u201cJust for that, when I get back and I\u2019m inside you with you begging me to let you come, it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d I watch her breath pause before speeding up. \u201cI should tie you up and torture you.\u201d Her thighs tighten together and she squirms on my lap, rubbing against my dick, which is ready to go. \u201cSeems like you like that idea,\u201d I whisper against her neck before biting down on her earlobe. I slide my hand from her stomach to her thigh. \u201cWhen I get back here, this is mine.\u201d I run my finger up the center of the panties before pulling her in for a kiss. I end it quickly, knowing how fast things can get out of hand with her. \u201cBe back soon.\u201d I kiss her once more before picking her up off my lap and heading out the door.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, baby,\u201d I tell her, shutting the door behind me.</p><p>When I finally get to the prison and make it past security, I know I\u2019m going to be late making it back to Sophie. Not only do I have this stop, but I have to pick up her ring from Tiffany\u2019s. Maggie and Devon want me to ask her when they are there to see it. It\u2019s f**ked up, but the only time I can do it is at their wedding. They\u2019re leaving town in the morning to head out for their honeymoon.</p><p>I walk down a long hallway with phone booths and Plexiglas lining one side. \u201cWait here,\u201d a guard says before going to stand near the door. I take a seat, watching as a man wearing an orange jumpsuit enters. He\u2019s short with a stocky build, dark, greying hair that\u2019s tied back into a ponytail, and a face that is weathered and aged. If not for eyes perfectly matching Sophie\u2019s, I would have no idea that he\u2019s her father. His eyes meet mine through the glass, and I can see the confusion on his face; I know he has no clue who I am or why I\u2019m here. He sits down across from me and nods to the phone, lifting the one on his side to his ear as I do the same.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d are the first words out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asks, his eyes looking me over.</p><p>\u201cYou and I have someone in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve been here for the last almost eight years and you look like you\u2019re young enough to be my son, I doubt that,\u201d he says and starts to pull the phone from his ear.</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d I say, and his face pales, his eyes go wide, and his grip on the phone tightens so much that his hand and knuckles turn white.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSophie,\u201d I repeat and watch as he leans back in his chair, his hand going to his mouth, covering it.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Sophie?\u201d he asks as his hand moves from his mouth to run over his head.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be my wife,\u201d I tell him bluntly.</p><p>His eyes look me over again before narrowing slightly. \u201cNot my daughter.\u201d I\u2019m slightly taken aback by the adamancy in his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s a sweet girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d I agree. \u201cSo tell me why the f**k you didn\u2019t protect her?\u201d Even though this isn\u2019t my reason for being here, knowing the shit she went through after losing her mother, I had to ask him.</p><p>\u201cI...I was lost.\u201d He takes a breath.</p><p>\u201cYou were lost?\u201d I repeat, wondering what the f**k that even means.</p><p>\u201cAfter her mother died, I was lost. I tried to be a good dad, but I couldn\u2019t even look at my own daughter without hating her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cShe looked just like her mom. I know it was f**ked up, but I hated looking at her and seeing my wife. Do you know how f**ked up it is to look at your only child and wish they would have died with their mother just so you wouldn\u2019t have to see the disappointment in her eyes when she looks at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one stupid motherfucker.\u201d I shake my head in disgust, wishing the glass weren\u2019t separating us.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? You think I don\u2019t regret the way I treated her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you do. You left her to the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was f**ked in the head after losing my wife,\u201d he says, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI get that, man. I really f**king get that. I honestly don\u2019t know what would happen if I lost Sophie, and I pray to God I\u2019ll never have to know what that feels like, but if she left me with our child, I would always make sure my kid was safe. No way would I f**k my kid\u2019s life up just to make mine easier to deal with.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI f**ked up!\u201d he shouts this time, making the guard take a step towards us.</p><p>\u201cYou did, but what I want to know is\u2014are you still f**king up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said earlier you wished Sophie had died. Do you still feel that way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know why I\u2019m in this f**ked-up place?\u201d</p><p>I do know.

It was two days after she left. I had been sober for two whole days, looked around, and realized what I was doing to myself and what I let happen to my daughter. I tracked the guy down that hurt her and killed him. I\u2019m in here for the next fifteen years. I do not regret for one second taking that f**ker\u2019s life. I know I should have prevented it from happening in the first place, but I didn\u2019t, so I made it to where it would never happen again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d I sit back in the chair, my body sagging.</p><p>\u201cI know I f**ked up with her, but I never wanted her to be afraid again,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>I shake my head, still in shock from what he just said. \u201cSomeone has tried to hurt her twice since she moved to Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where she went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had someone keeping an eye out for her, and then one day she was just gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s in Tennessee with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in the picture?\u201d He cocks his head to the side.</p><p>\u201cA while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d he asks, closing his eyes, but not before I catch the look of pain in them.</p><p>\u201cGood, but I really need to know who\u2019s after her. Do you know of anyone here from her past who would be messing with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only threat she had is dead.\u201d I nod. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I debate for a second if I should tell him, but seeing him in here behind bars and knowing the reason he is here, I quickly make up my mind.</p><p>\u201cNico Mayson.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re with my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she happy?\u201d he asks quietly, hopefully.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>His eyes search my face. \u201cTake care of her,\u201d he chokes out before hanging up the phone and standing. He leaves me sitting there in shock.</p><p>I still know nothing about who\u2019s after Sophie, but I do know that her dad loves her, and now I have to figure out if I should tell Sophie about him.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I grumble out before hanging up the phone and getting the f**k out of there.</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\u201cGirl, you know I don\u2019t do the whole \u2018white meat\u2019 thing, but that man of yours is seriously fine. I mean F-I-N-E,\u201d Maggie says, throwing herself down on the bed next to me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you this happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been this happy before. He makes everything okay. With him, I feel safe, like I can explore or just be me and know he will watch over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I saw that. He\u2019s kinda scary,\u201d Maggie says quietly.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he doesn\u2019t have to be nice to anyone but me,\u201d I tell her, watching her eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Her head turns towards me, her lips parting slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when I first met you, I wondered how the hell this little ol\u2019 white girl was gonna make it in the world if she couldn\u2019t even be around a group of people without freaking out. Then you surprised me by never giving up. Yes, you did freak the hell out every time, but you never quit trying. You\u2019re one of the strongest people I know, Sophie. So yes, that man will probably kill anyone who ever tries to harm you, but your strength is internal,\u201d she says, and I start to cry immediately.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mind me. This baby has me all messed up,\u201d I say before thinking. No one knows I\u2019m pregnant. Well, no one except Kenton, Nico\u2019s friend Leo, the EMTs, and a whole bunch of cops. Okay...so a lot of people know I\u2019m pregnant.</p><p>\u201cDid you just say what I think you said?\u201d I squeeze my eyes closed and shake my head. \u201cYou did! You just said, and I quote, \u2018Don\u2019t mind me. This baby has me all messed up.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly mother of God! Sophie Jean Grates, you\u2019re pregnant!\u201d Maggie yells as she climbs up to stand on the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant and you weren\u2019t going to tell me?\u201d She starts to jump up and down, and just like that, my stomach flips, I stand up and run to the bathroom, and proceed to get rid of my breakfast and lunch. \u201cOh shit, I\u2019m so sorry! I didn\u2019t even think.\u201d</p><p>I feel a cool, wet washcloth run across my forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just the whole jumping-on-the-bed thing was a little much,\u201d I say, flushing the toilet before taking the washcloth out of her hand and bringing it to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell were you jumping on the bed?\u201d I hear growled.</p><p>Maggie and I look at each other in shock before turning our heads to the open bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, babe. You have a hard-enough time keeping food down as it is, so tell me why the hell you would feel the need to jump on the bed,\u201d Nico demands, walking into the bathroom.</p><p>He is so hot that I have to look at Maggie and see if it\u2019s just me who is affected by him. Nope. The look on her face says that he does it for all women. Today, he has on jeans, boots, and a black Henley with the neck unbuttoned, showing off his tattoos. The area between my legs starts to tingle just from looking at him. I watch as he gets out my toothbrush before putting some toothpaste on it and setting it on the side of the sink. Then he walks over to where I\u2019m still sitting on the floor, picks me up, and places my butt on the bathroom counter.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were only going to be gone a couple hours,\u201d I complain right away. He has been gone for the last six hours. I try to avoid pouting out my bottom lip like a two-year-old who\u2019s not getting her way.</p><p>\u201cI know. I got held up. Now open,\u201d he instructs, and I do before I realize what he\u2019s doing.</p><p>\u201cI can brush my own teeth,\u201d I grumble, pulling the brush from his hand to clean my own teeth, and shake my head at him.</p><p>\u201cNo more jumping on the bed, okay?\u201d he prompts. He looks really worried, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s from seeing me sick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, searching his face.</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t jumping.\u201d Maggie laughs, looking between us. \u201cI... Well, she slipped up about the baby, and I was excited, so I started jumping on the bed.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Nico\u2019s eyes start to narrow, and I pull his face towards me. \u201cMaggie is my friend. I don\u2019t care what you say about not having to be nice to your friends, but you treat mine like you treat me. Got it?\u201d I say, waving my toothbrush around, foam flying everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you getting sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then you shouldn\u2019t have gotten me pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you pregnant.\u201d His eyes go soft before he runs his hand along my stomach like he often does. I smile then realize I probably look like an idiot with my mouth full of foam and a big cheesy smile on my face.</p><p>\u201cYou guys kinda make me want to vomit,\u201d Maggie says, making me laugh.</p><p>I look across the room at Nico, who has his head tilted towards Devon. They\u2019re both standing next to the bar wearing suits, and each has a glass of what looks like scotch in their hands. Whatever they\u2019re talking about looks really serious.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d Maggie asks, coming to stand next to me.</p><p>\u201cNo clue.\u201d I shrug, not taking my eyes off the guys.</p><p>\u201cWell, Nico has Devon\u2019s seal of approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask, finally looking at Maggie, who looks beautiful in her wedding dress. The creamy color against her dark skin is stunning.</p><p>I look back at the guys, thinking how much the two men are alike. Devon is one of the hardest people to get along with. His childhood made him into an adult who doesn\u2019t easily trust, yet he always sees the glass as half full. He is also very protective of those he cares about; he is a lot like Nico in that aspect. He is one of the first people who made me feel safe. I knew when we were in Job Corps together that Devon would hurt anyone who even thought about messing with Maggie or me.</p><p>\u201cReally. I guess they have a mutual friend, and Devon said he heard about Nico Mayson a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I whisper, this time in shock. Tennessee and Seattle are really far apart. Knowing that someone in Seattle heard about Nico makes me a lot more curious about his job.</p><p>\u201cYep. Seems your man has made a name for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he was good, but wow,\u201d I breathe, my heart filling with pride.</p><p>I look over at Nico and Devon again, seeing that they both have their heads turned towards Maggie and me. Nico\u2019s eyes travel from my head to my toes, and I can see the hunger in his eyes. I have the urge to pull him into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cSo how does it feel to be married?\u201d I ask, turning back to Maggie.</p><p>\u201cNo different, I guess.\u201d She shrugs her bare shoulder. \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve been living together so long we may as well have been husband and wife already. This is just a piece of paper that says we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have that piece of paper,\u201d I mumble under my breath.</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m living with Nico, and yes, I\u2019m pregnant with his child, but I want his last name. I want his ring on my finger, and I want mine on his. I really wanted it after the one night I was looking at all his tattoos and he told me why he didn\u2019t have one on his left ring finger when he has them on all the others.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we get married, I\u2019m gonna tattoo your name there,\u201d he said, and I felt my heartbeat double-time at his words. I want my name on him. I love that idea, but I want him to wear a wedding band as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the history of the wedding ring?\u201d I asked him, tracing the empty space between his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ancient times, the circle was the symbol of eternity, no beginning or end. The hole in the center of the ring also had significance. It wasn\u2019t just considered a space, but rather a door leading to things and events for the couple. When an Egyptian man gave his woman a ring, it signified his never-ending love. Later, when the tradition was adopted by the Romans, the ring symbolized ownership. They also believed the ring should be worn on the left ring finger because they thought there was a vein in that finger, referred to as the \u2018Vena Amoris,\u2019 or the \u2018Vein of Love,\u2019 that was said to be directly connected to the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>My eyes met his, which were warm and soft. \u201cI read it somewhere.\u201d I shrugged like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. I had been fascinated by that little piece of gold on my mom\u2019s finger since I was a little girl.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me the truth about how you knew that,\u201d he said, running his hand over my hair.</p><p>I sighed, loving and hating how he could read me so easily. \u201cWhen I was little, I used to play with my mom\u2019s wedding band on her finger. I remember always being curious about what it meant. I knew it meant forever. I just wanted to know why. So one day, my mom took me to the library, and we found this old book about the history of the wedding band. The first ones were made out of grass then later out of ivory or wood, depending on your wealth. But no matter what they were made from, the meaning was always the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he growled, flipping me onto my back, and before I had a second to think about what was going on, he was inside me.</p><p>\u201cSophie? Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh...what?\u201d I ask, snapping out of the memory.</p><p>\u201cWow, that man must have it going on if you can stand in a room full of people and still be with him somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that.\u201d I blush, lowering my eyes.</p><p>\u201cUh-hummm. Whatever you say, girl, but I know that look anywhere. Hell, I plan on wearing that look later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you to talkin\u2019 about?\u201d Devon asks, walking up and putting his arm around Maggie\u2019s waist as Nico does the same around mine.</p><p>\u201cGirl talk, and you know we can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Sophie\u2019s girl talks always mean trouble,\u201d Devon says with a smirk. \u201cMan, you gotta watch out for these two. They\u2019ve always been nothing but trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d I laugh. \u201cYou were always trying to get us in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cop. I take offense to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I roll my eyes and shake my head.</p><p>Devon was always trying to talk us into doing things we weren\u2019t supposed to. Job Corps was very strict; we weren\u2019t allowed to leave the grounds unless you had earned it. We had a curfew and other rules as well, and he was always breaking them and dragging us along with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSophie loved the drama.\u201d Maggie smiles.</p><p>\u201cAnyways, are you excited to go to the Bahamas?\u201d I ask, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes! Two weeks of beautiful beaches and sun. I love Seattle, but I hate that it rains all the time. It will be nice to get out of town,\u201d Maggie says, leaning deeper into Devon\u2019s side, smiling up at him. It used to make me jealous watching them, but now I have that kind of love for myself.</p><p>\u2018That\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t miss. I love Tennessee,\u201d I tell them, feeling Nico\u2019s fingers flex on my hip.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come visit after you have the baby,\u201d Maggie states, and Devon looks at me, his eyes getting big. Crap.</p><p>\u201cYou pregnant, Sophie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see, when a man and\u2014\u201d I start flippantly.</p> <p>\u201cCut the crap. You gonna marry our girl?\u201d Devon asks, glaring at Nico. Nico\u2014being Nico\u2014glares back at him, putting his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou really want to ask about that at your wedding?\u201d Nico asks.</p><p>\u201cHell yes. Everyone in this room loves Sophie, and no one here will be happy to know she\u2019s pregnant with no ring on her finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so?\u201d Nico asks, looking around at the people in the room, who have all started to watch us.</p><p>I can feel my cheeks heating up. I know Devon thinks of me as family, but this is crazy.</p><p>\u201cDevon, please sto\u2014\u201d I start, but suddenly Nico gets down on one knee in front of me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper, watching as he pulls a small, turquoise box from inside his suit jacket.</p> <p>\u201cI knew from the moment I saw you that I would do everything within in my power to make myself worthy of you. I was going through life one day at a time, and then you came along and gave me a reason to plan for tomorrow. Every second, every minute, and every day, I will prove to be a better man, a man worthy of you, a man who will love you the same way you love me\u2014for who I am, not what others see me as. I promise to love and protect you until my last breath, Sophie Jean Grates. Will you marry me, baby?\u201d he asks, pulling a diamond solitaire ring from the hinged case in his hand, dropping the box on the floor, and pulling my hand towards him.</p><p>Before I can even think or he can get the ring on my finger, I tackle him. \u201cYes.\u201d I push him backwards, climbing on top of him and kissing him all over his face. \u201cYes,\u201d I repeat, holding his face between my hands and looking into his eyes. \u201cI love you, Nico Mayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, baby.\u201d He slides his hands through my hair, pulling my face down to his. Loud applause fills the room, and I feel myself turning red as he kisses me again, only to pull away and whisper against my lips, \u201cLet\u2019s get off the floor, crazy girl.\u201d</p><p>I nod and climb off of him, fixing my dress. As soon as were both up, he slides the ring on my finger, pulling it to his mouth and kissing it then kissing me.</p><p>\u201cI love you, girl,\u201d Maggie says, pulling me into a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. I can\u2019t believe he asked me in front of everyone,\u201d I say, still in shock.</p><p>\u201cWe knew yesterday,\u201d she tells me then moves to Nico before I can ask her what she meant.</p><p>Devon holds his arms open to me; I automatically go to him, wrapping my arms around his waist.</p> <p>\u201cYou did good,\u201d he whispers before kissing the top of my head. I nod, feeling tears filling my eyes. \u201cI know you understand what you got in our girl, man; just take care of her,\u201d Devon says over the top of my head before turning me around and handing me off to Nico.</p><p>\u201cYou happy, baby?\u201d Nico asks, bending down to kiss my forehead.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I tell him, tilting my head back to get a kiss.</p><p>When his mouth leaves mine, I hold my hand up to his chest, looking at my ring. This is what my mom had with my dad; even if she only had it for a short time, I know this is what she felt.</p><p>\u201cI love this dress,\u201d Nico says from behind me later that night as his fingers run across my bare shoulders, making me shiver, \u201cbut I really love what\u2019s under this dress.\u201d He kisses my neck.</p><p>I feel his fingers on my zipper as he begins to pull it down. My breathing picks up as my dress starts to fall from around me. His hands go to the back clasps of my bra and it falls to the floor.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands around my neck,\u201d he says against my neck as my hands go over my head and behind his neck. His hands run over my hips and up my stomach before cupping my br**sts in his big hands. \u201cI want to try something with you. Will you let me?\u201d I nod. There is nothing I wouldn\u2019t try with him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I cry out as he tugs on both of my ni**les at the same time. Since becoming pregnant, my br**sts have become extra sensitive, and I swear they are directly connected to my clit now.</p><p>\u201cLie on the bed on your back and close your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I step out of his embrace and walk to the bed, where I climb on, wearing nothing but a pair of pale-yellow lacy boy shorts that match my bra and dress perfectly. I lie on my back, feeling the wetness between my legs with every movement. I get comfortable and close my eyes, but I can\u2019t help but to peek at what he\u2019s doing\u2014not that I can see anything. His back is to me, and his shirt is now off.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes. You peek again and I won\u2019t do what I\u2019ve got planned.\u201d</p><p>I slam my eyes closed and feel my pulse start to race in excitement. I hear some clinking, the shuffle of feet on the carpet, and then the bed depresses next to me.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want this.\u201d I nod, clenching my fists. \u201cI need you to say the words out loud, Sophie,\u201d he says, running a finger from the bottom of my foot to my inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cGood. Lift your hands over your head.\u201d</p><p>I take a second but do as he says, and then I feel something smooth wrap around my right wrist then my left. They\u2019re drawn together and lifted higher, and I automatically tug my hands and feel that they\u2019re tied to the headboard.</p><p>\u201cOh shit,\u201d I moan. I know he\u2019s joked about this, but I never thought it would really happen.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d I feel his fingers run from where my arms are joined, down one, and then along my side and under each breast. \u201cI have imagined this over and over again.\u201d</p><p>I feel the bed depress. Then his hands travel from my ankles, spreading my legs wider as they travel up my knees, pulling my legs apart. His body comes over mine, his tongue licks over one nipple then the other, and then his hand at my side leaves and I hear clinking again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, the cold feel of an ice cube is circled around my right nipple then the left, causing my ni**les to become even harder. I grit my teeth then cry out as the ice cube travels down my stomach, around my belly button, and then over the lace that is covering me.</p><p>\u201cI need to cool you down, baby. You\u2019re really hot down here,\u201d he says, but then the ice is gone and I hear some kind of metal-on-metal sound.</p><p>I scream when my nipple is pinched, and not by fingers, causing my eyes to fly open as I look down.</p><p>\u201cEyes closed,\u201d he growls, making me wetter.</p><p>I close my eyes and squeak when he treats my other nipple to the same treatment as the first. The image in my head is strangely beautiful. He\u2019s attached small, golden clamps to my ni**les. I can feel the pressure, but it\u2019s odd, because at the same time, I can feel the connection from the clamp to my clit like a live wire.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d This time, his mouth comes down on mine, his teeth biting my lip, drawing my tongue out to play with his. His mouth travels down under my chin, between my br**sts, and around my belly, and then I feel him sit away from me as his hands slide under my ass, pulling my panties down then off. His hands come under me again, lifting my ass of the bed.</p><p>\u201cNow you can open your eyes.\u201d I do immediately; our eyes lock and his tongue licks right up my center. \u201cDid you know you\u2019re so f**king sweet that I could eat you for hours? I love how wet you are for me.\u201d He sucks my clit into his mouth, my back bows, and the clamps on my ni**les shift, making me cry out. I tug my hands against their bindings, trying to get them free, but it\u2019s no use. I\u2019m completely at his mercy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d I pant, feeling the pull and knowing I\u2019m getting ready to crash over the edge. His mouth leaves me, his fingers running over me in soothing strokes, making me jolt and cry out. \u201cI was so close,\u201d I tell him, lifting my hips.</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d he breathes against my pu**y before licking me again. His fingers slide inside, and I cry out again as he flicks over my clit with his tongue. I\u2019m close again, so I squeeze my eyes closed and lift higher, only to have him pull away again.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d I shout. His chuckle has me trying to kick him.</p><p>His hands grab my ankles then thighs, holding tight before his mouth is on me again. This time, his fingers fill me, his mouth covers me, his tongue thrashes before pulling my clit into his mouth, my head presses deeper into the bed, and I scream as I come harder and longer than I ever have. I feel like I\u2019m floating on a cloud before I slowly come back to my body. The feeling is so overwhelming that I feel tears spring to my eyes.</p><p>He pulls the tie at my wrist, flips me over onto my stomach, lifts my hips, and slides into me, slowly filling me inch by inch; I can feel his piercing dragging inside me, hitting all the right spots. The nipple clamps attached to my ni**les pull them down, and the feeling of them dragging against the sheets causes me to moan. I arch my back, lifting my ass higher wanting it deeper.</p><p>\u201cShit, baby,\u201d Nico groans from behind me, the noises he\u2019s making spurring me on. His hands go under my arms, lifting me up and impaling me on him. Then one arm goes around my chest and the other hand slides down to my clit. With each thrust, my br**sts bounce, causing a jolt of electricity to shoot from my ni**les to my clit. \u201cI need you to come, Sophie. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>Nico shouts his release, pulling off the clamps one at a time then slapping my clit. The shock sends me over the edge and lights flash behind my closed eyelids. I can feel Nico deep inside me, his come filling me. We\u2019re both breathing heavily as he leans us forward, falling into the bed with him behind me, wrapping himself around me.</p><p>\u201cThat was wow,\u201d I say once I can talk.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was wow.\u201d His lips travel up my neck to my ear. \u201cSo when are we getting married?\u201d he asks, pulling my hand up.</p><p>I look over my shoulder and see that his eyes are on the ring on my hand. \u201cWhenever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a big wedding?\u201d he asks, looking at my hand then me.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m okay with just getting the license then doing dinner or something.\u201d I don\u2019t want a big thing; I don\u2019t really have anyone I would invite besides Maggie and Devon.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care either. I just need you. The rest doesn\u2019t even matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we agree?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI do want it done before the baby gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a chore.\u201d I roll my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cBaby.\u201d He chuckles, kissing my shoulder again. This time, I bite my lip. My hormones are turning me into a crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Before the baby gets here,\u201d I agree before turning around to face him. \u201cI\u2019m so sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you cleaned up so you can sleep.\u201d</p><p>I watch as he walks into the bathroom of the hotel room. I hear the water running, and then he comes back to me and gently cleans between my legs before tossing the washcloth towards the bathroom. I lean over and turn off the lamp as he gets into bed, pulling me into him and the blanket over us.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I whisper, cuddling deeper into his side.</p><p>\u201cYou too, baby. Sweet dreams.\u201d He kisses my forehead, and before I can reply, I\u2019m asleep.</p><p>I unlock the front door and run to the phone, trying to reach it before the answering machine picks up. \u201cHello?\u201d I breathe when I finally get it to my ear. Tossing my bag on the counter, I unhook the rest of the shopping bags from my arms.</p><p>\u201cThis is a collect call from Seattle Correctional Facility from inmate\u201d\u2014the automated voice clicks off and a man\u2019s voice comes on the line\u2014\u201cWilliam Grates.\u201d Then it\u2019s back to the automated voice. \u201cDo you accept this call?\u201d</p><p>I stand there, frozen. I can still remember the sound of his voice after all these years. It\u2019s like nothing has changed.</p><p>\u201cThis is a collect call from...\u201d the automated voice repeats itself.</p><p>It takes me a second to realize what the voice said\u2014Seattle Correctional Facility. My dad is in prison. I quickly slam the phone down into its cradle and take a few deep breaths. I can\u2019t talk to my dad now; there\u2019s just no way. Why the hell is he calling me, anyways? Better yet\u2014how the hell did he get this number? The phone starts ringing again and I have the urge to run away and hide.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you gonna get that?\u201d Nico asks, walking into the living room. Not having noticed that he\u2019s home, I jump and my hand goes to my chest, trying to calm my pounding heart. \u201cBabe, answer the phone,\u201d he says this time, walking towards me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no one, just a telemarketer.\u201d I lift the receiver then hang it back up.</p><p>\u201cWho was it, Sophie?\u201d His eyes narrow as he starts prowling towards me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no one. I already told you it\u2019s just a telemarketer.\u201d I walk into the kitchen to put away the groceries, praying the phone doesn\u2019t ring again.</p><p>\u201cI can tell by the look on your face that it was someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it.

His hands hold my face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how he found me,\u201d I tell him, closing my eyes. I have never seen him this mad.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can change the number,\u201d I tell him, laying my head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. I mean I know how he got this number.\u201d He picks me up, carrying me into the bedroom and crawling into the bed with me in his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask, reading his face.</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I heard the recording when he called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how I know.\u201d He runs his fingers through the hair at the side of my head. \u201cWhen you were attacked again, I had him looked into and found out he\u2019s in prison. I needed to see if he knew anything about what happened to you, so while we were in Seattle, I went and saw him.\u201d He pauses, looking down at me, studying my face. \u201cWhile I was there, your dad asked for my name. He knew that I lived in Tennessee. It wouldn\u2019t take him much to figure out how to find me and, in turn, find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think my dad had something to do with me getting attacked?\u201d I ask, skipping over everything else he just said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure, but now, no.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s he in there?\u201d I ask even though I don\u2019t know how I feel. Part of me cares, but then the other part\u2014the part that was abandoned by him\u2014doesn\u2019t care at all.</p><p>He lets out a long breath then pulls me up his body so I\u2019m lying on top of him before he rocks my world\u2014and not in the good way. \u201cYour dad\u2019s in prison for murder,\u201d he says, and my stomach rolls, making me hold my breath, praying for the nausea to pass. I can\u2019t imagine my dad killing anyone. Even when he was at his worse, he was never violent.</p><p>\u201cI feel sick.\u201d</p><p>His hand goes to my back, rubbing it in soothing strokes. \u201cI gotta tell you the rest, but I need you to know it has nothing to do with you,\u201d he warns.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, bracing myself.</p><p>\u201cYour dad killed the man who attacked you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I scream, trying to jump out of the bed.</p><p>\u201cBaby, calm down. This is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you,\u201d he growls, holding my wriggling body, which is trapped to his by his muscular, tattooed arms.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me to calm down! How can I calm down? My dad is a murder! He killed someone because of me! How is this not my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad made his own choices. This does not reflect on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be sick,\u201d I tell him, and this time, he must know that I really am going to be sick because he releases me immediately so I can run to the bathroom. I lean over the toilet, gagging.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe this. My dad is a murder.</p><p>\u201cTake some deep breaths for me,\u201d he says, laying a cool washcloth against the back of my neck.</p><p>I sit back on my calves and take a few deep breaths before he picks me up off the floor, carrying me back to the bed, tucking me in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I think you can tell me the rest now,\u201d I tell him, wanting to get this over with.</p><p>\u201cAfter I saw your dad, I did some research about what happened. I knew you would feel guilty about this, and I didn\u2019t want that for you.\u201d His arms wrap around me tighter, making me feel safe. \u201cWhen you left, your dad sobered up. He finally realized what he did\u2014or I guess, didn\u2019t do. The court documents say your dad started asking around about the guy who attacked you and found out you weren\u2019t his first victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d I close my eyes. I never even thought that what happened to me could have happened to someone else.</p><p>\u201cHe molested a girlfriend of his young daughter and then raped another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head not wanting to believe how really horrible that guy was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d He kisses my forehead, pulling me closer to him. \u201cYour father went to his house to confront him about what he had done. He said the guy attacked him first, but your dad had no wounds or anything that proved his claim. Your dad killed him.\u201d He pushes the hair away from my face, his lips going to my forehead again. \u201cI know you feel differently than I do. I\u2019ll be happy if our child has your kind of compassion, but I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead. He deserved what he got. Actually, he deserved a lot worse for the things he did.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead too. I\u2019m glad he isn\u2019t alive to hurt anyone else. I still feel guilty though. I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m crying until I feel Nico wiping the tears off my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry, baby,\u201d he says quietly, running his hands over my head.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s my dad calling?\u201d I wonder out loud.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll find out before he calls again.\u201d He rolls me to my back, his body leaning over me. \u201cYou know I love you, and there is nothing on this earth I wouldn\u2019t do for you. I would kill for you, walk through fire for you, and fight your demons if that\u2019s what you needed from me.\u201d He wipes my cheeks again before kissing me softly. \u201cThis is something I\u2019m going to need you to fight through with me though. I know it\u2019ll be hard for you, but I think it may help heal some of what he broke in you if you talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can. Why is he doing this now when before he couldn\u2019t care less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had someone checking on you while you were in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathe. I look into his eyes, and he nods then shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he had someone checking in on you, making sure you were okay, but then one day, you were just gone and he didn\u2019t know what happened to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay... I don\u2019t know how I feel about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was doing it so he had peace of mind.

He feels responsible for what happened to you, but he also feels guilty for your mother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d I look at him, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to.

I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to face my past, but I know that, as long as I have this man with me, I will be okay. I also know that, deep down, he is right; I need to face my past so I can move on to a future with Nico.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Nico</p><p>I look out the window of the nursery and rub my hands over my face. For the first time since I started doing what I do, I feel out of control. I got in early from a job today and went to meet Sophie for lunch. When I got out of my car to head into the building, I noticed a paper under her wiper blade. At first, I didn\u2019t think much about it. I wasn\u2019t even going to look at it until something in my gut told me to turn around and grab it. As soon as I opened the letter, my stomach dropped.</p> <p>After you have his baby, you\u2019re mine. I haven\u2019t forgotten about you.</p><p>The words were typed out on simple white copy paper. They were enough to send me into a rage and bring me to my knees all at once. I have no idea who had attacked her. I don\u2019t know how safe she is working at the school anymore. She already had to have someone stay with her when I was out of town for work. She hates feeling like she needs to be on guard. I have no idea what to do. I don\u2019t want her any more stressed out than she already is. Dealing with the situation with her dad already has her up late at night worrying. I don\u2019t want that for her, and I don\u2019t want that for my child. The fact she is now showing in her pregnancy is starting to freak me out. Not the showing part, but the part where she is very obviously carrying my child, there is someone after her, and they have been around her to know that she is pregnant.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d</p><p>I turn to look at her as she enters the room we chose for the nursery. She\u2019s so f**king beautiful that I have to ask myself, Why me? How did I get so lucky? Today, she has on a high-waisted skirt that ends right under her tits, and the fit of the skirt shows off her very rounded stomach and ends right above her knees. At only three and a half months, you would think she is farther along than she is with how large she is already. We still don\u2019t know what we\u2019re having. People have already been making bets, so we\u2019ve decided to keep it a surprise for D-day, as Asher always calls delivery day.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you know you\u2019re not supposed to be wearing those shoes.\u201d I shake my head as I watch her heels move across the carpet.</p><p>\u201cThese are not even that high,\u201d she defends, doing a one-leg lift to show off one of the shoes. They are tall. They bring her forehead up to my mouth. When she\u2019s barefooted, it reaches my chest. These are all lace with a long, wide heel. \u201cBesides, I think this is the last day of heels for me until the baby gets here anyways.\u201d She pouts then places one hand on my chest, lifting her foot behind her to slip off her shoe before doing the same with the other, causing her to shrink in height.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I rub her belly, loving the look of pregnancy on her. The first day I came in and saw her naked with the small bump that had formed overnight, I freaked, realizing that it\u2019s real. She really has my baby inside her.</p><p>\u201cMy feet are swelling today.\u201d She wraps her arms around my waist before laying her head on my chest.</p><p>\u201cNo more heels. They\u2019re not safe.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had this conversation. Talking to Sophie is like talking to a wall\u2014I tell her one thing and she agrees then does whatever the hell she wants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wearing heels forever. I\u2019m probably safer in heels than sneakers.\u201d She laughs, hugging me.</p><p>I hold her a little tighter, putting my lips to the top of her head. Our problems are a lot bigger than her wearing heels though. I hate not knowing who I\u2019m after. With my job, there is always a suspect. I always know exactly who I\u2019m looking for and what they are capable of. This situation is out of my hands, and that scares the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta talk, Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using my name, so that tells me it\u2019s something I won\u2019t want to talk about.\u201d She sighs.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby, but we gotta.\u201d I lead her out of the nursery and into the kitchen, where I carefully put her up on the counter. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, and you\u2019re the one who wanted to talk, so why are you avoiding it now?\u201d She watches me as I go to the freezer, pulling out a pizza before turning on the oven.</p><p>\u201cI found a note on your car today when I came to meet you for lunch.\u201d I go about taking the pizza out of the box before putting it on a pan.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d I run my hand over my head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you about this. If there was a way to keep this from you while keeping you safe, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she states, looking at my fist clenching and unclenching at my side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be scared. That\u2019s the last thing I want, but I would rather you be afraid and cautious than you not know what\u2019s going on, not pay attention to your surroundings, and then have something happen to you because you didn\u2019t know you were in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she prompts.</p><p>I walk back to her, fitting myself between her legs. I pull the copied note out of my back pocket to show her. I handed the original off to Kenton to take to Leo. I also checked with the school to see if they had any cameras on the premises, but they didn\u2019t have any. I still have no leads. The note has no prints besides mine from grabbing it from the windshield. I watch as Sophie reads the words and her face goes pale, and I see the worry etched in her eyes when they meet mine again.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s doing this?\u201d she asks, one hand covering her stomach, the other covering her mouth as tears begin to fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve asked myself that same question a million times and keep coming up with nothing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone here. I\u2019ve always kept to myself,\u201d she sobs, making me feel helpless.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, baby. I just don\u2019t know about you working at the school anymore. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe.\u201d I hold her until her tears start to die down.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m letting whoever\u2019s doing this win by quitting, but I know I can\u2019t work there and feel safe. I hope this ends soon. I don\u2019t want to have the baby and be looking over my shoulder every time I leave the house.\u201d</p><p>I wipe her face, kissing each of her eyelids before taking the note from her and putting it back in my pocket. \u201cI hate this for you, but things are going to have to change until I find out who it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you need me to do,\u201d she says, and in those few words, I know how much faith she has in me. Her faith alone makes me want to fight that much harder to end this.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, when I\u2019m out of town, you\u2019re gonna stay with Mom and Dad, and tomorrow, we\u2019re going to get you a gun and I\u2019m gonna teach you how to shoot.\u201d I put my mouth to her forehead, kissing her before looking into her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think it\u2019s necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I need to know you can take care of yourself. Your self-defense moves aren\u2019t going to be as helpful when you\u2019ve got a belly to contend with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I need to stay at your parents\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. The person has proven that he knows where you lived and now where you work. Who knows if he\u2019s figured out that you now live here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this, but okay,\u201d she agrees reluctantly.</p><p>I hate that she is being forced to change her life while whoever is doing this is out there living normally and probably getting off on her being afraid. But I\u2019m stuck. I cant risk something happing to her.</p><p>I kiss her forehead again then try to make her forget about everything by turning off the oven and carrying her upstairs, where I make love to her until we both fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cAim to kill, baby,\u201d I tell Sophie as I wrap my arms around her and help her line up the shot. \u201cI want you to take a deep breath, and when you let it out, I want you to squeeze the trigger, not pull it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she says shakily.</p> <p>I listen as she takes a deep breath, letting it out slowly. Her hand steadies, and she lets off three rounds, one after another, all hitting near the center of the target. Her aim is nearly perfect for someone who has never even held a gun until today. I hit the button, bringing the target closer so she can she what she did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural,\u201d I tell her with pride etching my voice.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks, setting the gun down before turning to me.</p><p>\u201cReally. Look at what you did. All three of your rounds are near the center of the bull\u2019s-eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is kinda fun.\u201d She laughs, and suddenly her eyes go wide and she grabs my hand, pulling it to her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask in a panic, and then I feel the slight movement under my palm. I immediately fall to my knees in front of her, both hands holding her stomach. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d I choke out, looking up into Sophie\u2019s beautiful, glowing face then back down to where my tattooed hands are in stark contrast to her white maternity dress.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispers, dragging my hands around her stomach so I can feel the baby moving. \u201cThe shooting must\u2019ve woken her up.\u201d</p><p>I nod then shake my head. I never thought this would be something I would experience. I look up at her again, seeing her beaming down at me. Her hair is braided back away from her makeup-free face, but little pieces have come loose and are flying around her in the wind.</p> <p>\u201cCan I shoot again?\u201d she asks, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cI was having a moment...and you want to shoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was fun.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and kiss her belly once before standing. \u201cAll right. This time, I want you to aim at the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d she says with confidence, giving me an instant hard-on.</p><p>She refused to get a gun at first...until she saw a white Ruger LCP .380 with pink flowers all over it. I almost refused to let her get it\u2014no gun should have flowers on it\u2014but I figured that, if she was carrying it and it could kill someone if she was in danger, I didn\u2019t care what it looked like.</p><p>I press the button on the machine, sending the target back out. I put my arms around her again, this time resting on her belly. With every shot, she makes the baby move inside her, making her laugh and miss the target the first three times. I reload her gun, giving her advice on how to focus before sending a new target out with instructions that I want two in the head and three in the heart. This time, she focuses and hits her target with ease.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, baby.\u201d I kiss her temple. Knowing that she can shoot has some of my stress easing.</p><p>\u201cMaybe when the baby gets here, I can work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s never gonna happen.\u201d I have a friend who works with his woman, but I can\u2019t imagine having Sophie with me on a job. I wouldn\u2019t be able to focus.</p><p>\u201cI could be your backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening,\u201d I state.</p><p>\u201cAww, come on. You said I was a great shot. I could dress like a ninja. I would be like your secret weapon. People would be like, \u2018Oh, we got Nico,\u2019 and then I would show up and take them out,\u201d she says, doing a strange-looking karate chop.</p><p>\u201cAs entertaining as that would be, it\u2019s still not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I guess I\u2019ll give up my dream.\u201d She sighs, making me laugh.</p><p>I take her hand and make our way out to my car. After I get her in the passenger\u2019s seat, I jog around and hop behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d I drive out of the parking lot before taking her hand in mine and pulling it to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to ask the doctor if he has any suggestions for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d She laughs.</p><p>\u201cVery funny, smartass, I\u2019m serious though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d I hear the humor in her voice, and it makes me smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the doctor\u2019s job to answer questions,\u201d I remind her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but when you call him at midnight to ask him if it\u2019s normal for me to have heartburn, I think that may be overkill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me to call if I had any questions. Besides, you ate a whole container of Tums in one night\u201d\u2014I look over at her\u2014\u201clike they were candy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me. That was not one of my crowning moments.\u201d She laughs. Then her voice goes quiet. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you won\u2019t be here for my appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, babe.\u201d I hear the regret in my own voice. I hate not being able to go with her, but after this job, I\u2019ll be taking some time off until the baby gets here.</p><p>In reality, the more I think about leaving Sophie and the baby after he or she gets here, the more I start hating my job. Leo told me the other day that they have a couple of spots opening up in his department. He could get me in if I wanted. My first thought was no, but then he explained that their captain lets them do their own thing as long as they\u2019re closing cases. Knowing that, if I took the job, I would no longer be going out of town and leaving her alone made me think harder about it. I want and need that. I hate the idea of her being home alone with a new baby. Yes, my family will be around, but it\u2019s not the same. I never want to miss out on important occasions with my family.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s gonna go with you so you won\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but it\u2019s not the same,\u201d she says, repeating my thought. It\u2019s crazy to think how much my life has changed since I first laid eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>We drive the rest of the way home in silence. When we reach the house, I pull into the garage and help Sophie out of the car before heading to the mailbox.</p><p>\u201cNico,\u201d Deb calls from two houses away, where she\u2019s outside watering her lawn.</p><p>I lift my chin then shake my head at her. I don\u2019t know how her husband puts up with her shit, but he\u2019s a better man than I am. If I ever found out that Sophie was outside watering the lawn and wearing practically nothing, I would go postal.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Deb,\u201d Sophie calls, waving at Deb, who gives a small wave back. She presses her tits into my arm before sticking her hand in my back pocket, leaning deeper into me.</p><p>I bite my cheek to keep from smiling. It\u2019s cute that she\u2019s protective, but she never has anything to worry about.</p><p>\u201cDid we get anything good?\u201d she asks innocently, looking at the stack of letters in my hand.</p><p>I shuffle through the mail then stop when I come across the letter Sophie has been waiting for. In a way, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s here as I\u2019m checking the mail. If I were on my own, I don\u2019t know if I would have given her the letter. Yes, I want her to work through her past, but it\u2019s engrained in me to protect her from anything that might potentially cause her pain.</p><p>\u201cHe wrote back,\u201d she whispers, looking from the letter to my eyes.</p><p>I put all the mail in one hand before cupping her cheek with the other. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to read it right now. You never have to read it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to.\u201d She swallows, leaning her head deeper into my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I need to see what he has to say so I can put it all behind me. I don\u2019t want this hanging over my head anymore, and I don\u2019t want to worry about it when the baby gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we read it then burn it, making it history.\u201d</p><p>She nods, not saying anything.</p><p>Running my thumb over her jaw, I lean in and kiss her once before tucking her under my arm to lead her inside. Once I get Sophie situated out on the back patio with a glass of tea, I go get a lighter and my metal trash can from the garage and take them out with me. I hand her the letter before pulling her onto my lap. Her hands start to shake as she rips the envelope open, and I watch as she pulls the letter out, unfolding it.</p><p>Dear Sophie,</p><p>I don\u2019t even know where to start. I got the letter from Nico after I tried to phone you. I understand why you didn\u2019t want to talk to me, but I wish I could hear your voice. Maybe one day, we can talk and I can hear for myself that you are well and happy. I know from your boyfriend that you have become successful and are leading a life that would make your mother proud. She was always proud of you. You were the most important thing in her life, and I know her death was hard on you. I wish I could explain to you the reasons I did what I did, but there is no excuse that will justify my actions and the way I neglected you when you needed me. Your mom would hate me if she knew what happened after her death. I regret few things in my life, but my treatment of you is something I will regret until the day I die. I'm sorry.</p><p>I know it would be nearly impossible for you to forgive me, but if you could find it in yourself to offer me a few words every now and then, I would enjoy that. Your boyfriend is very different from anyone I thought you would end up with, but he seems to love you and to be very protective, and even though it's not my right as your father, I couldn't ask for more. Your mother would have been thrilled that you found someone who obviously loves you so deeply. I love you, Sophie. I know I didn\u2019t show it when I should have, but there isn\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think about you and the woman you have become. I wish I could have been a better father to you. I just didn\u2019t know how to do that after your mom died. I\u2019m so sorry.</p><p>I hope this letter finds you happy.</p> <p>Love,</p><p>Dad</p><p>I pull a sobbing Sophie into my chest, rocking her back and forth like a child, trying to offer her some comfort. After reading that letter, I hope she will be able to find some closure.</p><p>\u201cI got you, babe,\u201d I shush her, rubbing her back.</p><p>When the sobs racking her body start to die down, I pull her face out of my chest, taking a second to look at her. Even with her face splotchy with tears, she\u2019s beautiful.</p><p>\u201cI know that was difficult, but how are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorn,\u201d she says quietly, grabbing my wrist. \u201cI feel like I want to talk to him. He\u2019s the only connection I have to my mom. I feel sad that it took him so long to realize what he had, and the other part of me hates him for not being there for me when I needed him. That\u2019s the part I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t want to hate him. My mom loved him. They were so in love that, even as young as I was, I could see their love was the kind that would never die. When I was young, my dad would come home from work and walk into the house, and the first thing he would do was go to my mom and kiss her, even if I was waiting by the door for him. Then he would come and pick me up.\u201d I don\u2019t tell her that that\u2019s f**ked up. Our kids will be just as important as her. \u201cWhen my mom died, I felt like my connection with him died too.\u201d Yep, totally f**ked up. \u201cI think I need time to think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have all the time you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for being here with me.\u201d She does a face-plant back into my chest, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cNowhere else I would want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I told you I used to want a tattoo?\u201d she asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I run my hand down her back, holding her tighter against me.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad had my mom\u2019s name tattooed along his ribs. I wanted that, only with my husband\u2019s name, but then I lost my mom. And not long after that, I lost my dad, and I stopped believing love could last. Now I know it can. After I have this baby, I want a tattoo like that of your name along my ribs. I belong to you\u2014will always belong to you. You brought me back to life.\u201d She lifts her head to look at me. Her finger runs along my jaw then up to trace my bottom lip.</p><p>I can\u2019t talk with the emotions choking me, so I pull her in for a deep kiss, gently pressing one hand to her stomach. After I find my voice again, I tell her, \u201cIf you want that, baby, I\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing in this world I wouldn\u2019t do for you, sweet Sophie.\u201d I pull her closer to me and smile into her hair, thinking about my name being tattooed onto her perfect skin.</p><p>\u201cYou sure he\u2019s here?\u201d I ask Kenton, looking at the run-down house across the street from us.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. When Ian called, he told me that Justin found a hit on his credit card. The stupid f**k ordered shit from Amazon and had it deliver here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the f**k did he run drugs without being caught for so long?\u201d I shake my head. I swear I don\u2019t know how most criminals are able to get away with the shit they do. Half of them are dumb as f**k.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he was the one in charge,\u201d Kenton says, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cSo what do the cops say about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think his partners are turning on him. They want to offer him a deal, but they haven\u2019t been able to track him. You know they always have too much red tape when it comes to this shit. Their hands are tied, so they want us convince him that he needs to come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I look across the street again, seeing that the only light on is the one in the basement.</p> <p>\u201cWe go in and do just that\u2014use the power of persuasion to convince him to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t agree?\u201d I ask with a smile, knowing what the answer will be.</p><p>\u201cBy the time we leave him, he will be running to the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I nod. What I do isn\u2019t always smiled upon, but knowing that one more f**ked-up criminal will be off the streets before my child comes into this world makes me feel that much better about doing what I have to do. \u201cLets roll.\u201d</p><p>I open the door to my car, getting out at the same time Kenton does. We don\u2019t even bother with the front door. We walk around the side of the house, checking windows until one opens. Kenton goes in first and I follow behind him when he gives me the signal that it\u2019s clear. After that, we search the house, making sure that no one else is inside. By the time we make it to the basement Meyer Bulger is in the middle of getting a blowjob. The chick that was sucking him off runs out of the room screaming when she sees me. I let her go, knowing that she was paid for her time and is not likely to get involved.</p><p>\u201cMeyer,\u201d Kenton says, sitting down casually across from the guy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he finally asks, his eyes are glossed over from the cocaine he was shoving up his nose.</p><p>\u201cWe came to have a chat,\u201d I tell him, setting my gun down on the table in front of me. His eyes go wide and his hand moves to the left. \u201cTry it and I will put a bullet in you.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes search my face, and I know that he can tell that I\u2019m not f**king around. His hand that had been reaching for his piece moves back to his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asks, looking between Kenton and me.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Kenton says with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what it means, Meyer.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a snitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re dead,\u201d I tell him, starting to stand.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand.\u201d I look him over. \u201cI can see it now. You probably started using your own product when no one was watching. Eventually your addiction caught up with you and you couldn\u2019t get enough. When that happened, you started f**king up, and the people at the top of the food chain didn\u2019t like that much. Now they want you dead. So tell me. What\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know if I talk to the cops I\u2019m signing my death warrant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a better chance of surviving if you work with the cops,\u201d Kenton tells him.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He shakes his head, his eyes falling to his lap, and just like that, I know we won.</p><p>I look at Kenton and smile, ready to get the f**k home to my girl.</p><p>\"Ma, we\u2019re not moving,\" I state firmly then watch Sophie's bottom lip wobble. Fuck, I hate when she cries, and she cries about everything lately. \u201cBaby, please don\u2019t cry.\u201d I pull her into my side, kissing her head.</p><p>\"I always wanted to live in the country, and the money from selling my house can buy it. Please just look at it before you say no,\u201d she says, looking up at me with tears filling her eyes.</p><p>\"You\u2019re not buying our house.\" I look at the ceiling, praying for patience. \"Ma, do you see the trouble you\u2019re causing?\" I narrow my eyes on my mom. \u201cI leave my girl with you for three days, and this is what you do?\u201d</p><p>\"Your mom\u2019s not causing trouble.\" Sophie sighs, looking at my mom then me</p><p>. I see something pass between them. \"What?\" I look at my mom and then back to her.</p><p>\"I have something to tell you,\" Sophie says, biting her bottom lip while avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\"What?\" I repeat.</p><p>\"I think you should sit,\" she says, wringing her hands together.</p><p>\"I don't need to sit. Is it about the baby?\" I ask, feeling sick all of a sudden.</p><p>\"I really think you should sit, honey,\u201d my mom says quietly, causing me to panic.</p><p>\"Tell me,\" I growl.</p><p>\"We're having twins,\" Sophie blurts then covers her mouth, looking at my mom with wide eyes.</p><p>I stare at her blankly for a minute. I don\u2019t make her repeat herself; I heard her loud and clear. \"I need to sit,\" I mumble, walking over to the couch where I plop, putting my head between my knees. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d I wonder out loud. Hearing my mom laugh, I lift my head to glare at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen,\u201d Mom sings, walking off.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Sophie asks, coming to sit next to me and running her hand down my back.</p><p>I sit back, pulling her into my lap to run my hand over her stomach. I can\u2019t believe this; it\u2019s like hitting the kid lotto.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay with this, right?\u201d she asks, and I realize I haven\u2019t spoken to her; I\u2019ve just been staring at her stomach, running my hands over her large bump.</p> <p>\u201cShocked as hell.\u201d I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cWe\u2019re having twins.\u201d I smile then feel it fall from my face. \u201cThey\u2019re both okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said they\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we just finding this out?\u201d I rub her stomach again, amazed that two babies are growing in there. I can\u2019t imagine how large her stomach will be when it comes time for her to give birth. She\u2019s so tiny, and her stomach is already large at just four months along.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor wasn\u2019t sure why the other baby didn\u2019t show before now, but he was suspicious when I told him we could feel him or her moving already, so he did an ultrasound to see what was going on. That\u2019s when we saw that there were two of them, and he assured me that everything\u2019s fine,\u201d she explains with a beautiful smile that lights up her whole face.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to move?\u201d I pull her head down to lay against my chest. I love the townhouse, but I can\u2019t see us raising our kids there. The neighborhood is mainly single people and couples with no children.</p> <p>\u201cI know you love your place, but I want my kids to grow up close to family. Well, your family, anyways,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your family now too, and my place is always your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I can hear the smile and tears in her voice, so I pull her face away so I can look at her. \u201cAll right, baby. We\u2019re gonna have to move anyways. One baby would be okay in our place now, but two would be pushing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks happily.</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, sweet Sophie,\u201d I tell her, watching in fascination as she laughs and cries all at the same time.</p> <p>Chapter 13</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much has changed. I mean, you got married, you are not only pregnant but you\u2019re having twins, and now you\u2019re moving into a new house,\u201d Maggie says, coming to sit down next to me on the couch. \u201cI should have guessed that you\u2019re having twins though. You\u2019re really frickin\u2019 huge,\u201d she says, rubbing my large belly.</p><p>I know she doesn\u2019t mean it in a bad way, but her words hit me wrong and I start to cry. My boobs are giant, my belly is so big that I can\u2019t even see my feet, and my legs are swollen and probably hairy.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d she asks, looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. I probably am crazy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big, fat, hairy beast,\u201d I tell her on a sob.</p><p>\u201cOh God, you\u2019re so dramatic.\u201d She laughs, making me cry harder.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s my wife crying, Maggie?\u201d Nico growls, walking into the house, Devon following close behind him, carrying a box.</p> <p>We\u2019re in the process of moving from the townhouse to our new country home. The process took longer than we\u2019d planned. The house was a short sale. The bank took two months to get back to us that they had accepted our offer.</p><p>I wipe my face, trying to get rid of the tears; I don\u2019t want Nico to see me cry. He\u2019s so amazing and supportive while I\u2019m horrible with my constant complaining and crying. I start crying harder as I think about what a bad wife I am.</p><p>\u201cGeez, girl. You need to calm down. We can shave your legs if it\u2019s bothering you that much.\u201d Maggie rolls her eyes, handing me another tissue. I blow my nose then look up when I see a shadow fall over me.</p><p>\u201cYou know I hate to see you cry,\u201d Nico says softly, putting one hand on the armrest of the couch and the other on my neck. \u201cIf Maggie\u2019s the reason you\u2019re crying I\u2019m gonna make Maggie leave,\u201d he says, making my eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cIf you try to make my friend leave, I\u2019ll leave with her.\u201d</p><p>I watch as one side of his mouth quirks up before he replies, \u201cYou can\u2019t. You have two of my kids growing inside you. So basically, your body is half mine until you\u2019re no longer pregnant. Not only that, you have my last name, meaning I own you.\u201d He smirks.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I hear Maggie say from beside me. She doesn\u2019t sound pissed, which is surprising.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that to me,\u201d I tell him, ignoring Maggie.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really cannot believe you just said that,\u201d I hiss, glaring at him.</p><p>\u201cWould rather have you mad than crying,\u201d he says before leaning forward, kissing me until I can\u2019t breathe, and then standing and leaving the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what just happened, but that was hot. So hot that I want to drag Devon into your spare bedroom,\u201d Maggie says, and I look over to see her leaning back, fanning herself.</p><p>\u201cHe just did that so I would stop crying,\u201d I tell her in shock.</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d she agrees, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s crazy.\u201d I grin back at her.</p><p>\u201cCrazy hot.\u201d Maggie giggles, and I look at her in shock; I have never in my life heard her do that.</p><p>\u201cDid you just giggle?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Her eyes get big. \u201cHoly shit, I f**king giggled. What the hell is wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but you should get that checked out,\u201d I tell her with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cYour man turned me into a giggling school girl.\u201d She sighs, laying her head back against the couch, a large smile on her face.</p><p>I smile and then look around our new home. The house is a newer two-story brick home with a location perfect for being close to family. Our new living room is much larger than the townhouse\u2019s, with dark bamboo floors, tall vaulted ceilings, and large windows that look out to the forest behind the house. The kitchen is also large and has all new appliances, with a large island that can seat five barstools. Next to the kitchen is a small dining room that was built into a rounded section of the house that is surrounded by floor-to-ceiling bay windows.</p><p>I love this house. I love that the backyard is huge and already has a play set for kids. I love that all the bedrooms are on the second floor so we won\u2019t have to be separated from the babies when they get here. What I really love is that Nico loves it as much as I do. I know he loved his townhouse and his neighbors, but when he walked into our new house for the first time with me, I could see it on his face that he loved it. Or maybe he just loved the fact that he\u2019d have a three-car garage and two of his brothers as our neighbors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAunt Sophie!\u201d I hear yelled in time to see July running into the living room, carrying a very annoyed Daisy in her arms.</p><p>\u201cHey, honey.\u201d I sit forward on the couch as she runs to me.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nico said you\u2019re getting another puppy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, did he?\u201d I look over at Maggie, who shrugs her shoulders.</p> <p>Nico hasn\u2019t said anything to me about getting another dog, but with him, I never know what\u2019s going to happen. He never even told me he wasn\u2019t going to be working for Kenton anymore or that he was taking a job with the MNPD working with Leo until he had to be gone for a week to do some training and testing. When I first found out, I was upset; I didn\u2019t want him to change jobs because of me. Then he sat me down and explained that, with the babies coming, he didn\u2019t think he would be able to handle being away all the time, and taking the job with Leo meant he would have more stability. I told him that was good, but if he didn\u2019t like it, he should go back to working for Kenton.</p><p>\u201cYes, but Daisy\u2019s still my favorite,\u201d July says, and I laugh as she pulls a wiggling Daisy up to her face to talk to her. \u201cYou will always be my favorite. You\u2019re so cute and small and fluffy,\u201d she tells the Pomeranian before bringing her down to her chest for a hug. Poor Daisy looks like her eyes are going to pop out of her head, making me wince.</p><p>\u201cHoney, why don\u2019t you let Daisy down for a bit and go wash your hands? Maybe we can make some sandwiches for everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Nico ordered pizza,\u201d she says, holding Daisy tighter against her, making her squirm.</p><p>\u201cDaisy may need to pee.\u201d</p> <p>I guess those are the magic words, because she immediately puts the dog down. I watch as Daisy jumps off the couch, quickly running away, probably trying to find somewhere to hide.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to pee on me. May peed on me one time when I was holding her, and that was gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is gross.\u201d I laugh at the squeamish look on her cute little face.</p><p>\u201cNow that you live here, can we have more sleepovers?\u201d she asks, looking around.</p><p>\u201cWe can.\u201d I don\u2019t tell her that it won\u2019t be for, like, ten years. She doesn\u2019t need to know that. I\u2019m still trying to recover from the last sleepover we had.</p><p>\u201cGood! The last one was so much fun!\u201d</p> <p>I smile and shake my head. Having six kids over for a sleepover was insane, and not something I want to repeat anytime soon. The first couple of hours were fine, but then it came time for bed and none of them wanted to sleep, except Jax, who was hanging with his uncle most of the time. Then there was a lot of crying. We had to take all of the kids home at around two in the morning, so it really wasn\u2019t a sleepover; it was more like an extended visit. I love them all, but I won\u2019t be doing that again for a long time.</p><p>\u201cUncle Nico,\u201d July says as soon as she sees him walking into the room carrying a box, \u201cAunt Sophie said we can have a sleepover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d he asks, smiling at her. I bite back my smile when his eyes come to me and narrow slightly.</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the babies are born, we will talk about it,\u201d he tells her, carrying the box somewhere into the house and getting out of Dodge.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your sisters, honey?\u201d I ask her before trying to stand.</p><p>\u201cOutside with the other kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You go get them and bring them in here. When all of you wash your hands, we can get you guys some juice for when the pizza gets here,\u201d I tell July, and she runs off. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go check on Nico,\u201d I say, looking at Maggie, who is lying on the couch with her eyes closed.</p> <p>\u201cSure, whatever. Leave me to my dirty fantasies about your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d I laugh, leaving the room. When I get to the office, Nico\u2019s there with his back to me, putting something up on one of the shelves built into the walls.</p><p>\u201cWe are not having a sleepover,\u201d he says without even turning around.</p><p>\u201cI agree\u2014no sleepovers.\u201d I walk behind him, wrapping my arms around his waist, laying my head against his back.</p><p>\u201cI set up the bed in our room. Why don\u2019t you go lay down for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>I look over his shoulder to see what he\u2019s putting on the shelf and see the picture of us on our wedding day. We\u2019re both in profile. I\u2019m in my dress, standing in front of him in his suit. My head\u2019s bending forward, my forehead pressed to his chest, his lips on the back of my head. Both of us have our hands on my belly. Every time I look at that picture, all I remember is how loved I felt right then. We had just walked down the aisle after saying our \u2018I do\u2019s.\u2019 Through the whole ceremony, the babies had been going crazy, so I\u2019d stopped Nico at the end of the aisle and pulled his hands forward, splaying them on my belly. He had said something sweet, making me lean into him, and I could feel his mouth on the back of my head where he kissed me.</p><p>With the way the picture was taken, you can\u2019t really make out our features, but out of all of our wedding pictures, it\u2019s my favorite. I never would have thought I\u2019d want a big wedding, but the minute I saw my wedding dress through the shop\u2019s window, I knew I needed to have one so I could wear that dress; it would have been a sin to waste it on a courthouse wedding. The dress was white\u2014so white that, if you looked at it in the sun, you might go blind. The top had slim sleeves that hung off my shoulders, and the waist was taken in with a simple white ribbon tied under my br**sts, showing off my baby bump. It was perfect.</p><p>After I found that dress, everything else fell into place. All the Mayson women were more than happy to help plan everything. We decided to have the wedding in November and Asher\u2019s backyard. The boys built a bridge over the pool with a perfectly placed altar in the middle, and the colors were pale yellow and cream. Nothing was like anything we\u2019d planned all those months before while we\u2019d lain in bed. We had over a hundred guests, most of them I didn\u2019t know, but all of those people there to see Nico and me get married, and that made it that much more perfect. We had a huge three-course dinner and a six-tier cake for dessert. That night, I learned that my new husband loved to dance. Every chance he got, he dragged me out onto the dance floor to hold me close through every slow song.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you really need to rest. It\u2019s not good for you to be on your feet for so long,\u201d Nico says, bringing me back to the present.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been resting all day,\u201d I tell him as he turns around to face me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damn stubborn.\u201d He shakes his head but looks at me lovingly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d I smile, looking up into his eyes. \u201cJuly said you ordered pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.

He knows this because he does at least one late-night grocery run every week.</p><p>\u201cMy boys are going to be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even going to argue with you. As you know, they could be girls. Two girls,\u201d I taunt him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re only allowed to give me one girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re going to allow me to give you one girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Just one,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAll right, but don\u2019t come crying to me if these are both girls,\u201d I say with a smirk and rub my belly.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re all healthy at the end of the day, I don\u2019t really care what they are,\u201d he confesses softly.</p><p>\u201cGood answer.\u201d I go up on my tiptoes while pulling his mouth down for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cEwww! Gross,\u201d I hear from behind me. I turn my head to see Jax looking at us. \u201cPizza\u2019s here,\u201d he says before running off. I giggle, turning back to face Nico.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t wait until Cobi gets big. He hates being the only boy old enough to voice his opinion on how gross girls are,\u201d Nico says.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to remind him about how gross girls are in about fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. Now, do I need to give you something to help you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d I question innocently, getting as close as my belly will allow.</p><p>\u201cWhen is everyone leaving?\u201d he growls, nipping my neck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. How much longer until we\u2019re all moved?\u201d I tilt my head while grabbing a handful of his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe have one more load.\u201d He licks up my neck, kissing below my ear. \u201cI need everyone gone so I can be inside you.\u201d</p><p>It still surprises me that he wants me as much as he does, even with how pregnant I am. He never makes me feel like I\u2019m unattractive; if anything, I feel like he wants me even more.</p> <p>\u201cI need you,\u201d I moan, shoving my face into his chest, my hands fisting his shirt.</p><p>His hands go to mine, pulling them away before leaving me standing there, watching as he walks to the door. Then he shuts and locks it before coming back to me and helping me up on the desk. When he\u2019s done with me, I\u2019m starving and ready for a nap.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a good idea?\u201d I look at the giant dog Nico just brought home.</p><p>Daisy\u2019s excited about him, and he seems like he\u2019s tolerating Daisy, but I\u2019m not so sure. He\u2019s huge; his head comes up to my waist when he\u2019s on all fours. I have never been afraid of dogs, but he puts some fear in me.</p><p>\u201cDanes are good dogs. They\u2019re loyal and very smart,\u201d he says from where he sits on the couch.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you even get him from?\u201d I back up when the dog starts to come towards me.</p><p>\u201cBaby, do you honestly think I would ever bring a dog into our home if I didn\u2019t know for certain you and our babies would be safe with him around?\u201d Nico asks, watching me and the dog closely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust you... It\u2019s just... He\u2019s so big that my head can fit in his mouth. Daisy can fit in his mouth! I love Daisy. I don\u2019t want to look for her one day then a couple hours later have him go outside to do his business and his business is a ball of fur that was once my Daisy.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, and the dog takes another step towards me, forcing me to take another step back. \u201cBaby, he isn\u2019t going to eat Daisy. He doesn\u2019t even notice her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now, but what happens when we\u2019re not home and they\u2019re alone together?\u201d I ask, watching as Daisy runs in and out from between the big dog\u2019s legs then jumps up and down, trying to get him to play with her. \u201cOkay, so maybe they\u2019ll be okay, but I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, Sophie.\u201d Nico holds out his hand in my direction. I scoot around the dog before taking his hand so he can pull me onto his lap.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m getting too big to sit on your lap,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He kisses the side of my head. \u201cNow come here, Goose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoose?\u201d I repeat quietly, watching the dog come towards us. \u201cWhat kind of name is Goose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoose is his name because he\u2019s as white as a goose.\u201d</p><p>He is white\u2014pure white, with one black ear, a pink nose, and blue eyes. Nico holds my hand out for him to smell. I have been around Asher and November\u2019s Beast a few times. He\u2019s a nice dog, great with all the kids, and very protective. He\u2019s just so big. I always try to avoid him.</p><p>\u201cRelax, babe. He\u2019s a good dog.\u201d</p><p>I un-ball my fist, cautiously holding my hand out to him. His cold, wet nose touches my palm, and then his tongue runs over my skin. Daisy jumps on the couch so she can get closer to Goose, and once she\u2019s in front of him, she starts licking his face and barking, trying jump on him. He pushes her out of the way with his head, forcing her to the side so he can lay his head on my lap. His nose goes to my stomach, and I wonder if he smells the babies. Daisy\u2019s still going crazy trying to get his attention, but he just ignores her, pressing himself even closer to me so I\u2019ll pet him.</p><p>\u201cThe best part is he\u2019s already house broken, and he\u2019s full grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d I ask, starting to relax and enjoy the comforting feeling of his big, warm head against me.</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine who\u2019s in the military is getting ready to go overseas and can\u2019t take him with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to have to give him back in a couple years?\u201d I wonder out loud, not liking the idea of getting attached to him and then having him taken away in a few years when his owner comes back.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe. He\u2019s ours permanently,\u201d Nico assures me.</p><p>I laugh as he rubs his big head against my stomach, wanting me to pay attention to him. \u201cOkay, so he\u2019s kinda cute,\u201d I finally agree.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s well trained. That\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not still worried, are you?\u201d I ask. Since moving, I never even think about what happened at my old house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI will be worried until we find out who the person behind what happened to you is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing has happened in forever.

It\u2019s gonna be a full house.\u201d</p><p>I sit down in the glider that was just delivered for the babies\u2019 room and tap my pen on the paper in my lap. I need to reply to my dad\u2019s letter. I\u2019ve been putting it off for a long time, trying to figure out what I want to say, what I really want our relationship to be like, or if I even want a relationship with him at all. The closer my due date gets, the more I think about my babies having their grandfather\u2014not just Nico\u2019s dad, but my dad as well\u2014at least in some capacity. I know it\u2019s what my mother would have wanted. I look down at the paper again, wondering how to even start the letter off. Do I write Dear Dad, or do I write his name? Why does this have to be so difficult?</p> <p>\u201cWhatcha doing in here?\u201d I look up when I hear Nico\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I ask him, lost in the way he looks. His torso is covered in sweat, his tattoos even more pronounced from the sun shining into the room, his body looking bigger than it used to for some reason.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, baby?\u201d he repeats.</p><p>\u201cTrying to write my dad,\u201d I mumble out, my eyes locked on the V of his hips. \u201cDid you have a good workout?\u201d I look up when I hear him laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, the look on your face makes me think you didn\u2019t get enough this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I smile. I\u2019m not really sorry; my hormones are insane. I want him all the time, but the part that sucks is that we are forced to only use a couple of different positions with how large I have gotten.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Come shower with me.\u201d He bends over me, his body caging me in with an arm on each side of the chair.</p><p>\u201cI really need to write him. I keep putting it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can write when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been ready. I just don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t even know how to address the letter. I mean, do I say, \u2018Dear Dad,\u2019 or something else?\u201d I sigh, leaning my head back against the chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you feel like addressing him as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad... I don\u2019t know.\u201d I close my eyes and then open them when his lips touch my forehead. \u201cHe\u2019s my dad, even if he didn\u2019t act like one, but after everything that\u2019s happened...I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou address him and talk to him about anything,\u201d he says softly, his words spoken against my skin. \u201cHe\u2019ll be happy to hear from you, no matter what you say.\u201d He kisses my forehead again and then my lips before running a finger down my cheek and leaving the room.</p><p>I watch the spot he just left for a long moment before putting my pen to the paper for the hundredth time.</p> <p>Dear Dad,</p><p>How are you? This is awkward, and I don\u2019t really know what to say, but as Nico told me once, awkward is okay as long as you don\u2019t feel uncomfortable. I don\u2019t feel uncomfortable. I feel like this is something I have needed to do for a long time. I have thought about your letter a lot since I read it. I have been trying to understand where you were coming from and what you must have been going through after Mom passed away. Now that I have Nico, I can\u2019t imagine him being taken away from me without warning. I pray I never have to go through something like that.</p><p>I wish I could say I forgive you for everything, and hopefully, with time, I\u2019ll find a way to do that. I want you to know your grandkids. Nico and I are expecting twins. We don\u2019t know the sexes yet because we want to be surprised when they get here. Everyone has been making bets since we found out we were pregnant. I think they are both girls, but Nico swears they are boys, but I can tell he really wants at least one girl. I know he is going to be a great dad. His family is amazing. His parents are very supportive and loving, and they have accepted me as I am. He has three brothers, and each of them is married and has kids of their own. I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m saying these things to upset you. That\u2019s not what this is. Honestly, before Nico, I had Maggie, Devon, and a few other friends, but now my life is full and I\u2019m happy.</p><p>Nico also just bought us a beautiful home in the country\u2014a house Mom would have loved. I sometimes sit out on the front porch at sunset and read. I hope when the babies get here I can sit outside and read to them like Mom used to read to me. I wish I had some of the photos of us so I could show them my side of the family when they get older.</p><p>Well, I don\u2019t know how to end this letter, but I hope you are okay and that when you read this, it brings you some kind of happiness.</p><p>XOXO,</p><p>Sophie Mayson</p><p>I set the letter down on my lap and close my eyes. When they open, I look around the nursery at the light-grey walls Nico and his brothers painted last week. Then I look at the mural of a white tree with silver leaves his mom just painted. My gaze drifts over the two cribs that were added to the room two days ago, with a changing table between them. The room is beautiful and will be perfect for either sex once the babies get here. The room represents so much\u2014not only the start of our family, but also Nico\u2019s family, the love they have for each other, and what it means to have a real family. I smile and stand up, going in search of my husband and praying that I find him before he gets dressed.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Nico</p><p>\u201cCap\u2019 wants you to start,\u201d Leo says, and I sigh into the phone and look out from the patio into the backyard, where Goose and Daisy are playing. Well, Daisy is playing; Goose is just walking around while Daisy jumps in and out between his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, man. I hate leaving Sophie right now. She just reached the eighth-month mark, and the doctor said she could go into labor any time. Her doctor\u2019s appointments have moved to every week. They\u2019re concerned because she\u2019s already begun to dilate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could really use you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before\u2014Sophie\u2019s my priority,\u201d I remind him. When this whole thing started, I told everyone that I\u2019m not going to start working until after the babies are born and I know Sophie will be okay on her own with them.</p><p>\u201cI know. I just thought you would relax some after you moved,\u201d he confesses.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t relax. I still have no clue who was after her or if they still are. Now, with her due date getting closer, I\u2019ve gotten even more nervous. I swear I feel like I\u2019m constantly on edge. I know something\u2019s going to happen. I just don\u2019t know when or how to prepare for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anything happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d I rub my hand over my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably just nervous about becoming a dad. When Jenna had Lynn, I was a nervous wreck.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not nervous about becoming a dad; that\u2019s the one thing I never really worry about. I know that, with Sophie as my kids\u2019 mother, the rest will fall into place. Plus, I have a shitload experience with kids now. I\u2019m not nervous about having my own; I\u2019m ready for that, even knowing how much work it will be.</p> <p>\u201cHow are Jenna and Lynn?\u201d I forgot all about his fianc\u00e9e and daughter because he never talks about them.</p><p>\u201cJenna is a bitch and Lynn is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I thought you guys were getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I thought we were getting married too until I found out she was sleeping with her high school sweetheart behind my back,\u201d he growls into the phone.</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up. She did that?\u201d I knew Jenna had a tendency to act like my old neighbor Deb, but I never imagined her cheating.</p><p>\u201cShe did. And had been doing it for about six months when I found out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean why didn\u2019t I tell everyone my ex-fianc\u00e9e was having an affair when she was supposed to be at work? I felt like an idiot, and when I caught on to what was happening, she blamed me and my job, saying I wasn\u2019t around when she needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell him, rubbing the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m glad I found that shit out before I gave her my last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, man. How are things with Lynn? She\u2019s what, three now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I would be pissed I wasted so much time on her mother. That\u2019s why I\u2019m tellin\u2019 you Sophie\u2019s safe. You\u2019re just nervous about having not only one, but two kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, man. You\u2019re a cop. You know that feeling you get in your gut when something is off. That\u2019s what I feel. It\u2019s not nerves.\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to do anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything anyone can do right now. That\u2019s the f**ked-up part. I have done all I can to make sure she is safe and that, even if I\u2019m not around, she will be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know if you need me I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. As soon as I know when I can start, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking forward to it. Everyone\u2019s excited to have Nico Mayson on board. Cap\u2019 wanted me to see about Kenton joining the team too, but I told him that shit was not gonna happen.\u201d He chuckles.</p><p>\u201cYeah, not happening, especially not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What\u2019s going on right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Kenton just doesn\u2019t like red tape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour cousin\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s not wrong; Kenton does his own thing and doesn\u2019t like anyone telling him when or how it should be done.</p><p>\u201cAll right, man. We\u2019ll talk soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. Talk to you soon.\u201d I hang up, watching Daisy and Goose for a few more minutes before heading inside to check on Sophie. I still have that feeling in my gut, and I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do to get rid of it, but I want it gone before my kids are born.</p><p>\u201cGoose, what the f**k?\u201d I yell, chasing him up the stairs to where Sophie is supposed to be taking a nap. The moment I get to the second floor and look down the hall towards our bedroom, I see the giant dog scraping the door, trying to get inside. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>I run to the door, swinging it open. Sophie\u2019s on the floor, her body wrapped around her belly. Her face is red and sweaty, and tears are running down her face onto the hardwood floors.</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d I get down on my knees in front of her, running a hand over her head.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong!\u201d she cries out, wrapping herself tighter around her belly.</p><p>\u201cAre you having contractions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I think there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d she cries harder, her body trembling. My first instinct is to pick her up and get her to the car, but something is off, and I don\u2019t want to make this worse for her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should move you,\u201d I tell her, grabbing the phone off the nightstand and dialing 911.</p><p>Once the dispatcher answers, I tell her what\u2019s going on. She tells me that I need to check Sophie over, so I lift the bottom of her nightgown up to her waist before helping her onto her back and pulling off her panties. I spread her legs and don\u2019t see the babies, so I take that as a good sign. I tell the woman on the phone that there is no blood or anything else I can see just as I hear sirens outside.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d Sophie screams, shoving her face into my lap, and then, without warning, I feel her teeth sink into the skin of my thigh. I grit my teeth, running a hand down her hair. Whatever pain I\u2019m feeling right now is nothing compared to what she\u2019s feeling.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get the door, babe,\u201d I tell her becoming more concerned.</p><p>Her face has paled, her breathing is more shallow, and her skin is now cool and damp. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but she whimpers when I stand to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Goose, come.\u201d I point to the floor where Sophie is. He whines, laying his head on top of her arms still wrapped around her waist.</p><p>I run down the stairs and throw the door open, not even bothering to make sure they\u2019re following before I run back up the stairs. \u201cMy wife is eight months pregnant and was laying down for a nap. I found her on the floor of our room, and she said she\u2019s having contractions, but something\u2019s wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d one of the EMTs says.</p><p>As soon as we enter the master bedroom, Goose stands up in front of Sophie and growls. I knew he was a good dog before that, but guarding my girl just earned him free rein\u2014especially since he\u2019s the reason I knew something was wrong to begin with.</p><p>\u201cGoose.\u201d I point to the floor next to the bed, and he immediately goes there to stand guard. The EMTs hurry over to Sophie. I kneel above her head, putting my lips on her forehead, telling her softly that everything will be okay.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get her to the hospital,\u201d one of them barks at his coworker.</p> <p>Everything is such a blur around me that I don\u2019t even have time to think before they\u2019re carrying her downstairs on a gurney. I see my dad\u2019s cruiser pull up as I\u2019m climbing into the back of the ambulance. He nods, letting me know that he will follow as the doors close behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask when there is a lull in activity.</p><p>The one carefully placing an IV in Sophie\u2019s arm looks at me, his face telling me more than I want to know right now. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure, but we think one of the babies\u2019 cords is tangled, and she\u2019s going to have to have an emergency C-section as soon as we get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>I look down at Sophie. She\u2019s the most important person in my life. I can\u2019t imagine something happening to her, and that thought alone scares me more than anything else. I nod at the EMT and hold her hand a little tighter, my other hand going to her belly and rubbing it once before closing my eyes. As soon as we arrive at the hospital and get her out of the ambulance, they run us down the hall towards an operating room that I hear a nurse say is already prepped and waiting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby. Everything\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I tell her, seeing her nod as tears begin to form in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d I repeat as the bottom of the gurney she\u2019s on slams through the door ahead of us.</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re not allowed past this point,\u201d a small woman wearing scrubs says, wrapping her hand around my arm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my wife and kids,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir. I\u2019m sorry, but until I get the okay from the doctor, you\u2019re not allowed,\u201d she says calmly.</p><p>\u201cGo get the f**king okay from him then. My wife is in there alone. I promised her\u2014\u201d I hear the break in my voice and try to swallow it down. Sophie\u2019s back there by herself and scared, and there is nothing I can do for her.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as they get her prepped for surgery, I will talk to the doctor. For now, why don\u2019t you come with me and get changed. That way, you\u2019re ready if you\u2019re allowed to be with her.\u201d I immediately follow the nurse into another room, where she hands me a stack of clothes. \u201cJust put these on and I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes,\u201d she says quietly.</p> <p>I jerk up my chin and start pulling on the baggie scrubs over my clothes and then slip the shoe covers over my boots before taking a seat. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m in that room alone, but I know I pray more in that time than I have in my whole life.</p><p>\u201cSir, you can come with me.\u201d I look up to see the nurse standing in the doorway. I get to my feet and follow her out of the room, down a well-lit corridor. \u201cNow, when we get in there, you need to stay near her head unless instructed differently.\u201d</p><p>I nod and follow her the rest of the way in silence. Once we reach the end of the hall, she grabs my arm and leads me into the room. Everyone is moving around quickly while people yell back and forth to each other around her. When my eyes land on Sophie, my stomach drops. She\u2019s lying on her back, her head the only thing I can see. Her hair is covered, and they are getting ready to put an oxygen mask over her face. I pull my arm free from the nurse and go to her.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby.\u201d I bend down, breathing her in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d she croaks out.</p><p>\u201cNowhere else I would want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Mr. and Mrs. Mayson. Are you guys ready to have some babies?\u201d</p><p>I look across the blanket at the doctor, whose cheerfulness relieves a little bit of the claustrophobic tension that\u2019s been building inside me since I heard Goose barking.</p> <p>\u201cYou ready, baby?\u201d I run a finger down her cheek. She nods and closes her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re ready when you are,\u201d I tell the doctor.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s get started,\u201d he says before disappearing behind the curtain.</p><p>The nurse comes back over, bringing a rolling chair for me to sit on. I thank her and put my face near Sophie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you\u2019re gonna feel some pressure, Sophie,\u201d I hear the doctor say above the beeping of the monitors.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nods, squeezing her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cThere we are! We\u2019ve got baby number one,\u201d the doctor says happily.</p><p>I want to stand and look over the curtain when a loud cry fills the room, but instead, I sit there, not breathing, holding Sophie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom and Dad, baby number one is a girl.\u201d I smile down into Sophie\u2019s face, quickly drying the tears starting to fall from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJust a quick hi so I can get her cleaned up,\u201d the nurse says, bringing our daughter over to us.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect,\u201d I whisper to Sophie, looking at our little girl, seeing her cute little face and headful of dark hair.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get you cleaned up,\u201d the nurse coos before taking her away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing great, baby.\u201d I smile down at Sophie, so f**king proud of her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom and Dad, we\u2019ve got baby number two, and she is a pretty girl as well! I\u2019ll let you see her after I have her checked over,\u201d the doctor says.</p><p>\u201cTwo girls.\u201d I laugh, looking down at Sophie, who looks worried. \u201cYou did great, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRr-ee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask before pulling the mask away from her face so I can hear what she\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s okay, baby. You and the girls are okay.\u201d I kiss her before putting her mask back in place and smoothing her hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cTwo girls... Can you believe that?\u201d I ask her, shaking my head. I certainly can\u2019t.</p><p>I smile when I see a small one forming on Sophie\u2019s face, and I\u2019m so happy to see that smile again. At that moment, a second cry fills the room, forcing me to let out a long breath. All three of my girls are alive and healthy; nothing would ever matter as much as that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee, baby? They\u2019re already showing off. Listen to those lungs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, girl number one is four pounds and seven ounces and seventeen inches long. Girl number two is four pounds and three ounces and sixteen inches long,\u201d one of the nurses yells from across the room.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re so small,\u201d I whisper and watch across the room as a nurse puts one of the babies in an incubator.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they putting her in that?\u201d I ask, my heart starting to pound.</p> <p>\u201cHer O2 level\u2019s a little low, but that machine will help bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they both okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwin number one is doing great, and twin number two needs oxygen but looks great otherwise,\u201d the doctor says, calming me.</p><p>\u201cBaby\u201d\u2014I look down at Sophie\u2014\u201cwe really need to give them names. I think they may get upset with us if we refer to them as twin numbers one and two for the rest of their lives,\u201d I tell her, trying to change the look of worry I see in her eyes.</p><p>I move the mask away from her face again, and she answers, \u201cWillow and Harmony.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose are perfect.\u201d I kiss her forehead.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad you didn\u2019t get a boy?\u201d she asks with genuine concern.</p><p>\u201cHow could I be mad when I have two beautiful girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hold them,\u201d she says softly.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my daughter, Harmony, who\u2019s been sleeping quietly in my arms for the last hour. Her sister, Willow, is still in ICU being monitored. They said that it\u2019s just a precaution; they were worried about her oxygen levels. I\u2019m willing to do whatever is necessary for her to get healthy so I can take all my girls home. Sophie is still out of it from the drugs they gave her for the C-section. She\u2019s been asleep since they brought her into this room.</p> <p>I look over at Sophie and can\u2019t believe that it was just a few hours ago I was worried out of my mind, not knowing if she or the babies were going to be okay. After Sophie was brought into the room, I went out and saw my family to let them all know that she and the babies were doing great and I would call them the next day when they could come by for a visit. They were all worried, and as much as I wanted them to meet my girls, I didn\u2019t want anyone near them yet.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d I look up from Harmony\u2019s sleeping face to her mom\u2019s beautiful eyes.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Willow?\u201d Her voice cracks, and I hate that she\u2019s upset.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, baby. The doctor said she should be in here with us by tomorrow morning. They just want to monitor her for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. Let me lay her down so I can help you.\u201d I carry Harmony over to her bed before going to Sophie to help her sit up, adjusting the bed and pillows around her. Once she\u2019s comfortable, I bring her Harmony and watch as tears fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe is perfect.\u201d Her eyes meet mine, and this time, they\u2019re smiling.</p> <p>\u201cShe is, and so is her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to have both of them with us,\u201d she whispers.</p><p>\u201cSoon, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe how much I love them already.\u201d She traces a line down the center of the baby\u2019s tiny nose. I nod; I can\u2019t talk with the tears clogging my throat.</p><p>We stay close the rest of the night, and the next morning, when they bring Willow in, I lose it completely. Seeing my wife holding each of my girls to her breast while they feed is a moment I will never forget. I can\u2019t believe how perfect my family is. My girls are both gorgeous. Harmony has dark-brown hair like her mother, and Willow\u2019s hair is dark blond like mine. We won\u2019t know what color their eyes are for a while, but I pray they\u2019re brown with golden flecks like Sophie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI want you to sleep for a while, baby. I\u2019m gonna have a nurse help me take the girls out to meet everyone while you rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can come in here,\u201d she says quietly, looking down at the girls, who are both sleeping.</p><p>\u201cNo way, baby-mama. You need your rest, and I know if we stay in here, you won\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to miss anything,\u201d she complains with a pout.</p><p>I smile then bend forward, kissing her. \u201cI won\u2019t let you miss anything. They\u2019ll probably sleep the whole time anyways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if they smile or do anything cute, you need to take a picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d I press the call button for the nurse so she can help me take the girls to see my family.</p><p>I carry Harmony while the nurse carries Willow into the waiting room. Everyone is excited to see both of our girls, but with the babies being so small and Sophie being out of my sight, I want to get them back to the room as fast as possible. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to stand going back to work. I don\u2019t even like to think about not seeing them for any length of time.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your wife?\u201d the nurse asks when we walk into the room.</p><p>I look at the bed expecting to see Sophie there, and it takes a second to realize that she\u2019s not in bed. The blankets are half on the floor, and the bed they brought in for the girls is pushed to the side. My heart starts slamming into my ribcage when I see that the bathroom door is open, letting me know that Sophie isn\u2019t in there either. I walk to the bed, pressing the call button before pulling out my cell phone and calling Kenton.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just getting in my car. You need me to bring you something?\u201d he asks as soon as he picks up.</p><p>\u201cSophie\u2019s not in the room. I need you back in here. Now,\u201d I tell him, trying to stay calm. Something isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she\u2019s not in the room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I just said. Get back in here now.\u201d I hang up.</p><p>\u201cDid you need something?\u201d a second nurse wearing bright pink scrubs asks, stepping into the room.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where my wife is?\u201d I ask, not wanting to hear the word \u2018no\u2019 come out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here?\u201d she asks, looking at the nurse holding Willow then around the room before walking into the bathroom and turning on the light.</p><p>\u201cGet security for me,\u201d I growl impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she mumbles, looking worried. She leaves the room, and I look down at Harmony then over at Willow.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Kenton asks, coming into the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for security to get here before I go look for her myself. Do me a favor and take Willow.\u201d I motion for him to take my daughter from the nurse, and he does immediately. \u201cGo check and see what\u2019s going on with security,\u201d I tell the nurse, and she nods, leaving the room quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her,\u201d Kenton says with conviction, looking down at Willow.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d There isn\u2019t any other option.</p><p>I know that, wherever Sophie is, she\u2019s scared, and it\u2019s f**king with my head. I\u2019ve made sure since we got together that she always felt safe. Knowing that she just had emergency surgery to have our daughters and is still recovering is only making my anxiety heighten.</p><p>It takes about five minutes for security to show up, and once there, they tell me that the nurse explained what\u2019s going on. They\u2019ve put the hospital on lockdown and are searching for Sophie.</p> <p>I take a second to call my mom to let her know that I need her here and to bring Dad. As soon as they arrive, I give her Harmony and Willow and a strict instruction to not leave the room for any reason. I leave her and Dad in the room, along with a guard at the door, and follow the head of security down the hall to the security office. Once there, we go into a small room holding the CCTVs. An older gentleman with short white hair is sitting in front of the screens, playing back a video from the camera in front of the room Sophie was in.</p><p>\u201cYou find anything yet, Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Still looking,\u201d the guy mumbles.</p><p>I watch the screen as well, trying to catch a glimpse of anything out of the ordinary. Five minutes into the video, I\u2019m ready to start breaking shit. I need to be out looking, but I know this is the first step in the process. I watch the video of me leaving the room with the nurse and heading to the waiting area, taking my girls to meet our family. About two minutes after we leave the room, a guy wearing a long doctor\u2019s coat and pushing a wheelchair enters Sophie\u2019s room. He\u2019s facing away from the camera, so I can\u2019t see what he looks like, but I feel bile in the back of my throat as I watch him enter the room. I don\u2019t know what happens when he is in there alone with her, but I do know I will find and kill him. About four minutes after he enters her room, I watch as he leaves, pushing a passed-out Sophie in the wheelchair, and I finally see who the f**k it is.</p><p>Rage fills me when I see that the man pushing the chair is the same man who\u2019s had a hard-on for Sophie since she started working at the school. David goes out of camera-view before reappearing in the next shot. He pushes Sophie casually down three halls before wheeling her out of the front door of the hospital. My body is literally shaking with adrenalin. I cannot imagine what he wants with her or how he even found out she was here.</p> <p>\u201cI know who that is. I\u2019m gonna call Justin and tell him what I know about this guy to see if he can lead us to where he lives or where he might have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Kenton asks.</p><p>\u201cHe worked with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he take her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants her. He\u2019s had a thing for her since she started working at the school,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cCall Justin,\u201d Kenton says as I pull my phone out of my pocket, putting it to my ear.</p> <p>\u201cHidee-ho, Ranger Joe,\u201d Justin answers in his usual chipper voice.</p><p>\u201cCut the shit,\u201d I snap, running a hand through my hair. \u201cI need everything you can get on a guy named David who works at the same school Sophie did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a last name?\u201d Justin asks, his voice now all business. I guess he must hear the seriousness in my tone.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s Rasmussen, but I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I mumble, hating that I didn\u2019t dig into the f**ker when I should have.</p><p>\u201cGive me five and I\u2019ll call you back with everything I find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, hanging up. \u201cJustin\u2019s on it. He said five, so let\u2019s be ready to roll when he gets back to me.\u201d Kenton nods, and we head outside just as the cops start to show up. \u201cLook, I\u2019m gonna call Leo and fill him in on what\u2019s going on. I don\u2019t what the local PD in on this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Too much red tape,\u201d Kenton mumbles, typing something into his cell.</p><p>I dial Leo\u2019s number once I reach to the truck, and he answers on the second ring.</p> <p>\u201cNico?\u201d He sounds tired.</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. Look, I don\u2019t have a lot of time because I\u2019ve got a call coming in, but I\u2019m going to need backup from your boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I can tell my words have woken him up and piqued his interest.</p><p>\u201cSophie went missing from the hospital\u201d\u2014I pull my phone away from my ear, looking at the time\u2014\u201ctwenty minutes ago. I got footage of the guy that took her. I need you to be ready to roll when I text you the info my man sends me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he growls, and I can tell he\u2019s up and moving. \u201cHit me back when you got something. Do you know who we\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, man. A guy Sophie worked with at the school. His name is David, and I think his last name is Rasmussen. He must have been watching her for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. All right. I\u2019ll get the guys rounded up. As soon as you know where you want us, text me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I hang up with him just as Justin calls.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I say, opening the door to my car.</p><p>\u201cHis address is 382 Donner Street in Springhill. It says he has another house over on Commerce in the same area. His background is pulling up all kinds of f**ked-up shit, man. He was married twice, and both times, his wives went missing. The first one was when he was nineteen and his wife was eighteen, and they had dated throughout high school. The second wife was when he was twenty-eight and she was twenty-three. She went missing a year after they got married. He was suspect number one in each case, but the police couldn\u2019t find any evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all,\u201d he says, and my gut goes f**king tight. I can\u2019t imagine anything worse than what he just told me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems he moves around a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I prompt.</p><p>\u201cEach place he has lived, there have been women who come up missing, and not long after they go missing does he move from the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I roar. That sick f**k has my woman. She\u2019s still recovering from the C-section she just had, and he f**king has her when she\u2019s in no state to fight back.</p><p>\u201cGo get her, man,\u201d Justin, says before hanging up.</p><p>I look at Kenton, giving him a silent signal to get into the car.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he says as soon as I hit the gas.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what to say; I don\u2019t want to say out loud the f**ked-up shit I just heard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get her back,\u201d he says, filling the silence.

I want that. Either way, the motherfucker\u2019s gonna die for even looking at Sophie.</p><p>I stoop, making my way in front of one window then another until I\u2019m at the back of the house. I can hear arguing from inside, and I signal for Kenton to follow. I take three steps, my back hitting the wall near the back door before I turn the handle. It clicks open, and I lift my Glock, pressing the door open with it. I search both ways while stepping into the kitchen. I hear Kenton behind me as we scope out the first two rooms we come to.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all clear down here,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I nod then point up the stairs. We make our way to the top, and there are two doors; one has a light penetrating from the bottom of it. I gesture to it with a tilt of my gun, and Kenton signals over his shoulder to the door behind him. He cautiously opens it to find it empty, and then I lean forward, trying to hear anything from inside the lit room. I hear two male voices and a whimper.</p> <p>I have been moving on autopilot since she was taken, just doing what was necessary to get her home. I know the minute I open the door that I\u2019m going to kill whoever is in that room with her.</p><p>Kenton nods to the room he just checked, motioning with his left hand to show me that he\u2019s about to set off a distraction. It takes two seconds for the flash bang to go off. The door to the room I\u2019m covering flies open, and one guy comes out. I shoot him in the head without a second thought. The second guy we heard inside points a gun at Sophie.</p><p>\u201cDrop the f**king gun,\u201d I tell him, my gun aimed at his head, ready for the smallest opening.</p><p>\u201cYou killed my brother,\u201d he says, looking down at the man at my feet.</p><p>I hear Sophie whimper and look at her for the first time. Her eyes are full of tears, she has a gag in her mouth, her face is pale, and she is tied to a chair. All I can think about is getting her out of here to somewhere safe.</p><p>\u201cI should f**king kill her. You killed my brother!\u201d he yells, and I watch his finger tighten on the trigger.</p> <p>\u201cDrop the f**king gun, David,\u201d Kenton says this time from behind me.</p><p>\u201cFuck you! I\u2019m not David. I\u2019m Dustin.\u201d He looks at Sophie. \u201cI f**king told him you weren\u2019t worth it. You didn\u2019t even know, did you? He\u2019s my twin. We like to pretend to be the same person. It\u2019s a fun game, and no one ever figured it out until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, f**ker,\u201d I growl, his eyes coming back to me. \u201cYou\u2019re dead. There is nothing you could say or do to get out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. This is all your fault.\u201d He points the gun at me. \u201cYou and your brother Cash\u2019s fault. I thought I had chance at something real with Lilly, and then he came along and took her from me\u2014just like you took Sophie from David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d I breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d Kenton says calmly.</p><p>Before I have a chance to blink, there\u2019s a loud explosion in the hall, and Dustin moves his gun towards us. I take my opening and shoot once, hitting him between the eyes. Blood goes everywhere, including on Sophie, who starts to scream against the gag in her mouth.</p><p>I go to her side, carefully pulling the gag out before untying her hands and feet, wrapping her in my arms. She starts sobbing, her fingers digging into me, her face going into my neck. I pull her away, wanting to check her over.</p> <p>\u201cI got you, baby. You\u2019re safe,\u201d I tell her, cupping her face. I check her over and see nothing until I reach her stomach, where the nightgown she has on is covered in blood across her lower abdomen. If those f**ks weren\u2019t dead, I would kill them all over again. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you to the hospital, baby.\u201d I put my arm under her knees and pick her up.</p><p>\u201cLeo\u2019s here,\u201d Kenton says, coming back into the room. Two seconds later, Leo and two other men I met recently walk in behind him.</p><p>\u201cAmbulance is en route,\u201d Leo says, looking at Sophie, who is clinging to me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get this cleaned up. Take care of her,\u201d Kenton says.</p><p>I nod, carrying Sophie out of the house and down the stairs, and as soon as I reach the front door, the ambulance pulls up.</p><p>\u201cI got you, baby,\u201d I tell her, not sure if I\u2019m reminding her or myself at this point.</p><p>\u201cOur girls?\u201d she asks against the skin of my neck.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at the hospital with Ma and Dad.\u201d I kiss her temple. The ambulance door opens and I don\u2019t even stop; I just carry her right inside, laying her down on the gurney. \u201cShe just had a C-section. I think her stitches are torn,\u201d I tell the EMT, watching as they start to pull up her nightgown. \u201cYou wanna shut the f**king door and get a blanket to cover her first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Sophie says, palming my cheek.</p><p>I look down at her and shake my head. \u201cYou\u2019re not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. You found me.\u201d Tears start to fall from her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cI will always find you,\u201d I tell her, kissing her forehead.</p><p>The door to the ambulance closes, and a blanket is laid over Sophie\u2019s lap. I sit back and watch as they lift her nightgown, showing her waist and the incision from the C-section. The wound is open, and I can tell she\u2019s in pain. I grit my teeth, not wanting to flip out and make this harder for her.</p><p>The guys clean up her wound as best as they can, and as soon as we reach the hospital, she is rushed back into surgery while I\u2019m forced to wait for her outside. I call my dad and mom to make sure they\u2019re okay with the girls up in the nursery of the hospital. Ma tells me that they are fine and that Kenton called as soon as we were in the ambulance to let them know that we were on our way back to the hospital.</p><p>I feel like crying in relief that the situation is finally over, but at the same time, I know going through something like this is going to f**k with Sophie\u2019s head when she just started getting over what had happened to her when she was younger. Hell, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to deal with it. I hate that I wasn\u2019t able to protect her when she needed me. I vow right now that nothing else will ever touch her again. I don\u2019t care how small or big\u2014she will never be worried or scared as long as I walk this earth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 15</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\"Nico, why is your mom calling to tell me you\u2019re not letting anyone see the girls?\" I ask, walking into the nursery where Nico is sitting, holding Willow.</p><p>\"The girls are too small to have everyone over right now,\" he grumbles then smiles over at Harmony, who is now awake and cooing at her daddy through the slats of the crib.</p> <p>\"Honey, they\u2019re old enough to have people over to visit.\" I roll my eyes.</p><p>\"They\u2019re too small. Look, she fits in one hand,\" he says, proving his point by putting Willow in one of his hands.</p><p>\"Your hands are freakishly large,\" I argue.</p><p>\"You like my freaky hands.\" He smirks before looking down at Willow as he tells her, \"Your momma is a dirty girl.\" He laughs when she smiles at him.</p><p>\"Nico, don't tell our daughters that,\" I growl. \"This is getting ridiculous.\" He is so overprotective of the girls and me. I'm lucky if I'm able to go to the bathroom alone.</p> <p>\"Baby, I'm not ready.\"</p><p>\"They\u2019re family.\" I run my hand down the back of his hair, trying to get him to relax.</p><p>\"They\u2019ve seen them,\" he grumbles sullenly, making me smile.</p><p>\"Call your family and tell them to come for dinner.\"</p><p>\"My mom talks too much.\" He looks up at me with puppy-dog eyes, making it hard to fight to do the right thing.</p><p>\u201cYour mom wants to get to know her granddaughters. There is nothing wrong with that,\u201d I tell him, walking over to pick up Harmony, who sees me and begins to fuss.</p> <p>\u201cI hate when they come over. They are all like, \u2018Oh, just let me hold her for a couple of minutes,\u2019 and then they don\u2019t give them back when I tell them to,\u201d he complains, looking completely serious.</p><p>I shake my head. I want to laugh at how ridiculous he\u2019s being about this, but I can\u2019t. He loves his girls; he\u2019s hands-on with everything. I don\u2019t ever need to ask for help. He\u2019s always there the second one of the girls starts to fuss.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you need to get over what happened. You can\u2019t lock us away forever,\u201d I tell him quietly. I hate that what happened to me is so hard on him. I haven\u2019t even had one nightmare about it. He has woken up twice drenched in sweat. The minute he knows where he is and I\u2019m there, he\u2019s on me. I know it\u2019s his way of reassuring himself that I\u2019m okay, but I hate that he still thinks about it when I never really do.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get over it.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI will never get over thinking you were lost to me and our girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, so please try for me and the girls to be reasonable about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you guys to myself. I only trust us with my most prized possessions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I love you for that, I know that, even if we were in a room full of the most dangerous criminals in the world, you could and would protect us. But, honey, the people who want to come over are not criminals. They\u2019re your family. They love you, the girls, and me. They would never hurt us, and even if they tried, you wouldn\u2019t let them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Dinner. The minute dinner\u2019s over, I want them gone.\u201d</p> <p>I avoid rolling my eyes in front of him and sit down in the rocker next to him, pulling my tank top down and freeing my breast for Harmony.</p><p>\u201cFour days,\u201d he says under his breath, making me smile.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait until we can have sex again either. The next four days can\u2019t come fast enough.</p><p>Nico</p><p>\u201cMa, I don\u2019t care,\u201d I tell my mom, who has been hogging Willow and Harmony since she walked into the house.</p><p>\u201cNico, go away. I\u2019m their grandmother. I want to spend time with them.\u201d She blows me off then smiles down at my girls, who are lying on the floor smiling up at their grandma.</p><p>I shake my head and look at the clock on the wall, counting down until everyone is out of my house. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love my family or want them around; I just want my own little family to myself. I hate sharing them with everyone.</p><p>\u201cSon, come outside,\u201d my dad says.</p><p>I look at him, then down at my girls, then back through the house to the kitchen where Sophie\u2019s sitting, talking to November, Liz, and Lilly. I nod, looking back at my dad before following him outside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I ask, standing near the door so I can look inside through the glass window at the girls and Sophie.</p><p>\u201cRelax, man,\u201d Trevor says, handing me a beer. I don\u2019t even know how to relax anymore. My body is wired lately.</p><p>\u201cThis is an intervention,\u201d Asher says before taking a drink of his beer.</p><p>\u201cYeah, bro. You need to f**king chill,\u201d Cash says, and I wonder how the hell he could seem so calm when the same sick f**ks who took my wife had wanted his.</p><p>\u201cYou guys don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re going through. The thing is, this is not healthy. You need to go back to work soon. You need to understand that the girls and Sophie will be okay at home without you.\u201d</p><p>I know they\u2019re right, but a permanent, cold dread settled inside me once Sophie was taken. Knowing now what the men who had taken her wanted to do to her and that I would have been left with two baby girls to take care of\u2014looking at my girls every day and knowing I had failed them\u2014I never want to feel that kind of fear ever again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all stop by and check on them while you\u2019re at work so you can have some peace of mind,\u201d Trevor offers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I rub the back of my neck.</p><p>I have enough money to live comfortably for at least a couple of years, but I know Sophie\u2019s ready to kick my ass if I don\u2019t back off a little. It\u2019s unbelievable to me how she acts like nothing happened, like she has no fears, while I spend every day worrying from the time I wake up until I go to sleep.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all worried. You need to talk to someone about what\u2019s going on,\u201d my dad says.</p><p>I look at my brothers and dad, seeing concern etched in their faces. I know Sophie\u2019s worried, and now, seeing that everyone feels the same way, I know I need to get help.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll talk to someone,\u201d I agree, taking a swig of my beer.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Trevor groans and sits down, \u201cI thought I may need to beat the shit out of you to get you to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you were able to take me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take you,\u201d he says, puffing out his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna let your mouth slide this time, but only because I don\u2019t want to embarrass you in front of Liz. I doubt she would want to sleep with you anymore if you cried like you did the last time I kicked your ass.\u201d I smirk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck you! You kicked me in the nuts. That shit doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I mutter, fighting back laughter.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I missed,\u201d Cash says, sitting down.</p><p>I take a seat as well, and when I look inside the house through the glass doors, Sophie\u2019s eyes meet mine. She gives me a smile I haven\u2019t seen in weeks. That\u2019s the moment I realize how worried she is about me. I take a breath and mouth the words, \u201cI love you,\u201d before going back to talking to my brothers.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do act like nothing happened?\u201d I ask Sophie, who is sprawled out on top of me later that night.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like nothing happened, while I relive that shit over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll protect me. I think about it sometimes, but really, I think about the girls and you and how lucky I am to be with my family. I know I could\u2019ve died that night. I know what David wanted to do to me,\u201d she whispers, clinging to me. \u201cHe told me about the other women he and his brother hurt. His brother, Dustin, told me what they had planned to do to Lilly, but when she got fired from the school because of Cash\u2019s ex, it threw a wrench in their plan. I was afraid, but I knew you would find me, and I guess I deal with it because I know what I could have missed out on,\u201d she says, cuddling closer.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I whisper, finally getting it. I don\u2019t know how I missed it before. I\u2019m doing to her what she did to herself for years. I hate that I\u2019m trying to shove her back in her bubble when she has a million reasons to be out enjoying life.</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d she whispers back. \u201cNow I just need you to start living life with me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, sweet Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d she mumbles, and I kiss her head.</p><p>I think about my girls and my need to protect them and their mother, and then I think about being their father and what that means. I can\u2019t be the reason they\u2019re never able to experience life to the fullest. I would hate myself if my own fears stunt their growth or turn them into fearful adults.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t know was that, when my girls became teens, I would wish I had made them fearful of everyone, especially the male population.</p><p>Epilogue</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re grounded until they\u2019re forty,\u201d I tell Sophie as I watch both my girl across the football field. \u201cWhy did you encourage them to be cheerleaders?\u201d I grumble as I watch one of the football players come off the field, giving Harmony a smile. \u201cYo! Hands off!\u201d I stand and shout when another player picks up Willow and swings her around in a circle. His head turns my way, and his face pales when he sees me. \u201cYeah, you. Hands off,\u201d I repeat. He drops Willow immediately, making her stumble and glare at him.</p><p>\u201cHoney, calm down,\u201d Sophie says, pulling on my back pocket.</p><p>\u201cCalm down?\u201d I glare at her. \u201cThis is your fault. Seriously, babe. Those skirts with your genes?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cFuck no, I can\u2019t calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your daughters can\u2019t talk to boys, but your son can do that?\u201d She nods to where my seventeen-year-old son, Bax, has his mouth on some girl.</p><p>\u201cI never claimed to be fair, babe, but the shit with your daughters is getting ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to college at the end of summer, and as much as you want to, you can\u2019t keep them locked up forever.\u201d She shakes her head at me.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going away for college,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Can you please sit down so we can watch the rest of the game in peace without you freaking out and scaring everyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou need to tell the girls that flirting shit isn\u2019t going to fly,\u201d I growl.</p><p>\u201cHoney.\u201d Sophie leans into me, her mouth getting close to my ear. Her breath hitting my skin makes me instantly hard for her. Even now, almost nineteen years later, I can\u2019t get enough of my wife. \u201cIf you calm down, I will do whatever you want when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to bribe me with sex?\u201d I ask, turning my face to look at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bribe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA promise.\u201d She winks.</p><p>\u201cI can get you to do whatever I want without taking you up on that offer,\u201d I tell her with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d She smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful, baby.\u201d I run my fingers down her cheek. \u201cAll that beauty... You gave all that shit to our girls, and now I\u2019m paying for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have good girls.\u201d She pats my thigh.</p><p>She\u2019s right; I know she\u2019s right. Both my girls are straight-A students. Actually, all my kids are good kids. Willow and Harmony are getting ready to graduate and Bax is a year behind them. Then there\u2019s Talon, who\u2019s in junior high, and our adopted twins\u2014our son, Sage, and daughter, Nalia\u2014 just turned six. Sophie got her dream\u2014her large house in the country that we filled with kids. If she hadn\u2019t gotten sick after having Talon, forcing her to get her tubes tied, she would probably still be popping my babies out.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, can I be a cheerleader when I get big?\u201d Nalia asks, making me grit my teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou can be whatever you want when you get big, honey,\u201d Sophie tells my beautiful little girl, making me cringe.</p><p>\u201cDo Daddy a favor, baby, and don\u2019t be a cheerleader.\u201d I pull her from the seat below me into my arms.</p><p>There is nothing greater than being a father, but it\u2019s also difficult watching your kids grow up. Having girls only makes it that much harder. Boys can look out for themselves, but girls need someone there to watch out for them.</p><p>Sophie</p><p>\u201cGrandpa!\u201d Nalia yells, running across the backyard.</p><p>I lift my head from Nico\u2019s shoulder to watch my dad pick up Nalia and swing her around. My dad got out of prison and moved to Tennessee a few years ago. I love having him around. He has become good friends with Nico\u2019s dad, and he even started working for Nico\u2019s brothers doing construction. Before he got out of prison, we wrote letters back and forth. I think it was easier to talk to him through letters. I knew that I could say whatever it was I needed to say, and he could reply with whatever it was he needed to get off his chest.</p><p>It helped that I was never alone when I got a letter; Nico and I would sit outside or in bed and read them together. I knew he would be there to hold me when it was all done, and that was all I would ever need. After a while, I started sending my dad pictures of the kids and opened up to him about my family and everyday life. He told me about himself and what he was doing each day. It was difficult to talk about the past, but we did. And we each shared some of our favorite memories of my mom. I loved that we could share that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He even sent me a key for a storage unit in Seattle that held things from my childhood home. I hated going through the stuff that had been stored there. Having to relive some painful things from my past was hard, but in the end, I was able to have pictures of my parents along with mementos and things I had left behind when I moved out.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Grandpa\u2019s angel?\u201d my dad asks Nalia, who\u2019s holding his face in her small little hands.</p><p>\u201cSo happy! I have a new boyfriend at school.\u201d She laughs, smiling at her grandpa, who, up until that moment, was smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d Nico whispers, looking over at me. I bite my bottom lip to keep from laughing.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to have boyfriends, beautiful girl,\u201d my dad tells her, kissing her forehead.</p><p>\u201cBut he brought me chocolate,\u201d she tells him like that\u2019s the most important quality in a boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cMe, Grandpa James, your daddy, or any of your uncles will give you whatever chocolate you want, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks, smiling.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d He grins back before setting her on the ground.</p> <p>As soon as she\u2019s free, she runs inside yelling to anyone who will listen that she\u2019s going to get chocolate. By that point, Nico is muttering under his breath about how this is all my fault and that I need to teach our daughter that boys are gross.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go inside and see what the kids are up to,\u201d I tell him, getting off the overstuffed bed/chair that sits on our back patio.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that we\u2019re not gonna talk about that shit tonight, baby.\u201d He kisses my temple before smacking me on my ass once I start to walk away. I look over my shoulder at him and laugh at the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Dad,\u201d I say, kissing my dad\u2019s cheek before walking into the house. I love my family.</p><p>Nico</p><p>\u201cPlease stop teasing!\u201d Sophie cries, trying to lift her hips higher into my mouth. I\u2019m not having it; I press her hips down into the bed, keeping her just like I want her.</p> <p>\u201cTake it, Sophie,\u201d I growl against her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t! I want to come... Let me come!\u201d she cries, trying to push me away.</p><p>I grab both of her hands, holding them against her hips as I bury my face in her pu**y. Once she\u2019s dripping wet, I flip her onto her stomach, pulling her hips up high before slamming into her. I watch her hair fly back, her head drop forward, and her ass lift higher, meeting me thrust for thrust.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Fuck yourself.\u201d I still my movements so I can watch her taking my cock, f**king herself hard.</p><p>\u201cNico?\u201d she whimpers.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby?\u201d I ask, not even looking at her, my eyes glued to our connection.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she moans.</p><p>I look up to see that her eyes are locked on me over her shoulder. I put my hand under her arms, lifting her up until she\u2019s sitting on my cock, and I do what she wants\u2014I f**k her hard and fast. I feel my balls draw up as she begins to clamp down around me. My hand goes to her hair, pulling her head to the side so I can take her mouth in a deep kiss.</p> <p>\u201cHell yes.\u201d I growl my orgasm down her throat as she whimpers hers into my mouth. \u201cI can never get enough of you, sweet Sophie.\u201d I pull out of her, lying down on my back before pulling her on top of me.</p><p>That\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s going to be nineteen years since we first got together, and most days, it feels like the first. I\u2019m still as anxious now as I was then to get home to her. She\u2019s not only my wife, but my best friend.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She cuddles deeper into me.</p><p>I run my hand down her back, loving the smoothness of her skin. \u201cLove you too, baby, but you need to get a handle on your daughters.\u201d I feel her cheek move against my chest and know she\u2019s smiling. \u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cI know you are, honey.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say anything else, and I know I\u2019m f**ked and there\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have to be here when I have heard this story a million times?\u201d Jax asks, looking annoyed. I watch my oldest nephew grab a beer before sitting down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI agree with Jax. I\u2019ve heard all this before\u2014the Mayson curse...blah blah blah,\u201d Cobi says, leaning against the wall.</p><p>\u201cCan you hurry? I have a date,\u201d Bax says, looking smug before getting a pound from Jax.</p><p>I look at Asher and shake my head. My sons and nephews are a f**king handful. I thought my brothers and I were bad growing up, but hell no! We\u2019re looking more and more like choir boys compared to them.</p><p>\u201cThe younger boys have never heard about it, so shut up and sit down,\u201d Asher says, and all the boys automatically sit down and shut up. Once Asher finishes telling them about the curse and the history of it, they all look at each other and laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou, Uncle Cash, Uncle Trevor, and Uncle Asher are all just crazy. I don\u2019t care what any of you say. The Mayson curse isn\u2019t real. It\u2019s just something Great-Grandpa and Grandpa Mayson made up to make you guys worry or something.\u201d Bax shrugs, walking over to sit down next to me.</p><p>\u201cI never believed it either,\u201d I tell them, and Asher, Trevor, and Cash nod in agreement. \u201cThen I saw Sophie, and boom! It was like my soul knew hers, and I needed her to breathe. One day, boys, you\u2019re going to know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d I tell my sons and nephews. Just like me, they don\u2019t believe, and just like my dad, and his dad before him, they have been warned.</p><p>What none of us know was that we should\u2019ve been sharing this same story with our daughters, for unbeknownst to any of us, the Mayson curse doesn\u2019t affect only the men in the Mayson family.</p>  </body></html>"]
