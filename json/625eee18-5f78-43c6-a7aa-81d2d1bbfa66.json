There was still a nip in the wind, carrying with it hints of winter fading to spring. Around him, people sat on benches and in chairs at the small tables where they drank coffee, worked on laptops or were listening to iPods.</p><p>It was an absolutely gorgeous day, not that he usually indulged in things like a walk in the park or even being in a park, especially during business hours when he was usually entrenched in his office, on the phone or typing emails or making plans to travel. He wasn\u2019t a \u201cstop and smell the roses\u201d kind of guy. But today he was restless and cagey, he had a lot on his mind, and he\u2019d found himself here without really realizing that he\u2019d planned to end up in the park.</p><p>Mia and Gabe\u2019s wedding was a few short days away, and his business partner was up to his eyeballs in wedding preparations as he sought to ensure Mia had the wedding of her dreams. And Jace? His other best friend and business partner was in a very permanent relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Bethany, which meant that his two friends were otherwise occupied.</p> <p>When they weren\u2019t working, they were with their women, and it meant that Ash didn\u2019t see them except at the office and on the occasions they all got together outside of work. They were still close, and Gabe and Jace ensured they\u2019d stayed solid, including him in their changing lives. But it wasn\u2019t the same. And while it was good for his friends, Ash still hadn\u2019t quite come to terms with how rapidly all their lives had altered over the last eight months.</p><p>It was weird and life-changing, even though it wasn\u2019t his life being impacted. It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t happy for his friends. They were happy. That made him happy. But for the first time since the beginning of their friendship, he was on the outside looking in.</p><p>His friends would vehemently dispute that. They were his family. Much more so than his own batshit crazy family whom he spent most of his time avoiding. Gabe, Mia, Jace and Bethany, but especially Gabe and Jace, would deny that Ash was on the periphery now. They were his brothers in all the ways that counted. More than blood. Their bond was unbreakable. But it had changed. So in fact he was on the periphery. Still a part, but in a much different, smaller way.</p><p>For years their motto had been play hard and live free. Being in a relationship changed a man. It changed his priorities. Ash got that. He understood it. He\u2019d think less of Gabe and Jace if their women weren\u2019t their priority. But it left Ash out of the loop. The third wheel. And it wasn\u2019t a comfortable place to be.</p><p>It was especially hard because, until Bethany, Ash and Jace had shared most of their women. More often than not, they fucked the same women. It sounded asinine that Ash wouldn\u2019t know how to function outside a threesome relationship, but there it was.</p> <p>He was restless and edgy, in search of something, he had no idea what. It wasn\u2019t that he wanted what Gabe and Jace had\u2014or maybe he did and refused to acknowledge it. He just knew he wasn\u2019t himself, and he didn\u2019t like that fact.</p><p>He was focused. Knew exactly what he wanted at all times and had the wealth and power to make it happen. There were no shortage of women who\u2019d be more than willing to give Ash what he needed or wanted. But what was the point when he himself had no clue what it was he wanted or needed at present?</p><p>He scanned the park, taking in the baby strollers being pushed by mothers and nannies. He tried to picture himself with children and nearly shuddered at the thought. He was thirty-eight, almost thirty-nine, a time when most men had already settled down and produced offspring. But he\u2019d spent all of his twenties and a good chunk of his thirties busting his ass with his partners to make their business the success it was now. Without using his family\u2019s money, their connections, and especially without their help.</p><p>Maybe that was why they hated him so much now. Because he\u2019d thumbed his nose at them and basically told them to fuck off. But the biggest sin he\u2019d committed was in making more of a success of himself without them. He had more wealth and power than even the old man did. His grandfather. For that matter, what had the rest of his family ever done but live off the old man\u2019s largess? His grandfather had sold his successful business when Ash was still a boy. None of his family had worked a day in their lives.</p><p>He shook his head. Fucking leeches, the lot of them. He didn\u2019t need them. Damn sure didn\u2019t want them. And now that he had surpassed them\u2014and his grandfather\u2014he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to allow them back into his life to reap the benefits of riding his star.</p><p>He turned to go because he had shit to do that didn\u2019t include standing around in a damn park self-reflecting like he was in need of a shrink. He had to get his act together and start focusing on the one thing that hadn\u2019t changed. Business. HCM Global Resorts had projects in various stages of work. The Paris hotel was a done deal after their having to work fast to replace investors that had backed out. Things were moving along and progressing well. This wasn\u2019t the time for him to drop the ball, especially when Gabe and Jace couldn\u2019t give work the time they had in the past. Ash was the only one not distracted by his personal life, so he had to step up. Take some of the slack for his friends so they could enjoy having a life outside of work.</p> <p>As he started to stride back in the direction he\u2019d come, he saw a young woman sitting alone at one of the tables outside of the primary traffic area. He stopped mid-step and let his gaze settle more fully on her, taking in her appearance. Long blond hair that drifted just so with the breeze, revealing a startlingly beautiful face with striking eyes that he could see even from the distance at which he stood.</p><p>She was wearing a funky long skirt that swirled with the wind, baring the long expanse of one leg. Blingy flip-flops adorned her feet and he could see the bright pink polish on her toes and a toe ring that sparkled when she moved her foot to shift position. The sun caught on a silvery ankle bracelet, drawing even more attention to her slender leg.</p><p>She was busy sketching, her brow furrowed in concentration as her pencil flew over the page, and beside her was a huge bag stuffed full, with rolled-up papers extending from the top.</p><p>But what most caught his attention was the choker she wore around her neck. It didn\u2019t fit her. He made that instant assessment. It was tight around her neck, resting just at the hollow of her delicate throat. But it didn\u2019t fit her. It didn\u2019t reflect her at all.</p><p>It was gaudy on her. A diamond choker, obviously expensive and probably not fake, but it didn\u2019t go with the rest of her. It stood out, out of place. His curiosity was piqued because when he saw a piece of jewelry like that on a woman, it meant something far different than it did to most people and he was seized with interest to know if it was indeed a collar, or if it was just an ornament, chosen by her. And if it was a collar, the man who\u2019d chosen it for her had done a piss-poor job. The man didn\u2019t know her, or maybe he didn\u2019t care to ensure that such an important adornment suited the woman he called his own.</p><p>If Ash could make that judgment after mere moments of studying her, then how the hell could the man making love to her not see the same? Maybe the collar was more a reflection of her dominant, which was arrogant and idiotic. A collar should represent his care of his submissive, how in touch with her he was, and it should fit the woman wearing it.</p><p>He was making a hell of a lot of assumptions. It could just be a simple necklace the woman had chosen herself. But to a man like Ash, that piece of jewelry meant something more than just an accessory.</p><p>How long he stood watching her, he didn\u2019t know, but, as if sensing his gaze, hers lifted to meet his and her eyes widened and something like panic entered her expression. Then she hastily slammed her sketch pad closed and began to shove it into her bag. She half rose, still stuffing things into that huge bag, and he realized she was leaving.</p> <p>Before he was even aware of it, he hurried forward, intrigued. Adrenaline rushed through his veins. The hunt. Discovery. Challenge. Interest. He wanted to know who this woman was, and what that collar she wore meant.</p><p>And even as he strode toward her, he knew that if it did mean what he thought it did, he was trespassing on another man\u2019s territory, and furthermore, he didn\u2019t give one fuck.</p><p>Poaching another dominant\u2019s submissive was one of those unwritten no-nos, but then Ash had never been one for rules. At least the ones he himself didn\u2019t make. And this woman was beautiful. Intriguing. And perhaps exactly what he was looking for. How would he know unless he got to her before she bailed?</p><p>He was nearly to her when she whirled around, bag in hand, obviously preparing to walk away, and she nearly bumped headlong into him. Yeah, he was absolutely invading her space, and he\u2019d be lucky if she didn\u2019t scream the park down. He probably looked like some stalker about to attack.</p><p>He heard her quick intake of breath as she took a step back, banging the bag into the chair she\u2019d vacated. The bag tipped over, coming loose from her grip, and the contents spilled, pencils, brushes and papers flying everywhere.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She bent immediately, grabbing for the papers, and he chased after one that had been caught by the wind, taking it several feet away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them,\u201d she called. \u201cPlease don\u2019t trouble yourself.\u201d</p><p>He captured the drawing and picked it up, turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no trouble at all. I\u2019m sorry if I startled you.\u201d</p><p>She let out a shaky laugh as she extended her hand for the paper. \u201cYou did that for sure.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, taking in the drawing as he started to hand it over to her and then blinked in surprise when he saw himself on the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he murmured, ignoring her hasty grab for the drawing.</p><p>\u201cPlease just give it back,\u201d she said, her voice soft and urgent.</p><p>She sounded scared, like he was going to freak out, but he was more mesmerized by the small expanse of her side that had been bared by the loose-fitting top when she\u2019d reached for the paper.</p><p>On her right side he\u2019d glimpsed a tattoo that was vibrant and colorful. Like her. The brief glimpse he\u2019d gotten told him it was flowery, almost like a vine, and that it likely extended a hell of a lot farther up or down her body. Maybe both. He wished like hell he could see more of it, but she let her arm drop and the hem of her shirt settled back to the waistband of that full skirt, depriving him of further view.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you drawing me?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>Color invaded her cheeks, making her skin rosy. She had fair skin, just barely kissed by the sun, but with her hair and those gorgeous aquamarine eyes, it looked beautiful. She was beautiful. And evidently very talented.</p><p>She\u2019d drawn him perfectly. He\u2019d had no difficulty in recognizing himself in the pencil drawing. His thoughtful expression, the distant look in his eyes. She\u2019d drawn him as he\u2019d stood there, hands shoved into his pockets. That moment of self-reflection, and clearly that was evident in the drawing. It made him feel awkwardly vulnerable that a complete stranger had been able to capture his mood in just a few moments. That she\u2019d seen him in that vulnerable moment and had picked up on what he hid from everyone else in the world.</p><p>\u201cIt was just an impulse,\u201d she defended. \u201cI draw a lot of people. Things. Whatever captures my attention.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, never dropping his gaze from hers. Her eyes were so expressive, capable of swallowing a man whole. And that damn choker stared back at him, taunting him with the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying I caught your attention.\u201d</p><p>She flushed again. It was a guilty flush, but also one that was telling. She was checking him out every bit as much as he was checking her out. Perhaps more subtly, but then subtlety had never been one of his strong points.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed out of place,\u201d she blurted. \u201cYou have very strong features. I was itching to get them down on paper. You have an interesting face and it was obvious you had a lot on your mind. I find people are a lot more open when they think no one is watching them. If you\u2019d been posing, the picture wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d he said slowly as he dropped his gaze to once more take in the drawing. \u201cYou have a lot of talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have it back now?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>He looked back up, lifting his eyebrow in question. \u201cYou didn\u2019t appear to be leaving until you saw me coming toward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was several minutes ago, and I wasn\u2019t late then. Now I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you late for?\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together in consternation and then her eyes flashed in annoyance. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh,\u201d he said at her pause at the end. \u201cMy name is Ash.\u201d</p><p>She nodded but didn\u2019t say his name. And right then he\u2019d have given anything to hear his name on her lips.</p><p>He reached forward, brushing his fingers over the collar at her throat. \u201cThis have anything to do with what you\u2019re late for?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She took a step back, her frown deepening.</p><p>\u201cYour Dom waiting for you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and her fingers automatically went to the collar where his fingers had been just seconds before.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked, when she remained silent. \u201cI gave you mine. The polite thing to do is return the favor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJosie,\u201d she said barely above a whisper. \u201cJosie Carlysle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who owns you, Josie?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed then and she clutched her bag, shoving the remainder of her pencils into it. \u201cNobody owns me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen did I misunderstand the significance of that collar you\u2019re wearing?\u201d</p><p>Her fingers brushed over it again, and it made him itchy. He wanted to remove it. It wasn\u2019t right for her. A collar should be carefully chosen for a submissive. Something that matched her personality. Something made especially for her. And not just any woman.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t misunderstand,\u201d she said in a husky voice that sent shivers down his spine. Her voice alone would seduce a man in a matter of seconds. \u201cBut nobody owns me, Ash.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. His name on her lips. It hit him deep, filling him with inexplicable satisfaction. He wanted to hear it again. When he was pleasuring her. When he had his hands and mouth on her body, drawing whispery sighs of contentment from her.</p><p>He lifted one eyebrow. \u201cThen do you misunderstand the significance of that collar?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, but he doesn\u2019t own me. Nobody owns me. It was a gift. One I choose to wear. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, and this time she didn\u2019t back away. Her gaze fixed on him, curiosity gleaming, and even anticipation. She felt it too. That magnetic pull between them. She\u2019d have to be blind and in denial not to feel it.</p><p>\u201cIf you wore my collar, you\u2019d damn well know you belonged to me,\u201d he growled. \u201cFurthermore, you wouldn\u2019t regret for a moment that you gave yourself wholly to me. If you were in my care, you\u2019d definitely belong to me. There\u2019d be no question. And you wouldn\u2019t hesitate when asked who your dominant was. Nor would you say it was a gift like it was nothing more than a piece of jewelry thoughtlessly chosen on a whim. It would mean something, Josie. It would mean fucking everything, and you\u2019d know that.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened and then she laughed again, her eyes twinkling. \u201cThen it\u2019s too bad I don\u2019t belong to you.\u201d</p><p>With that she turned and hurried away, bag over her shoulder and him still standing there holding the drawing she\u2019d done of him.</p><p>He watched as she walked away from him, hair sliding down her back and lifting in the wind, a glimpse of the flip-flops and the ankle bracelet that tinkled softly when she moved. Then he glanced down at the drawing in his hand.</p><p>\u201cToo bad indeed,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Chapter two</p><p>Ash sat in his office, door closed, brooding over the report in front of him. It wasn\u2019t a business file. No financial chart. No email he had to respond to. It was a file on one Josie Carlysle.</p><p>He\u2019d acted quickly, calling in a favor from the same agency he\u2019d used to do a background check on Bethany, which had solidly pissed Jace off at the time. They were good, and, more importantly, they were fast.</p><p>After his meeting with Josie in the park, he hadn\u2019t been able to shake her from his mind. Hadn\u2019t been able to shake his fixation with her, and he wasn\u2019t even sure what he\u2019d call it, other than he was acting a lot like Jace had when he\u2019d first met Bethany, and Ash had been quick to call his friend on the stupidity and rashness of his actions then. What would Jace think if he knew that Ash was basically stalking Josie?</p> <p>Jace would think he\u2019d lost his damn mind. Just as Ash had thought Jace had lost his\u2014and well, he had\u2014over Bethany.</p><p>According to his report, Josie was twenty-eight. An art grad who lived in a basement studio apartment in a brownstone on the Upper East Side. The apartment was leased to her. Not another man. In fact there was little evidence in the report of this other man\u2019s presence, other than him arriving to pick her up at different intervals. The report only spanned a few days, since it had only been since then that Ash had met Josie and immediately requested the information.</p><p>More often than not, she spent time in the park, drawing or painting. Some of her work was displayed in a small art gallery on Madison, but nothing had sold, at least in the amount of time since Ash had someone keeping an eye on her. She also designed funky jewelry and had a website and an online shop where she took orders for some of her handmade stuff.</p><p>From all appearances, she was a free spirit. No regular work hours. No regular schedule at all. She came and went seemingly on a whim. Though it had only been a few days, it seemed that she was also a loner. His guy hadn\u2019t spotted her with anyone other than the man Ash assumed was her Dom.</p><p>It didn\u2019t make sense to him. If Josie was his, he damn sure wouldn\u2019t spend so little time with her, nor would she be alone so much. It appeared to him that Josie was an itch this guy was scratching and that either he, or she, didn\u2019t take the relationship that seriously.</p><p>Was it all a game?</p><p>Not that Ash had anything against people doing whatever the fuck they wanted, but in his world, submission wasn\u2019t a game. It was everything. He didn\u2019t play games. Didn\u2019t have time for them, and they just pissed him off. If a woman wasn\u2019t into it with him, then he was out. If she wanted a fucking game where she played at being submissive, complete with cute role-playing and yanking his chain to earn a punishment, he cut her loose quick.</p><p>But then most of the women he\u2019d fucked, he\u2019d fucked with Jace. They had their rules. The women were clued in from the start. Bethany had been a complete game changer, and a complete rule breaker. Jace hadn\u2019t wanted to share, and Ash got that. He hadn\u2019t at first, but he got it now. But it didn\u2019t mean that he didn\u2019t miss that connection with his best friend.</p><p>On the other hand, with Jace out of the way, Ash was solely in control. He didn\u2019t have to worry about tripping over his best friend, pissing him off, or playing by anyone else\u2019s rules but his own.</p><p>That appealed to him. It appealed a damn lot. He\u2019d always known that people misunderstood his personality. Looking at the three of them, Gabe, Jace and Ash, people assumed Ash was the easygoing one. The \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d kind. Laid-back. Maybe even a pushover.</p><p>They were all wrong.</p><p>Of any of them, he was the most intense, and he knew that about himself. He\u2019d held back when he and Jace were with the same woman, because he knew he\u2019d take it a hell of a lot further than Jace ever would. So he played it Jace\u2019s way and held that part of himself in check. The part that would take over completely. And, well, there hadn\u2019t ever been a woman who tempted him to let that part of himself go.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>And it was stupid. He didn\u2019t know Josie. He knew about her, yeah. The report was detailed. But he didn\u2019t know her. Didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d even respond to what Ash would give her. What he would take.</p><p>That was the biggie. What he would take. Because he\u2019d take a lot. He\u2019d give a lot, but his demands would seem extreme even to someone well-versed in the lifestyle he lived.</p><p>He glanced down at the report again, pondering his next move. He already had a man on her. The idea of her being alone so much bothered him. Not that he didn\u2019t think it was perfectly okay for a woman to do whatever the hell she wanted in the city. But it bothered him for Josie. A lot. Would her supposed Dom even have a fucking clue where she was during the day? Did he give her protection? Or did he just hook up with her when he wanted someone to fuck?</p><p>A low growl rumbled in his throat and he swallowed it back. He needed to calm the fuck down and get his shit together. This woman was nothing to him. But even as he thought it, he knew he was a damn liar. She was something. He just wasn\u2019t sure what yet.</p><p>His cell phone rang, and he looked down, frowning when he saw the contact. It was the man he had watching Josie.</p><p>\u201cAsh,\u201d he answered shortly.</p><p>\u201cMr. McIntyre, this is Johnny. Just wanted to let you know what I just observed. With what you told me, I figured you\u2019d want to know what\u2019s going down.\u201d</p><p>Ash sat up in his chair, his frown deepening. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. She just came out of a pawnshop. She sold some jewelry. I was in the shop, heard her talking to the pawnbroker. Said she needed the cash to make rent. He asked her if she wanted to sell it or pawn it and she said sell because she doubted she\u2019d have the money to get it back unless something changed. Didn\u2019t say what that change would be, but thought you\u2019d want to know what she did.\u201d</p><p>Anger splintered his mind. What the fuck was Josie doing hocking jewelry in a goddamn pawnshop? If she needed cash, then why the hell wasn\u2019t her Dom providing for her? Why wasn\u2019t he protecting her better? The hell she\u2019d be in a fucking pawnshop if she belonged to him.</p><p>\u201cBuy it,\u201d Ash clipped out. \u201cBuy every piece. I don\u2019t care what it costs. And you bring it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Johnny said.</p><p>Ash hung up and then leaned back in his chair, his mind working furiously. Then he rose abruptly, his phone to his ear calling for his driver to meet him in front of the office building.</p><p>He nearly ran over Gabe in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cAsh, you got a second?\u201d Gabe called when Ash continued down the hall.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Ash ground out. \u201cGot shit to do. I\u2019ll tag you later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh?\u201d</p><p>Ash stopped, impatience simmering as he turned to look at his friend. Gabe\u2019s brows were drawn together in concentration and concern gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cYeah, fine. Look, I\u2019ve got to run. I\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded, but there was doubt in his eyes. No way Ash was sharing what was on his mind. Gabe had enough to keep him occupied with his wedding. Shit, that was tomorrow. Which meant Gabe probably wanted to talk shit about the wedding and the ceremony.</p><p>Ash stopped at the very end of the hall and called back to Gabe.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay with the wedding? Mia okay? You need anything?\u201d</p><p>Gabe paused at his office door and smiled. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. Or at least it will be when the fucking ceremony is done and she\u2019s mine. We still on for tonight? Jace is determined to throw me a bachelor party, which is not making Mia happy. I doubt Bethany is any happier, but he swears it\u2019s just drinks at Rick\u2019s and nothing that will piss either woman off.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. Ash had forgotten about it all. In his preoccupation with Josie he\u2019d put the wedding and the night out with Gabe and Jace solidly out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there. Eight, right? I\u2019ll just meet you and Jace there.\u201d</p><p>Gabe nodded. \u201cOkay, see you then. Hope everything works out.\u201d</p><p>Gabe was fishing again, but Ash ignored him and turned for the elevator. He didn\u2019t have much time if he was going to make it to the art gallery before it closed.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ash walked into the small gallery and quickly glanced around. It was apparent that this was a small dealer with not a lot of well-known artists displayed. He probably dealt with independent artists. Those yet to be discovered. Those displaying in hopes of being discovered.</p><p>His eyes settled immediately on a painting on the wall, and he knew without confirming that it was one of Josie\u2019s works. It just looked like her. Bright. Vibrant. Carefree. He felt her when he looked at the painting. Saw her, remembered the way she smelled and when she\u2019d smiled, those ocean eyes he could drown in. Yeah, it was definitely hers. He wasn\u2019t wrong about this.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>Ash turned to see an older man smiling at him. He was dressed in a worn suit with scuffed shoes and wore glasses that drew attention to the lines in his forehead and around his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJosie Carlysle,\u201d Ash said bluntly. \u201cYou display her work here?\u201d</p><p>The man looked surprised but then smiled again and turned, gesturing toward the wall. \u201cYes, I do. She\u2019s good. Not focused though. I think it\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t caught on. She\u2019s too all over the place and her style hasn\u2019t emerged yet. One that\u2019s identifiable, if you understand my meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Ash said impatiently. \u201cI like it. I like her work. Is that all you have, there on the wall?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cNo. Not at all. I have several pieces of hers. I only take a few at a time. I have to utilize the space to display what sells, and I\u2019ve only sold one or two of her pieces, regrettably. I\u2019ve actually cut back on the work of hers I display, just because it isn\u2019t moving well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want them all.\u201d</p><p>The surprise was still evident in the man\u2019s face but he hurried immediately to the wall to take down the painting that had first caught Ash\u2019s attention. It was framed. Not well, and he\u2019d definitely replace the frame with something more worthy of her talent. But first he had to buy up all her work and let the man know that anything else that Josie brought in was his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a few minutes, the man had taken down the last painting and started toward the desk in front of the gallery. Then he paused and turned, a thoughtful look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI have one more. In the back. She just brought it in two days ago. I didn\u2019t have the space to hang it, but I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her no. Not when I\u2019d already told her I wouldn\u2019t be able to take anything else until I sold something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it too,\u201d Ash clipped out.</p><p>\u201cSight unseen?\u201d</p> <p>Ash nodded. \u201cIf she did it, I want it. I want every piece of hers you have.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s expression brightened. \u201cWell, then. Perfect. She\u2019ll be thrilled! I can\u2019t wait to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Ash held up his hand, halting the man before he went to the back to retrieve the painting.</p><p>\u201cYou tell her whatever you want, but you do not give her my name or any information about me. I want complete anonymity or the deal is off. Understand? Furthermore, I\u2019m going to leave you my card. If she brings in anything else, you call me. I want whatever she brings in. I\u2019ll pay you double for everything you currently have as long as you make sure she gets her cut. And I will find out if you stiffed her, so don\u2019t even think about it. But that extra money also ensures I get first option on whatever else she brings you\u2014and I will buy whatever she brings\u2014so it would be in your best interest to let her bring in whatever the hell she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-of c-course,\u201d the man stammered out. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange it however you like. She won\u2019t know anything other than someone took a liking to her work and wanted everything I had. She\u2019ll be thrilled. I, of course, will tell her she is free to bring in anything else she has.\u201d</p> <p>Ash nodded. \u201cGood. Then we understand one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Let me just get the painting in the back and bring it out. Would you like to take them all today or have me deliver them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the one with me,\u201d Ash murmured, gesturing toward the first painting he\u2019d seen on the wall. \u201cThe others you can have delivered to my apartment.\u201d</p><p>The man nodded and then hurried to the back, returning a moment later with an unframed painting wrapped in a protective covering.</p><p>A moment later, Ash handed the dealer his credit card and watched as the purchases were totaled. He wasn\u2019t sure what the breakdown on the commission was, but with what he paid, Josie should have enough to solve any money issues for the short term.</p><p>The long term? He wasn\u2019t that worried about the long term, because while Josie had no clue of Ash\u2019s intentions\u2014yet\u2014he very much intended that the long term would include him.</p> <p>Chapter three</p><p>At ten minutes past eight, Ash walked into the private box where Gabe and Jace were already sitting, enjoying a drink. They looked up when he entered and Jace waved a greeting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your poison tonight? Your usual?\u201d Jace asked when Ash took a seat next to him.</p><p>A woman appeared wearing a sexy smile and propped her arm on Gabe\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry to hear you\u2019re off the market,\u201d she said in a flirty voice.</p><p>Gabe looked pointedly at her arm and when he didn\u2019t say anything, she swiftly took it away and then turned to Ash.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in a drinking mood, but he didn\u2019t want to be a damper on his friend\u2019s evening. And it was in fact their last evening as bachelors. Well, it wasn\u2019t as if Jace and Ash were married, but Jace would be. It was the last evening with the three of them still single, and it signaled an end to nearly twenty years of living free and playing hard.</p> <p>His friends would argue that they weren\u2019t free or playing hard. He was sure they were doing both just fine. Mia and Bethany weren\u2019t any hardship for the men, and they certainly had no hesitations about embracing a permanent relationship.</p><p>\u201cScotch,\u201d Ash finally said.</p><p>\u201cWas it that hard of a decision?\u201d Jace drawled.</p><p>Ash grinned, though it felt more like a grimace. A few moments later, the waitress returned with Ash\u2019s drink and he held it up to his two friends.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s to Gabe, the first to take the plunge. Well, the first and the second,\u201d Ash amended, referring to the fact that Gabe had been married once before. He tended to forget that and he was sure Gabe would prefer it that way as well. The marriage hadn\u2019t lasted that long and it hadn\u2019t ended well.</p><p>Predictably, Gabe scowled, though he did raise his glass.</p><p>\u201cMia is the only one that counts,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cDefinite upgrade from Lisa. You did good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman\u2019s brother,\u201d Ash snorted.</p><p>Jace lifted an eyebrow in Ash\u2019s direction. \u201cYou saying Mia\u2019s not a good choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if. Don\u2019t give Gabe any reason to want to kick my ass. Don\u2019t want the man wearing a black eye for his big day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Gabe snorted. \u201cWho the hell says it\u2019ll be me wearing the black eye? I\u2019ll wipe the floor with you, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Ash rolled his eyes and sank back into the comfortable chair. \u201cSo is this what it\u2019s come down to for us? Sitting around like old farts the night before the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you don\u2019t have a woman to go home to and explain anything wilder,\u201d Jace said dryly. \u201cMia and Bethany would both have our asses if we had anything resembling a true bachelor party. So yeah, this is as good as it gets. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting too old for that shit anyway,\u201d Gabe muttered. \u201cActing like a bunch of frat boys with their first piece of ass isn\u2019t my idea of a good time anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Jace said.</p><p>\u201cWell, when you put it that way so will I,\u201d Ash added. \u201cDamn, were we ever that bad?\u201d</p><p>Gabe laughed. \u201cWe were a bit more discerning, but yeah, you can\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember our days in college. Lots of drinking and sex. Not necessarily in that order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I remember all the women I slept with,\u201d Jace said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you have Ash to remind you,\u201d Gabe shot back. \u201cI don\u2019t tag team so I don\u2019t have someone to remind me of everyone I fucked because I wasn\u2019t fucking them with best friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s an image,\u201d Ash drawled. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the only thing we never tried. A foursome.\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed. Even Gabe joined in as they continued to give each other shit.</p><p>Several drinks later, Gabe kept checking his watch and it amused Ash. The man couldn\u2019t wait to get home to Mia. Forgoing any of the traditions of not seeing the bride the night before or day of, Gabe would be going to bed with Mia, waking up with her in the morning and probably make her late for the ceremony by getting a head start on the honeymoon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let us keep you,\u201d Ash said dryly.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s head yanked up, guilt flashing in his eyes as Jace laughed.</p><p>\u201cHow long you and Mia going to be gone on your honeymoon?\u201d Jace asked. \u201cYou never said and I didn\u2019t see that you\u2019d cleared your calendar at work.\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cNot working for two weeks. Not even bringing my phone or laptop with me. So if the company goes to shit in my absence, I\u2019m not going to be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Ash muttered. \u201cJace and I do all the work anyway. You just sit back and obsess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised you\u2019re only going to be gone for two weeks,\u201d Jace said. \u201cI figured you\u2019d go off and we wouldn\u2019t see you for a month at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m not tempted. But for now, two weeks will do. I plan to be taking a lot more vacation from now on, though. There\u2019s a lot of places Mia wants to see and I\u2019m going to make that happen for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve it, man,\u201d Ash said sincerely. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked your ass off. Already had one bad marriage. You\u2019ve got a good woman now and more money than you\u2019ll ever spend. Time to go out and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Make sure you don\u2019t fuck it up with Mia. She\u2019ll love you forever, which is more than I can say for your bitch of an ex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not ruin my night by discussing my ex,\u201d Gabe growled.</p><p>\u201cAny plans for babies yet?\u201d Jace asked. \u201cHas she talked you around on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to persuade me,\u201d Gabe said with a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m not getting any younger. My only concern was whether she was ready for children yet. She\u2019s still young. Lot of years ahead of her. I\u2019d wait if that\u2019s what would make her happy, but she insists she wants a big family, the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re doing your best to knock her up as soon as possible,\u201d Ash drawled.</p><p>Gabe tipped his glass in Ash\u2019s direction and Jace winced. He visibly shuddered and then took a long swallow of his drink.</p><p>\u201cWe need to stop now. This is my sister we\u2019re talking about. Now I\u2019m going to have to go home and bleach my eyeballs over the images you\u2019re invoking.\u201d</p><p>Gabe rolled his eyes and Ash chuckled. Then Gabe sobered and stared between Jace and Ash.</p><p>\u201cGlad to have you both at my back. Means a lot to Mia that you\u2019ll be there tomorrow, but it means even more to me. We\u2019ve been friends a hell of a lot of years. There\u2019s no one else I care about having there. Wouldn\u2019t give a shit if no one but you and Mia were there. And Bethany, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery eloquent speech there, man,\u201d Jace said, amusement thick in his voice.</p><p>\u201cMeant it,\u201d Gabe said simply.</p><p>Ash extended his arm with a closed fist to bump Gabe\u2019s. \u201cCongrats, man. I\u2019m happy for you. Take care of Mia and you\u2019ll never have to worry about Jace and I having your back.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo what was up your ass earlier?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>Ash blinked, realizing Gabe was talking to him. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair as Jace turned his attention to Ash as well.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust had shit to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked pretty intense when you damn near knocked me over coming out of your office,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cAnything I should know about before I make myself unavailable for two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had nothing to do with business,\u201d Ash said in an even tone. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all you need to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Jace muttered. \u201cIs it your goddamn family again? Are they still jacking you around? Thought you told them to fuck off for good after the dinner with the old man.\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head. \u201cHaven\u2019t spoken to any of them in weeks. I saw the old man. Did my good deed. Played the dutiful grandson. Then told my parents to fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Gabe chuckled. \u201cWould have loved to have been a fly on the wall for that.\u201d</p><p>Jace was still scowling. Ash appreciated the fact that his friends got so pissed off on his behalf when his family started their crap. Gabe and Jace had always had his back when it came to his family, but more recently, he\u2019d not wanted them involved. He didn\u2019t want Mia or Bethany exposed to his family\u2019s venom. Especially Bethany, who was a hell of a lot more vulnerable and would have been an instant target for their vitriol.</p><p>\u201cYou sure they\u2019re not giving you shit?\u201d Jace demanded. \u201cGabe will be out of town on his honeymoon, but Bethany and I are here. You know we\u2019ll stand with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown boy now,\u201d Ash drawled. \u201cI can stand up to mommy and daddy without help. But I appreciate it. And no, they aren\u2019t giving me shit. They\u2019ve been suspiciously quiet. I\u2019m just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if everything\u2019s okay, and you two are going to be okay running the ship without me for the next two weeks, I\u2019m heading home to Mia. Sooner this night is over with, the sooner she\u2019s my wife and the sooner we take off on that honeymoon,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of running the ship,\u201d Ash cut in before everyone rose to go their separate ways. \u201cYou never did say why we dropped Charles Willis like a hot potato. With him out and losing the other two investors, we barely managed to salvage the Paris deal. Anything you haven\u2019t shared with us?\u201d</p><p>Gabe\u2019s expression became shuttered, his lips drawn into a tight line. Jace looked questioningly at Gabe as well. All Gabe had shared at the time was that Willis was out and then the other two dropped without explanation as well, one of whom was a wealthy Texan who they couldn\u2019t afford to lose. But with the scramble to replace those investors, neither Jace nor Ash had asked questions. They\u2019d knuckled down, did what had to be done to get back on track.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t right for the job,\u201d Gabe said darkly. \u201cI knew it in Paris when we met. Knew I wouldn\u2019t work with him, no matter his bid. Business decision. It was what was best for the company. My call. I know you\u2019re my partners, but we didn\u2019t have time to get into the whys and wherefores. We needed to move to get the situation in hand and the plans back on track.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jace frowned. It was evident he didn\u2019t quite swallow Gabe\u2019s explanation. It didn\u2019t wash with Ash either, but Gabe\u2019s face was implacable. And him saying it was a business decision was bullshit. It was personal. Ash didn\u2019t know what the hell had gone on in Paris, but whatever it was had turned Gabe solidly against Charles Willis. The man had dropped off the face of the earth after being cut loose from HCM\u2019s operations.</p><p>Ash shrugged. All he cared was that they\u2019d salvaged the whole bloody mess. He wasn\u2019t going to get into what had gotten Gabe\u2019s underwear in a knot over the whole thing. It was behind them. No harm, no foul.</p><p>\u201cNow if we\u2019re done, I\u2019d really like to get home to my future wife,\u201d Gabe drawled.</p><p>Gabe rose and Jace followed suit. Christ, they really were getting old. It wasn\u2019t even ten yet, and they were already folding up the tent for the night and schlepping home. But then, they had women to go home to. In their position, he wouldn\u2019t be so eager to spend a night out with friends either.</p> <p>He walked out with them and watched as Gabe got into his car. Jace turned to Ash. \u201cWant a ride back to your place or is your driver on standby?\u201d</p><p>Ash hesitated. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk, and, no doubt, after Gabe\u2019s questions, Jace\u2019s curiosity would be piqued. But if he refused the ride, Jace would be even more convinced that something was bugging him. It would be better if Ash just sucked it up and took the ride.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Bethany doing?\u201d Ash asked, when they\u2019d gotten in. He figured if he got Jace talking about Bethany, he wouldn\u2019t pry into Ash\u2019s business.</p><p>Jace\u2019s expression eased into a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s doing good. Excited about going to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the latest on Kingston? He still being a dumbass?\u201d</p> <p>Jack Kingston was Bethany\u2019s foster brother. He was also the man who damn near killed Bethany and was currently in rehab. Personally Ash thought Jace had gone far too easy on the other man. Ash would have beat the shit out of him and then nailed his ass to the wall, but in an effort not to hurt Bethany any more than she already had been, Jace had helped Jack get a plea bargain that included rehab and probation.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t hear from him, and I\u2019m good with that,\u201d Jace said.</p><p>Ash arched an eyebrow. \u201cBut is Bethany good with it?\u201d</p><p>Jace sighed. \u201cShe has good days and bad. When I can keep her focused on me and us, things are good. When she has time to think, she worries. She knows he fucked up, and she hasn\u2019t gotten over that. I doubt she ever will. But she still loves him and is sick over what he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Ash murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>They pulled up to Ash\u2019s building, and Ash was relieved that Jace hadn\u2019t had time to pry into his head. Because he would. Just like Ash would do to him if he sensed something off about Jace. But knowing he\u2019d do the same didn\u2019t mean he was lining up to have Jace do it to him. It made him a flaming hypocrite, but oh well.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, then?\u201d Jace asked as Ash started out of the car.</p><p>\u201cYeah, wouldn\u2019t miss it. You walking Mia down the aisle?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s face softened. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we have had a rehearsal or some shit like that?\u201d Ash asked.</p><p>Granted, his experiences with weddings had been confined to Gabe\u2019s first, but rehearsals were normal for weddings the scale of Gabe\u2019s and Mia\u2019s, surely.</p><p>Jace laughed. \u201cYeah, man, it was last night. You didn\u2019t show. Not that you have to do anything but stand there with Gabe. Mia\u2019s going to give you shit about ducking out. I covered for you and said you had shit with work and that you stayed so Gabe could make the rehearsal. That appeased her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Ash said. \u201cI feel like an ass now. I swear I didn\u2019t remember. I wouldn\u2019t have remembered the wedding was tomorrow if I hadn\u2019t seen Gabe at the office earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been around much lately,\u201d Jace said, curiosity in his voice. \u201cEverything okay with you? Work hasn\u2019t been that bad, unless there\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. Things have been pretty damn quiet since Gabe went on a tear trying to get everything worked out before he left for his honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust been preoccupied, man. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>Jace leaned forward before Ash could close the door. \u201cLook, I know things have been . . . different. Ever since me and Bethany. I get that. But I don\u2019t want things to change, Ash. You\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings did change,\u201d Ash said softly. \u201cNothing to be done about it. I\u2019m dealing. Don\u2019t make it an issue that it isn\u2019t, Jace. Be happy and make Bethany happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we cool?\u201d Jace asked. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve been off lately. And it\u2019s not just me noticing.\u201d</p><p>Ash cracked a smile. \u201cYeah, man, we\u2019re cool. Stop acting like a goddamn nanny. Go home to your woman. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow in my goddamn tuxedo. Only for Mia would I do this shit.\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed. \u201cYeah, tell me about it. Bethany and I are so eloping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSet a date yet?\u201d</p><p>While Jace and Bethany had become engaged at Bethany\u2019s twenty-fourth birthday party, they hadn\u2019t set a date, at least not to Ash\u2019s knowledge. But then, he\u2019d been so far out of the loop lately that it was possible he just didn\u2019t know about it.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Jace said. \u201cWas waiting until this shit with Jack blew over. I don\u2019t want that hanging over her head when we get married. After he gets out of rehab and gets his shit sorted, I\u2019ll plan a trip somewhere and we\u2019ll get married on a beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great. See you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>Ash closed the door and slapped the side to signal the driver to pull away before he turned and walked into his apartment building.</p><p>Once inside his apartment, he walked into his bedroom and his gaze fell on the painting the art dealer had pulled from the back. The one that was still wrapped and not on display.</p><p>The others he\u2019d put against the wall in the living room, but he\u2019d put this one in his bedroom, intending to look at it when he got home. Now curiosity was eating at him, so he carefully pulled away the wrapping and turned it over.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>It was . . . stunning. Provocative and sexy as hell.</p><p>It was her.</p><p>Or rather her tattoo, or what he imagined had to be her tattoo. Granted he\u2019d only gotten a glimpse when she\u2019d bared a thin strip of her waist, but this was in the right place and it resembled the flowery vine.</p><p>The painting was of a nude woman\u2019s profile. One hip was presented, arms covering her breasts, but the barest hint of one soft mound peeked tantalizingly from underneath her upper arm. And down her entire side was a colorful, flowery tattoo. It curved over her hip and disappeared between her legs.</p><p>It had to be on the inside of one thigh and now he was dying to know if this was an exact replica of her tattoo. The one he\u2019d seen on her body. Jesus, but he was dying to know. Dying to trace the lines with his fingers and his tongue.</p><p>He stared at the painting, absorbing every detail. The art dealer had been a fool not to display this one. Had he even looked at it? It was erotic as hell and yet still tasteful.</p><p>Long blond hair flowed down her back, the ends lifted as if she was caught in a breeze. Her arms were hugged to her body, her fingertips splayed over the arm pressing down over her breast. Delicate. Utterly feminine. And so damn beautiful it made his balls ache.</p><p>Holy fuck but he was obsessed with a woman he\u2019d only met in person one time. And this painting wasn\u2019t helping a damn bit.</p><p>Tomorrow this was getting framed and it was going over his bed so he\u2019d see it every time he entered his bedroom. Or, even better, he\u2019d put it on the wall opposite his bed so it would be the first thing he saw when he woke up in the morning and the last thing he saw before he went to sleep at night.</p><p>Yeah, he wasn\u2019t just obsessed. He was all sorts of fucked up over this woman. He had to get a grip.</p><p>Johnny was bringing her jewelry by the office day after tomorrow since the entire business would be shut down for Gabe\u2019s wedding tomorrow. Ash then had to figure out how he was going to get it back to her. He could just mail it to her, but then he wouldn\u2019t see her. And he definitely planned on seeing her again. Soon.</p><p>Chapter four</p><p>Ash sat in his office the day after Gabe\u2019s wedding and studied the small box containing the jewelry that Josie had pawned. He examined each piece before carefully returning it to the tissue so it wouldn\u2019t get damaged.</p><p>It was quality. He wasn\u2019t an expert but it looked vintage and real. Definitely not fake. It was worth far more than Josie had pawned it for, and the pawnbroker knew it, judging by the price it had cost Ash to get it back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the desperation in that single act. Of pawning jewelry for a fast buck and taking far less than it was worth because she had no other choice. He was going to give that choice back to her. But other choices? Not so much. Not if he had anything to say about it.</p><p>It made him arrogant and demanding, but he knew himself to be both, so it didn\u2019t bother him. It was who he was. He knew what he wanted, and he wanted Josie. Now he just had to put the ball in motion.</p><p>His intercom buzzed and he jerked his head up in irritation.</p><p>\u201cMr. McIntyre, your sister is here to see you,\u201d Eleanor, his receptionist, said in a crisp voice that sounded pissed off.</p><p>But then it wasn\u2019t a secret how Ash\u2014and Gabe and Jace\u2014felt about his family. Eleanor had been with them for years and it likely hadn\u2019t pleased her to buzz him with this kind of information.</p><p>What the fuck was Brittany doing here? Had his mother resorted to having his sister do her dirty work for her? He could feel his blood pressure rise, even knowing he had to stop allowing them this kind of power over him.</p><p>\u201cSend her in,\u201d Ash said grimly.</p><p>No way he was going to air family shit outside the privacy of his office. Whatever it was Brittany wanted, Ash would give her a few minutes and then let her know she wasn\u2019t welcome at his office. None of his family was, and for that matter, none of them had ever stepped inside the HCM offices. They saved their venom for holidays and family get-togethers.</p><p>If they ever set foot inside the HCM offices, they\u2019d be forced to acknowledge his success instead of treating it like a dirty secret no one talked about. They\u2019d be forced to see firsthand that he didn\u2019t need them and he\u2019d succeeded without their help or influence. No way they were going to do either.</p><p>A soft knock sounded at his door and he voiced a \u201ccome in.\u201d</p><p>The door slowly opened and his sister walked in, apprehension written all over her features. She looked more than nervous. She looked terrified.</p><p>\u201cAsh?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Brittany was a replica of his mother. Not that his mother wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman. She was. And Brittany was every bit as beautiful, if not more so, than their mother. The only problem was his mother was ugly on the inside and it forever marred his perception of her looks. Because he knew what resided behind that pretty face. It was a cold and calculating mind. He firmly believed she was incapable of loving anyone but herself. It was a mystery to him why she\u2019d ever had children. And not just one, but four.</p><p>Besides Brittany, Ash had two older siblings. Both brothers and both firmly under the grasp of their mother and father. Though younger, Brittany was approaching thirty. Or maybe she\u2019d turned thirty already? He couldn\u2019t remember and he didn\u2019t spare an ounce of sadness over that fact. And she was as solidly under the family thumb as their brothers. Perhaps even more so.</p><p>Their mother had handpicked Brittany\u2019s husband. An older guy she\u2019d married Brittany off to when she was barely out of college. Wealthy. Influential. All the right connections. The marriage had barely lasted two years and Ash\u2019s mother blamed that squarely on Brittany. Never mind that in Ash\u2019s digging, he\u2019d found a hell of a lot of skeletons in Robert Hanover\u2019s closet.</p><p>He was not a man he\u2019d want his sister\u2014or any woman\u2014married to. But Brittany had meekly submitted to her mother\u2019s desires despite Ash\u2019s warning to her that Robert was not the man he seemed.</p><p>At least she\u2019d had the balls to get out of the marriage. That had surprised him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Ash asked in an even tone.</p><p>He gestured for her to sit in the chair facing his desk. She eased into it, perched gingerly on the edge, nervousness and uncertainty evident in her body language.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d she breathed out.</p><p>He cocked one eyebrow upward. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Get into an argument with mommy dearest?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed in Brittany\u2019s eyes as she stared back at Ash.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Ash. I know I deserve your mockery and scorn. I deserve a lot of things. But I want out. And I need your help to do that. It shames me to have to come and beg for help from you, but I don\u2019t know where else to go or who else to turn to. If I go to Grandpa, he\u2019d just tell Mom and he probably wouldn\u2019t help me anyway. You\u2019re his favorite. He can\u2019t stand the rest of us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surprise gripped him at the earnestness\u2014and urgency\u2014in her tone. He leaned forward, his gaze narrowing at her.</p><p>\u201cYou want out. What does that mean exactly, Brittany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want away from them,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did they do to you?\u201d Ash demanded.</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing. I mean nothing more than usual. You know how they are, Ash. I\u2019ve always envied you so much. You tell them to fuck off and you\u2019ve made your own way. All I\u2019ve done is marry a man my mother wanted me to, try to make the best of a bad situation and fail miserably. I got nothing in the divorce and I was okay with that. I just wanted out. But I have nothing without Mom and Dad\u2019s help. And I don\u2019t want it anymore. Because their help comes with strings. I\u2019m thirty years old and what do I have to show for my life? No life, no money. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>The desolation in her voice hit Ash deep. He knew exactly what she meant. It could have easily been him in this same situation. His brothers certainly were. He didn\u2019t like the shadows in her eyes and the beaten down look she currently wore. As much as she\u2019d been a bitch before, mimicking their mother, he\u2019d take that over this whipped-puppy look she now had.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cIs it pathetic that I don\u2019t know? I don\u2019t even know where to start. I came to you because I had no one else to go to. My friends aren\u2019t friends when the chips are down. They\u2019re more than willing to support me when things are good, but I can\u2019t count on them for real support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said in an even tone. \u201cJace owns an apartment that Mia used to live in, and more recently his fianc\u00e9e lived there. But it\u2019s empty again and just sitting there. I can probably buy it from him or at least use it until we get you situated somewhere else.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened in shock.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a job?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She flushed and dropped her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not criticizing, Brittany,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019m asking so I know what kind of help you need.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve been living with Mom and Dad. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to work, but what am I good at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be good at a lot of things,\u201d Ash said. \u201cYou\u2019re smart. You have a degree. You\u2019re just afraid to try and get out there in the real world.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cI can get you a position in one of the hotels, but Brittany, you need to know. It would be a real job with real responsibilities. I can pull strings to get you hired, but if you aren\u2019t doing the job, you don\u2019t get to keep it. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand and thank you, Ash. I don\u2019t know what to say. We\u2014I\u2014have been horrible to you.\u201d Tears filled her eyes as she stared earnestly back at Ash. \u201cThey hate you because they can\u2019t control you. And I\u2019ve let them control me. Now that I\u2019m not going to do that anymore, they\u2019re going to hate me too.\u201d</p><p>Ash reached across the desk and curled his hand around hers, squeezing reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need them, Brittany. You\u2019re young and smart. You can make it on your own. You just need a little help to do that. But be prepared. You\u2019re going to have to be strong. Our mother is a bitch, and she won\u2019t hesitate to use every weapon in her arsenal on you as soon as she figures out what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back somehow, Ash. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand again. \u201cThe best thing you can do for me is to live your own life and don\u2019t let them beat you down again. I\u2019ll help. I\u2019ll do what I can to shield you from that shit. But it\u2019s going to take a lot of strength on your part as well. I\u2019d like to think we could actually be family again.\u201d</p><p>She curled both her hands around his, her eyes shining as she locked gazes with him. \u201cI\u2019d like that too, Ash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me call Jace and see where he stands with the apartment. If we can\u2019t get you into that one, we\u2019ll have to take a look at what else is out there. Do you need me to go with you to get your stuff from Mom and Dad\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI packed everything. My clothes and stuff I mean. Nothing else to pack. I brought it with me. My suitcases are in the reception area here. I took a cab to your office. Wasn\u2019t sure what I was going to do if you refused to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then let me call Jace and we\u2019ll get your bags. For tonight I\u2019ll put you up in our hotel. I\u2019m sure the apartment will need restocking. I\u2019ll work on that today and also set up an account for you and deposit enough cash to get you through to your first paycheck. Take a few days to settle in and then come back to see me about that job. By then I\u2019ll have something lined up for you.\u201d</p><p>She rose and then was suddenly around the desk, throwing her arms around his neck. He caught her, rising from his chair, still holding on to her so she didn\u2019t fall, and he returned her hug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best, Ash. God I\u2019ve missed you. I\u2019m so sorry for the way I\u2019ve treated you. You have every right to kick me out and never see me again. I\u2019ll never forget what you\u2019re doing for me. Never.\u201d</p><p>The fervency in her voice made Ash smile as he patiently waited for the hugfest to be over. Who would have thought today would bring his sister into his office for a family reunion of sorts. Gabe and Jace weren\u2019t going to believe this one. Although it would be two weeks before Gabe knew anything.</p><p>Jace would likely think he\u2019d lost his mind for helping his sister out. But Ash couldn\u2019t just turn his back on her. Even if it was what his family had done to him. Brittany was still his little sister and perhaps this would be a new page for them. Ash didn\u2019t like the estrangement between him and his family. But they\u2019d given him no choice. He wanted what everyone else took for granted. A solid family unit. People who had his back. People who loved and supported him unconditionally.</p><p>He had that with Gabe and Jace and now Mia and Bethany. But he\u2019d never had it with his own blood. Maybe Brittany would change all of that. Even if they\u2019d never be one big happy family, he and his sister could at least have a relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my driver take you to the hotel. I\u2019ll ask Eleanor to have him come up and get your bags. She\u2019ll also call over to make sure they have a room ready for you when you get there. You\u2019ll need to go to the bank to set up your account. I\u2019ll have Eleanor help you out with that too. But for now take it easy, try to get some rest and tomorrow we\u2019ll move you into an apartment.\u201d</p><p>He smiled indulgently when she hugged him again. She hastily wiped at a tear as she turned away.</p><p>\u201cThis means a lot, Ash. It means everything. And I swear I\u2019ll make this up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be happy and don\u2019t let them take you back down,\u201d Ash said in a serious tone. \u201cShe won\u2019t let go that easy, Brittany. You have to know that and you have to be prepared for it. If she pulls any shit, you come to me and I\u2019ll sort it out.\u201d</p><p>Brittany smiled wanly and then started for the door. She paused, her hand gripping the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always admired you, Ash. And if I\u2019m honest, I\u2019ve always been jealous. But you\u2019re not what they say you are. I hate them for what they did to you. To me. And I hate myself for letting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t worth your hatred,\u201d Ash said quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t give them that kind of power over you. Not saying it\u2019s going to be easy. But you can\u2019t let them knock you down and keep you down.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon. I\u2019d like that, I mean. Maybe dinner. Or I can cook something at the apartment for just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that too,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cTake care of yourself, Brittany. And if you need anything, call me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she walked out of his door, he buzzed Eleanor and gave her the rundown on what he needed. After instructing her to assist Brittany in opening a bank account, he told her to give him the account number as soon as Brittany had it so he could wire funds.</p><p>What a day. So Brittany had a backbone after all. It had taken her long enough, but better late than never. Their two older brothers had never had the balls or the desire to stand up to their parents and the old man. Ash had no use for them. Both in their forties and neither one able to support himself or his own family. Hell, Ash had nieces and nephews he\u2019d rarely ever seen. He knew nothing about his sisters-in-law other than they were married to weak men still firmly under the thumb of his parents.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to be him. It would never be him. And now, if he had anything to say about it, neither would it be Brittany.</p><p>It remained to be seen if she\u2019d really have the fortitude to make a clean break and slip out from under the control of their parents. But he was more than happy to help her if that was truly her goal. She was young and beautiful. She was smart even if she\u2019d made some spectacularly bad choices. She had more than enough time to turn it around and get her life on the right path.</p><p>Everyone made mistakes, and everyone deserved the chance to make up for them. He just hoped to hell Brittany would turn it around now and get her head on straight.</p><p>He opened his drawer to look at the box of jewelry he\u2019d hastily shoved inside when Eleanor had buzzed him about Brittany\u2019s arrival. He brushed one finger over the edge as he thoughtfully stared down at it.</p><p>Brittany was squared away, and now it was time to focus on his primary preoccupation.</p><p>Josie.</p><p>Chapter five</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you sold them already?\u201d Josie asked, her voice rising as she stared at the pawnbroker she\u2019d visited several days earlier to sell her mother\u2019s jewelry.</p><p>He surveyed her calmly. \u201cI sold them. Had a customer who liked the stuff.\u201d</p><p>Josie twisted her hands in agitation. \u201cCan you give me an address? A name? Phone number, anything? I\u2019d like to buy it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had the option to pawn it, Miss Carlysle,\u201d the man said patiently. \u201cI specifically asked if you preferred a loan with the option of getting your items back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the loan wouldn\u2019t have been enough,\u201d she argued. \u201cI needed the money then. I couldn\u2019t wait. But it\u2019s different now. I have the money and I have to get my mother\u2019s jewelry back! It\u2019s all I have left from her. It was my grandmother\u2019s. Oh God, I can\u2019t believe you sold it so quickly.\u201d</p><p>The man shot her a look of sympathy but remained silent. Josie was sure he thought he was dealing with a crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me the information of the person you sold it to?\u201d she asked again in desperation.</p><p>\u201cI think you know I can\u2019t do that,\u201d the man said.</p><p>She wiped a hand over her face in agitation. If only she\u2019d waited another day. But how on earth could she have predicted that someone would walk into the art gallery and fall in love with her work\u2014all if it\u2014and buy it for more than the dealer was asking for? It was all so crazy. Not that she wasn\u2019t extremely grateful for her good fortune, but if only she\u2019d waited one more day she wouldn\u2019t have pawned her mother\u2019s jewelry and she wouldn\u2019t be standing in a pawnshop desperate to get it back.</p><p>\u201cWill you at least contact the person for me and give them my phone number? You could ask them to call me. Tell them I\u2019ll pay double what they paid for it. I have to get it back.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and then shoved a piece of paper with a pen across the counter toward her. \u201cI can\u2019t promise anything, but write down your info and I\u2019ll pass it along. I don\u2019t normally do this kind of thing. Once it\u2019s sold, it\u2019s out of my hands. You relinquished any claim when you sold the jewelry to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Josie said as she hurriedly jotted down her name and number. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s your fault or that you\u2019re to blame. I have only myself to blame for acting so rashly. But I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could just give the person a call and let them know how desperate I am to get the pieces back.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as she shoved the paper back to him. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She turned to walk out, her heart heavy. She should have been elated. Her artwork had sold. All of it! And Mr. Downing had told her to bring more, whatever she wanted. He had an interested buyer, and though he hadn\u2019t divulged any information about the buyer, he\u2019d told her that the party was interested in whatever else she brought in.</p><p>The only thing marring the entire day was the fact that her mother\u2019s jewelry was gone. She had no idea where or who had bought it or if she\u2019d ever get it back. She\u2019d been so happy when Mr. Downing had given her that check. Far more than she\u2019d ever hoped for. It was enough to pay her rent and buy groceries for a few months. Plenty of time for her to get other pieces to the gallery. And most importantly, it had been enough money to buy back the jewelry she\u2019d sold, even though she knew it would cost her more than she\u2019d gotten from the sale. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pawnshop had been the very first place she\u2019d gone after depositing the check into her bank account. And she\u2019d sworn to herself that no matter what, she\u2019d never part with the jewelry again.</p><p>Only now it was gone, and so was the last link to her mother.</p><p>She left the shop, stepping onto the busy street, uncertain of where exactly she was going next. As she turned to the right, she was stopped by a familiar face. She blinked as she stared back at the man she\u2019d met in the park several days earlier. He was standing there, not looking surprised. In fact, he looked as though he\u2019d been waiting for her. Crazy thought, but she didn\u2019t get the impression he was startled at all by the unexpected meeting.</p><p>\u201cJosie,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>\u201cH-hello,\u201d she stammered out.</p><p>\u201cI believe I have something that belonged to you.\u201d</p><p>He held out an opened box and as soon as she saw inside, her breath caught and stilled in her chest.</p><p>She raised her gaze back to him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this? I don\u2019t understand. How could you have possibly gotten it? How did you know?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled, but his eyes were steely. No hint of a smile in those green eyes.</p><p>\u201cI bought it after you sold it to the pawnshop. I\u2019m guessing since you just came out of there that you want it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I want it back. But that doesn\u2019t answer the question as to how you got it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI just told you. I bought it after you sold it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head impatiently and it was then his gaze came to rest at her throat. Her bare throat. His eyes glittered with instant interest. She lifted a hand automatically to where the collar had once rested.</p><p>He\u2019d know that she\u2019d worn it awhile. There was a thin band of paler skin from where the necklace had been.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t explain how you knew about it,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does! Have you been following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe personally? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to make me feel better that you had someone else following me?\u201d she demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s just . . . creepy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want the jewelry back?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she said in irritation. \u201cHow much do you want for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want money.\u201d</p> <p>She took a step back, looking warily up at him. They were on a public street and there were people all around them, but that didn\u2019t mean a whole lot if he was some deranged lunatic out to do her harm.</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner. Tonight. I\u2019ll bring the jewelry and you can have it. All I want in return is your company for the evening.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t know you. I know nothing about you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled patiently. \u201cThat\u2019s what dinner is for. So you get to know me better. And I can get to know you better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously know a hell of a lot about me,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIncluding where to find me and where I\u2019ve been and what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing the collar?\u201d he asked, his gaze once more raking across her throat.</p><p>His stare made her feel vulnerable. Like she was completely undressed in front of him.</p><p>This time she laid her splayed hand over her throat as if trying to hide the bare expanse of her skin from his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of your business,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI intend to make it my business.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019m going to agree to go to dinner with you? You\u2019ve been stalking me, or rather you\u2019ve had me stalked. You\u2019re asking personal questions and you\u2019re basically blackmailing me for the return of my mother\u2019s jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it belonged to your mother,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt must be important to you.\u201d</p><p>Pain stabbed into her chest and she had to suck in a breath to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes, it does,\u201d she said in a quiet voice. \u201cI hated having to sell it. If only I\u2019d waited a day. I have to get it back. It\u2019s the only thing I have left of her. Tell me what you paid and I\u2019ll give you the money. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your money, Josie. I want your time. Dinner tonight. Public place. No strings. I bring the jewelry. You just bring yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after? Will you leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t promise that,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cI go after what I want. If I gave up every time an obstacle was thrown into my path, I wouldn\u2019t be very successful now would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she said in frustration. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me. How could you? You know nothing about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I want to have dinner with you tonight,\u201d he said patiently.</p><p>But she could tell he was fast losing his patience. His eyes simmered with impatience even as his tone remained even. He was clearly a man used to getting his own way. She could tell that just by looking at him. Why the hell would he want her, though? What could she possibly have that he\u2019d want?</p><p>He was a man who wouldn\u2019t have to look far for any woman. They probably lined up outside his door at any given time. He was obviously wealthy. He had that polished GQ look that screamed wealth and privilege. And he had a quiet confidence\u2014arrogance\u2014about him that told her he not only got what he wanted, but that he knew it too.</p><p>Arrogance wasn\u2019t a quality she was particularly attracted to. But on him, it looked good. It fit him. Just like his clothing and his entire demeanor. And there was something about that gaze that turned her inside out. It had the very first time they\u2019d met. Her stomach had performed somersaults, and he\u2019d made her consider things she\u2019d never considered before. He\u2019d made her want things she\u2019d never wanted or realized she wanted before.</p><p>And she hated him for that. For overturning her carefully ordered existence. No, it wasn\u2019t that well ordered. She didn\u2019t have a routine and she liked it that way. But she was comfortable in her life, knew who and what she was. Until him. Until that meeting in the park that had made her question everything about herself.</p><p>He was not a man who would be quiet. He\u2019d turn her entire world upside down the minute she allowed him access. She knew that as solidly as she knew anything else in her life. He was someone who liked\u2014demanded\u2014control. It was evident in the way he spoke, the way he carried himself. He\u2019d latched onto the significance of that collar. He\u2019d known what it meant and he spoke as though he had vast experience in the kind of lifestyle that collar signified.</p><p>But he wouldn\u2019t be like Michael. Nothing like him at all. And that scared her even as it intrigued her at the same time. She was curious\u2014she wouldn\u2019t deny that. She wouldn\u2019t even deny that he\u2019d made her question everything about herself\u2014and her relationship with Michael. That he was the reason why she wasn\u2019t wearing that collar any longer.</p><p>And now he was standing in front of her, holding her mother\u2019s jewelry, demanding dinner with her in return for the jewelry. But his gaze promised a whole lot more. She\u2019d be a fool to think he\u2019d be satisfied with only dinner.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an idiot. She\u2019d felt the attraction\u2014that spark\u2014between them. Knew he\u2019d felt it too. As inexplicable as it was that he\u2019d find anything about her interesting, she knew that he was absolutely interested. But for how long? Women like her didn\u2019t hold the attention of men like him long term. And she had no desire to be his temporary plaything. A challenge he felt compelled to overcome.</p><p>\u201cJosie?\u201d he prompted. \u201cDinner? Tonight?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, dropping her gaze in agitation to the box he still held in his hand. She wanted the jewelry back. It was priceless to her. She should be relieved he didn\u2019t want money from her. The money she\u2019d received from the sale of her art would go a long way in helping her over the next months. But instead she found herself wishing that he\u2019d just take the money, give her the jewelry and walk away. Out of her life. Because this was a man who would shake everything up. No doubt about it.</p><p>All he wanted was dinner. A simple date. She\u2019d had dates. A night out. Food. A little conversation. She could walk away then and make it clear she didn\u2019t want to see him again.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she finally conceded. \u201cWhere and what time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at seven.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll meet you there. Just tell me the place and time.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cSo difficult. I\u2019ll concede on this point, but I warn you now. It\u2019s likely the last concession I\u2019ll make where you\u2019re concerned.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t making a very good case for me to go to dinner with you.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cJust shooting you straight, Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime? Place?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cSeven thirty,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cBentley Hotel. I\u2019ll meet you in the lobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll bring the jewelry with you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the box in his hands and then back up to her, amusement twinkling in his eyes. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t sure you\u2019d bail on tonight, I\u2019d give you the jewelry now. I have no interest in keeping something that evidently means so much to you. But if it gets you to dinner tonight then I\u2019ll keep it as collateral. And yes, I\u2019ll bring it. I don\u2019t break my promises, Josie. Dinner with me, you get the jewelry. No matter what else happens.\u201d</p><p>She breathed out, her shoulders sagging in relief. \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll see you at seven thirty.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to touch her cheek, his fingers just grazing her jaw. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it. We have a lot to discuss.\u201d</p><p>As he said the last, he let his hand drift downward until it touched the hollow of her throat where the collar had once rested. There was no mistaking his meaning. He wanted to know her status. What had happened to the collar. And why she was no longer wearing it.</p><p>She sighed and then turned to walk away. How could she possibly explain that he was what had happened?</p><p>Chapter six</p><p>Ash checked his watch as he stood in the lobby of the Bentley Hotel, one of the many hotels owned by HCM. He let out his breath in irritation as his gaze tracked toward the entrance once again.</p><p>She was late.</p><p>Or perhaps she wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>He would have bet any amount of money on her showing up. Her mother\u2019s jewelry obviously meant a great deal to her, and while he\u2019d been a complete bastard to blackmail her into having dinner with him, he couldn\u2019t muster any real regret. Not if it got him what he wanted.</p><p>A few hours in Josie\u2019s company.</p><p>He had a dozen questions simmering on his lips. He wanted to know why she wasn\u2019t wearing the collar anymore. He wanted to know if the guy who\u2019d given it to her was out of the picture now. While it wouldn\u2019t change his plans if she hadn\u2019t cut the other guy loose, it would certainly make things a hell of a lot easier for him if she weren\u2019t in a relationship.</p><p>At a quarter to eight, Ash straightened, realization slowly creeping in that she wasn\u2019t coming. Disappointment surged in his veins. Not a common sensation for him. But if she thought he would be deterred by being stood up, she was wrong. It only hardened his resolve.</p><p>He was about to pick up the phone to call for his driver when Josie burst through the front entrance to the hotel. Her cheeks were red and her hair was askew, as if she\u2019d been hurrying and the wind had played havoc with the long tresses.</p><p>When her gaze lighted on him, she paused, standing several feet away as they locked eyes. He found himself walking toward her when, normally, he wouldn\u2019t be the first to make a move. People came to him. Not the other way around. And yet, he wanted to close in before she changed her mind and bolted back out the door.</p><p>\u201cJosie,\u201d he greeted smoothly.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI was painting. Got caught up in what I was doing and completely forgot the time.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the oversized bag hanging from her shoulder and the paint smudges on her fingertips. Then he took in the rest of her, memorizing every detail, right down to her toes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right. They\u2019ll hold our table,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you like to eat now or have a drink first?\u201d</p><p>She pulled a face. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a drinker. I mean, I don\u2019t have anything against it, and I do drink on occasion, but I\u2019m rather finicky and I drink frou-frou girly drinks. But I love an occasional glass of wine.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019d fit right in with Mia and Bethany and their girls.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side. \u201cWho are Mia and Bethany?\u201d</p><p>He reached to take her arm, tucking it over his as he guided her toward the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cMia is the wife of one of my business partners, Gabe, and she\u2019s the sister of my other business partner, Jace. Bethany is engaged to Jace.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSounds like one big happy family,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf sorts.\u201d</p><p>They arrived at the restaurant and the ma\u00eetre d\u2019 immediately ushered them to the table always reserved for himself or Gabe or Jace when they chose to eat here.</p><p>Josie sat across from Ash, but she didn\u2019t fully relax. She was perched on the edge of her seat and her gaze kept darting left and right and beyond Ash. She looked ill at ease and like she\u2019d rather be anywhere but here with him. His ego was taking one hell of a beating. Women didn\u2019t normally have to be blackmailed in order to agree to a date with him.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like wine?\u201d he asked when a waiter immediately appeared.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. Water will be fine. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake that two,\u201d Ash murmured to the waiter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you from enjoying wine if that\u2019s what you prefer,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to drink and then have to get back home. Alcohol makes me pretty fuzzy. Last thing I need to do is be stumbling around Manhattan after dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t hold your liquor and when you do imbibe, you drink girly drinks. I\u2019ll have to remember that.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips twitched and her eyes flashed. He\u2019d almost gotten a smile out of her. Was he such an ogre? He was used to women falling for his charm, although in Josie\u2019s defense he hadn\u2019t exactly been charming in her presence. Something about her brought his caveman instincts roaring to the surface. He was lucky he could form coherent sentences without growling, beating his chest and dragging her back to his cave by her hair.</p><p>That would go over well . . .</p><p>Not only would she have his balls, he\u2019d never see her again.</p><p>The waiter took their orders and then quickly disappeared. Josie glanced up, a question in her eyes as soon as they were alone.</p><p>\u201cDid you bring the jewelry?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He reached into the breast pocket of his dinner jacket and pulled out a small velvet drawstring bag. Placing it on the table, he slid it across to her, but held on when she would have retrieved it.</p> <p>\u201cThe deal was dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the jewelry now and hope you don\u2019t make a break for it the minute it\u2019s in your possession.\u201d</p><p>She flushed, whether from embarrassment or guilt he wasn\u2019t sure. Maybe she had considered it.</p><p>\u201cMy ego is taking one hell of a beating,\u201d he said, voicing his earlier thought. \u201cAm I that unattractive, Josie? I didn\u2019t imagine your response to me in the park. You were as aware of our chemistry as I was. But you act like I\u2019m carrying the plague and you don\u2019t want to breathe the same air as I am.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled over the bag, brushing against his. Instant warmth traveled up his arm to his shoulder. At just her touch. Such a simple thing. Nothing behind it. It was incidental and yet the air was instantly charged with awareness. No, he wasn\u2019t the only one who felt it, but he was the only one embracing it.</p><p>\u201cI think you know you aren\u2019t unattractive,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cI doubt you need me to tell you that. I\u2019m sure you hear it all the time. Women probably fall over themselves to compliment you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what other women are thinking,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with what you think.\u201d</p><p>She carefully drew her hand back, the bag with the jewelry tightly fisted in her grasp, as if she were afraid he\u2019d prevent her from taking it. When he made no move to intercept it, she quickly opened the bag a nd gently pulled out the two rings, a necklace and a bracelet.</p><p>Relief was evident in her eyes. The aqua pools lit up as she lovingly traced the lines of the jewelry. A faraway look entered her eyes and when she raised her gaze back to Ash, moisture glistened around the edges.</p> <p>\u201cThank you for giving my mother back to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis is all I have of her. My grandmother too. One day I want to pass it down to my daughter. My grandmother and mother were exceptional women. I want my daughter to have this legacy. Though my daughter will never know them, I want her to know about them. Who they were and how important they were to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d Ash asked gently.</p><p>Her lips trembled, but she held herself together, her gaze never faltering, though it grew suspiciously brighter with the evidence of tears.</p><p>\u201cCancer,\u201d she said, her voice aching with sorrow.</p><p>\u201cRecent?\u201d he asked in a quieter tone.</p><p>The last thing he wanted was to upset her, but it gave him absurd pleasure that she\u2019d open up to him. Communicate. It was a start. The start of something more permanent if he had his way. And he had every intention of getting his way. It was just going to require a great deal more patience than he was used to having to employ.</p><p>Adrenaline spiked, burning through his veins. She was a challenge. One he looked forward to conquering. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been excited about anything. And Josie definitely excited him.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago,\u201d Josie said, sadness creeping into those beautiful eyes. \u201cBut she was ill for a lot longer. In the end . . .\u201d She broke off, her voice cracking at the very last.</p><p>\u201cIn the end what?\u201d he prompted gently.</p><p>\u201cIn the end it was a relief even though I was devastated over having to let go and say good-bye. She was in so much pain. It hurt to see her like that. It hurt her. She hated for me to see her that way, to have to take care of her. She worried for so long that she was taking up too much of my life, that she was holding me back and saddling me with the responsibility of taking care of her. But God, she was my mother. I would have done anything for her. I never regretted a single moment of our time together. And in the end, she was ready to go. She\u2019d fought for so long and so hard. She was exhausted and no longer had the strength to fight. That was the hardest for me. To watch my kick-ass mom slowly fade. I just wanted her pain to be over and for her to have peace. So when she passed away, there was relief. And I know that sounds horrible.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot horrible, Josie. Human. She was your mother and you loved her. No one likes to see their loved ones endure pain and heartache.\u201d</p><p>Josie nodded and wiped at her eye with the back of her hand. Her fingers were shaking when she lowered her hand back to the table.</p><p>\u201cWow, not great dinner conversation, right? Sorry to babble on like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWhat about your father? Do you have any siblings or are you an only child?\u201d</p><p>She blew out an unhappy sigh. \u201cI\u2019m an only child. My parents wanted more, but my mother couldn\u2019t have any more after me. She had cancer once before and with all the treatments, not only could she not bear another child, but she was too weakened by the whole process. I\u2014we\u2014thought she\u2019d kicked it, you know? She went twenty years in remission and then it came back. Much more pervasive this time. She didn\u2019t respond to treatment like she did before.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cSorry. There I go again.\u201d</p><p>He reached across the table and slid his hand over hers. \u201cWe\u2019re having a conversation, Josie. It\u2019s what two people do when they go out on a date. Stop apologizing. If I wasn\u2019t interested, I wouldn\u2019t have asked. However, if it\u2019s too painful a subject, we can certainly talk about other things. But I\u2019m interested in every part of you. I very much want to hear about you, your life, your family, whatever makes you tick.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and didn\u2019t pull her hand away from his. A fact he was absurdly triumphant over.</p><p>\u201cNow, you said parents. Did your father pass away as well?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened and coldness crept into her gaze, turning the aqua color more to blue. It was like looking at a frost-covered windowpane.</p><p>\u201cHe left her\u2014us\u2014the first time she had cancer. Not right away. He waited until she was well enough to make it on her own and then he split. His reason? He couldn\u2019t stand the heartache of losing her to cancer. He didn\u2019t want to have to watch her die and so he left instead. Isn\u2019t that the biggest bullshit you\u2019ve ever heard? It makes no sense to me. It\u2019s never made any sense that he\u2019d walk away from his wife and child, all because he worried she\u2019d die. He lost her either way, but he lost me too. I never forgave him for that. For leaving us both when we desperately needed him. Especially my mother. Who after undergoing extensive treatment then had to find a job so she could support me and pay the bills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is bullshit,\u201d Ash said darkly. \u201cSo you haven\u2019t seen him since? How many years ago was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen,\u201d she replied, her voice tight. No matter her anger\u2014and he didn\u2019t blame her for being angry\u2014there was also hurt in her voice. Betrayal. He rubbed his thumb over the tops of her knuckles in a soothing motion, silently urging her to go on.</p><p>He had her talking now and hopefully she\u2019d relax and open up further.</p><p>\u201cI was ten years old when he left. For a long time he didn\u2019t even try to contact her or me. Then when I graduated high school, he called me. He wanted to send me a graduation gift. I told him where to stick his graduation present.\u201d</p><p>The more she spoke, the cloudier her eyes got and her lips formed a grimace.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t contact me again until Mom died.\u201d</p><p>Tears glittered brightly in her eyes and she used her free hand to rub her thumb along the corner of her eye where a damp trail had formed.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered again. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about it at all. I mean I never shared this. It\u2019s just sort of all coming out and I didn\u2019t realize how angry I still am about it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time to keep that shit bottled up.\u201d</p><p>She nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cSo he contacted you when your mom passed away? Did he know she was sick again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew,\u201d Josie bit out. \u201cHe never came to see her. Never called. Never spoke to her. After she passed away, he called wanting to see me. He said he was sorry about Mom but that he wanted us to be a family. I told him that family doesn\u2019t do the kind of shit he pulled and that my family was dead. That was two years ago. He\u2019s never tried to contact me again. I don\u2019t even know where he lives. He moved a lot after he and Mom divorced. His job takes him away quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever regret not seeing him?\u201d</p><p>She looked startled by the question. \u201cNo. Not at all. I don\u2019t think I could see him without flying into a rage. Especially right after Mom died. If he\u2019d been there, I think I would have just gone off on him. I was furious and heartbroken. And I was pissed. Pissed that he\u2019d been such a coward and that he hadn\u2019t been there for my mom when she needed him most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. Believe me I do. I don\u2019t see my family. Well, most of them. Recently my sister came to see me but until then I\u2019ve had nothing to do with any of them.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side, studying him. Their hands were still joined and he traced several patterns on her skin, from her knuckles to the top of her wrist and back. He liked touching her. Could touch her all night. And it wasn\u2019t sexual. He simply enjoyed the satiny softness of her hands. Fingers that were stained with paint, a different color on each tip.</p><p>\u201cWhat did your family do?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cLong story. I\u2019ll tell you about it sometime. Right now, though, I\u2019m much more interested in hearing about you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cThat isn\u2019t fair. I\u2019ve told you about my family. I won\u2019t say another word unless you reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and his hand tightened around hers. Her eyes widened and she glanced down at their joined fingers. Yes, she felt it just as much as he did. But she was fighting it and he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cVery well then. I\u2019ll give you a tidbit and then it\u2019s your turn again.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cThat depends on how worthy I feel your information is. You must give a piece of equal value to the one I gave to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he murmured. He looked intently into her eyes, that drowning sensation washing over him. \u201cNo information I can give you will be as valuable as you sharing yourself with me.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks grew pink and she dropped her gaze. Her hand twitched beneath his, but he held it firmly so she wasn\u2019t able to draw it away.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you think so,\u201d she said in a husky voice. \u201cBut perhaps I find information about you to be much more valuable. You see, you have me at a disadvantage. You\u2019ve checked up on me, had me followed. I have no doubt that you know far more about me than I\u2019m comfortable with. So it\u2019s only fair that you even the odds by telling me all your deep, dark secrets.\u201d</p><p>She was flirting with him. In a shy, adorable way, as if she were uncertain of how to do so. He\u2019d never experienced such an intense surge of . . . excitement. There was lust, absolutely. He wanted her like he hadn\u2019t ever wanted a woman before. But there was more. He was interested in her. What made her tick. He wanted inside her head every bit as much as he wanted inside her body. Most of all, he wanted her trust, even if nothing he\u2019d done so far deserved such a gift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given time he\u2019d prove himself to her. If she only gave him a chance.</p><p>\u201cDeep, dark secrets, huh. I fear you\u2019re in for disappointment. I\u2019m frightfully boring. I\u2019m married to my business, and I despise my family almost as much as they despise me. My real family are my business partners and their women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that your sister came to see you recently. Have you reconciled?\u201d</p><p>This time he pulled his hand away, leaning back in his chair. His gaze went beyond Josie for a moment before he allowed it to drift back to her face.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose you could say that. I\u2019m not completely convinced of her sincerity as of yet. I\u2019d like to think she\u2019s finally making a break from the wolf pack, but only time will tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do? To you both?\u201d</p><p>Ash sighed. \u201cGave birth to us? Hell if I know. My mother has zero maternal instinct, and yet she had four of us. It baffles me that a woman that self-serving would continue to have children she considered a burden.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s nose wrinkled and her eyes flashed with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cHave you never gotten along with them? Even when you were a child?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI rarely saw them when I was a child,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cWe were packed off to school and only came home during the holidays and even then we had a nanny. More often than not, my mom and dad were off doing their thing. Traveling. Involved in the social scene. My grandfather made a lot of money in his lifetime, but we don\u2019t come from old money. We would be considered nouveau riche, a fact my mother has never been able to get over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive my assumption, but she sounds horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no assumption. She and my father are both lousy people. Not just lousy parents, but lousy in every aspect. I firmly believe the only reason she had so many children is because my grandfather came from a large family with several siblings, and he wanted my mother to give him several grandchildren. And if nothing else, my mother will not piss off the old man because she depends on him too much for support. So she had us, but he paid for our upbringing, such as it was. The only times she or Dad ever had time for us was if the old man was present. I don\u2019t know what was worse. Them being lousy parents or them acting like caring parents around others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d Josie said. \u201cI adored my mother. And my grandmother. They were wonderful women. So what happened with your sister? And how old is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrittany is the youngest. She\u2019s thirty now. My mom married her off right out of college to a much older man who had the right pedigree. The marriage lasted two years and Brittany bailed, getting nothing in the divorce settlement. That pissed my mother off even more because in her words, she\u2019d worked damn hard to land a husband for Brittany and the least she could do was suck it up and remain a dutiful wife until her husband died, leaving her a rich widow and the means to funnel money to her parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Josie whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s insane. I mean that\u2019s stuff from some historical saga. I didn\u2019t think there were really people like that in this day and age.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cSorry to burst your bubble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what prompted Brittany\u2019s visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants out,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAs I said, she got nothing in the divorce and she\u2019s been living with my parents ever since. She has a college degree but has never had a job. She came to ask me for help. Primarily financial help, but I think she was looking for an ally. Emotional support as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I set her up in an apartment, got a bank account opened for her with enough cash to last until she starts work. In a few days she\u2019ll take a position in one of my hotels. The rest is up to her. I gave her the means to start a new life, but it\u2019ll be up to her to make it successful. My mother is going to give her shit. She\u2019ll want Brittany back under her thumb where she pulls all the strings. I just hope Brittany has the balls to stand up to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that you did so much for her. She must have felt like she had no one to turn to.\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t. And regardless of how shitty she may have treated me in the past, I do realize that she didn\u2019t really have a choice. Mom wouldn\u2019t have allowed anything else. She seems sincere now, and if she is, then I\u2019ll do whatever I can to help her. I don\u2019t care what my parents and other siblings think of me. Brittany hasn\u2019t gotten to that point yet, but she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther siblings? How many do you have?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree including Brittany. I have two older brothers who are both in their forties and neither one of them can support their families without help from my parents and the old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad. So if you don\u2019t have anything to do with them, how did you make it? I mean you\u2019re obviously successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s your turn,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI\u2019ve spilled my guts and so far all I know about you is that your dad is an asshole and your mother passed away after a long battle with cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you ask a question as soon as you answer my last one.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow at her. \u201cThen I get two because you\u2019re already over quota.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched in amusement. \u201cDo you have any idea how sterile this conversation is with all the talk of keeping score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be. And okay, I\u2019ll answer, but this is the last one until you catch up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI became friends with Gabe Hamilton and Jace Crestwell in college. Jace\u2019s parents were killed in an accident when he was twenty and he had to take over caring for his much younger sister. Our focus changed after that. Before we had a fuck-it attitude and while we made the grades, we were more concerned with beer and women. We formed our business as soon as we were out of college. We started with a single hotel. Poured our heart and soul into it, and every penny we could scrape up or borrow. We waited a year before we expanded. Using the first hotel as collateral, we were able to secure financing for another property. From there, using the early hotels and their success, we expanded rapidly and began to have an easier time finding investors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your family had nothing to do with your success, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take a dime from them. Didn\u2019t want the strings attached. And I wanted them to have no part of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess they didn\u2019t take that very well,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNope. They were pissed that A: I made it without them and B: I don\u2019t give them money. It\u2019s kind of like if your dad showed up tomorrow and wanted you to be one big happy family.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew stormy and her lips tightened at the mention of her father.</p><p>He leaned forward, sliding his hand across the table to cover hers once more. A muscle jumped in her arm and she shivered, chill bumps forming and racing across her skin.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn to ask you twenty questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t ask you twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOkay, okay. Ask away.\u201d</p><p>His gaze immediately went to her neck. To that pale ring where the collar had rested. It had been the first thing he\u2019d noticed when she\u2019d walked out of the pawnshop, and he hadn\u2019t dared to get his hopes up. But the fact that she\u2019d accepted his dinner invitation, even if he\u2019d blackmailed her, and that she didn\u2019t wear the collar tonight as a barrier between them, told him that she was at least intrigued by this thing between them. Whatever the hell it was.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing the collar?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her free hand went immediately to her neck, and consternation shone brightly in her eyes. But she remained quiet, lips firmly pressed together.</p><p>\u201cJosie? Why aren\u2019t you wearing the collar?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not seeing him anymore.\u201d</p><p>He had to work hard not to react to that piece of news. He\u2019d suspected as much, but he hadn\u2019t wanted to jump to any conclusions.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand away from his, dropping it into her lap. She looked down, refusing to meet his gaze. He waited, not letting her off the hook. This was too important. He wanted to know everything.</p><p>\u201cDid you break it off or did he?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me why? What happened, Josie?\u201d</p><p>Her head popped up, her eyes flashing. \u201cYou\u2019re what happened, Ash. You.\u201d</p><p>Chapter seven</p><p>There was no faking Ash\u2019s surprise. She\u2019d definitely caught him off guard with her outburst. His eyes narrowed and he leaned farther over the table. He was still holding one hand, and he covered her free one, his palm sliding over the tops of her knuckles.</p><p>The man was lethal. With every touch, he seduced her, and she doubted he even knew it. Or maybe he did. Maybe he knew exactly what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cBecause if I did, you\u2019d be in my bed right now.\u201d</p><p>His voice was a husky growl, sliding over her skin until the hairs at her nape stood on end.</p><p>She tried to pull her hands away, but he held firm, not allowing her to escape.</p><p>\u201cYou happened,\u201d she refuted. \u201cThat day in the park. You made me question everything. And I didn\u2019t like what I discovered as a result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that being?\u201d</p><p>She shifted, uncomfortable with his close scrutiny. She didn\u2019t want to be having this conversation. It was too intimate. It was too . . . revealing. Ash was a man that if you gave him an inch, he\u2019d take a mile.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I make you question, Josie?\u201d</p><p>It was equally clear that he wasn\u2019t going to back down.</p><p>\u201cWhat that collar signified,\u201d she said, finally relenting.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d he prompted gently.</p><p>She blew out a deep breath. \u201cThe things you said, what the collar meant to you and what it should mean to me. I realized that. After. I thought about it a lot. And when I went to see Michael to find out what that collar meant to him, he didn\u2019t even notice I wasn\u2019t wearing it. Now, maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I\u2019d think a man wouldn\u2019t like the fact that a woman took the collar off. I mean if it\u2019s supposed to mean everything you implied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game for him. Maybe it was for me too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe told me I was taking things too seriously. That the collar was fun, but meaningless. It\u2019s like he was role-playing and none of it was real. And when I realized that, I also recognized that I didn\u2019t want a game. But at the same time, I don\u2019t know if I want it to be real. I think . . . with you . . . that it would be very different. With a man like you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not meaningless,\u201d Ash growled, his face drawn into a scowl. \u201cAnd hell yes it would be different with me. But you know what? It would be real. And it would mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would it mean?\u201d she asked, her lips trembling as she stared back at the intensity in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt would mean you belong to me. Only to me. That you would submit to me. That I\u2019d take care of you, provide for you, make love to you.\u201d</p><p>He could have no idea the effect his words had. That they reached deep inside her and called to a part of her she hadn\u2019t known existed. With Michael, it had been a game. She could see that now. Two people playacting. Going through the motions for a thrill. There was nothing wrong with that, but it wasn\u2019t what she wanted.</p><p>But the thought of being with Ash, of belonging to him in the sense he was talking about, scared her. He was overwhelming in every sense of the word.</p><p>\u201cI think you know I want you, Josie. I certainly haven\u2019t made it a secret. The question is whether or not you want me and what I can give you. But you also need to think about all I would take. Because I take a lot. I give more, but I take everything.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, her hands trembling beneath his. He curled his fingers tighter around her hands and squeezed gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAt least give me that.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, her chest rising and falling with her rapid breaths. Saying she\u2019d think about it wasn\u2019t a commitment. There was nothing to say that she had to go through with anything. And she did need time to consider what she was getting herself into.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she finally conceded.</p><p>Satisfaction, no, triumph gleamed brightly in his eyes. He acted as though she\u2019d already agreed. Maybe he thought she had by saying she\u2019d think about it. Or maybe he just didn\u2019t like taking no for an answer.</p><p>The waiter returned bearing their entrees. Ash quieted until the plates had been served and the waiter retreated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow, tell me more about you. You\u2019re an artist, obviously.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not even tasting the food she put in her mouth. The steak smelled delicious and was so tender she could cut it with her fork. But the moment she put it on her tongue, the taste didn\u2019t register. She was too preoccupied with Ash, and the proposition he\u2019d put before her.</p><p>\u201cAre you able to make a living at it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It was a personal question, but then Ash didn\u2019t seem the sort of man who worried too much about propriety or boundaries.</p> <p>\u201cMore so now,\u201d she said ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to make it. It\u2019s not always easy. But I\u2019ve tried regular nine-to-five jobs. I don\u2019t have a passion for it. Not like I do for my art. I\u2019ve sold a few pieces here and there and I design jewelry and sell it over the Internet. I make enough to pay my rent. Most times,\u201d she added with a grimace. \u201cThis month was lean for me. Internet orders, which are usually steady, were down and I hadn\u2019t sold any of the art I display in a gallery in the last six weeks. That\u2019s why I went to the pawnshop to sell my mother\u2019s jewelry. I hated it, but I didn\u2019t see another way of paying my bills. I could have gotten a loan, but that doesn\u2019t do me any good if I don\u2019t have the money to pay it and the interest off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell was Michael in all of this?\u201d Ash demanded.</p><p>She blinked at the ferocity in his gaze, the anger she saw brimming in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s lips twitched in annoyance. \u201cYou were having financial trouble, which forced you to choose between selling your mother\u2019s jewelry, something that obviously means a lot to you, or not being able to pay your rent and ending up without a place to live. Michael should have helped you.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like that. I don\u2019t want him to support me. He makes good money, but our relationship wasn\u2019t about that. I couldn\u2019t take money from him. It would be too much like he was paying me for sex.\u201d</p><p>Ash looked even more annoyed. \u201cYou have some fucked-up reasoning, Josie. If it was a choice between you being on the streets or taking money from a man who damn well should have protected you better then there\u2019s no question that he should have provided for you. You shouldn\u2019t have had to ask. If he was involved with you, if he was your Dom and he knew what he should about you then he would have known that you were in trouble. He should have known you were in a fucking pawnshop hocking jewelry to make ends meet. And he damn sure should have stepped in and taken care of you. If he treated you like he was supposed to, you wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable with him helping you. You should have complete trust in the man you\u2019ve given yourself to. And he should cherish that gift by making sure you have no worries, financial or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I never looked at it that way,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he said.</p><p>The determination in his voice made her go still. He was so sure of himself. Of her. Of there being an eventual \u201cus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your food?\u201d he asked, shifting the conversation in a completely different direction.</p> <p>She stared down at her plate, realizing the steak was halffinished and she had no memory of eating what was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cExcellent actually. I\u2019ve never eaten here before. It\u2019s too rich for my blood. What made you choose it?\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted. \u201cI own the hotel, so it\u2019s only natural that I\u2019d have a restaurant in it that I love to eat at. I\u2019m glad the steak was to your liking.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw went slack. \u201cYou own this hotel?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow went up. \u201cYou sound surprised. I told you that my partners and I own several hotels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I thought you meant like a hotel chain or something small. This hotel is . . .\u201d She grasped for the right word to keep from sounding like a complete moron.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so glitzy and obviously caters to the wealthy. I guess I thought you owned something on a much smaller scale,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. It just took me by surprise. I mean you look like you\u2019re wealthy, but maybe I wasn\u2019t thinking you were this successful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that if you agree to what I\u2019ve proposed that it makes you a gold digger?\u201d</p><p>He nailed it with one shot. The man was far too adept at reading her mind.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say that I\u2019m not in your league. Anyone looking at the two of us would immediately label me an opportunist. No one would ever believe that I wasn\u2019t with you for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you be?\u201d he asked bluntly.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t suppress her reaction. Her lips thinned and the corners dropped down in a frown.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I don\u2019t want or need you to support me, Ash. I don\u2019t want your money. I want . . .\u201d</p><p>She broke off in horror at what she\u2019d almost said. But Ash didn\u2019t miss it and his gaze became all the more intense.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction gleamed in his eyes and a slow smile worked over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThen you need to deal, Josie. Because with me comes all that I can give you, and it will not make me happy if you refuse anything I choose to give you or do for you. As long as you and I know the score, I don\u2019t give a fuck what anyone else thinks and neither should you.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, his earlier words coming back to her. She had wanted to question him then, but the moment hadn\u2019t seemed right and then the food arrived. But the question was burning on her lips, and she had to know.</p><p>\u201cYou said earlier . . . I mean, when you said you\u2019d give but that you\u2019d take. A lot. What did you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cYou in my bed. You in my space. You under my protection. I\u2019d take everything, Josie, and you\u2019d give it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem very equal,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cNothing I can ever give you could compare to your gift of submission. The gift of your trust. Nothing is more valuable than that, and you can\u2019t put a price tag on that kind of gift. I\u2019d spend all my time catching up, because hell no it\u2019s not equal. What you\u2019d give me far surpasses anything I could give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you also be giving me yourself? I mean you said I\u2019d give myself to you, but you\u2019d give me you in return, right?\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment, still staring intently into her eyes. \u201cYou get me. All of me. What I choose to give you. Nothing more. And you have to understand that. If that bothers you, then you have to deal or make a decision because I can\u2019t give you more.\u201d</p><p>She digested his words for a long moment and then glanced back up at him, her brow creased as she plunged ahead with her next question, or rather, condition. He might not take it very well, but she couldn\u2019t even consider this if he refused.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t share you with another woman,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean if we do this, I won\u2019t tolerate you being with another woman. I don\u2019t know how this works. If you have other women like me. But I don\u2019t want to ever worry that you\u2019re with someone else. Because if I give you everything you\u2019re demanding, especially my trust, then I\u2019d expect you to be faithful to me for however long this lasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of sleeping with another woman or even being with another woman if I have you. Why would I need someone else if you\u2019ve submitted to me and are in my bed? I\u2019d never give you that kind of disrespect, Josie. Of everything else I give you, respect would be the uppermost. I\u2019d care for you, protect you and cherish you. No other woman would get those things from me.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t at all sure what to say to that. He sounded so . . . decisive. As if their relationship were already a fait accompli.</p><p>He leaned forward, his gaze growing more intense, his tone . . . persuasive. As if he wanted very much for her to render her decision now instead of taking time to think it over.</p><p>\u201cOne thing you need to realize. I\u2019m not more than you, Josie. I get that there is an inequality in power in the relationship. The scales are tipped in my direction. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m more. Never more. You are everything in this equation. You don\u2019t lower your gaze. You don\u2019t ever feel like you\u2019re less, because that\u2019s going to piss me off. You don\u2019t kneel unless that\u2019s what I want when you\u2019re sucking my dick. I make the decisions. You submit to me. But that doesn\u2019t make me more and you less. It makes you everything. And your power over me is far greater than any perceived power I have over you. You talk about what I give you and what you give me. Without me, you\u2019ll be fine. You can make it on your own. You\u2019ve proven that. But without you, I have nothing because money, wealth, power, it doesn\u2019t mean anything without someone to share it with. So maybe my need of you is greater than your need of me. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to do everything in my power to make you need me every bit as much as I need you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at his impassioned speech. Holy crap, did he mean that? All of it? \u201cYou need me?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He released her hand and leaned back, dragging his own hand through his hair in agitation. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it. This thing, whatever it is between us. But yeah, I need you. I\u2019m not even sure need is the right word because it\u2019s such an inadequate word for the insane urge I have to be with you. To have you. To have your submission. It\u2019s never been like that with another woman. It\u2019s something I want. It\u2019s something I desire. It\u2019s something I enjoy. But with you I need it and if I don\u2019t have it, I\u2019m going to lose my fucking mind. So yeah, I need you, Josie. And that\u2019s putting it mildly. And if that scares you, I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t be any other way with you. I\u2019m shooting you straight. I\u2019ll try not to overwhelm you, but I only know one way with you. Full-on, no holding back.\u201d</p><p>She was speechless. She had no idea how to even respond. This was crazy. All of it. They\u2019d only seen each other twice before tonight. How could he possibly have determined that she was someone he needed when they knew next to nothing about each other? For that matter, how could she feel like she needed him?</p><p>\u201cAnother thing you need to know,\u201d he said before she could respond. \u201cI don\u2019t deal in fantasies, Josie. I deal with reality. And maybe your fantasy is my reality and that\u2019s okay as long as you realize at the end of the day the fantasy becomes reality. What we do is real. It\u2019s here. Solid. It\u2019s not going away tomorrow or the next day. You need to be sure you can deal with that because yeah, I\u2019ll give you the fantasy but it\u2019s going to be real. No made-up shit you only dream about in your head. Are you prepared for that? Can you deal with this being real and permanent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how? I mean I understand where you\u2019re coming from about the line between fantasy and reality. I get that Michael obviously wanted a game. It wasn\u2019t real with him, and I realized I didn\u2019t want to play a game. But if I\u2019m not even sure of what I want, how can you be expected to know?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached over to slide his palm over her hand again. \u201cThat\u2019s my job. Yours is to submit, to give freely of yourself. My job is to be in tune with your needs and desires, to know them better than my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds too good to be true,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou say this isn\u2019t fantasy. That it would be real with you, but it sounds like fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t know unless you take the plunge. But believe me when I say this is no game. If you submit to me, you\u2019ll know it\u2019s real. No playacting. No silly games. You\u2019ll feel that to your bones. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to say yes. To take the plunge as he labeled it. But it would be stupid of her not to take time to think about it, preferably when he wasn\u2019t sitting across from her seducing her with every look, every touch and every word that came out of his mouth.</p><p>There was no doubt that he called to a part of her soul that had never been stirred. He made her want things she\u2019d never considered. She knew without a doubt that a relationship with him would be far different than what she\u2019d had with Michael. And she wasn\u2019t entirely certain she could handle that. Ash was an overwhelming presence. He in turns frightened her and intrigued her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d she said in a quiet voice. \u201cI need time, Ash. This is . . . heavy. It\u2019s a huge decision and one I can\u2019t make lightly. I wouldn\u2019t want to disrespect you by agreeing and then immediately balking at the terms of our relationship. If I agree then I have to know that I\u2019m capable of giving you all the things you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you time,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that you won\u2019t take too long, but also know there is no time limit on your decision. I\u2019m not going to take up with another woman in a week because you haven\u2019t given me your decision. You need to know there is no other woman. No one I\u2019m considering. The other thing you need to know is that I don\u2019t make this offer lightly. In fact, I\u2019ve never asked another woman for this kind of relationship.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brow furrowed. \u201cBut you said this is who you are. What you are. How can you never have asked another woman for these things? I doubt you\u2019ve been celibate forever.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, indeed not. The women I\u2019ve been with all knew the score. What I expected and what I\u2019d take. But I never considered those actual relationships, because going in, she and I both knew it was very temporary. Hardly what I\u2019d call an actual relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t be temporary?\u201d she asked, voicing perhaps her biggest fear. That he\u2019d grow tired of her in a week\u2019s time and simply move on to someone else.</p><p>But then what was she expecting? What was she even asking for? Something long-term? How could she ask that of him when she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted something more permanent? It was a huge leap to be making. It was possible that she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the demands he made. And yet, the idea of him only wanting a temporary fling unsettled her.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say with any authority what you\u2019ll be, Josie,\u201d he said in a quiet voice. \u201cBut what I can say is that no, you most certainly will not be temporary. I intend to keep you for a very long time. And if it makes you feel better, I\u2019ve never asked a woman for anything longer than a few weeks, and none of those women had the hold on me that you already have.\u201d</p><p>Warmth traveled through her veins, sending pleasure into her chest. It was silly. This giddy feeling that she was somehow more to him than any other woman. But what woman didn\u2019t like to feel that way about the man she was with?</p><p>No matter what the future had in store for them and any relationship they entered, she was comforted by the thought that for whatever reason, he felt for her what he hadn\u2019t felt for another woman.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take long,\u201d she said. \u201cJust give me a few days to sort it all out in my head.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll give you my cell number. When you\u2019ve had time to consider everything I\u2019ve said, call me and we\u2019ll have dinner in my apartment. Then, if you\u2019ve agreed, we\u2019ll go over the terms, or rather my expectations.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we do that before I make my decision?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s where trust has to enter, Josie. Consider what I\u2019ve told you, how it will be, and then when you say yes, we\u2019ll go over the more intimate details of our arrangement.\u201d</p><p>Chapter eight</p><p>Ash wasn\u2019t someone who liked waiting around. Especially for something he wanted. He was too used to getting what he wanted, when he wanted. No wasn\u2019t a word in his vocabulary and the more time that passed since his dinner with Josie, the more on edge he felt.</p><p>Not even the situation with Brittany had been able to distract him from his preoccupation with Josie.</p><p>His sister had settled into her apartment and had reported to work at the Bentley in their administration. So far she seemed to be doing well. He received regular reports about Brittany from the manager, who was satisfied with her performance so far. He\u2019d commented that she was punctual, a hard worker and seemed eager to make her job a success.</p> <p>Tonight he had dinner plans with Brittany, and he would have looked forward to it were it not for the fact he had yet to hear from Josie. It had been a week since their dinner, and he\u2019d been very confident that he\u2019d hear from her in a matter of days. He\u2019d seen the look in her eyes. She was intrigued. She was obviously attracted to him. And the things he\u2019d offered seemed to appeal to her.</p><p>So why was it taking so damn long for her to respond? Or did she even plan to? Maybe she\u2019d gotten home and immediately talked herself out of a relationship with him.</p><p>He knew he should have pressed for an answer the night they\u2019d gone to dinner. She\u2019d been precariously close to consent. He\u2019d seen it in her eyes and in her body language. Whether she consciously realized it or not, she wanted him and she wanted the kind of relationship he proposed.</p><p>This was new territory for him. Never had he been in a position where he had to wait for a woman to make up her mind whether she wanted to be with him. The women he\u2019d been with in the past hadn\u2019t hesitated even a minute. They\u2019d been all too eager to hook up with him, no matter how long things lasted.</p><p>And in fact, there had been several who hadn\u2019t gotten the message that they were over. The last woman he and Jace had been together with\u2014not counting Bethany\u2014had not taken the end of her fling with him and Jace well at all. She\u2019d been pissed and acted very much the woman scorned even though he and Jace had made it abundantly clear that it was a temporary arrangement.</p><p>He replayed the evening Josie and he had dinner. Yes, he\u2019d definitely been blunt and straightforward. Maybe that scared her. Maybe he\u2019d come on too strong too quickly. But he didn\u2019t want to mislead her. He wanted her to know exactly what she was getting into with a relationship with him.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>Ash looked up to see Jace standing in the doorway of his office. Ash motioned him in and Jace sauntered toward the desk, closing the door behind him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet lately. Anything wrong? How has the fallout over Brittany\u2019s defection been?\u201d</p><p>Ash rolled his eyes. \u201cPredictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>Jace took a seat across from Ash and pinned him with an inquisitive stare.</p><p>\u201cOh, you know my dear old mother and father. Dad is too much of a spineless wimp to do or say much of anything. He just toes the line with Mom and whatever she says goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey been giving her shit?\u201d Jace asked with a scowl.</p><p>\u201cWell, they showed up at the apartment you\u2019re letting her use. Ordered her home and told her to quit being a child. This is a thirty-year-old woman my mother was dressing down, mind you. When Brittany refused, Mom wanted to know how she afforded the apartment she was living in and how she was making it on her own. Brittany told her it was none of her business how she got the apartment and that she was making it like most people made it. By working.\u201d</p><p>Jace chuckled. \u201cGood for her. Wouldn\u2019t have thought she had it in her to stand up to the wicked bitch of the east.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe either to be honest,\u201d Ash admitted. \u201cBut she seems determined to make a break from the family. I\u2019m proud of her. Mom can be intimidating and you have to understand until recently Brittany has always done what Mom wanted her to. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be a hard adjustment for her,\u201d Jace said in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having dinner with her tonight. You and Bethany want to join us? I\u2019d like Brittany to meet Bethany. Brittany hasn\u2019t associated with the best female friends. They were never her real friends and Brittany knows that. When the chips are down, they aren\u2019t riding to her rescue. They dropped her like a hot brick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll call Bethany and make sure we don\u2019t have other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Will be nice to take my mind off other things.\u201d</p><p>Too late he realized how telling that statement would be, and the last thing he wanted was to discuss it with Jace, who would most definitely latch on to it and wouldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>\u201cAnything you need help with?\u201d Jace asked, his brow wrinkled with concern.</p><p>\u201cNah. Not unless you have a way of making a woman acquiesce to your demands.\u201d</p><p>At that Jace\u2019s eyebrow lifted. \u201cA woman? Do tell. This has to be worth the price of admission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Ash muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s being difficult.\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed. \u201cShow me one woman who isn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBethany,\u201d Ash pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky son of a bitch to have her. She\u2019d give you the moon and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem with your woman du jour?\u201d</p><p>Ash scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. She\u2019s not just any woman. I don\u2019t know, man. She hits buttons that a woman has never pushed for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shit. It\u2019s happened,\u201d Jace crowed. \u201cThe smug son of a bitch who gave me and Gabe so much grief has finally fallen hard and from the sounds of it she isn\u2019t exactly reciprocating.\u201d</p><p>Ash flipped up his middle finger. \u201cIt\u2019s too early for that. She just intrigues me. I want her,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get her in my bed. The problem is, she isn\u2019t exactly tripping over herself to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow this is hilarious. Women kill themselves to get next to you. You\u2019re the charming one. Not as hard-ass as Gabe and I are.\u201d</p><p>Ash barely held back the snort. His friends were sadly mistaken on that score. He might give the appearance of being the easygoing, laid-back one, but when it came to women, what he wanted, what he needed? There was no charm, no being laid-back. It had been years since he\u2019d let that part of himself go with a woman. He still remembered her fondly. He\u2019d just turned thirty. She was a few years younger than him. They both wanted and enjoyed the same things and when he\u2019d actually let her see him for what he was, she hadn\u2019t balked.</p><p>He still thought of Cammie from time to time. Wondered where she was. If she was married with children. And wondered if she\u2019d found a man to satisfy her submissive streak.</p><p>She and Ash had parted as friends. She\u2019d wanted more than he could give her. At the time he was solidly married to his career, trying to make HCM into what it was today. She wanted to settle down, have a family, live the American dream. And Ash hadn\u2019t been prepared to do that.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that he minded the idea of marriage to her. She was a beautiful woman, fun to be with. He could have grown to love her. He knew that. But he\u2019d wanted to wait. He hadn\u2019t wanted to marry her when he wasn\u2019t absolutely certain he could provide for her every need.</p><p>Now? Marriage and commitment seemed to be the next logical step. Gabe and Jace had taken the plunge. They were all at a point in their careers where they could step back, relax, focus on things other than business.</p><p>But while Gabe and Jace had found that perfect woman, someone who embraced and accepted the kind of men they were and loved them in spite of their imperfections, Ash hadn\u2019t yet met a woman who fulfilled the parts of his heart that weren\u2019t satisfied by his career and good friends.</p><p>\u201cShe wants me,\u201d Ash said. \u201cShe wants what I can give her, but as much as I can see that she wants it, she\u2019s hesitant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know patience isn\u2019t one of your virtues, but perhaps this is one time you need to get acquainted with the concept.\u201d</p><p>The heavy amusement in Jace\u2019s voice just made Ash grumpy. Patience? Definitely not one of his virtues. And he definitely wasn\u2019t going to start getting up-close and personal with the idea now of all times. Not when he wanted something as badly as he wanted Josie.</p><p>And he still couldn\u2019t explain it. Obsession. It was a word he\u2019d associated with Jace when it came to Bethany, and Ash had come down hard on Jace for it. He hadn\u2019t understood it. He\u2019d even tried to talk Jace down, going as far as doing a background check on Bethany and then warning Jace off.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t one of his better moves, because Bethany had been the best thing that had ever happened to Jace. It was a good thing his friend hadn\u2019t listened to Ash\u2019s advice, and now that Ash found himself in a similar predicament, he could well understand Jace\u2019s uncharacteristic reaction to Bethany.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d Ash said, his tone serious. \u201cIn the beginning with Bethany. Did you sit back and wait or did you move in, take charge and take over?\u201d</p><p>Jace winced, his face contorting with a grimace.</p><p>\u201cI tried at first to be patient, take things slow. But that lasted a very short period of time. I wanted to give her time to adjust. I mean, her circumstances were different than most. It made me crazy to think of her not having a place to sleep, and when I moved her into Mia\u2019s old apartment it made me crazy because she wasn\u2019t with me all the time even though we were together every day. But I wanted her in my apartment. As long as she was living somewhere else, I didn\u2019t feel like she was completely mine. It sounds nuts but I wanted to know where she was every minute. It makes me sound like a fucking stalker, and maybe that\u2019s what I was. Hell if I know. I just knew that I wanted her with me. Every day. In my apartment when I got home. In my bed every night. Not in another apartment where she could bolt at any time even though I had men on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that didn\u2019t work out too well if I remember right,\u201d Ash said dryly. \u201cDidn\u2019t she bail on them and disappear for a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn entire day,\u201d Jace muttered. \u201cHell, I thought she\u2019d left me or walked out, but all she did was go find Jack, and I still get tense just thinking of all that could have happened to her in those few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get it then,\u201d Ash admitted. \u201cI thought you\u2019d lost your mind. But I get it now, because I feel the same way about Josie. And it\u2019s crazy. We\u2019ve only seen each other a few times and had only one date where we actually spent more than a few minutes in each other\u2019s company. I\u2019m still kicking myself for not pressing her harder at dinner. She was so close to agreeing, but the dumbass that I am, I backed off because I didn\u2019t want to overwhelm her, so I granted her wish for time to think. Well, that was a fucking week ago and I haven\u2019t heard shit since our dinner.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jace\u2019s face crinkled in sympathy. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have plans tonight with Brittany, and you and Bethany if you can make it, but tomorrow I\u2019m employing a full-court press. I\u2019m done sitting back and being patient. If she\u2019s going to tell me no, I at least want to hear it from her lips instead of enduring this prolonged silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck man. I hope it works out for you. And at the risk of being a total hypocrite since I got in your face for checking up on Bethany, have you checked Josie out?\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cYeah, I did. After our first meeting in the park. No skeletons in her closet that I uncovered anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, well, if there\u2019s anything I can do, you know you only have to ask. If you get her to agree, we\u2019ll have to hook up, and when Gabe and Mia get back from their honeymoon, we can all get together. You can introduce Josie to Mia and Bethany. They have a good group of girlfriends, and I\u2019ll tell you from experience, when they have their girls\u2019 nights out?\u201d He broke off and a shit-eating grin attacked his face.</p><p>Ash held up his hand with a groan. \u201cI know, I know. You\u2019ve already regaled me with the details of drunk, sexy women in fuck-me shoes wanting to be fucked in those fuck-me shoes. No need to torture me further.\u201d</p><p>Jace laughed and then rose. \u201cLet me go call Bethany. I\u2019ll let you know about tonight. Where we eating and what time? I just need to give her a heads-up so she can be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the Bryant Park Grill right after work?\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cSounds good. We\u2019ll see you there.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter nine</p><p>Brittany was noticeably nervous at dinner, though Bethany was a complete doll, easing the awkwardness and treating Brittany like a long-lost friend.</p><p>The Bryant Park Grill was hopping, as it was every day right after work hours. It was filled with suits, businessmen and women enjoying cocktails after a day at work. It was a popular after-work haunt, but that wasn\u2019t why Ash chose it.</p><p>He\u2019d chosen it because he thought he might see Josie there. But according to the man Ash had assigned to keep tabs on Josie, she hadn\u2019t been out of her apartment at all for several days.</p><p>Maybe she was working furiously to finish a new piece of art for the gallery. Maybe she wasn\u2019t giving his proposition a moment\u2019s thought. He\u2019d told Jace he\u2019d give her until tomorrow, but he was only half paying attention to the dinner conversation because he was tempted to go to Josie\u2019s apartment unannounced.</p><p>Patience. Jace had said to have patience. Ash nearly snorted over the hypocrisy of that statement, even if Jace had admitted it.</p> <p>Their food was served, and Brittany had finally relaxed, even smiling in Ash\u2019s direction. At one point she leaned toward him so only he would hear and said, \u201cThank you, Ash. You can\u2019t know what this means to me. You\u2019re the only family I have now. The others have cut all ties. They treat me like I\u2019m some sort of traitor for wanting to have my own life. You understood what I wanted and needed and you didn\u2019t judge me for it.\u201d</p><p>Ash smiled. \u201cJoin the outcast club. It\u2019s not so bad really. The longer you remain away from them, the more perspective you\u2019ll gain and you\u2019ll realize that this is something you would have been happier doing a lot sooner. But you\u2019ve done it, and that\u2019s all that counts. It\u2019ll get easier. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d she asked in an earnest voice. \u201cI mean does it bother you that they treat you like an outsider? That they have such disdain for you and your success?\u201d</p><p>Ash shrugged. \u201cIt did in the beginning I suppose. I haven\u2019t given it much thought over the last few years. I have good friends and they\u2019re my family. And now you.\u201d</p><p>Her face lit up, the shadows chased from her eyes in a flash. \u201cI\u2019m glad we can be family, Ash. I really mean that. I\u2019m not going to let you down. I know I didn\u2019t get the job on my own, but I\u2019m not going to make you regret giving it to me.\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted by the ringing of Ash\u2019s cell phone. He reached automatically for it, holding his breath without realizing at first that he was doing so. It could be Josie. He\u2019d waited a damn week for something, anything from her.</p><p>But when he looked at the incoming name, he frowned. It wasn\u2019t Josie. It was the man assigned to Josie.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I have to take this,\u201d Ash said as he rose, already pushing the button to accept the call.</p> <p>He walked away from the table to a quieter area near the restrooms.</p><p>\u201cAsh,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cMr. McIntyre, I know my reports have been much the same all week. Miss Carlysle hasn\u2019t left her apartment until now and I knew you\u2019d want to know what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ash demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sporting one hell of a black eye. Split lip. Looks like someone took a shot at her. I could be wrong. It could have been an accident, but I doubt it. And it could be why she hasn\u2019t left her apartment.\u201d</p><p>Ash swore. \u201cWhere is she headed now? Are you on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m following her now. Looks like she\u2019s headed to the gallery. She had several canvases when she got into a cab. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d Ash murmured as he hung up.</p><p>He stood for a moment, his mind filled with rage at the idea that someone had abused Josie in some way. And then he cursed the fact that he hadn\u2019t asked his man if Josie had been anywhere or if she\u2019d had visitors. Surely he would have reported it if she had. But then he hadn\u2019t had her shadow back on the job until two days after their dinner. He\u2019d thought she would have contacted him by then and when she hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d put his man back on her to monitor her activities.</p><p>Obsessed? Yeah, that was one word for it. Demented was another. He was acting like a crazed stalker, the kind most women would do well to steer clear of. Only he wasn\u2019t going to harm Josie. But he was kicking himself for not keeping his man on her, because someone had hurt her, or at the very least she\u2019d been injured in some way.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she called him? Why hadn\u2019t she come to him for help? She had to know after their conversation that he would take care of her.</p><p>With a muttered curse he returned to the table where Brittany, Jace and Bethany all looked up at him. Concern immediately flashed in their eyes. His expression must have been grim for them to have picked up on his mood so quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to cut this short, but I have to go. Brittany, I\u2019ll make it up to you soon. Promise. Jace and Bethany, thank you both for coming, and please, all of you finish your dinner. I\u2019ll see you all later.\u201d</p><p>As he turned to walk away, Jace called out to him.</p><p>\u201cAsh? Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Ash sent him a look he knew Jace would pick up on. He\u2019d know it had to do with Josie, and he\u2019d understand. Jace nodded once and then turned back to the women, smiling and engaging them both in conversation.</p><p>Breathing a sigh of relief and knowing he owed Jace for taking over, he picked up the phone to call for his driver. If Josie was going to the gallery, she\u2019d probably go right back home since she hadn\u2019t been anywhere else in the last several days. He\u2019d take care of buying the art she\u2019d taken in later, but right now he was going to be at her apartment waiting for her to return and then they were going to have a serious come-to-Jesus moment.</p><p>Chapter ten</p><p>Josie breathed a sigh of relief as the cab pulled to a stop at the corner of the cross street her apartment was on. She hadn\u2019t wanted to venture out at all, but she\u2019d wanted to get more of her artwork to Mr. Downing. While the money from the sale of her previous works would tide her over for the next few months, she\u2019d wanted to get more to him so the buyer wouldn\u2019t lose interest or think she didn\u2019t have anything else to offer.</p><p>As she paid her fare and stepped out of the cab, she self-consciously put a hand to her bruised cheek and winced when her fingers brushed over the corner of her mouth where her lip had been split. Head down, she hurried down the sidewalk toward her apartment, only wanting to be back inside and out of view of anyone.</p><p>Though she had nothing to be ashamed of, she still felt embarrassed over what had happened. Shocked. Completely and utterly shocked that Michael had come to her apartment and lost his temper, something that had never happened before. She was still in disbelief over it all. She should have pressed charges. She should have done a lot of things, but she\u2019d been too numb to take it all in. So instead she\u2019d sequestered herself in her studio apartment and worked feverishly to take her mind off the events of the last week.</p><p>She knew she owed Ash a response. An explanation. Something! She\u2019d told him she wouldn\u2019t take long, but how could she go to him with bruises inflicted by a man who\u2019d been her dominant?</p><p>Of course, it was laughable now. He wasn\u2019t a true dominant. He\u2019d been playing at it. It was an ego trip for him. He\u2019d become someone completely different the moment he realized she was serious about ending their relationship. Her mistake had been mentioning Ash at all, not that she\u2019d called him by name, but she\u2019d told Michael that he couldn\u2019t give her the things another man had promised her.</p><p>Now she wasn\u2019t so certain. What if Ash was no better? She knew next to nothing about him. She\u2019d been ready to commit, had actually made up her mind to call him the same day Michael had come to her apartment. After that fiasco, she\u2019d harbored doubts and self-preservation had kicked in.</p><p>If Ash was more intense than Michael\u2014and it was evident he definitely was\u2014then could she expect the same kind of treatment at his hands? Or even worse?</p><p>Her head spun with the possibilities and she knew she was in no emotional state to be making such a huge decision. To place her trust, her well-being, her entire self into the hands of a man like Ash. And so she\u2019d remained silent, mulling over her decision, going back and forth.</p><p>The fact was, she was afraid. And that fear had prevented her from either accepting or declining his proposition. And she hated that fear. It wasn\u2019t how she wanted to live her life or make her decisions. She needed a clear head before taking that huge step in trusting another man who could very well turn out just like Michael.</p><p>She heaved an unhappy sigh and reached into her pocket to retrieve the keys to her apartment. Her head was still down when she reached the steps and she saw an expensive pair of shoes directly above the first step leading down to her door.</p><p>Startled, she glanced up to see Ash standing there. As he looked her over, fury blazed in his eyes and she took an instinctive step backward.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>He was seething, anger bristling from him in waves. Gone was any semblance of charm or laid-back calm. He was one huge ball of pissed-off alpha male.</p><p>\u201cPlease, not here,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just want to go inside. Let me by and then leave.\u201d</p><p>His expression of complete what the fuck made her pause as she attempted to push by him. He grasped her shoulders, his grip firm but extremely gentle, his fingers against her skin, but not pressing into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI want to know who the fuck did this to you,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged and she nearly dropped the keys that dangled precariously from her fingers. She tightened her grip and then pushed her chin upward.</p><p>\u201cLet me by,\u201d she said through clenched teeth.</p><p>To her surprise, he dropped his hands and let her go down the steps, but he followed closely behind, giving her no option to go in and shut the door to prevent his entry.</p><p>She sighed as she unlocked her door and pushed it open. She felt better the moment she was inside. Her own space. It was laughable that she felt safe here after what had happened with Michael. But now that she knew just what he was capable of, she\u2019d never make the mistake of letting him within a mile of her.</p><p>She dropped her purse by the door and walked into her tiny living area. Ash closed the door, sliding the deadbolt into place, and then he too entered her living room. A room that suddenly seemed way smaller with him in it. He stood there, staring at her, his gaze relentless as he did a thorough up-and-down of her body, stopping once again on the bruise on her cheek.</p><p>His eyes grew cold and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you,\u201d he began.</p><p>She flushed guiltily and lowered her gaze, not wanting him to see all she wanted to hide.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019m thinking there was a reason you haven\u2019t called me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she nodded, still not meeting his gaze.</p><p>\u201cJosie, look at me.\u201d</p><p>His voice was soft. Gentle even. But it was definitely not a request. It was a command. One she felt compelled to obey.</p><p>Slowly she lifted her head so their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d</p><p>Gone was the gentleness, replaced by an edge of steel to his tone. His entire body vibrated with fury and it made her hesitant to tell him what had happened. How she\u2019d ever thought him not dangerous or perhaps charming or affable she had no clue. Because the man standing in front of her right here, right now, looked capable of terrible things. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it wasn\u2019t that she was afraid of him. No, she knew instinctively, even as she was shrouded in fear over what had already happened to her, that this man would not hurt her. But he was angry. Angry didn\u2019t even begin to describe what she saw in his eyes. And he absolutely looked capable of killing someone. She found herself not wanting to tell him, because she feared not him, but what he\u2019d do.</p><p>\u201cJosie, answer me,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cWho. Did. This. To. You.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to allow her not to tell him. And though she didn\u2019t fear reprisal, she knew she absolutely had to obey him. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to duck the question. She firmly believed he\u2019d stand here all night, do whatever it took to get what he wanted.</p><p>She closed her eyes and exhaled in a long, weary sigh, her shoulders sagging in defeat.</p> <p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she whispered, her voice so low she could barely hear it herself. Maybe she hadn\u2019t even really voiced it.</p><p>\u201cSay that again?\u201d</p><p>The words whipped from his lips, snapping through the air with enough force that she felt them. She chanced a glance up and immediately flinched at the look on his face. It was . . . terrifying.</p><p>\u201cYou heard,\u201d she whispered in only a slightly louder voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that motherfucker put those bruises on your face? That he split your lip?\u201d</p> <p>He advanced and she rapidly took a step backward, which only seemed to piss him off even more.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Josie, I\u2019m not going to hurt you! I\u2019ll never fucking hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The words were explosive. Not exactly soothing and yet she took comfort in the vehemence with which he made the vow. So much so that she took a step back toward him so they now only stood a foot apart.</p><p>His entire body still vibrated with rage. His green eyes were nearly black, the green just a thin ring around the dilated pupils. And then he raised his hands, slowly, as if he feared frightening her. He cupped her face in his palms, his touch infinitely gentle, and she didn\u2019t know how he could possibly pull that off when the rest of his body was taut with fury and his expression was so black.</p><p>But that touch was so exquisitely tender that she literally melted into his hands. She felt no pain even though her face was still painful to touch several days after the incident. He brushed his fingers over the bruise and then traced the split at her lip, so lightly that she nearly didn\u2019t feel it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p> <p>Ash\u2019s voice was absolute. The resolution in his voice made her blood chill in her veins because she believed him. In this moment, she believed him absolutely capable of killing the man who\u2019d hurt her. Her pulse leapt and her breathing accelerated as panic shot down into her belly.</p><p>\u201cNo! Ash, please. Just let it go. This is why I didn\u2019t want to tell you. Why I haven\u2019t called.\u201d</p><p>She would have said more, but he put his finger over the uninjured part of her mouth to silence her.</p><p>\u201cLet it go?\u201d</p><p>His tone was deadly.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to fucking let it go when that motherfucker put his hands on you? What the fuck happened, Josie, and I want every goddamn detail. Nothing left out. I want to know when this happened. I want to know how many times he hit you. And above all, I want to know why the hell you didn\u2019t immediately come to me or call me, the instant this happened.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went slack against his finger. And then, as if he changed his mind entirely, he pulled away, turning to survey her living room, glancing toward the open archway to her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my apartment,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re moving in with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait. What? Ash, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t negotiable, Josie.\u201d His eye glittered with purpose and his stance was rigid, brooking no compromise. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me. Now let\u2019s go into your bedroom. You\u2019re going to sit on the bed and tell me what you need packed for tonight. Tomorrow we can go over what you have to have or want moved to my place and I\u2019ll arrange for someone to come in and have everything brought over. But when we have this conversation about that son of a bitch\u2014and we are having that conversation\u2014it\u2019s going to be in a place where you feel absolutely safe. A place where you know no harm will come to you. That\u2019s in stone.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open even farther, but even amid the utter shock of his proclamation came . . . relief. Comfort. But mostly overwhelming relief. The decision had been wrested from her hands, and at the moment she embraced that. Her worries\u2014fears\u2014surrounding Ash seemed silly now. That she\u2019d even entertained that he might be like Michael or that she would be entering an even worse situation than the one she\u2019d just come from seemed absurd.</p><p>\u201cI can pack my own things,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There was a sudden fire in his eyes. Satisfaction over her capitulation. Maybe he\u2019d expected her to fight it more or even to outright refuse, though she could see he had no intention of backing down.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t pack. What I said was that you\u2019re going to sit on your bed while I do this for you. All I need from you is to tell me what you want for tonight and maybe tomorrow. The rest will be taken care of after you and I have talked later tonight.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Okay. This was moving at supersonic speed. She felt like she\u2019d just gotten off an insane roller-coaster ride and was still trying to gain her bearings.</p><p>He held out his hand to her, not moving to her or taking it on his own. He simply held it out, waiting. Waiting for her to accept. To take his hand and to enter his world.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she reached out, sliding her palm over his upturned one. He gathered her fingers gently in his hand and then squeezed, holding firmly. Like he was forging an unbreakable bond between them.</p><p>Then he pulled her gently toward her bedroom, and she followed, allowing him to lead her inside where he sat her on the edge of the bed as if she were incredibly fragile. Something precious and breakable.</p><p>He backed away and did a quick survey.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an overnight bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the closet,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>She watched in stupefaction as he briskly began to pack under her quiet direction. Didn\u2019t they have it all turned around? He was doing everything for her. What had she done for him? But then, he had said he\u2019d give a lot. But he\u2019d take everything.</p><p>She shivered lightly, wondering just how much he\u2019d take, and if she\u2019d have anything left when he\u2019d taken his fill.</p><p>Chapter eleven</p><p>Ash wasn\u2019t a stupid man. He knew he\u2019d pressured Josie, given her no time to breathe, analyze or react to his arrogant demand. And it had been the height of arrogance to sweep into her apartment and order her to move into his.</p><p>So it was with brisk efficiency that he hurried about his task, because the longer she sat on that bed looking overwhelmed and befuddled, the more time she\u2019d have to reconsider her quiet agreement. Which meant he risked her not coming home with him.</p><p>And that was not an option.</p><p>He packed an overnight bag, called his driver to make sure he\u2019d be waiting outside Josie\u2019s apartment, and then he hustled her toward the door, not giving her any further time to process the whirlwind event.</p><p>After urging Josie into the car, he closed her door and paused only a moment to call his doorman and ask him to go up to Ash\u2019s apartment and take down the painting of Josie from his bedroom and store it, along with the others in his living room, until Ash retrieved them. He didn\u2019t want Josie to know he was the one who\u2019d bought her work. Not yet.</p><p>When he got into the car next to her, he relaxed and then glanced sideways, taking in her pale, shaken face. The bruises pissed him off. Enraged him. The split at the corner of her mouth stood out, a reminder that another man had put his hands on what Ash already considered his. That the man would have put his hands on any woman in such a manner. Not just Ash\u2019s woman, but any woman. But most especially his woman.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is a good idea, Ash,\u201d she said quietly, speaking for the first time since she\u2019d given him hesitant instructions on what to pack for her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very good idea,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cYou would have already come to me if it weren\u2019t for that asshole. You know it and I know it. Now, we still have to address the matter of Michael, and we\u2019ll do it when we\u2019re in a place you feel safe and secure, and you\u2019ll do it in my arms, where you know nothing bad is going to touch you. But know this. What he did doesn\u2019t change one thing about you and me. We\u2019re inevitable, Josie. From that first day in the park, we were inevitable. Fighting is a waste of time and mental energy. I\u2019m not fighting it and I don\u2019t want you fighting it either.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth parted in surprise. Her eyes flashed, not in anger, but in recognition. Good. They were getting somewhere because she was starting to see what he saw. What he knew.</p><p>\u201cNot happy that you kept this from me,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat you didn\u2019t come to me the minute this happened. But we\u2019ll work on that. You weren\u2019t mine yet even if I knew you were. But you are now. And you\u2019ll come to me any time you have a problem.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she nodded, and satisfaction\u2014triumph\u2014gripped him.</p><p>He held out his arm, not liking the distance between them, but not wanting to push her too hard. Not yet. He\u2019d already pushed enough. He wanted her next move to be of her own doing, and so he waited, arm outstretched toward her.</p><p>She came readily, with no hesitation, and he liked that. She slid next to him, burrowing into his side so he could wrap his arm around her. And he did. Anchoring her against him. She laid her head against his chest, the top resting just underneath his chin. He liked her tucked there.</p><p>She gave a soft sigh and then seemed to melt into him, her body sagging as if a great weight had been lifted off. Relief.</p><p>The scent of her hair tantalized him. Soft and sweet, like her. He ran his hand up the length of her arm, enjoying the feel of her skin and knowing that soon, he\u2019d discover all of her flesh. But for now she needed comfort. Safety. A sense of security. She needed to know that he would never hurt her. Never raise his hand to her as Michael had done.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her hair and inhaled even as he pressed the kiss to her head.</p><p>Deep. Yeah, he was in deep. He didn\u2019t even have a fully thought-out plan. He\u2019d acted on instinct. Knew he had to have her. Knew he had to have her in his space. And he knew if he didn\u2019t press now, that he\u2019d likely lose her.</p><p>Overwhelming her seemed the best idea, even if it made him a total bastard. But he wouldn\u2019t compare himself to Michael. He wasn\u2019t that man. He might not be the most understanding, patient and considerate person. And he definitely did not back down when he wanted something. But he\u2019d never, ever raise his hand to a woman. The idea appalled him.</p><p>But he absolutely had no such problem meting violence out on the bastard who\u2019d hurt Josie.</p><p>He shoved that thought aside, because he knew it had to be dealt with later\u2014and it would be dealt with. But Josie came first. Her needs. Her comfort. Starting right now.</p><p>The drive was silent, and Ash did nothing to disturb it. He knew Josie was processing the evening\u2019s events. Knew she was probably having second and third and fourth thoughts. But she was here in his arms, and as long as she was here and not in her apartment, he could fight dirty.</p><p>Instead he simply stroked her skin, sliding his palms up and down her arms, offering her comfort the best way he knew how.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ash,\u201d she said quietly, her words nearly lost against his chest.</p><p>His hands stopped their upward progress and he tilted his head downward so he could better hear her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not calling you. For not responding when I said I would. I was just so freaked out.\u201d</p><p>He slid his fingers underneath her chin and turned her face, tipping it upward so her gaze met his. Then he put a finger over her lips.</p><p>\u201cNot now. And you won\u2019t apologize to me. There\u2019s nothing to apologize for. We\u2019ll talk this out, Josie. I want to hear every word. But not here. For now just sit here with me, and let me hold you. When we get to my apartment, we\u2019ll talk. But even then you won\u2019t apologize for something that was not your doing. I may not have liked that you didn\u2019t reach out to me when you needed someone, but I understand.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was tremulous and warmth entered her eyes, removing some of the uncertainty and anxiety that had taken residence in the aquamarine pools.</p><p>\u201cThere, that\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have such a beautiful smile. I\u2019m going to ensure that you do it more often, Josie. I\u2019m going to make you happy. That\u2019s a guarantee.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, a baffled expression crossing her face. \u201cI\u2019m at a loss, Ash. Things like this just don\u2019t happen. They don\u2019t. A part of me thinks I\u2019ve entered the Twilight Zone. It\u2019s all . . . crazy.\u201d</p><p>He smiled indulgently. \u201cIn my world, they do. Or at least they do now. Can\u2019t say this has ever happened to me either, so we\u2019re both entering new territory. But it\u2019s your world too, Josie. There are no rules but the ones we make ourselves. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever been much of a traditionalist anyway. I\u2019m too much of a \u2018do it my own way and fuck the rest of the world\u2019 kind of guy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her smile broadened, her teeth flashing and an adorable dimple forming in her cheek. It fascinated him. Made him want to trace the indention and then follow it with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of getting that about you. I pity the person that ever tells you that you can\u2019t do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that doesn\u2019t go over too well,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to be the person who pisses you off by telling you no, then.\u201d</p> <p>His smile faded and he stared intently into her eyes. \u201cI hope to hell I never give you reason to tell me no. But if you do, Josie, understand. I won\u2019t ignore that word. Unless it has something to do with your safety or well-being. Or if it means you walking away from me. No is a deal breaker. It means I stop whatever I\u2019m doing. So use it wisely and only if you mean it. Because I take that word very seriously.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went soft and she leaned further into him, her body molding so very temptingly to his. His balls ached, his dick was stiff as a board and his teeth were clenched tight as he sought to control his physical reaction to her nearness.</p><p>This woman did it for him. He had no explanation for why. He barely knew her, but he knew he had to have her. Knew he would have her. Knew they were going to be tangled up and that he had no desire to extricate himself. He also knew that this woman was different from all the women who\u2019d come before her.</p><p>That part scared the shit out of him and excited him all at the same time.</p><p>What if she was the one? That woman who, when a man saw her, he was instantly struck with the knowledge that he was done for. Like Mia was for Gabe. Like Bethany was for Jace. The one.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t even wrap his mind around it. Wasn\u2019t even going there. It was too soon. The entire situation was crazy. He was moving her into his apartment. He was taking over her life. He hadn\u2019t thought beyond that to \u201cwhat next?\u201d</p><p>Because what the hell was next?</p><p>Other than getting Josie in his bed, under his hand, submissive, fully submissive to his every need and desire. Just as he would see to her every need and desire. Wasn\u2019t that enough? It had to be because he wouldn\u2019t let himself think beyond that.</p><p>His driver pulled to a stop on the side street to his apartment building and then got out to open the door for Ash.</p><p>Ash stepped out first, sliding away from Josie and then extending his hand to help her from the backseat. He tucked her into his side and then collected her overnight bag from the driver before hurrying toward the entrance.</p><p>\u201cYou live by the Hudson,\u201d Josie said faintly, staring in the direction of the river.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Nice view from the top. Come on up. Let\u2019s get you inside.\u201d</p><p>They rode the elevator to the top floor and he carried her bag inside, guiding her toward the bedroom. She stiffened slightly when they entered the master suite, and she glanced sideways, caution reflected in her eyes.</p><p>He tossed her bag onto the bed and then pointed toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you time to get changed into what you\u2019re sleeping in. I\u2019ll be in the kitchen fixing you a glass of wine. Take your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I sleeping?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He put his hands to her shoulders and let his palms glide down her shoulders. \u201cIn my bed, Josie. With me.\u201d</p><p>Anxiety crept into her gaze.</p><p>He leaned forward and pressed his lips to her forehead, feeling particularly tender toward her. Perhaps it was the vulnerability. The worry and fear he could see in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we talk, Josie. It will be in my bed. You in my arms. You safe. And you\u2019ll know that. But you\u2019re only sleeping. It\u2019s why you\u2019re changing into your nightclothes. You won\u2019t wear them again, but tonight, you need that barrier because you\u2019re still not sure of me. After tonight, you will be.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her one last time and then he turned, leaving her in his bedroom alone to change.</p><p>He went into the kitchen, taking his time as he took down two glasses and opened a bottle of wine. He remembered that she didn\u2019t drink much in the way of alcohol, but she had mentioned she liked an occasional glass of wine, and it would most certainly help her relax tonight. He didn\u2019t know for certain, but he imagined her to prefer red wine. She\u2019d want something with color. Vibrant and flavorful. Nothing devoid of warmth like white wine.</p><p>He frowned when he realized his own dinner had been interrupted, and since he\u2019d gone straight to Josie\u2019s and met her upon her arrival, it was likely she hadn\u2019t eaten either.</p><p>He rummaged in the fridge for fruit salad and several wedges of gourmet cheese. He arranged a tray, pulling bread and crackers from the pantry to accompany the cheese and fruit. And something sweet. Didn\u2019t all women enjoy chocolate?</p><p>His housekeeper often left him delectable homemade treats, and this week\u2019s offering was chocolate mousse with a cream cheese topping. There were five individual dessert dishes on the top shelf of the fridge, so he pulled two of the single-serving containers out, added them to the tray and then yanked spoons from the drawer.</p><p>Satisfied that he had all the bases covered, and that he\u2019d given Josie enough time to prepare for bed and to get over any nerves she was feeling, he headed back toward the bedroom.</p><p>When he walked in, she was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the bed, and he was absurdly taken by the image of her in his bed. Comfortable, bare feet, like she belonged.</p><p>She was wearing silky, hot pink pajamas. Long-legged and long-sleeved, covering her entire body. Buttoned to the neck.</p><p>He\u2019d give her this tonight. That barrier. But after this, she would come to their bed with nothing. She\u2019d sleep next to him, her skin against his.</p><p>Her eyes widened when she saw the tray he carried and she scrambled up, scooting back off the bed so he could set the tray down.</p><p>\u201cPull back the covers,\u201d he directed. \u201cWe\u2019ll get into bed and I\u2019ll put the tray on the nightstand. You can eat in bed next to me.\u201d</p><p>She hastily pulled back the comforter and the sheet and even plumped the pillows before crawling back onto the mattress.</p><p>As he said, he set the tray down on his side of the bed and then strode toward his closet to strip out of his clothing.</p><p>He faced a dilemma, because he never wore anything but boxers to bed. Then he shrugged. It wasn\u2019t as if he was completely nude, and he\u2019d promised her that she\u2019d only rest in his arms. He wasn\u2019t putting the moves on her, so his boxers would do.</p><p>When he walked back out, he felt her gaze on him even as she tried to hide the fact that she was watching him. It was adorable the way she peeked from underneath her lashes and the color heightened in her cheeks when he crawled onto the bed beside her.</p><p>He offered her the fruit and cheese first and then slipped a glass of wine in her free hand. He offered her bites, enjoying the slight brush of her lips over his fingertips. And she seemed to derive as much pleasure from eating from his hand as he did in feeding her this way.</p><p>A dreamy, contented look entered her eyes, some of the earlier shadows chased away as she relaxed. Tension drifted from her shoulders, and they settled, her entire body going slack.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked huskily, entranced by the provocative image she presented.</p><p>Finally. In his bed. Just inches away. His body screamed at him to take her, to take what was his even as he mentally chastised it for being an impatient asshole.</p><p>\u201cStarved,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten well over the past few days.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened and anger vibrated once more from his body. \u201cYou\u2019ll take better care of yourself from now on. I\u2019ll take better care of you,\u201d he amended.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not solely because of . . . Michael . . . and what happened. I\u2019ve been busy with work.\u201d</p><p>He knew well why, but he asked anyway, because it would seem odd not to, and she was offering information, relaxing around him, and he wanted that. Wanted easy communication. No hesitancy or reserve on her part.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you been working on?\u201d</p><p>Color tinged her cheeks and he glanced curiously at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on an erotic series of paintings. Not too over the top. Tasteful. Sexy but still classy.\u201d</p><p>Excitement gleamed in her eyes as she sat back a moment, refusing further food from his hand.</p><p>\u201cI sold all my work that was exhibited in the art gallery where I sell on consignment! It was the most incredible thing. Mr. Downing had told me he couldn\u2019t take anything else of mine because nothing had sold and I had already brought him the first painting in the series I\u2019m working on. Then he called to tell me the news that not only had he sold everything but that he wanted more! And that a buyer was interested in whatever I brought in. I\u2019ve spent the week working on the rest of that series.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head self-consciously and then peeked back up at him from underneath her lashes.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re self-portraits. I mean, not that you can tell who it is, but I used my likeness in a series of nude poses. I have a . . . tattoo, one I designed myself, and it features prominently in the paintings. I . . . I like them. I think they\u2019re good. I hope the buyer will like them too.\u201d</p><p>There was a note of anxiety at the end of her statement that made his heart clench. Hell yes he\u2019d like them, and he\u2019d be damned if anyone else even got to see them. They would be his. Only his. And only he would see her without her clothing. That was for him and him alone.</p><p>No doubt, Josie was a beautiful woman, and there was also little doubt that men and women alike would be drawn to the paintings. She had talent, no matter what the moron gallery manager had said about her style. It was only a matter of time before others discovered that talent. Ash was just glad he got to those paintings before someone else did. The idea of anyone else having something so intimate of Josie\u2019s made his teeth clench.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your buyer will love them,\u201d he said. Even as he spoke, he made a mental note to call Mr. Downing first thing Monday morning and make damn sure he wrapped and delivered the paintings to Ash\u2019s office. \u201cI\u2019d love to have seen them myself.\u201d</p><p>She blushed but smiled and then said, \u201cPerhaps I can take you down to the gallery to see them. I only just dropped them off. Maybe the buyer won\u2019t have bought them yet. They may sit there for days.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, touching her cheek and letting his fingers travel down her jaw to her neck where he pushed back the long blond strands of her hair. \u201cI\u2019d rather you draw me something new. Something no one but me will see. Perhaps even something a bit more erotic than your other paintings?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and then her brow furrowed as if she were visualizing the painting already. Her lips parted and her breath escaped in an excited rush. He could literally see her painting it in her mind.</p><p>\u201cI have ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do something more personal. I mean, as long as you never displayed it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head solemnly. \u201cNo one but me will ever see it. I\u2019ll treasure whatever you paint for me, Josie. But if you give me you, the sexy you, you can be damn certain it will only be for me and nobody else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured, her face flushed with color and . . . arousal.</p><p>\u201cHave you had enough to eat?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and handed him the half-empty glass of wine. He set it aside and then took the tray to his dresser and left it before returning to the bed. And Josie.</p><p>He climbed in, holding his arm out so she could nestle beside him. They were leaned up against his mound of pillows, her body anchored against his.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me about Michael,\u201d Ash said in an even tone.</p><p>She stiffened against him and for a long moment she was silent. Then she sagged and blew out her breath.</p><p>\u201cI was so wrong about him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI never imagined him capable of something like this. Even during our relationship, when he exerted his . . . dominance . . . it was always done in a restrained, careful manner. He always treated me very carefully. Like he was determined never to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when this occurred?\u201d Ash demanded. \u201cDid you go see him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. He came to me.\u201d</p><p>Ash swore. \u201cYou let him into your apartment?\u201d</p><p>She pushed up and off him, turning so she could look him in the eye. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I have? Ash, we were lovers. He never gave me any reason to believe he\u2019d hurt me. He never lost his temper. Not once. I never even saw him angry. He\u2019s always been very calm and restrained. He came to see me because he didn\u2019t believe I was serious about ending our relationship. He brought the collar back, apologizing, saying that it evidently meant something to me and that he would be aware of that going forward.\u201d</p><p>Ash frowned but didn\u2019t interrupt her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I told him it was over, he demanded to know why.\u201d</p><p>She broke off, glancing away, folding her hands in her lap as she presented her profile to him. He pulled her tighter against him, molding her to his body. He could feel her pulse, how agitated she\u2019d become.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d he asked softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told him that he couldn\u2019t give me the things another man had promised me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ash\u2019s hold tightened further. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe freaked. I mean completely lost it. The words were barely out of my mouth when he slapped me. I was so shocked that I didn\u2019t even know what to do. And then he was standing over me, where I\u2019d fallen, and he hit me again. He wrapped his hands in my hair and accused me of cheating on him. Told me that he\u2019d handled me far too gently. That if he\u2019d been the way he should have with me this would have never happened, that I would have never cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Ash ground out. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him for this.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head violently. \u201cNo! Ash, leave it alone. It\u2019s done with. It\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is!\u201d</p><p>He calmed his breathing and forced the rage from his mind and eased his grip on her arm where his fingers had dug into her skin. She would wear no marks from him. None that weren\u2019t given in passion and tenderness. None that she wouldn\u2019t want to wear.</p><p>\u201cI should have gone to the police,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI should have pressed charges. Had him arrested. But God, I was just in shock. And then I felt so . . . stupid. How could I not have seen this in him? That capacity for violence? How could I have had sex with him and never known what lay underneath his fa\u00e7ade? When I think of what could have happened. I trusted him. Implicitly. I gave him full access to my body. He could have done anything to me. It\u2019s why . . .\u201d</p><p>She broke off, going silent against him. He pushed her hair from her battered cheek and then pressed a kiss to the bruised flesh.</p> <p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s why I didn\u2019t call you. Why I didn\u2019t come to you. Why I didn\u2019t accept what you offered. I was . . . afraid.\u201d</p><p>He tensed, his gaze focusing intently on her. \u201cAfraid of me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded miserably.</p><p>He sucked in his breath. He understood. He didn\u2019t like hearing it, but he understood.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d he said, stroking his hand up her arm. \u201cYou thought because you misjudged him so badly that you couldn\u2019t trust your judgment of me and my intentions.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cI understand, but Josie, you need to get this. I am not Michael.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back up at him, hope stirring in her eyes. She wanted to believe him. Wanted to trust herself and her instincts where he was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI will never hurt you,\u201d he said, the vow coming solemnly from his lips. \u201cIf we have issues, we work them out. And it does not involve me raising my hand to you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he murmured, stretching his other arm to her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate and promptly buried herself against his chest. He wrapped both arms around her and held her close, breathing in her scent.</p><p>\u201cPisses me off that you\u2019ll wear those bruises for several more days. I don\u2019t like seeing them, but more than me not liking to see them is you having to see them and remember him hurting you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. Yet. But you will be,\u201d he promised. \u201cGive me that, Josie. Give me the chance to show you that we\u2019re right together. I get that you\u2019re gun-shy right now and that you\u2019re doubting yourself, but give yourself into my care. Give me that chance. You won\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for a long moment, one that had him on edge as he waited for her acceptance.</p><p>Then she gave it. One simple word, laced with uncertainty but quiet determination.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His own chest caved in a bit. He breathed in and out for several seconds before squeezing her to him.</p><p>\u201cSleep now, Josie. Tomorrow we\u2019ll decide what to do about your apartment.\u201d</p><p>He held her just as he was doing until her body went lax against his and the soft, even sounds of her breathing filled his ears. And still he waited, tense, replaying every word she\u2019d said earlier. The fear in her voice. The self-condemnation. The image of her lying on the floor, Michael standing over her while he hurt her made it impossible for him to sleep.</p><p>It was well past midnight when he quietly picked up his cell phone from the nightstand and punched Jace\u2019s number from his contacts list.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d his friend mumbled into the phone. \u201cThis better be good, Ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need an alibi,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>There was a long silence.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Fuck! What the hell, man? Do you need help? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Ash glanced down at Josie, her eyelashes resting on her cheeks, the shadow of a bruise still on her face.</p><p>\u201cNot now. But soon. Right now Josie needs me. She needs comfort and peace. And she needs to know that I will never hurt her. For now, I\u2019m going to spend every minute making sure she knows this. But then I\u2019m going after the bastard who put these bruises on her face and I\u2019ll need you to help provide an alibi if it becomes necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ash. What the fuck? Someone hurt Josie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ash bit out. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to make sure he never touches her or any woman ever again.\u201d</p><p>Jace blew out his breath over the phone as he grew quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need, man. You have it. Never have to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Ash murmured. \u201cTalk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Chapter twelve</p><p>Josie stirred and tried to stretch but immediately ran into a hard body. Her eyes flew open and she blinked rapidly as confusion ran through her mind. Then she remembered. She was in bed with Ash. In Ash\u2019s apartment. In his arms.</p><p>Her gaze met the hard wall of his chest, saw the rise and fall of that beautiful male flesh. She inhaled, savoring his smell. Her lips were so close that she could easily press her mouth to his skin. And she was tempted.</p><p>But they weren\u2019t lovers waking up after a night making love. They hadn\u2019t had sex at all. Yet. They didn\u2019t know each other at all beyond a few pleasantries and one conversation over dinner.</p><p>And yet she was here in his bed after agreeing to move in with him.</p><p>She closed her eyes and wondered again if she was making the right decision. Her mind and heart argued incessantly, and she still wasn\u2019t sure who was the clear winner. Maybe there wasn\u2019t one. She was going to have to wing this, because there was no clear and easy \u201cright\u201d decision.</p><p>Hesitantly, she lifted her gaze, holding her breath as she looked up to see if he was awake. Her eyes met his and she felt the jolt all the way to her toes. He was definitely awake and he was staring intently at her. As if he could reach in and pluck her thoughts right from her head.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She dipped her head as heat crept over her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cJosie?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back up to see the question in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cThis is hard.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hand up her body, over her arm and then up to tangle in her hair before brushing his fingers over the curve of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cNever said it would be easy. Nothing good ever is.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. And no, Ash would definitely never be easy. Nothing about him was simple or uncomplicated.</p><p>\u201cLike waking up, you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>The statement rumbled from his chest and warmth seeped into her blood, traveling through her body.</p><p>\u201cI liked it too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWant you to feel safe here,\u201d Ash said in a serious tone. \u201cSafe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now give me your mouth so I can tell you good morning properly.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her chin upward and placed her hand against his chest. He flinched beneath her touch, his muscles tight and quivering. She withdrew hastily, but he caught her hand and guided it back to his chest.</p><p>\u201cLike you touching me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll want it often. Just like I\u2019ll be wanting to touch you anytime you\u2019re near me. If we\u2019re in the same room, Josie, I\u2019m going to be touching you.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed her, his warm, sensual mouth working exquisitely over hers.</p><p>It was gentle. Undemanding. Coaxing, almost.</p><p>She sighed into his mouth and relaxed, going limp against him, trapping her hand between their bodies.</p><p>\u201cBeen waiting for this,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou in my bed. Your mouth on mine. You the very first thing I taste in the morning. The last week has driven me crazy, Josie. Waiting for you. For this. And I finally have it. I\u2019m not letting it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting too,\u201d she admitted. And she had. She\u2019d dreamed about it. Wondered how it would feel. And now she knew. It felt . . . right.</p><p>Her earlier worries evaporated. Her questions. Her fears. The idea that she was making the wrong decision. They were gone in a perfect moment of absolute rightness. This was what she wanted. What he could give her. And she wasn\u2019t going to fight it or herself any longer.</p><p>He rolled her onto her back, coming up and over her, his body looming big and strong. He kissed her again, deepening it this time. Allowing his urgency to bleed into her mouth.</p><p>His lips moved strongly over hers, demanding, taking. He stole her breath. She couldn\u2019t breathe because he didn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cI was determined to wait. To be patient,\u201d he rasped out. \u201cCan\u2019t do it, Josie. I have to have you now. Tell me you\u2019re with me. You have to be with me. I can\u2019t be the only one feeling like I\u2019m going to die if I don\u2019t get inside you.\u201d</p><p>His impassioned words cut to her core. She arched into him, inviting him without words. But he stopped, his eyes boring intently into hers. He wanted the words. He demanded them.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cTell me you\u2019re with me, Josie. I want to hear you say it so there\u2019s no doubt that this is what you want. As much as I want you, as much as I have to have you, if you\u2019re not with me, this stops now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d she said breathlessly, her heart surging, adrenaline spiking through her veins.</p><p>\u201cThank fuck,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>He kissed her again, as if he couldn\u2019t stand to have his mouth away from hers for even a moment. Then he reluctantly dragged his head away, his eyes brimming with lust and arousal.</p><p>\u201cNeed to get a condom. We\u2019ll talk about alternatives later, but for now, you have to be protected. And we have to get rid of those pajamas. Pink is you. Definitely your color, but right now, I\u2019m dying to see that tattoo.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as he rolled off her and rummaged in his nightstand drawer. Then he came back to her and pushed his hands underneath her pajama top to the waistband of her bottoms.</p><p>\u201cBeen dying to see it ever since that first day in the park where I got just a glimpse when your shirt came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw it already?\u201d she asked in surprise.</p><p>He smiled, pausing in his downward push of her bottoms. \u201cYeah. Drove me crazy. I\u2019ve been thinking about it. I want to see just how far it extends.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her butt so he could pull her pajamas the rest of the way off. He tossed the bottoms aside and then began working his way up from the last button, slowly opening her top to reveal the rest of her body.</p><p>When he loosened the last button, he pushed the material apart and over her shoulders. She hitched herself upward, wanting to be rid of the top every bit as much as he did. This time it was she who sent the piece of clothing sailing across the room to hit the floor near the bathroom.</p><p>His gaze was riveted to the tattoo. She watched as his eyes tracked downward, following the line of the design to where it flowed over the top of her thigh and disappeared between her legs.</p><p>She shivered at the intensity in that stare. There was a brooding possessiveness. A look that screamed, \u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>Ash turned Josie gently on her side, wanting to see the entirety of the tattoo. It was startling in its vibrancy, a shock of color against pale skin. Done in pinks, oranges, aqua blues that matched her eyes and shades of purple and green.</p><p>It was, as he\u2019d suspected, a flowering vine, but it was rendered in exquisite detail. This was no simple tattoo done in a few hours time. He couldn\u2019t imagine the time it had taken. The patience exerted in getting the design done just right.</p><p>He let his fingers trail over her skin, tracing the lines to where it flared over her hip and then across the top of her thigh before dipping lower, on the inside of her thigh. He turned her again, to her back this time, his fingers resting next to the golden curls covering her mound.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d he said in a low growl. \u201cSpread your legs, Josie. Show me the tattoo and that sweet little pussy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blanked and widened, the pupils flaring and then constricting. But she obeyed instantly, her legs going slack and slowly parting to bare herself to his gaze. He stroked the soft curls, approving of her easy acquiescence.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said, the words thick in his throat. The tattoo, all that sweet, pink, feminine flesh. Josie was beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The intricate design curved around the inside of her thigh, coming to a stop just at the back of her leg. It was a bright, floral blanket over her skin, vibrant like her, a perfect reflection of her personality and artistry.</p><p>There would be plenty of time to exert his dominance, to have her submit in all manner of ways. Today was about their first time together and establishing trust. It was about him taking care of her needs. Pleasuring her. He would be infinitely gentle, because before it was over with, he knew he\u2019d take everything. He\u2019d demand everything. So for this one time, he would give her an experience that would become the basis of their bond.</p><p>He leaned down, pressing his mouth between her breasts. She arched into him, seeking more of his mouth. So he gave her more, kissing a line down to her belly. A soft moan escaped and her stomach clenched and quivered beneath his mouth.</p><p>The anticipation of tasting her intimately had him doing his own amount of quivering. He was walking a razor\u2019s edge. The urge to spread her wider and plunge into her was overwhelming. He wanted to claim her. It was a primitive instinct, one that had ruled his thoughts since the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on her. And now she was here, naked, in his bed. His to do with what he wanted.</p><p>He was going to damn well savor the gift and appreciate it for what it was worth. She\u2019d given him her trust, and he knew how huge that was, given the circumstances.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to the silky hairs over her pussy and then nuzzled deeper, inhaling her scent as he spread her further to his advances. He stroked his fingers through her velvety folds, spreading moisture from her opening up to her clit so his fingers slid more easily and he wouldn\u2019t irritate the sensitive flesh.</p><p>\u201cAsh!\u201d</p><p>His name exploded from her mouth. He loved the way she said it, the sound of his name on her lips. And he knew he could make her even crazier with desire just as soon as he got his mouth where his fingers were.</p><p>Using his fingers to open her to him, he pushed in, swiping his mouth from her entrance to her clit, her wetness like honey on his tongue.</p><p>A ragged moan tore from her throat and suddenly her hand was in his hair, fingers clenching over his scalp. He sucked lightly at her clit, exerting just enough pressure to send spasms of pleasure through her legs. Then he licked downward again, wanting more of her silken, hot dampness.</p><p>His tongue slid inside her, fucking her in slow, sensual strokes. While he may have decided that this time would be all about her and her pleasure, making her writhe beneath him was also his pleasure. He was hard and aching, so aroused that his head was spinning.</p><p>\u201cGive me one,\u201d he said huskily, raising his head to look up her body. \u201cIn my mouth, Josie. Come all over my mouth. I\u2019ll work you back up again. I\u2019ll make it good for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were glazed with passion, her lips red and swollen from his kisses and the fact her teeth had found purchase there while he\u2019d eaten her.</p><p>\u201cYou like my mouth, Josie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou\u2019ve very good with your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou inspire me,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>She moaned again when he slid his tongue back inside her liquid heat. Tasting her from the inside out.</p><p>Deciding to up the tension and get her off with his tongue inside her, he slipped his thumb over her clit, rolling as he continued to lick and suck, acting like his tongue was his dick.</p><p>Her ass came off the bed, bucking upward at the pressure he exerted with his thumb. She went even softer around his tongue. Hot, sleek, spilling into his mouth. He lapped hungrily, greedy for her orgasm.</p><p>With his free hand, he inserted one finger, moving his tongue only long enough to reach inside her, stroke the silky walls and then press deep. She clutched at his finger like a greedy fist, holding on when he withdrew and replaced it once again with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cNow, Josie,\u201d he growled. \u201cGet there.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her with his fingers and his tongue and she went wild beneath him. She let loose a torrent of energy as she quaked around him. Her legs closed against his head, anchoring him in place as he continued to lap hungrily at her. And then a sudden burst of heated honey on his tongue.</p><p>She rolled her hips and bucked as wave after wave of her orgasm washed over them both. Goddamn but his dick was going to be permanently imprinted on the mattress. It was rigid and straining underneath him, hungry for what his mouth was currently getting.</p> <p>He rose up when he sensed her orgasm had faded to the stage where she was too hypersensitive to his continued ministrations. Hunching over her, palms planted on either side of her head so his weight wouldn\u2019t press down on her, he leaned down, angling his head to kiss her. So she could taste herself, so he could share it with her.</p><p>\u201cYour passion. Your sweetness, Josie. Never tasted anything sweeter. It\u2019s you on my tongue and now on your own.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, and it sounded nearly pained but she kissed him back every bit as hungrily. Her nipples were rigid peaks, jutting upward as if begging for his mouth just as her pussy had. He\u2019d get to those next. But first he wanted to sample her mouth and her neck. Then he\u2019d work down to her delectable breasts.</p><p>\u201cCan I touch you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNever have to ask that,\u201d he murmured against her ear. He licked the shell, eliciting a shiver through her body. \u201cI want you touching me often. I\u2019ll never not want it. If you\u2019re with me, I want you touching me. Even if it\u2019s not sexual. I\u2019m a feely person, Josie. Don\u2019t know if that bothers you. Hope to hell it doesn\u2019t. And I don\u2019t give a shit if it\u2019s in public or not. I have no problem with the world knowing you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and slid her hands over his shoulders and then down his back. He goddamn near purred as her nails dug into his skin.</p><p>\u201cI like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it. Michael wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes became troubled, almost as if she realized that it wasn\u2019t likely a good idea to bring him up, especially when Ash was about to get his dick inside her for the first time.</p><p>He made certain his face softened, not wanting her to think she\u2019d made him angry.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemonstrative. He wasn\u2019t into affection. Touching me. Except when we had sex. But only then, and even so, it was very . . . impersonal. But the way you say it sounds . . . nice. Like you want me to be close to you. To touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes I do,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give a fuck who knows it either.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then shivered again when he bent to graze his teeth over the skin just below her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m liking this, Ash,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll of it. And that scares me because it sounds too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad it appeals, Josie. Would suck if it didn\u2019t, because this is who I am and what I offer. It\u2019s not too good to be true. It\u2019s just good. Now let\u2019s focus on the matter at hand. Because if I don\u2019t get my dick inside you soon, it\u2019s going to become very painful for me.\u201d</p><p>She looked alarmed, but he grinned, letting her know he was only half kidding. Because it was pretty damn painful. It had been a long-ass time since he\u2019d sported an erection this long without doing something about it. And eating her sweet pussy while his dick was poking the damn mattress was not an experience he wanted to repeat anytime soon.</p><p>He\u2019d much prefer a sixty-nine, with her sucking him off while he feasted on her. But as with all of the other fantasies he had, it would have to wait. And now that he had her exactly where he wanted, he had all the time in the world to explore every sexual kink he could possibly ever want to pull out of his repertoire.</p><p>He turned his attention to her breasts, and they were perfect breasts. Small without being too small, but not too big either. Just enough swell to make his mouth water, and her nipples were absolutely perfect, pink confections.</p><p>He ran his tongue around one puckered ridge, tracing every detail, licking the point before sucking it strongly into his mouth. Her entire body went rigid, her gasps filling the air and sliding over his ears with a warm buzz.</p><p>\u201cAsh.\u201d</p><p>The way she said his name, he knew she wanted to ask something. He looked up, connecting with her gaze, watching in fascination as the color turned electric, a shock of blue-green awash with desire.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to make you feel as good as you made me feel.\u201d</p><p>He smiled tenderly at her and then leaned down to kiss the corner of her mouth. \u201cYou will. But right now is about you, and me making you go over as many times as I can. Believe me when I say, you\u2019ll get my dick in your mouth soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking forward to it,\u201d she said in a hazy murmur.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he said before lowering his mouth back to her breasts.</p><p>He lazily toyed with her nipples, alternating between them, licking them into hard points before sucking hard with just enough bite to make her let out the most erotic sounds. She wasn\u2019t a quiet lover. She was extremely vocal, a multitude of sounds slipping from her lips, all sexy as hell, the ultimate sounds of female pleasure.</p><p>He groped for the condom he\u2019d taken out, tore the wrapper and then reached down to roll it on. He winced when his hand made contact with his dick. He was so hard and so close to coming that even his own touch was painful.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI will be in just about three seconds,\u201d he murmured back as he slid a finger inside her to gauge her readiness.</p><p>She was still swollen and snug from her orgasm and he broke into a sweat imagining how fucking sweet she was going to feel all closed around his cock, squeezing and milking it for every drop of his release. Shit but he had to get it together or he was going to come in the condom right now.</p><p>Taking deep breaths, he positioned himself over her, nudging her entrance with the head of his dick as he planted his hands on either side of her head.</p><p>\u201cReach down and guide me in,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cWrap your fingers around me and put me inside you, baby.\u201d</p><p>He caught her reaction to the endearment, approval and delight flashing in her eyes. He tucked that little piece of information away and then closed his eyes when her hand found him.</p><p>Her fingers circled his width, stroking up and down as she positioned him at the mouth of her pussy. Sweat broke out on his forehead and he clamped his lips together in an effort to keep it together.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re there, Ash. Come inside me now.\u201d</p><p>Readily, he pushed in, ensuring that he wasn\u2019t too forceful and that she was able to accommodate him easily. She was damn snug, but she stretched, enveloping him as he thrust deeper and harder this time.</p><p>\u201cNow, move your hands and put them above your head against the headboard,\u201d he said.</p><p>She twitched and pulsed in reaction, her pussy going wetter and hotter around him. Slowly, she did as he directed, lifting her hands and then putting them over her head.</p><p>He reared up and then slid his hands underneath her ass so he could hold her and position her so he could get even deeper inside her. He glanced down, drawn by the sight of his cock sliding in and out of her pussy. Then his hands glided from her ass up her legs until he hooked them behind his back, opening her further so she was completely accessible.</p><p>\u201cHow close are you to coming again?\u201d he asked, breathing through his nose as he sought for control.</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I need . . .\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip and broke off, her gaze falling from his.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Her gaze snapped back to his, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhm, for you to touch me.\u201d Color flooded her cheeks and suffused her body, making it delectably pink. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to come from just penetration.\u201d</p><p>He lowered himself, coming to rest on his forearms so his face was just above hers, their mouths precariously close.</p><p>\u201cA lot of women can\u2019t come without clitoral stimulation,\u201d he said gently. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with you. Furthermore, even if it was an oddity, you don\u2019t ever hesitate to tell me what you need in bed. Got it? I can\u2019t please you if I don\u2019t know what turns you on and what doesn\u2019t. And I want you to be pleased because that makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d she returned softly.</p><p>\u201cUse your hand,\u201d he said, carefully reaching up to tug one of her hands down between them. \u201cI\u2019m going to go hard, baby. I\u2019m about to explode here. Build up\u2019s been too long. Once I start going, I can\u2019t stop, so you need to make sure you get there with me. If you need a minute, go ahead and start touching yourself now. Just let me know when, okay?\u201d</p><p>She slid her fingers between their bodies, and he could tell when she touched her clitoris. There was an immediate burst of satisfaction in her eyes. They went dreamy and hazy, cloudy with desire.</p><p>\u201cGo now,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBe sure, Josie. This isn\u2019t going to last.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, her face already strained with her impending orgasm.</p><p>It was like setting the bloodhounds free.</p><p>He withdrew, enjoying the sensuous slide from her body. Then he slammed forward and began thrusting hard and deep. Faster. Harder. His eyes rolled back in his head. He\u2019d never felt anything so goddamn good in his life.</p><p>A roar began in his ears. His blood thundered through his veins. Josie went dim in front of him and the room faded as agonizing pleasure bloomed, unfurling like a tightly closed bud in the first rays of spring sunshine.</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cThis is going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she gasped. \u201cOh God, Ash, don\u2019t stop, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell that\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>He pounded into her, the force of his thrusts shaking the entire bed. Her breasts jiggled enticingly, her nipples so hard and beaded that it looked painful. But then hell, he was banging away at her like some rutting pig.</p><p>Need splintered through him. Razor sharp, his orgasm swelled and boiled low, gathering in his balls and then shooting straight up his cock, exploding outward in a painful spurt. He wasn\u2019t breathing. He was just thrusting, riding the wave. Immersing himself in her warm clasp over and over.</p> <p>\u201cJosie,\u201d he whispered, her name nearly a groan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you, Ash.\u201d</p><p>Her words cut the last thread and he spiraled downward like a snowflake in the wind. Crazy. Fluttering madly. His entire body sizzling like a blown fuse. Hell, he probably had blown a few circuits. His mind was mush. Completely overtaken, sated, satisfied.</p><p>He collapsed down on her, no longer able to keep his weight off her. He lay there, gasping for breath, her body beneath his. For a long moment he remained there, but he knew he was smothering her and he also had to get rid of the damn condom.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to have her bareback. He\u2019d stay inside her all damn night. They\u2019d wake up a sticky, wet mess, but he didn\u2019t give two fucks. He wanted his come in her and on her.</p><p>Levering himself upward, he kissed her forehead and then smoothed the hair from her face before kissing her lips.</p> <p>\u201cWas that good for you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf it was any better, I\u2019d be dead,\u201d she said ruefully.</p><p>He smiled and then got up just long enough to discard the condom. Then he crawled back into bed, pulling her into the shelter of his body.</p><p>\u201cThink I could go back to sleep for a while,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMmm hmm,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s sleep. I\u2019ll arrange something for us to eat when we wake up.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled deeper into his embrace and then threaded her leg through his so his was looped over hers.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Chapter thirteen</p><p>\u201cI want you to wear my collar, Josie,\u201d Ash said in a low voice.</p><p>She turned in his arms, surprised at the blunt declaration. The two were stretched out on Ash\u2019s couch, a lazy morning after their lovemaking and short nap earlier. After they\u2019d woken up again, Ash had brought her breakfast in bed and then he\u2019d taken her into the bathroom where he\u2019d washed every inch of her skin and hair in the shower.</p><p>He\u2019d dried her, brushed out her hair and then wrapped one of his robes around her before taking her into the living room where they\u2019d been on the couch ever since.</p><p>Ash stared intently at her as if gauging her response. His gaze flickered over her face and then back up to hold her eyes.</p><p>\u201cKnow you wore Michael\u2019s. Also know it didn\u2019t mean a damn thing. It means something to me, Josie. I want it to mean something to you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI want to choose it especially for you. I don\u2019t have it yet, but I will. And when I get it, I want you to wear it. Will you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, already imagining wearing his jewelry, the knowledge of what it would mean to him alive in her mind.</p><p>\u201cGot a lot of other things to talk about today,\u201d he continued. \u201cA lot we need to work out. I\u2019d rather get it all out today so we can move on, knowing what we need to know. And you\u2019ll know what you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ash. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her arms, satisfaction brimming in his eyes. \u201cMeans a lot for you to trust me. Especially after what happened with that prick. I won\u2019t ever hurt you like that, Josie. You may not know it right now, but you\u2019ll know it soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she said, lowering her mouth to his. \u201cI trust you, Ash. I do. I\u2019m not just saying that. You have to know how hard this is for me. But I\u2019m good with my decision. I know it\u2019s the right one. You don\u2019t have to prove that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d he refuted. \u201cEvery day. I have to show you every day what you\u2019ll mean to me. That\u2019s on me. And we\u2019ll get there. This\u2014you\u2014are important to me. I\u2019m going to make sure you know that at all times.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in, laying her head on his shoulder, her body settling over his. He felt so good. So solid and strong. He didn\u2019t have to work at making her feel safe. She did feel safe. Just being close to him.</p><p>\u201cFirst thing we need to talk about is medical exams and birth control.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head back up, one eyebrow raised in question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to use condoms. Not with you. I want to be able to come inside you, on you. In order for us to do that, you need to have an alternate method of birth control and we also both need tests so we know we\u2019re both clean, although I\u2019ll tell you now, Josie. Not sure what you did with Michael, but I use condoms. Never haven\u2019t. And it\u2019s been a while for me. Not since . . .\u201d</p><p>He broke off and shook his head. \u201cThat will come in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhat will come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe circumstance surrounding the last time I had sex with a woman,\u201d Ash said in a serious tone. \u201cI\u2019ll get to that. But right now there are other things we need to get settled.\u201d</p><p>The way he said it made her concerned. Her brow furrowed and he reached up, curling his hand around her nape to pull her down so his lips settled against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMichael and I used condoms,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s the only man I\u2019ve been with in two years. And I\u2019m already on birth control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou good with my word or you want a copy of my last medical exam?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She frowned, wondering if this was some kind of a test. If she said she wanted a copy of his medical report, would it seem that she didn\u2019t trust him? Was he asking her if she trusted him this far? But if she didn\u2019t ask for it, if she said his word was good enough, that was taking a huge leap. And her life was too important to take those kinds of risks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like the copy,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded, seemingly unbothered by her request.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure you get it this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you want me to be tested? The last time I saw a doctor was three months ago. Obviously I\u2019ve had sex since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll arrange it for this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI can\u2019t get an appointment with my doctor that quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll use mine. He\u2019ll see you,\u201d Ash said confidently.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow we need to discuss our arrangement here. At this apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant it to sound hesitant. But things seemed much simpler in the abstract. Now that they were actually hashing out specifics, she was nervous and on edge.</p><p>\u201cNo way to do this except to be blunt,\u201d Ash said, his voice soothing. \u201cI know you\u2019re nervous, but we\u2019ll talk it out and then deal.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis apartment is not convenient to public transportation. Which is just as well, because I\u2019d prefer having the security of knowing you\u2019re safe when you leave here. Which means that my driver will take me to work in the mornings and pick me up in the afternoons. Between those times he\u2019ll return here and be at your disposal. But, and this is not me being a controlling asshole, I want to know where you go, when you go, and I want to know you\u2019re safe while you\u2019re doing it.</p><p>\u201cNow we need to sort your apartment out and get what you need from there. You\u2019ll move it here, whatever you need. I have an office and extra bedrooms. You can use whatever space you like to paint or draw. I thought the living room might be the best choice simply because you\u2019ll have more light and you\u2019ll have the view of the river.\u201d</p><p>She felt light-headed. Like everything around her was moving at the speed of sound while she stood stock-still, trying to take it all in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want and need you to be flexible, because when I get home every day, I want you here. Which means that I\u2019ll stay in touch with you and you\u2019ll do the same with me. My schedule varies. Some days I\u2019ll be home early, and those days I\u2019ll let you know. Others I\u2019ll be late. If I travel\u2014and I don\u2019t have immediate travel plans\u2014I\u2019m going to want you with me. Is that something you can deal with?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath and then smiled shakily. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>He paused a moment. \u201cNo. Those are my expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I suppose I\u2019ll be home when you are,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>He breathed out, his shoulders dipping slightly in relief. As though he\u2019d expected her to refuse. She wondered what he would have done if she had balked? Tossed her out? Or would he have tried to reach a compromise?</p><p>He\u2019d readily admitted his need of her. He wanted her, no doubt. But how inflexible was he really? She was curious, but she wasn\u2019t ready to push back. Not yet. Not over something she had no real issue with. If and when the time came when he posed something she couldn\u2019t embrace, then she would test the boundaries of their newly forming relationship.</p><p>\u201cJust so I understand your . . . expectations . . . you basically want me here when you are. Or where you are. And you want me to tell you where I\u2019m going and when and where. And you want me to check in with you frequently.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sound that demanding to her. It sounded reasonable. She didn\u2019t want him worrying about her. Didn\u2019t want to be a distraction for him. If he worried\u2014and it was obvious he did\u2014she wanted to do whatever she could to alleviate that stress.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his eyes growing more intent. \u201cBut, Josie, you need to understand. You make it sound light. It\u2019s not. I will be pissed if you flake. This isn\u2019t an \u2018oh sorry I completely forgot to tell you where I was going\u2019 thing and laugh it off. I expect you to tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Ash,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI get it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNow, there are things you need to know about me. I don\u2019t want this shit coming up later and surprising you or making you feel awkward. It\u2019s better if you know everything from the start so you can deal and it doesn\u2019t become an issue down the road.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an eyebrow. He sounded so serious. Like he was about to drop some earth-shattering bomb on her. She wanted to joke and ask him if he was about to admit to being an ax murderer, but he was too serious and he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her attempt at levity. So she remained silent, waiting for what he had to say.</p><p>He shifted upward, grimaced a moment and then leaned forward so he could shove a cushion between his back and the arm of the sofa. She sat forward so he had room but then he promptly snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her solidly back to him so she was once more nestled against his body.</p><p>\u201cAny serious conversation we have is going to be with you in my arms so I\u2019m touching you,\u201d he said. \u201cNever you across the room from me. That is not going to make me happy. Warning you now that if you get pissed and we\u2019re having a discussion, you won\u2019t be putting distance between us.\u201d</p><p>She smiled against his chest and nodded. That sounded fine to her. One of the things she had disliked the most about Michael was his aloofness when it came to her. The distance\u2014emotional distance\u2014between them. Michael was more of a sit-down-across-the-room-from-each-other-and-discuss guy. For that matter, the only time he ever touched her was when they were having sex. He wasn\u2019t demonstrative or affectionate. And Ash couldn\u2019t seem to keep his hands off her for two seconds. She liked that. She liked it a lot.</p><p>\u201cIs this going to be a serious discussion?\u201d she asked, no longer able to keep the teasing note from her voice.</p><p>There was no doubt that Ash radiated seriousness today. And it was starting to feel suffocating. She needed to lighten the moment, even if for a brief second. It wasn\u2019t in her nature to take everything so seriously. And Ash was an intense guy. Maybe he\u2019d eventually lighten up around her, or maybe he\u2019d always be this . . . broody . . . when it came to her.</p><p>His hold tightened around her. \u201cYeah. It\u2019s serious. Everything about me and you is serious. I get that this seems heavy, especially today when we hash it all out. It won\u2019t always be this . . . intense. But today, yeah. Need to get whatever out that has the potential to hurt you, because that I will not allow going forward.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brow furrowed again and she pushed up so she could see his eyes. So serious and intent. On her. Watching her every reaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ash?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat is it you think is going to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t know if it will or not, but it could. If you don\u2019t understand it from the start. I just don\u2019t want you blindsided. If you\u2019re prepared and you know everything, then it doesn\u2019t have the power to catch you off guard.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to touch his jaw, running her fingertips over the slight stubble. He hadn\u2019t shaved this morning, and the dark blond formed a shadow on his jaw.</p> <p>\u201cThen tell me. I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and kissed it, pressing his mouth into her palm.</p><p>\u201cJace Crestwell is my best friend. He and Gabe Hamilton. But Jace . . . We share a bond. Gabe is my best friend, no doubt. But Jace and I have always had a closer friendship. He\u2019s my brother in every sense of the word. I trust him. He has my back and I have his. Always. We used to share everything, and by that I mean women. I\u2019ve had a lot of threesomes over the years with Jace.\u201d</p><p>Her brow crinkled, her eyebrows bunching as she stared into his eyes. And to think she\u2019d been worried that she\u2019d be expected to share him with other women. This she hadn\u2019t expected. She couldn\u2019t imagine as possessive as Ash had been with her so far that he\u2019d want her to have sex with another man while he watched or participated. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t something she wanted.</p><p>\u201cIs that something . . . I mean, is that what you\u2019ll want to do with me? Share me with another man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>The denial was explosive, the words rushing from his mouth in a puff of air she felt on her chin. Relief hit her hard and she relaxed, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get it then,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHow Jace was with Bethany. I didn\u2019t understand it. But I do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re losing me,\u201d she said patiently. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, Jace is my best friend. He\u2019s involved with Bethany. They\u2019re engaged. We\u2019ll see them a lot. I\u2019ll want to share you with them. Their friendship I mean. They\u2019re important to me and you\u2019re important to me. So we\u2019ll spend time with them. And what you need to know is that in the beginning, the first night that Jace and Bethany were together, I was with them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAre you . . . do you still have . . . threesomes . . . with them?\u201d</p> <p>Ash shook his head. \u201cHell no. Jace didn\u2019t want it the first time. I didn\u2019t know it at the time. It\u2019s fucked up and complicated, but what you need to know is that I\u2019ve had sex with Bethany. And you\u2019ll see her. And Jace. And I don\u2019t want it to be awkward for you. It was awkward as hell the first few times we were all together after that night. But we\u2019re cool with it now. Bethany\u2019s cool with it and so is Jace. It\u2019s not something that gets brought up. But it\u2019s there. And I don\u2019t want it to hurt you when you look at her and know that I\u2019ve had sex with her. Because there\u2019s nothing there, Josie. Nothing but deep friendship. Bethany\u2019s a great woman. I think you\u2019ll like her. But she is no threat to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI appreciate you telling me. Being up front with me about it. I can see how it would be awkward, especially if I didn\u2019t know and somehow put my foot in my mouth in front of them.\u201d</p><p>His gaze focused on her, studying her intently. \u201cIs that going to be a problem with you? Spending time with a woman I\u2019ve fucked and that I care a great deal about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you tell me it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a problem. Like I said, I didn\u2019t get where Jace was coming from then. His possessiveness where Bethany was concerned. We\u2019d never had a woman come between us like that. There\u2019d never been one who mattered. But I get it now because I know I don\u2019t want to share you with anyone, and especially not my best friend, even if he was single and not in a relationship. And as for other men, that is not something you ever have to worry about. I\u2019ve had threesomes with Jace and another woman. A hell of a lot of times. I won\u2019t lie. We\u2019ve fucked our way through countless women over the years. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of but it\u2019s not something I lose sleep over either. It is what it is. But there will be no threesomes with you, Josie. It\u2019s only going to be you and me. I\u2019m going to be the only man making love to you from now on.\u201d</p><p>It all sounded so final, and yet she knew they were just words. How could they be anything else? They\u2019d known each other such a short time. They\u2019d only had sex once. And he was talking like this was a done deal. That they were permanent and in a committed relationship long-term.</p><p>While she didn\u2019t doubt his commitment, or even her own, there was no way she could look down the road with any authority. There were too many what-ifs.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he prompted.</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you expected me to react, Ash. Did you think I\u2019d change my mind because you\u2019ve had kinky sex with a bunch of women? You\u2019re what, thirty-five? Thirty-six? It\u2019s not realistic to think you hadn\u2019t had affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-eight. Almost thirty-nine,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, so you\u2019re thirty-eight. I\u2019ve just told you that I had a relationship\u2014and sex\u2014with a man as recently as a few weeks ago. I can hardly condemn you for having similar relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we won\u2019t be seeing the man you fucked,\u201d Ash pointed out.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI won\u2019t say it\u2019ll be fun to look at her and mentally compare our performance, or even imagine you and your friend both making love to her. But I\u2019ll deal, Ash. And if she\u2019s as nice as you say she is, then I\u2019ll like her and hopefully we can be friends. I\u2019ll just have to not torture myself by visualizing you in bed with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only one time,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019t want you thinking about it at all when we get together. Because know this, Josie, no matter who was in the past, you\u2019re my present and my future. And those women have nothing on you.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved her lips and she leaned in, pressing her forehead to his. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to think about it at all, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, it\u2019s almost lunchtime and we still need to sort out your apartment. Want to go grab a bite to eat and then swing by your apartment so you can get all your art supplies? If you make a list of stuff while we\u2019re there, I\u2019ll have someone go over and get it all packed for you. Don\u2019t want you worrying about anything other than settling into my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fine to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>He kissed her hungrily. \u201cWe\u2019ll see the others in time. But for now, I want you all to myself. I\u2019m tempted to call in to work Monday and spend the week with you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart fluttered. It was a tempting visual. An entire week in Ash\u2019s bed. In his arms.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, with Gabe on his honeymoon and the deals we have working, Jace and I can\u2019t miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said easily. \u201cI have work to do too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the idea of you working in my space,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhen I\u2019m at the office, you\u2019ll be here. I like that image. And then you here when I get home. Wearing nothing, Josie. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m on my way home each day, and when I get here, I want you naked and waiting. Unless I tell you different, that\u2019s the way I want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Chapter fourteen</p><p>Jace was waiting for Ash when Ash got into his office Monday morning. Not that Ash had any doubt his friend would be chomping at the bit to pick his brain after Ash\u2019s late-night phone call Saturday night.</p><p>Jace was sitting in Ash\u2019s office when Ash walked in. Jace\u2019s worried gaze found him.</p><p>\u201cYou get everything sorted out?\u201d Jace asked, not even giving Ash time to sit down.</p><p>Ash tossed his briefcase onto his desk and then flopped down into his chair, glancing over at his friend whose eyes were dark with concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d Ash murmured. \u201cMade a few calls on my way into work. Need to get a man on the asshole, monitor his movements, figure out the best time to strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jace muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re serious about this.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s eyebrow went up. There was a stack of notes on Ash\u2019s desk. Missed calls that needed returning. Documents that needed his signature. But he left them untouched, leaning back in his chair as he calmly surveyed Jace across his desk.</p><p>\u201cHave I given you any reason to believe I\u2019m anything but dead serious? He hurt her, Jace. He put bruises on her face. No way in fuck I\u2019m letting it go. She was too scared and shocked to report it. But I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t because I can make the bastard suffer far more. He would have been out of jail in two seconds, and it\u2019s doubtful anything would have come of it. You know how this kind of shit gets brushed underneath the rug. Especially when you have the money and connections to make it go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has all that?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cSome, yeah. No match for me, though. I\u2019m going to make damn sure he gets the message. Josie is mine and if he ever fucks with her again, he\u2019s a dead man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Josie taking all of this?\u201d Jace asked quietly.</p><p>Ash paused. \u201cOkay I think. I didn\u2019t really give her time to process much. When I hit her apartment after bailing on dinner Friday night, I didn\u2019t give her any options. I packed her shit up and told her she was moving in with me. It was an asshole move. She needed gentle handling, but I knew if I gave her space she might never come to me. So I pressed my advantage when she was overwhelmed and shaken and I moved in quick.\u201d</p><p>A smile quirked the corners of Jace\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou? Asshole moves? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be the charming, nice guy? Thought being an asshole was mine and Gabe\u2019s job.\u201d</p><p>Ash grimaced. \u201cWhy the fuck does everyone think I\u2019m such a laid-back pansy?\u201d</p><p>Jace snorted. \u201cNever said that, man. But you\u2019re usually Mr. Polished when it comes to women. Never known you to be off your game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other women didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Ash said simply. \u201cJosie does. Can\u2019t afford to play it safe with her. Have to press my advantage when I have it.\u201d</p><p>Jace took in a long breath, his gaze intently studying Ash. After a moment, Ash shifted uncomfortably underneath his friend\u2019s scrutiny.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking long term here?\u201d Jace asked. \u201cYou say she\u2019s different and already I\u2019ve seen just how different you are about her. You\u2019re talking about breaking the law and doing God only knows what to the asshole who beat her up. But just how different are we talking here, Ash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about how you felt when you met Bethany,\u201d Ash said in an even tone.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jace breathed. \u201cSay no more. I get it. And congrats, man. Never thought it would happen for you this fast. You\u2019ve always been so determined to live by our motto, \u2018play hard and live free.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, so were you,\u201d Ash said dryly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t congratulate me yet. Too much shit to sort out, and while I may have Josie where I want her right now, it\u2019s definitely not in the bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut knowing how I felt about Bethany, and you saying it\u2019s like that? You\u2019re done for, man. If you feel even half what I felt for Bethany in the beginning, this is it for you. And knowing you the way I know you, if Josie is what you want, you\u2019re damn well not going to let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no,\u201d Ash muttered. \u201cIf she\u2019s not with me for the long term, it\u2019ll be because she fought me tooth and nail and won. And I don\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking marriage? Absolute commitment? What are we talking here, Ash? I need to know so I can give you shit after all the insults you hurled mine and Gabe\u2019s way when our balls were twisting in the wind over Bethany and Mia.\u201d</p><p>Ash flipped up his middle finger. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Marriage is a big step. It\u2019s permanent. And it\u2019s too early to be thinking about marriage and babies and shit. All I can focus on is Josie and making sure she\u2019s as into me as I\u2019m into her.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cYeah, I get it. But just so you know, I\u2019m going to start planning that bachelor party now.\u201d</p><p>Ash chuckled. \u201cWhatever, man.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s expression grew more serious and he leveled a hard stare in Ash\u2019s direction. \u201cNow what about the man who hurt Josie? You said you needed an alibi, and you know I\u2019ll do whatever you need, but I need details here. Can\u2019t say visiting you at Riker\u2019s is on my top-ten list of shit to do for kicks and giggles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ash sighed and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m checking into it, as I said. But I want to move quickly on this. I want to get Josie settled, and part of that is me knowing that this asshole won\u2019t be threatening her anymore. I got some preliminary info on him and his movements. He\u2019s pretty predictable. Keeps to the same schedule. If that holds true, then I plan to address the situation Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s eyes narrowed and he sat forward in his seat. \u201cYou as in you personally? Or are you having the issue taken care of by a third party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Ash said, taking in his friend\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ash. Don\u2019t fuck up, man. I doubt Josie wants to visit you in jail anymore than I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot going to be an issue,\u201d Ash said evenly. \u201cThe guys I have in mind are good. Cover all the bases. They\u2019ll swear they don\u2019t know me and I\u2019ll swear I don\u2019t know them. Don\u2019t want to put you in a bad position and definitely don\u2019t want Bethany involved, so I\u2019d prefer if my alibi was only you and not the two of you together.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cYeah, you know I don\u2019t mind going to the wall for you. Ever. But I don\u2019t want this touching Bethany. And whatever you need, man. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. Appreciate it, Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know, okay? Don\u2019t keep me in the dark. I\u2019ll want details, and if you get into trouble, you better fucking call me. And don\u2019t do this alone, got me? If you can\u2019t arrange it with whatever men you plan to hook up with for the job, then you call me and I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Ash grinned. \u201cYes, Mother. Want to wipe my ass for me while you\u2019re at it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Jace said rudely.</p><p>Ash chuckled and then sobered as he stared back at Jace. \u201cDon\u2019t want this touching Bethany or you. You providing me an alibi is enough. It\u2019s more than I want to ask of you. I\u2019d never do anything to jeopardize your relationship with Bethany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But also know that you\u2019re my brother, Ash. You\u2019re family. Not those shitheads you share blood with. Me and Gabe and by extension Mia and Bethany. Don\u2019t care what I have to do to help you. I\u2019ll do it. No questions asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, man. Stop it already or we\u2019ll be a bunch of pansy-ass girls reaching for the fucking tissues.\u201d</p><p>Jace threw back his head and laughed. \u201cOkay, now that we have that squared away, when do I get to meet Josie?\u201d</p><p>Ash huffed out a breath. \u201cSoon. I want you and Bethany both to meet her. After I get this shit with her ex taken care of then I can breathe a little easier. Maybe we can have dinner Sunday night.\u201d</p> <p>Jace nodded. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows about Bethany.\u201d Ash made a face. \u201cI told her everything. Didn\u2019t want it to catch her off guard, not that I think it would ever come up, but I didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d</p><p>Jace winced. \u201cHow she\u2019d take it? I can see how that would be awkward as hell when we\u2019re all together. Especially now that she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was cool about it. I doubt any woman loves the idea of hanging with a woman her man slept with in the past. But I assured her that you had no intention of ever sharing Bethany with anyone ever again, and that furthermore, I wasn\u2019t going to be involved in any threesomes and I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t want to have a threesome with her and another guy.\u201d</p><p>Jace scowled. \u201cFuck no I\u2019m not sharing Bethany with anyone. Bad enough there was that one time with you.\u201d</p><p>Ash held up his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t get all worked up. I didn\u2019t bring it up to piss you off. I just wanted you to know that Josie knows. I was straight with her about everything regarding my sexual history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that took a while,\u201d Jace said dryly.</p><p>\u201cAbout as long as it took you to explain to Bethany,\u201d Ash shot back.</p> <p>\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d Jace said with a grin. Then he stood, heading toward the door. \u201cIf that\u2019s everything, I\u2019m going to get to work. I have calls to make and a conference call in half an hour. You got lunch plans?\u201d</p><p>Ash checked his watch. \u201cNo, but I plan to head home early today. Didn\u2019t like leaving Josie on her own so quickly after I got her moved in. I have people bringing her shit over to my apartment and I told her I\u2019d help her sort it all out when I got home. So I\u2019ll probably skip lunch, get my desk cleared and then head out around two.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cOkay. Keep me posted. Especially about Friday night. We need to get our stories straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Ash replied.</p><p>Chapter fifteen</p><p>Josie put down her paintbrush and scrambled to wipe her hands before picking up her ringing cell phone. They shook slightly as she saw it was Ash calling. A flutter began in her belly, rising up into her throat.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way home.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s simple words sent a tingle down her spine.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You didn\u2019t forget, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know what your expectations are.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cBut is it what you want, Josie? Or are you only catering to my desires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it too, Ash. I\u2019m a little nervous, but it\u2019s because this is all new and we\u2019re still getting to know each other. But I wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t want to be. No matter what kind of woman you think you hustled to your apartment, I\u2019m not her. I\u2019m not weak or spineless. Granted, I didn\u2019t handle the situation with Michael like I should have, but I\u2019m not easily walked over.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, the sound warm and vibrant in her ear. \u201cI never thought for a moment that you were weak or spineless, baby. It takes a strong woman to take on a man like me. Never doubt that.\u201d</p><p>A broad smile attacked her face and her belly clenched in delight at the soft endearment. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d called her baby, and she\u2019d loved it then. There was something about this man\u2019s voice softening, the tenderness when he used the pet word, that made her heart skip a few beats.</p><p>\u201cI need to go if I\u2019m going to be ready for you when you get here,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint you on your first day home to me.\u201d</p><p>There was another pause and then his voice low and sweet, sending a brisk thrill coursing through her veins.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t disappoint me, Josie. Don\u2019t want you thinking that. Don\u2019t even want it in your head. If you\u2019re there when I get home, naked and waiting for me, I\u2019m not going to be disappointed. I\u2019ve looked forward to it all day. I\u2019ll let you go so you can get ready. See you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>As soon as she ended the call, she surged to her feet, frowning when she saw the scattered supplies all over his living room. She knew his housekeeper was coming in the morning, but she didn\u2019t want to be an added burden. For that matter, all her stuff was in boxes, neatly stacked against the living room wall. She hadn\u2019t bothered unpacking them yet because she\u2019d wanted to work, eager to get more of her paintings to the art gallery.</p><p>Hopefully Ash wouldn\u2019t be annoyed at the mess and at the chaos she\u2019d brought into his immaculately kept apartment.</p><p>She rushed to the bathroom, wondering if she had time for a quick shower. But she\u2019d taken one this morning. She was clean. Just her hands and her arms had paint splatters and she could clean those off in short order.</p><p>Still, she paid careful attention to her appearance. She brushed out her long, blond hair and surveyed her reflection in the mirror. No makeup today, but then she rarely wore more than lip gloss and mascara.</p><p>Satisfied that she didn\u2019t look an absolute mess, she went into the bedroom and stripped out of her clothing. She folded the jeans and the shirt, not knowing if she\u2019d dress afterward or if Ash would keep her occupied until bedtime. She\u2019d tackle that particular issue when the time came.</p><p>But what now? Did she wait in the bedroom? Should she sit in the living room and wait for him there? She frowned pensively. They hadn\u2019t gone over the particulars, just that he wanted her naked and waiting for him.</p><p>He\u2019d been specific in that he didn\u2019t want her to kneel unless he wanted her there because she was sucking his cock. Her cheeks flamed in remembrance of that statement. Michael had liked her to kneel. Liked her subservience. At the time it hadn\u2019t bothered her. It was a part of their relationship, one she\u2019d readily agreed to. Now she felt foolish for offering the jerk her submission.</p><p>She walked into the living room, deciding this was where she\u2019d wait for him. He\u2019d liked the idea of coming home and finding her naked and waiting, which told her that he\u2019d probably like to see her as soon as he walked in. If he had to look for her, then she wasn\u2019t waiting for him very well. And she liked the idea of being the first thing he saw when he got off the elevator.</p><p>Since she wasn\u2019t going to kneel, she opted for the plush leather couch, but she put one of the throws down so it would be comfortable against her bare skin. And then she pondered over whether she should sit up? Recline? Laughter bubbled from her throat. She was so overthinking this.</p><p>She was an artist and visuals appealed to her. She knew all about provocative poses and Ash would appreciate one of those surely. She wanted to wow him the first time he came home to her.</p><p>Warmth entered her chest as those words settled over her. Coming home to her. How easily she fell into his life, his apartment, and adopted it as her own. Was she really considering this home now? And that she had a man coming home to her every day?</p><p>Not deliberating over whether she was crazy for entertaining such thoughts, she settled onto her side, arranging her hair to hang over her shoulder, partially obscuring her breasts. It wasn\u2019t that she had any inhibitions. But less was often more. Men responded to what they couldn\u2019t see often as much or even more than what they could see.</p><p>It was what made her paintings provocative. The hint of flesh. Just a glimpse of the forbidden.</p><p>She rested her head against the arm of the couch and let her gaze drift toward the elevator door. Her skin tingled, anticipation licking over her body as she imagined what Ash would choose to do when he got home.</p><p>Arousal hummed low in her body. She was tempted to slide her fingers between her legs and stroke herself to a quick orgasm. It wouldn\u2019t take much. She was worked up just thinking about Ash\u2019s arrival. But she didn\u2019t want to take away from whatever he planned.</p><p>So she waited, each second seemingly an hour.</p><p>When she heard the elevator, her breath hiccupped and stuck a moment in her throat. Her mouth went dry and she hastily licked her lips just as the doors slid open, revealing Ash in the suit he\u2019d worn to work.</p><p>One hand shoved into his slacks pocket, his pose casual and arrogant. He exuded wealth, charm and . . . power.</p><p>She shivered as their gazes met and held. His eyes burned over her, flaring when he took in her pose. Appreciation gleamed, and she was glad she\u2019d opted for seductive instead of just sitting and waiting.</p><p>He strode toward her, his jaw tight, eyes blazing. She lifted her head, tracking his progress.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cAnd welcome home.\u201d</p><p>He surprised her by dropping to his knees in front of the couch. He swept in and fastened his mouth to hers in a heated rush that took her breath away. His hand tangled in her hair, yanking her closer so there was no space between them.</p><p>\u201cFucking beautiful,\u201d he growled. \u201cBeen thinking about this all day. Me coming home, seeing you waiting. But nothing could have prepared me for the reality.\u201d</p><p>He traced a finger down her cheek, stroking gently as he sucked in breaths to catch up from their kiss.</p><p>\u201cReally glad you\u2019re here, Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad too,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHad a dozen different ideas on the way home. Thinking of how I\u2019d take you when I got here. The minute I saw you, I forgot everything but the way you look perched on my couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to hear all those ideas. I\u2019m intrigued now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his eyes gleaming with amusement. \u201cSome of them are probably illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, low and husky, the sound vibrating over her skin. \u201cI like your enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we write them all down and draw one out of a jar to decide how we have sex?\u201d she asked with a grin. \u201cOr can I count on you to be decisive in the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy darling is being cheeky today,\u201d he drawled. \u201cI might have to punish you for that.\u201d</p><p>Heat rushed into her cheeks. One of his eyebrows lifted.</p><p>\u201cYou like that idea.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, unsure of what to say. Ash had said he wasn\u2019t into games. Wasn\u2019t her playing the naughty submissive to earn a punishment a game?</p><p>Ash\u2019s gaze narrowed and he slid his fingers underneath her chin, forcing it upward so she met his gaze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking right now?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. I guess I was worried about how to respond to that. And how it would make me sound if I did say that the thought of you punishing me turned me on. You said you weren\u2019t into games and you wanted to keep it real.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his thumb over her lips to silence her.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, never ever hesitate to tell me anything. Especially what turns you on, what you want, what you need from me. Sexually, emotionally, whatever. Second thing, your desires aren\u2019t a game. I get that what I said may have caused some confusion. What I meant was that you and me, we\u2019re real. Not a game. Doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t play together. As long as you get that what we do is real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClear as mud,\u201d Josie said, amusement thick in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about punishment. Have to tell you, I\u2019m not much into the discipline thing. I\u2019m not your father and you\u2019re not a child. But there are things I like, and there\u2019s a big difference between thinking you need punishing and me wanting to redden your ass because it turns me on. Get where I\u2019m coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said breathily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that idea appeals to you too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI like it. I mean it\u2019s a turn-on. There\u2019s something hot about a mouthwatering alpha male spanking me. Or exerting his will over me. That probably sounds stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Ash sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting me, baby. Nothing you think or feel is stupid. Understand? If it turns you on then it\u2019s not stupid. If it turns you on, I want to know about it because I want to bring you pleasure. I want to make you feel good. Now, what I want at this exact moment is you on your knees, my dick in your mouth. But after? We\u2019re going to have a discussion about your kinks. And mine for that matter. Hopefully they\u2019ll match up pretty damn well.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and licked her lips in anticipation.</p><p>He groaned and then pressed his mouth to hers, devouring her hungrily.</p><p>\u201cYou drive me crazy,\u201d he said into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He reared back, pushing up to his feet. Then he extended his hand down to help her up. After reaching over for one of the pillows from the couch, he dropped it onto the floor and then urged her down on her knees on the cushion.</p> <p>His hand went to his fly, unfastening it and then lowering the zipper. He reached in, pulled his straining erection from the confines of his pants and fisted it as it jutted forward toward her mouth.</p><p>\u201cLick it,\u201d he rasped out. \u201cTease the head and then suck me deep.\u201d</p><p>She flicked out her tongue, circling the broad head and teasing the sensitive underside. She loved the way he sucked in his breath and the way it escaped in a long hiss in reaction.</p><p>His fingers delved into her hair, twisting around the strands before his knuckles came to rest against her scalp. His hold wasn\u2019t gentle, and she liked that. With his other hand, he cupped her jaw, opening her mouth as he pushed inside.</p><p>His thrusts weren\u2019t any more gentle than his grip in her hair, and she loved that too. She loved the raw power barely restrained underneath the surface. He was like a lion poised to pounce. All predatory, delicious male.</p><p>She levered up higher so she could take him deeper. She wanted him deeper. Wanted his taste, loved the way he took control, the fact that she had no power except what he gave her.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he breathed. \u201cNever felt anything better than your mouth around my cock, baby.\u201d</p><p>She shivered in delight over his words. Her nipples hardened, puckering into taut crests. She gasped when he reached down and took both nipples between his thumbs and forefingers, twisting gently, exerting just enough pressure to drive her insane without causing her pain.</p> <p>She licked leisurely from base to tip, letting the head rest precariously on her lips before sucking him back in and sliding her mouth down until her chin rested against his sac. She swallowed, milking the head with the back of her throat. He groaned, rewarding her effort with a twitch, and his fingers grew more aggressive at her breasts, eliciting a groan of her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve imagined you so many ways,\u201d Ash said in a strained voice. \u201cTied up, ass in the air, my mark on your skin. On your hands and knees, me taking you from behind, in your ass, in your pussy. You on top of me, riding me. Me eating your sweet pussy while you suck my dick. You name it, I\u2019ve imagined it.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, her body trembling almost violently as the images he provoked fired through her mind.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t always be this easy, baby,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to hold back, but I don\u2019t want it to be too much too fast.\u201d</p><p>She tore her mouth away from his cock and stared up at him, her fingers wrapped around his erection. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be easy, Ash. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m with you. I want what you can give me. I need it.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands and looked down, his expression tender. \u201cI love that you want that from me, Josie. I just want to make sure you\u2019re ready for it. You\u2019ve been through a lot and the last few days have been hectic and stressful for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they have,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut do you know today was the best day? The first day in longer than I can remember where I was utterly content. I was happy, Ash. Because of you. Because I was here. I sat in your living room painting, and all I could think was how content I was to be here, working, anticipating the moment when you called to let me know you were on your way home.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened and went liquid green, the color almost electric. \u201cYou take my breath away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she said, rocking back on her heels as she positioned her mouth to take his cock again. \u201cWhen do we get to the kinky part?\u201d</p><p>Chapter sixteen</p><p>Ash was nearly undone by the sight of Josie on her knees, her mouth around his dick, just like he\u2019d imagined so many times since seeing her that first day in the park. Now she was his. In his apartment. His life.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d given him a precious gift. He didn\u2019t look beyond the fact that she offered him her trust. She\u2019d placed her body and heart in his hands, and he\u2019d do whatever it took to protect both. He\u2019d never take for granted what this beautiful, courageous woman was giving him.</p><p>He slid his hands through her hair, curling the strands around his fingers as he leaned into her. Deeper. Each stroke the most exquisite pleasure he\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>He\u2019d had many women. He\u2019d been honest with Josie about that. But she was different. And he couldn\u2019t even say why definitively. There was something about her that just spoke to him on a different level. Made him think about permanency when that had never been an issue in his past relationships. But then, him and Jace fucking the same women could hardly be classified as actual relationships.</p><p>It had been years since he\u2019d spent any time with a woman one-on-one, and he found the idea appealed to him now. Josie appealed to him.</p><p>She was on her knees before him, utterly submissive, and not only submissive, but she wanted the same things he wanted. Enjoyed the same kinks he enjoyed. There wasn\u2019t a more perfect woman for him. Of that he was certain.</p><p>He sank deep into her mouth, twitching at the back of her throat before sliding back out, enjoying the rasp of her tongue over the sensitive underside of his dick. Then he withdrew, watched as her eyes, aquamarine pools clouded with desire, found his.</p><p>Wordlessly, he extended his hand down for hers to help her to her feet. As soon as she\u2019d risen, he pulled her into his arms, crushing her against his chest. He kissed her, almost forgetting in his urgency to possess her mouth that he should take care. She still wore bruises. Her mouth was still tender. Yet it hadn\u2019t stopped him from fucking her mouth, even as gentle as he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go into the bedroom,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ve been hard on your mouth. For now I\u2019ll focus on other portions of your delectable body.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared with heat and anticipation. She\u2019d asked him for kinky. He sure as hell could accommodate her there. His hands itched to redden her ass, to see his marks of possession on her body. It was a primitive urge that completely overtook him. He wanted to own her, for there to be no question as to his ownership.</p><p>But as he guided her toward his bedroom, he acknowledged that he didn\u2019t want just to own her body. He wanted to own her heart. And while he would possess her body in short order\u2014as he\u2019d already possessed her once\u2014it would take much more effort and time to own the parts of her she held most dear. Her heart, mind and soul.</p><p>He wanted them all. Wouldn\u2019t settle for anything less than all of her.</p><p>Now he just had to convince her.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed. Lie on your stomach, hands behind you at the small of your back. I\u2019ll come to you as soon as I prepare everything.\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath and color suffused her cheeks. He could see her breathing had sped up and excitement reflected in her gaze. Her hand slid from his, leaving him bereft of her touch. Then she walked to his bed and positioned herself as he\u2019d directed.</p><p>He collected the items he needed from his closet. A leather strap. He was confident it would bring her\u2014and himself\u2014great pleasure. A length of rope.</p><p>He dropped the rope on the bed and then positioned his knee between her splayed thighs. He gathered her wrists in one hand and then began coiling the silken rope around them, binding them together.</p><p>She gasped softly. He could feel the tension coiling in her body.</p><p>When he had her wrists securely tied, he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cUp on your knees,\u201d he said firmly, injecting a bite of command into his tone. \u201cAss in the air. Cheek against the mattress.\u201d</p><p>She struggled upward, and he reached underneath her, splaying his hand over her soft belly. He helped her upward until her knees found purchase in the mattress and she rested her face against the bed.</p><p>Satisfied with her position, he stepped back again to retrieve the leather strap.</p><p>\u201cHave you done this before, Josie? I don\u2019t want it to be too much. You need to let me know what you can take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I can take a lot, Ash. Don\u2019t hold back. I . . . need it. I want it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, blanketing her with his body. \u201cIf it\u2019s too much, at any time, you say stop. Understand? It all ends with that word, darling.\u201d</p><p>A shudder rolled through her body. She liked endearments. He liked her reaction every time he used them.</p><p>Then he stepped back once more and smoothed a hand over her plump ass.</p><p>\u201cTwelve,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve marks you\u2019ll wear on your skin. When I\u2019m certain you\u2019re with me, we\u2019ll graduate to more. But for now, we start at a dozen.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her eyes closed, her lips tight with anticipation. He didn\u2019t make her wait any longer.</p><p>The first snap of leather against her skin was loud in the silence. She jumped, the red immediately blazing across her ass. Then a soft moan escaped her lips, the sound intoxicating to him.</p><p>Again he expertly delivered the blow, the other cheek this time. Red shimmered, coloring her skin, the contrast between the paler, untouched skin and where the leather had kissed beautiful and striking.</p><p>She squirmed restlessly as he administered the third, fourth and fifth. By the ninth, she was softly begging. More. Harder.</p><p>\u201cThe last three, Josie. They\u2019ll be harder. And then I\u2019m going to fuck your sweet ass. Think you can take that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh.\u201d</p><p>His name came out a moan. A desperate plea. Yeah, she was with him. More than with him. He was holding back, and she didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>He allowed more power into the tenth stroke, watching her closely, how she took the pain. It was there, at first. But just as quickly as the pain registered, she converted it, pushed it away and embraced the pleasure.</p><p>Her eyes, open now, were soft and dreamy, as if she\u2019d escaped into another world.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t used to tempering his movements, to holding himself back. He\u2019d held back with Bethany, that night he and Jace had been with her together, because Jace wouldn\u2019t allow him to do anything but. But Josie was important. Different. He wanted to cherish her. Be gentle and patient, even when she herself exuded impatience with his reserve. There would be plenty of time for him to give her everything. For now he wanted to make sure she was with him every step of the way, that he didn\u2019t cross the line and cause her more pain than pleasure.</p><p>He gave her the eleventh and then paused, savoring the last, wanting her edgy and needing. She twisted restlessly, arching back. He didn\u2019t even know if she was cognizant of the way her body begged for more.</p><p>\u201cTwelve, Josie. Take the last. Give it to me. Everything you have.\u201d</p><p>He brought the strap down, harder than the previous times, taking care not to hit the same spots he\u2019d hit before. The crack sounded. Her surprised yelp faded into a moan. A soft, sweet sigh of pleasure that prickled the hair at his nape and dove deep under his skin. His dick was rigid, so hard it was painful. He wanted inside her body. Deep in her ass. It was the one part of her he hadn\u2019t possessed yet, the final hurdle in his complete ownership of her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He dropped the strap, impatient to be inside her. But he held himself back, forcing himself to take the care he needed to ensure she could take him with no pain.</p><p>He took his time applying the lubricant, stretching her opening, adding one finger and then two, applying the gel inside and out. Then he squirted more into his hand and rubbed it down the length of his erection.</p><p>A groan escaped him. His dick hated his hand. It wasn\u2019t what it wanted. His cock wanted inside her.</p><p>He pushed forward, cupping her rosy buttocks in his palms before spreading them so her opening was bared to him. Then he circled his erection with one hand, palming the base, and guided it against her entrance.</p> <p>She presented the most erotic image, kneeling, ass presented, her hands bound and secured at the small of her back. Utterly helpless to do anything but take whatever he gave her.</p><p>He tucked the head of his cock to the puckered opening and began to press forward, taking his time and exerting patience he hadn\u2019t known he possessed.</p><p>She moaned as he began to push inward, stretching her tight ring around the thick width of his dick.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight it, baby. Push back and let me inside,\u201d he soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to feel so good when I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>He reached underneath her, circling her waist, his fingers splayed wide against her belly. Then he lowered his fingers, delving into the damp curls to find her clitoris. As soon as his finger brushed over the taut bud, she jerked in reaction and he took advantage of that burst of pleasure to thrust hard.</p> <p>She gasped as her body opened, surrendering to his invasion. He closed his eyes and breathed harshly through his nose as he fought off his release. God, she was so tight around him, gripping him like a fist. And he was only halfway in.</p><p>He stroked once more over her clit, exerting just the right amount of pressure, and when she began to buck back toward him, he used his strength to push himself the rest of the way in. To the balls. She enveloped him, swallowing him whole. His thighs rested against her ass as he heaved for breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d she whispered desperately. \u201cI can\u2019t hold it off, Ash. Oh God.\u201d</p><p>He moved his finger, just for a moment, waiting for her to catch up. He didn\u2019t want her to come yet. It would make his possession too painful. She needed to be with him the whole way. The minute she orgasmed, the edgy build-up would be lost and he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>\u201cNot until I do,\u201d he commanded, withdrawing a bit so he could push back into her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not ready yet, baby. You feel so damn good. Going to enjoy this sweet ass a little longer before I come inside you.\u201d</p><p>She moaned again, her ass clenching hard around his cock.</p> <p>He withdrew and thrust forward again, careful to keep his fingers from her clit. Then he touched her again, testing just how close she was to falling over.</p><p>The moment her body tightened, he took his finger away again, earning him a desperate sound of agitation and impatience. He smiled. So responsive. So fucking beautiful. And all his.</p><p>He was balls-deep inside her ass, no part of her body untouched by him. She wore his marks on that beautiful ass. And still she wanted more. Fucking perfect.</p><p>He began to thrust harder. Rhythmically. A drive to completion. As soon as he felt his balls draw up and the rush begin to hurdle over him, he began to stroke her clit again, wanting her with him. Wanting them both to fly over that edge together.</p><p>With his free hand, he curled his fingers around her bound wrists, gripping the rope, holding it and using it to pull her back hard against him to meet his thrusts. She let out a sharp cry, one that worried him for a moment because he feared he was hurting her. But she was thrusting back against him, desperate for more.</p><p>\u201cGet there, Josie,\u201d he rasped out. \u201cCome for me, baby. I\u2019m there. I\u2019m coming. Fuck me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers never left her clit, even as his own orgasm swarmed over him. The room blurred around him. He closed his eyes as he strained into her, as he yanked her back to meet his demanding thrusts.</p><p>The first spurt of his release was painful. Edgy. Overwhelming. Still, he continued to thrust, bathing her insides with his hot semen. Until it seeped from her opening and ran down the inside of her leg.</p> <p>The visual spurred his orgasm to further heights. Seeing the evidence of his possession on her body was supremely satisfying. He\u2019d never been so gratified before.</p><p>His name tore hoarsely from her mouth. Her entire body tightened. Her fingers balled into tight fists underneath his hand. Her body shook and trembled and then she slid down, her knees losing purchase on the bed. He went with her, his hand sliding from between her legs to brace himself on the bed so she didn\u2019t bear his full weight. But he let her have some of it. The feel of her beneath him, of the way he blanketed her body, hit him hard. He loved it.</p><p>Nothing was more satisfying than her beneath him, him deeply embedded in her body.</p><p>When it became evident that his weight was likely too much and that she struggled to catch up in her breathing, he shifted, causing them both to moan as he began to retreat from her ass.</p><p>Gently he pulled the rest of the way out, holding himself up on his palms as he looked down at her reddened ass, the distended opening where he\u2019d been just seconds before, and the traces of his semen on her skin.</p><p>\u201cFucking beautiful,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNever a more beautiful sight, baby.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, her eyelashes fluttering against her cheek. Then he loosened the bonds at her wrists and leaned in to scoop her into his arms. She nestled against his chest as he carried her into the bathroom. He set her down on the commode only long enough to turn on the shower and wait for the water to heat. Then he pulled her into the shower with him and washed every inch of her skin with gentle hands.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d he murmured as he stroked a hand over her cheek.</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes still glazed with passion. And she smiled. A beautiful, gut-tightening smile that made him want to take her all over again.</p><p>\u201cNever too much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was wonderful, Ash. I loved it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down to kiss her as the hot spray rained down on them both. \u201cGlad to hear you were with me, sweetness. Because it\u2019s definitely something I want to do again. Never going to have enough of you.\u201d</p><p>She circled his neck, hugging him as she returned his kiss. He reached up behind her to turn off the water and then he ushered her out to wrap a towel around her so she wouldn\u2019t get cold.</p><p>After she was dry, he wrapped his robe around her and tied the ends so she was completely covered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early yet. You want to go out and get something to eat or would you prefer me to order in and us eat here?\u201d</p><p>She paused a moment, her hands thrust into the pockets of the robe. The towel he\u2019d wrapped her hair in was perched atop her head, and she\u2019d never looked more beautiful than she did right here, wearing his robe, in his bathroom while they discussed their plans for the evening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to eat in. Here, with you, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our first night together. I mean not exactly, but it\u2019s the first day of you going to work and coming home. I\u2019d like to spend it alone with you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, because he understood what she was saying. He had no desire to share her with the world yet. It suited him just fine to stay behind the doors of his apartment, prolonging the inevitable, when they both would go out together.</p><p>He wanted to introduce her to Jace and Bethany. Gabe and Mia. He wanted to share her with his friends. Hoped they\u2019d become her friends as well. But for now, he was content to let it remain only the two of them for as long as they could hold off the outside world.</p><p>He leaned in to kiss her, brushing his lips long and sweet over hers. \u201cThat sounds perfect to me. I\u2019ll order the food and you can show me what you worked on today.\u201d</p><p>Chapter seventeen</p><p>Ash fingered the choker he\u2019d had designed for Josie as he waited for Jace to make his appearance in Ash\u2019s office. He\u2019d known exactly what he wanted for Josie, but finding someone who could custom design it in a matter of days had been challenging. But he found, as with everything else, if you had enough money, nothing was impossible.</p><p>He\u2019d chosen bronze because he loved the contrast of the golden metal against Josie\u2019s fair skin and it matched well with the golden streaks in her hair. But the stones, he\u2019d been adamant that they match her eyes. Aquamarines, rarely found on the market, were embedded in the metal, creating a dazzling jeweled choker that would look stunning against her skin and provide a perfect accompaniment to her gorgeous eyes.</p><p>He could have chosen blue topaz, but they weren\u2019t as rare or as expensive, and he wanted only the best for Josie. Smaller diamonds crusted the edge, providing a glittering border around the choker, and in between the aquamarines were smaller emeralds, just to provide a richer array of color.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted vibrant. Something that reflected her personality. Not just some dull, colorless piece of jewelry chosen without thought or care for the person receiving it.</p><p>The result, he had to admit, was stunning. He knew, without her seeing it first, that she would love it.</p><p>And the timing was perfect. Because he hadn\u2019t felt as though he could take this step with Josie until after the situation with Michael had been addressed. Tonight he would be taken care of and then Ash\u2019s focus would be solely on Josie. Michael would no longer be a threat.</p><p>The entire week Ash had been adamant that Josie remain in his apartment. He hadn\u2019t wanted her going out, and the one time she had\u2014a trip to the gallery to bring Mr. Downing more artwork and also to pick up her check for the last pieces\u2014he\u2019d sent his driver with her, and his driver had accompanied her inside. Ash hadn\u2019t wanted to take any chances that Michael would by lying in wait for her or that he\u2019d make a public scene, which Ash knew would appall Josie and embarrass her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t explained to Josie why he\u2019d been so forceful in his expectations, or why he\u2019d told her that the next week she would be granted more freedom to do as she liked. He could hardly tell her that he had to first take care of the asshole who\u2019d put his hands on her. None of what he had planned would touch Josie. He\u2019d make damn sure of that. And neither would Michael ever touch her again.</p><p>A sound at the door had him looking up to see Jace coming through. His friend\u2019s expression was grim and worried, but then Ash had already told him why he needed to see him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got everything set for tonight,\u201d Jace said quietly.</p><p>\u201cBethany\u2019s out, right?\u201d Ash asked. He\u2019d been explicit. While Jace would be involved, at least in the capacity of providing an alibi for Ash, he hadn\u2019t wanted Bethany to have any part in lying for him. Just as none of this would ever touch Josie, neither did he want it to touch Bethany. She\u2019d had enough hardship in her life and Ash wasn\u2019t about to pile on more.</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cI told her, just as you\u2019ve told Josie, that we have an important meeting here at the office. I\u2019ve set up the conference call with investors. You\u2019ll be here at the start so they all get a good look at you. You\u2019ll get up a few minutes in and excuse yourself to go to the bathroom. Mute the call for a period. But then it gets a little tricky, because you\u2019ll have to continue to conduct the conference call while you\u2019re on your way. If I angle the monitor just right, I can make me the primary focus and have your guy come in and sit in the background. Your coat, him there, but you on the actual call. Make sure they hear you periodically. I\u2019ve arranged for the building\u2019s security monitors to \u2018go down\u2019 right before the time you leave, so no cameras will catch you departing. I have an extra security badge you can use to buzz out, so according to the logs you\u2019ll still be here with me and if necessary I\u2019ll use your badge to leave when I go. I can only make the call go on for so long, so once you go silent to handle your situation, you need to make it quick and then pipe back in so it appears you were there for the entire call. It would be best if you come straight back here so we can both leave together once the cameras all go back online.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cThanks, man. Means a lot. And just so you know, if shit goes down, you\u2019re clean. I won\u2019t let this fall back on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust make sure shit doesn\u2019t go down,\u201d Jace said in a dry tone. \u201cI still think you should have someone else handle this. You\u2019re risking a fuck of a lot by doing this yourself.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cI want my point made, and the best way to do that is to deliver the message myself. I want this fucker scared shitless. I want him to know that I have him by the balls, and after I beat the shit out of him, I want him to know that I can easily ruin him if he ever steps out of line again.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s smile was rueful. \u201cHave to admit, you have a point. Also have to admit that if some fucker messed with Bethany, I\u2019d beat the hell out of him myself and not rely on others to do the dirty work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand me, then.\u201d</p><p>Jace nodded. \u201cYeah, I get you. Don\u2019t have to like it, but I get you. I\u2019m worried, Ash. Don\u2019t want this shit falling back on you. Not when you\u2019ve found . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He broke off and Ash pinned him with a look. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve found what?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s smile was crooked as he stared back at his friend. \u201cYour kryptonite.\u201d</p><p>Ash didn\u2019t flinch. Was that what Josie was? Yeah, he could see it. He\u2019d given Gabe and Jace no end of grief over falling head over ass for a woman and going against their play hard and live free motto. But now that he was in a very similar situation, he didn\u2019t object one bit.</p><p>A sense of peace settled over him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a lot more calm. Settled lately,\u201d Jace said. \u201cI like it on you, man. After Bethany . . .\u201d He broke off again with a sigh, almost as though he hated bringing it up after they\u2019d sworn not to go back there. \u201cAfter Bethany, I was worried. About you and me. Hated what happened even though I don\u2019t regret it. I hope to fuck that makes sense. I didn\u2019t like what it did to us and I didn\u2019t like how shitty I was to you and Bethany after that night. But I also don\u2019t regret the decision I made not to share her with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret it either,\u201d Ash said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m good with it, Jace. You need to stop dwelling on it. We\u2019re good. You got over being a dick. Bethany makes you happy. Now I\u2019ve got Josie, and she makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad for you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo word from your family? How are things with Brittany?\u201d</p> <p>Ash sighed. \u201cNothing this week, and that makes me nervous, because it\u2019s not like them to just give up and sit back. Brittany\u2019s happy in her job. She hasn\u2019t done much more than work and go home, but she\u2019ll get there. I want her to meet Mia and Josie and hook up with Mia\u2019s girls. They\u2019d be good for her. Josie is more Brittany\u2019s age, so maybe the two of them will hit it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound positively domesticated with all the girlfriend-arranging you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Jace teased.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, man.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s expression grew serious. \u201cSo nothing from the Wicked Bitch of the East? She laying low? And what about the old man? Can\u2019t believe he wouldn\u2019t have anything to say about Brittany\u2019s defection. Not when he\u2019s so high on family bonds, no matter how fake they may be.\u201d</p><p>Ash sighed. \u201cYeah. Nothing this week. But I don\u2019t expect that to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when the shit hits the fan, I expect you to let me know. No way I\u2019m letting you into that viper\u2019s nest without backup.\u201d</p> <p>Ash chuckled. \u201cYou make it sound like a sting operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, an evening with your family qualifies.\u201d</p><p>Ash checked his watch. \u201cWant to grab a bite to eat before our conference call? I want to call and check in with Josie. Make sure everything\u2019s all right with her and remind her that I\u2019ll be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Want to hit the Grill again?\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cThanks again, Jace. Know I don\u2019t say it enough, but you and Gabe always having my back . . . Don\u2019t have words.\u201d</p><p>Jace grinned. \u201cAfter tonight, how about you let your lady off the leash and let her mingle with the rest of us?\u201d</p><p>Ash laughed. \u201cYeah, I know, I\u2019ve kept her to myself this week. It\u2019s been nice. But yeah, I want her to meet you and Bethany. Gabe and Mia will be back by Sunday. Would be nice to get together with them too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago would you have ever thought that the three of us would be so tangled up with women? Gabe married, me engaged and you head over ass for a woman you only just met?\u201d</p> <p>Ash shot him a glare. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about being head over ass for a woman after only just meeting.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s grin was unrepentant. \u201cOnly takes one time, man. When it\u2019s the right woman, you just know. I would have never thought it would go down like that, but then when I saw Bethany, I just knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I hear you. I wasn\u2019t much of a believer myself, but then I met Josie and something just clicked. Can\u2019t even explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need to. I get it,\u201d Jace said as they walked out of Ash\u2019s office. He stopped outside the door and turned to Ash, his eyes serious. \u201cJust remember this, man, and it\u2019s applicable and so true on so many levels. Take it from me, because I did my best to fuck it up. Falling in love is the easy part. It\u2019s everything else that happens afterward that\u2019s hard and takes work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. You\u2019ve turned into a pyschobabbling pussy,\u201d Ash said in disgust.</p><p>Jace flipped him off. \u201cFine, don\u2019t listen to some friendly advice, but don\u2019t come crying to me when you fuck things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d Ash grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWant to walk or take the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk,\u201d Ash said. \u201cI\u2019ll call Josie on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ash stared stonily down into the bloody face of Michael Cooper while the other men who\u2019d accompanied Ash stood to the side, their gazes alert, watching for any sign of discovery.</p><p>Ash flexed his fingers, working the stiffness from his knuckles, the gloves he\u2019d worn torn across one hand and smeared with the other man\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cYou forget Josie Carlysle exists. Understand? If I hear of you coming within a mile of her, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded his head, spitting blood from the side of his mouth. \u201cI understand. Jesus. She\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong, asshole. She\u2019s worth it. More than you could ever imagine. She\u2019s mine now and I protect what\u2019s mine. Furthermore, if you even think of going to the police like she should have done when you laid hands on her, I will make your life hell. I\u2019ll be watching you, Cooper. Don\u2019t ever forget it. If you try to start trouble over this, I\u2019ll ruin you. You\u2019ll have nothing left. And if you don\u2019t think I have the money, power and connections to make it happen, just try me. When I\u2019m finished with you, you\u2019ll be living in a cardboard box begging for money so you can eat.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded again, fear and panic blazing in his eyes. He was a pathetic, ball-less worm.</p><p>Ash let go of Michael\u2019s shirt and shoved him to the ground where he lay panting for breath, quiet moans of pain slipping from his battered mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you did to her, you son of a bitch,\u201d Ash said, fury lacing his every word. \u201cYou hit her and then held her down on the floor while you hit her again. Count yourself lucky that this is all I\u2019m doing to you. Forget my warning, and I\u2019ll come down on you so hard that you\u2019ll feel me when you\u2019re taking a piss. For that matter, I\u2019m watching you, Cooper. If I ever hear of you hurting any woman again, you\u2019ll go down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed to go,\u201d one of the men said in a low voice. \u201cFew minutes was all you said. It\u2019s dangerous to be out here any longer.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cI\u2019m done with this asshole.\u201d</p><p>Ash and the others turned, leaving Michael along the side of the building where they\u2019d ambushed him. It was a path he took every evening and, luckily for Ash, it was well out of sight of the main streets. Still, he was taking a huge risk. If the wrong person happened upon them, all hell would break lose. He couldn\u2019t afford to be seen, couldn\u2019t afford any witnesses that would counteract his alibi if Michael pulled a really dumb move and went to the police.</p><p>He pulled up the collar of his long coat, one that would be discarded and never used again, one he\u2019d purchased specifically for tonight. Satisfied his face was shielded by the cap he\u2019d pulled low over his hair and the lapels that covered his cheeks, he hurried off, leaving Michael lying on the ground, the victim of an apparent mugging. He\u2019d been more than willing to let the other men take what they wanted.</p><p>Ash slipped the man on his right a wad of cash and muttered his thanks.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, McIntyre,\u201d C.J. murmured. \u201cIf you need us, you know where to find us.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded and strode in the opposite direction from them when they reached the street. He was only a few blocks from the office building and he had to hurry to make it back before the cameras came back online. He grabbed his phone, the call still open, and brought it to his ear. He still had the mute button punched and left it so the sounds from the streets couldn\u2019t be heard.</p><p>He listened in as Jace effectively held the conversation, giving no opportunity for Ash to have interjected anything. When he reached the door of the office building, he hurried in, making sure his face was obscured. He ducked into a bathroom on the first floor and stuffed the coat into the gym bag he carried and ripped off the cap. After checking his appearance and ensuring there was no blood on him anywhere, he punched the mute button on his phone and headed toward the elevator.</p><p>A few minutes later, he stood in the doorway of Jace\u2019s office and motioned for the other hired man to step away. They traded jackets, the other man quickly disappeared and Jace joined the wrap-up, thanking the investors for their time and fielding a few last minute questions. Jace looked inquiringly at him, his gaze sweeping up and down Ash as if to gauge whether there was any indication of what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Ash just nodded in his direction as they ended the call.</p><p>There was silence a long moment before Jace finally broke it.</p><p>\u201cAny problems?\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head. \u201cNo. Fucker is taken care of. He\u2019ll wear the bruises longer than Josie did. And he\u2019ll think twice before raising a hand to another woman again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad it\u2019s done with. This shit stresses me out, man. Would love to know when the fuck you fell in with the kind of guys you pulled in for this job. Hell, for that matter, how you knew the men you had take care of Bethany\u2019s problem with the man Jack owed money to.\u201d</p><p>Ash shrugged. \u201cDoes it matter? They aren\u2019t people I\u2019ll ever invite to dinner or people you, Gabe and especially our women ever have to meet.\u201d</p><p>Jace sighed. \u201cJust makes me wonder what kind of shit you\u2019ve been into that I didn\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing illegal,\u201d Ash drawled.</p><p>\u201cUntil now,\u201d Jace said quietly.</p><p>\u201cUntil now,\u201d Ash agreed. \u201cBut it had to be done. Not going to allow anyone to fuck over my woman. Won\u2019t hesitate to do it again if there\u2019s ever the need.\u201d</p><p>Jace rose, blowing out his breath in a deep exhale. \u201cI\u2019m ready to get home to my woman, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re ready to get home to yours.\u201d His gaze drifted over Ash again, concern bright in his eyes. \u201cYou okay, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good. Fucker didn\u2019t touch me. My hand\u2019s sore, but nothing serious.\u201d</p><p>Jace shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here and make damn sure we\u2019re seen leaving together.</p><p>Chapter eighteen</p><p>It was the first night all week that Ash had been late coming home from work, and it sucked. Despite them only being together a week, Josie had grown used to Ash coming home to her before dark. They\u2019d fallen into a comfortable routine. She worked during the day. He worked during the day. But then he came home and she was waiting for him. Every day. On the couch, naked. And when he walked through that door, the air immediately changed.</p><p>She\u2019d asked for kink, and Ash had certainly delivered. Her ass was still sore from last night\u2019s interlude. The first spanking on Monday night hadn\u2019t been overwhelming. It had been perfect. Then he\u2019d laid off the rest of the week, opting for other explorations that didn\u2019t involve him taking a crop to her ass.</p><p>But then last night?</p><p>She rubbed a hand over her bottom, enjoying the tingling sensation from the still-raised welts. He\u2019d used a crop, and he hadn\u2019t been as gentle as he had that first night. But then she\u2019d begged him for more. More edge. More of that fine line between pain and pleasure.</p><p>What did he have in mind for tonight? Or would he be too tired after a long day at work and a late meeting?</p><p>Her phone rang, and she pounced, her eyes lighting up when she saw it was Ash calling.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cHey baby. I\u2019m on my way. Be ready for me. Been a long day. Just want to get home to you.\u201d</p><p>A thrill shot through her chest. It made her ridiculously giddy that this man looked forward to coming home to her so much. Ash was a man who could have any woman he wanted. And he wanted her. There wasn\u2019t a woman alive who wouldn\u2019t enjoy a stroke to the ego like that.</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting, Ash.\u201d</p><p>She already had in mind the way she wanted to greet him tonight. Granted, they did things his way. His control. His authority. He called the shots. But he hadn\u2019t asked her to suck his cock since that first night either, and she knew he enjoyed it. A lot.</p><p>Tonight, she wanted to do that for him. Take control just long enough to give him pleasure after a long, exhausting day. Somehow she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d mind giving her that tiny bit of control.</p><p>She shrugged out of her clothes, brushed her hair and then checked her appearance, just as she did every day when she expected him. Then she went into the living room to wait for him on the couch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t seem to have as long to wait this time, which either meant he\u2019d waited longer to call her or perhaps she\u2019d relaxed enough in their routine that each minute didn\u2019t feel as though an hour was passing.</p><p>As soon as she heard the elevator open, she swung her legs over the couch and slipped to her knees on the thick, fur rug in front of the sofa.</p><p>When hers and Ash\u2019s gazes connected, she felt a jolt at the intensity in those brilliant green eyes. They were hard, but appreciative. Dark, so dark it made her shivery. If his expression was anything to go by, this hadn\u2019t been the best day in the world, but he seemed very satisfied to find her waiting on her knees, even if he\u2019d told her he didn\u2019t expect her to kneel.</p><p>He stalked toward her, discarding his briefcase with a thump on the floor. He also pulled off his suit jacket and tossed it toward the armchair and immediately began unbuttoning his sleeves.</p> <p>When he stopped in front of her, she put her hands up, sliding them to his fly, and his eyes flared in surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m welcoming you home. Just stand there and enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d he breathed out.</p><p>She unzipped his pants and impatiently shoved them down over his hips and then dove into his boxers, gently pulling his rigid erection free of confinement. She licked her lips, anticipating that first taste of him. The feel of so much hard flesh over her tongue.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Josie. You licking your lips like that is about to drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again just as she guided the broad head of his penis to her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d</p><p>He sucked in his breath, a sharp inhalation that was audible in the quiet. She licked the head and then tucked it inside her mouth, sucking gently as she pulled him deeper inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you today,\u201d she whispered as she let his cock slide free momentarily. \u201cBeen waiting all evening for you to come home. Wanted to make it special. Something you won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuaranteed I\u2019m not forgetting this, darling. Never. Love coming home to you. This week has been the best week of my life.\u201d</p><p>Again that giddy thrill attacked her, spreading warmth through her entire body. She loved that he was so open with her. There was no doubting how he felt, that he wanted her. No silly guessing games. No games period. But then, he\u2019d told her that. That he didn\u2019t play games. That they were real. What they did was real. Maybe she hadn\u2019t fully appreciated that at first, but he\u2019d proven to her that he meant those words.</p> <p>Every day, he didn\u2019t hesitate to tell her how beautiful she was, how much he wanted her, how much he liked having her in his apartment. That he adored her gift of submission and that he treasured the fact she\u2019d given him her trust.</p><p>In a week\u2019s time, this had surpassed any relationship she\u2019d ever had in the past. In just one week, Ash had become more deeply entrenched than any other man had. With Michael, their times apart hadn\u2019t felt interminable. She didn\u2019t watch the clock, anxious for the next time she\u2019d see him.</p><p>Her heart hadn\u2019t been involved. And now it was. Ash didn\u2019t just own her body. He owned her heart and soul and he\u2019d conquered it in less than a week.</p><p>It sounded crazy. Things like this only happened in books or movies. Relationships were tricky things you had to work at. They didn\u2019t just happen. Love didn\u2019t just happen. Did it?</p><p>But it had.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t love him so soon, could she? Not when they were still learning each other, exploring the boundaries of their relationship.</p><p>She was in lust. Definitely. She was definitely in \u201clike\u201d with him. She liked him a hell of a lot. But did she love him? Did she feel as though every minute apart was the most agonizing torture?</p><p>It made her crazy, because she knew she was falling hard for this man, but she fought the idea, knowing it was too soon. Knowing there was still too much she didn\u2019t know about this man. She hadn\u2019t even met his friends. His family. Though she doubted that would ever come. He hated them. He\u2019d made no secret about that.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t imagine hating her family. She\u2019d adored her mother and mourned her after her passing. But she hated her father, so who was she to judge Ash? But then, she didn\u2019t count her father as family. Because family didn\u2019t bail on you. Not true family.</p><p>No, her father was a sperm donor and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re not here.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s gentle reprimand brought her abruptly back to the present and out of her scattered thoughts. She glanced up to see him staring down at her, his brows drawn together as he slid his cock from her mouth.</p><p>She flushed, guilty that she\u2019d been caught out so easily. There was no hiding from Ash. He saw everything. He was in tune with her moods, her thoughts. It was scary to her that he read her so easily after only a week together.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, baby? Because it\u2019s definitely not my dick. Not that what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t feel good, but your head\u2019s not in it.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and rocked back on her heels, her fingers still wrapped around his length.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Ash. My fault. I was just thinking about a hundred different things.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he\u2019d punish her. It\u2019s certainly what Michael would have done. And his punishments weren\u2019t kinky pleasures. They hurt. They were meant to hurt.</p><p>Ash\u2019s gaze narrowed as he continued to study her. \u201cWhat the hell is going through your head right now? Whatever it is, I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, almost allowing the word \u201cnothing\u201d to slip out. It would do no good to deny him. He\u2019d only push her until she gave him the truth. He liked bluntness and honesty. He liked knowing what was going on in her head.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering if you\u2019d punish me for zoning out,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd I was thinking about Michael\u2019s punishments and the fact that he would absolutely have punished me for not giving him my full attention. And his punishments aren\u2019t kinky pleasurable punishments like yours. They . . . hurt. Just hurt. There\u2019s no pleasure in them.\u201d</p><p>There was a spark of rage in Ash\u2019s eyes that made her withdraw her hand instinctively. Darkness tracked over his entire face and she immediately regretted the fact that she\u2019d been so honest. She shouldn\u2019t have brought up Michael. Not brought him into Ash\u2019s apartment. Into their lives.</p><p>She lowered her gaze, knotting her fingers together between her knees.</p><p>Above her, Ash swore but she didn\u2019t look up. Then his hands closed gently around her shoulders and lifted upward until she was standing right in front of him. He pulled his pants up and refastened the fly.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of those times when we\u2019re going to talk, but we\u2019re going to do it with you in my arms.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look angry, and relief coursed through her. Damn it, but it was hard navigating the waters of a new relationship. Always worrying about doing or saying the wrong thing was exhausting. She didn\u2019t want to screw this up. She was already half in love, okay maybe a lot in love with Ash, and she wanted to see where things would take them.</p><p>Ash turned her toward the couch and then sat, pulling her with him. His hands slid over her body, up her arms, before giving her another gentle squeeze. He cupped her face, thumbed the small area right at the corner of her mouth where there was still the faintest hint of a bruise.</p><p>\u201cTold you before, I\u2019m not your father. You aren\u2019t my daughter. We aren\u2019t playing daddy/daughter roles here. You\u2019re a grown woman, free to make your own choices. And if that sounds contradictory to the kind of relationship you and I have, it\u2019s not meant to be. You have a choice whether to submit to me. I can\u2019t make you. Can\u2019t force you to make decisions you don\u2019t want to make. Don\u2019t want to make you do that. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWhich means that I\u2019m not into punishment for things you supposedly do wrong or to displease me. That just makes me an asshole, and that\u2019s not who I want to be with you. Now, when I feel like reddening your ass because it turns us both on? Yeah, I\u2019m down with that. And it\u2019ll happen often if I have my way about it. But as for pulling out a crop and inflicting pain on you for no other reason than you did something wrong, or you pissed me off? Not going to happen. Ever. Because that would make me no better than the bastard who hit you because he was pissed that you dumped him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, understanding where he was coming from.</p><p>\u201cDo you really get it, Josie? It pisses me off to think of him meting out pain to you because of a supposed infraction. I am never going to touch you physically or sexually when I\u2019m pissed. I may say shit that hurts you. I have a temper. But I\u2019m not ever going to hurt you purposely.\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded, some of the tension lightening in her chest.</p><p>His voice lowered until it was soft, his gaze finding hers, warm and tender.</p><p>\u201cBaby, what I need you to understand is that your relationship with Michael was not good. It wasn\u2019t healthy. And it\u2019s not indicative of the kind of relationship you thought you were getting with him. Maybe that works for other people, and if it does, more power to them. As long as both the man and the woman are down with it and the woman consents. If that\u2019s what she wants and needs from the guy she\u2019s with, then fine. But it doesn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m a demanding bastard. You and I both know that. But I\u2019m not so egotistical and arrogant that it\u2019s all about me all the time. If there\u2019s something you don\u2019t like or something you don\u2019t want, then all you have to do is tell me. We\u2019ll talk about it. Figure out if it\u2019s really important. And we\u2019ll find a way to work around it.\u201d</p><p>She battled a smile but it broadened her lips and relief registered in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWas going to do this when I got here, but seeing you on your knees, naked and waiting for me . . . Let\u2019s just say I forgot all about what I was going to do. But you\u2019re here in my arms now, and I think this is the next logical step.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side and looked inquisitively at him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go get it out of my briefcase.\u201d</p><p>He turned, easing her onto the couch, and then slid from underneath her. He strode toward his discarded briefcase, rummaged around for a moment and then returned carrying a long, rectangular box.</p><p>He tucked the box under his arm and resumed their earlier position. Him on the couch leaned against the arm with her on his lap, his arms firmly around her. He held the box in front of her so they could both see it and then he carefully opened it, revealing a stunning choker.</p><p>She gasped as he took it out and held it up. She knew what it was. He\u2019d told her he was having one made. But she\u2019d never imagined it would be so exquisite.</p><p>\u201cI want you to wear this, Josie. I want you to understand what it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to, Ash,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He held it up, wrapping it around her neck. She turned so he could fasten it in back and then turned back to him, taking in his fierce expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. And it was. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely something I would have chosen for myself.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s you. It suits you. I wanted something to match your eyes, but I also wanted something that reflected your personality. Your vibrancy.\u201d</p><p>Tears bit the corners of her eyes and she sucked in a breath so she didn\u2019t lose the battle and let them fall.</p><p>He touched her cheek, stroking tenderly over her skin and then slipped his fingers down to trail over the collar resting at the hollow of her throat.</p><p>\u201cWant you to understand what this means, baby,\u201d he said again. \u201cI know it\u2019s fast, but just because it\u2019s fast doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not real. I saw my two best friends fall hard and fast. Very fast. I know it can happen and that it can last. I want you and me to last. Not saying we\u2019re there yet. But I want us to get there. And I want you to understand the significance of this collar. In some ways it\u2019s even more important than an engagement ring. Not that you won\u2019t have that too. When it\u2019s time, you\u2019ll have the rock and you\u2019ll have my commitment. But this collar is every bit as important as a ring and those formalities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say,\u201d she said, her voice cracking as she stared down at him in awe.</p><p>\u201cSay you understand its meaning and say you\u2019ll wear it. Then we\u2019ll get to the other parts of the conversation I want to have with you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and then lifted her fingers to touch the collar. \u201cI won\u2019t ever take it off, Ash.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction gleamed in his eyes and then he pulled her down into a long, breathless kiss. When he pulled away, his eyes were half-lidded and smoky with desire.</p><p>\u201cNow, to get back to your relationship with Michael.\u201d</p><p>She made a face but he put his finger to her lips.</p><p>\u201cI get that it\u2019s not a good subject. I understand you not wanting to talk about it or even being afraid to bring him up when you\u2019re with me. But darling, this is you we\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m not going to pretend that your relationship with him didn\u2019t happen and I\u2019m not that much of an asshole to forbid any mention of your past and the things that affect you. You never have to be afraid to say anything to me. If it concerns you then it concerns me and we talk about it. Got it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I get it. I just didn\u2019t want him here, you know? Your apartment is our world and I hate bringing him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, baby. But here is where you should feel the safest bringing up shit from your past that hurts you. I don\u2019t want you ever holding out on me. Now, what I was going to add was that your relationship with Michael was all sorts of fucked up. And I\u2019ll tell you why I think that. I don\u2019t want you thinking I\u2019m judging you or thinking you were an idiot for being with him. But what I\u2019m going to say is important and it has bearing on what you and I have now.\u201d</p><p>God, she loved this man. If she hadn\u2019t already acknowledged that she was falling hard and fast for him, these words, completely and utterly sincere, amazingly awesome words, would have sealed the deal for her. Where else would she ever find a man like this? Someone who was so caring and considerate. So tender and gentle with her and yet rough and demanding when she needed it?</p><p>He was, in a word, perfect. And she hadn\u2019t thought perfect men existed except in fantasy land.</p> <p>She settled into his arms, warm and content, waiting to hear what he\u2019d say next.</p><p>\u201cMichael took from you in your relationship but he didn\u2019t give shit back. And I know this from what you\u2019ve told me. He expected things from you. He punished you when you didn\u2019t comply. But he didn\u2019t give you anything back. You said he was cold and distant. He was never affectionate. He didn\u2019t give you the things you needed. And he didn\u2019t reward you when you did something that pleased him.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips in distaste because Ash had nailed it right on the head. And the hell of it was she\u2019d never seen it while she was in the relationship with Michael. She\u2019d wrongly assumed that all relationships like the one she had with Michael were that way. Ash was fast proving her wrong.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t show you affection. He didn\u2019t do things for you because he knew you\u2019d love them. And, baby, that\u2019s wrong. Your relationship with him was all about him. Not about you. It was about what he could take from you without having to give back. And that\u2019s ten sorts of fucked up. It\u2019s no way for a man to treat a woman he\u2019s supposed to cherish and protect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not like that,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>His eyes flared. \u201cThank fuck you feel that way, baby. I wouldn\u2019t be pleased at all if you thought I wasn\u2019t giving you back what you needed from me. And if it ever comes to that, I want you to let me know. Because I\u2019ll fix it. I won\u2019t ever consciously do it. But if it does ever happen, I expect you to give me a loud wake-up call.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNo worries there, Ash. Now that you\u2019ve shown me how it can be, I\u2019m a greedy bitch and I\u2019ll never go back to the way it was with Michael. You\u2019ve spoiled me for any other man.\u201d</p><p>His expression darkened. \u201cIt\u2019s a good damn thing because I have no intention of you ever finding out what it\u2019s like with another man. If I\u2019m not giving you what you need, then you better be telling me what it is I\u2019m not giving you because you going to another man for that . . . Not happening. You\u2019re mine, Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours,\u201d she whispered, tracing her fingers down his firm jawline.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk about me letting you off the leash so to speak.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up. \u201cLeash? Ash, that sounds horrible! Is that what you think you\u2019ve done? Put a leash on me?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cWas just joking with you, darling. Jace accused me of having a leash on you because I\u2019ve been keeping you all to myself. And he\u2019s right. I\u2019ve kept a pretty tight rein on you this week. It\u2019s me being selfish. I haven\u2019t wanted to share you with anyone yet. And that\u2019s not fair to you. You\u2019ve only been out once this entire week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t minded, Ash. I\u2019ve loved this week with you. And I\u2019ve been working. So it\u2019s been fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019ll get old after a while. I just wanted to make sure . . .\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and broke off.</p><p>\u201cMake sure of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot important,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cThe point is that I want you to meet my friends. They\u2019re the most important people in my life next to you. They\u2019re my family. My real family. Gabe and Mia are going to get in late Saturday and if they\u2019re up for it, I\u2019d like to take you to meet everyone Sunday. I\u2019d like you to meet my sister, Brittany, too. She\u2019s having a hard time of it and she\u2019s almost the same age as you. Mia and Bethany and Mia\u2019s girls are a bit younger but I think you\u2019ll like them too. Mia and Bethany have good heads on their shoulders and they both have hearts as big as Alaska.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d she said sincerely. \u201cIf they mean that much to you, I have no doubt I\u2019ll like them, Ash. And I want to meet the people you care about. I\u2019m happy you want to share that part of yourself with me. I just wish I had that to share with you as well.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her again. \u201cWant you to have people to love and support you, baby. Hate that you\u2019re alone with no family and that you lost your mother. I\u2019m sure I would have loved her if she\u2019s everything you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled and reached up to kiss him again.</p><p>\u201cBethany is different, Josie, and I want you to know that going in. She\u2019s had a hard life, so it would probably not be a good idea for you to ask her about herself. Before now I mean.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s eyebrows came together in question as she stared up at Ash. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Ash sighed. \u201cShe was homeless when Jace and I met her. She was working Mia\u2019s engagement party. We didn\u2019t know that at the time. We slept with her that night as I\u2019ve already told you. But she bailed the next morning and Jace damn near turned the city over looking for her. He found her in a shelter and took her home with him. The rest is history, but even after that, she had some tough times. She had a foster brother who lived on the streets with her and he was mixed up in some shit. Bethany used to be addicted to painkillers and she\u2019d worked past that, but the heaviness of her relationship with Jace nearly made her go back. And then her brother, Jack, drugged her hot chocolate and nearly killed her. We all thought she\u2019d overdosed and that she\u2019d tried to commit suicide. It was a cluster fuck because the night before Jace came home to find me with Bethany in his apartment and he flipped. Took it out on me and her and upset Bethany. So the next morning when this shit happened, it didn\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Josie breathed. \u201cThat sounds unbelievable! Like something you\u2019d see on a television show or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ash muttered. \u201cOnly it was all too real. Jack didn\u2019t mean to hurt her. He was the one going to commit suicide but Bethany picked up the wrong cup and ended up in the hospital fighting for her life. I just wanted you to know all of this so you don\u2019t ask the wrong questions or bring up shit that makes the situation awkward for you or for Bethany.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, a question burning, but she wasn\u2019t sure she should ask because it made her sound . . . jealous. Even if she still did feel a bit of the sting when he talked about Bethany. Because his expression changed when he talked about her. It was obvious that even if she did belong to his friend, he definitely cared a lot about her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Ash prompted. \u201cI know that look. You\u2019re wanting to ask me something. Just ask, baby. You have to know by now you can ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you said Jace found you and Bethany in his apartment and flipped out. But you told me it was just that first night . . .\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cIt was nothing. I\u2019d gone over to bring Jace stuff from work. We had a deal going south, which is why he was in such a pissy mood when he got there and immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion. I owed Bethany an apology. I came down on her pretty hard in the beginning. Didn\u2019t think she was right for Jace. Saw how he was losing his damn mind over her. I also wanted to move past the awkwardness of that first night and how we all met. So I apologized to her and told her I wanted us to be friends. That Jace was important to me so it meant now she was important to me. That was what Jace walked in on.\u201d</p><p>Josie nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Ash cocked his head, staring intently at her. \u201cDoes the thing with Bethany still bother you?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders heaved with a sigh but she was honest. She owed him that much at least.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I won\u2019t lie. It makes me a little nervous to meet her. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe you at all. But I don\u2019t know a woman alive who likes being confronted by her man\u2019s ex-lover, even if it was just a one-night stand. And bad enough to have to meet her, but to have to spend time together long term. I\u2019ll get over it. But I\u2019m honest enough to admit that when I meet her for the first time, I\u2019ll be picturing you with her and that won\u2019t be fun.\u201d</p><p>Ash didn\u2019t look happy with that statement.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you torturing yourself over this, baby. It meant nothing. Or at least I should say it meant nothing to me. It meant a hell of a lot to Jace. And if he\u2019d been honest with me from the start, that night would have never happened. I would have backed off because I wasn\u2019t into her. Not then and not now.\u201d</p><p>Relief settled into her chest. His words were absolutely sincere, and she believed him absolutely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being silly. I won\u2019t let it bother me, Ash. I promise. And I won\u2019t bring it up. I won\u2019t bring up Bethany\u2019s past either. She sounds like a pretty amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Ash said. \u201cShe\u2019s perfect for Jace. And you\u2019re perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter nineteen</p><p>Ash led Josie into the bedroom, his jaw clenched tight as he battled the urge to haul her onto the bed and thrust into her and ride her long and hard. He was on edge, the thing with Michael still bright in his mind.</p><p>And it only made his desire to possess Josie, to reassert his claim and possession, that much more fierce. It was inexplicable, this urge that came over him whenever he was near her. He wondered if it would ever dim with time. Somehow he didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Something this volatile, this consuming, wasn\u2019t just a flash in the pan. It wouldn\u2019t go away next week, next month or even next year. He could well imagine himself feeling this way ten or twenty years into the future. Which told him he was already thinking long-term, no matter that he\u2019d decided to take it a day at a time and not look beyond the present.</p><p>It was damn hard to only think about today when he was dead set on tying her to him on a permanent basis. Everything he did now was to convince her to remain with him. To show her how perfect she was for him and hopefully how perfect for her he was.</p><p>Josie turned, her naked body soft and warm against his. She gazed up at him, her eyes glowing with soft desire. He thought, at times, could swear, that he saw love in her eyes. But maybe it was what he wanted to see. She hadn\u2019t said anything, but then neither had he. It was too fast. No matter what he told her, it had only been a week. People didn\u2019t fall in love in a week.</p><p>Only they did. He\u2019d seen it. Knew it happened. Knew it lasted.</p><p>Did he want Josie to love him?</p><p>Hell yeah he did. He wanted it, could taste it, would savor the sweetness of those words when they finally passed her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like tonight, Ash?\u201d she asked in a soft voice. \u201cTell me how you want me. You\u2019ve had a long day. I want to make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>His heart softened. Sweet, darling Josie. So eager to please. So warm and willing. The darkness that had hung over him ever since he\u2019d left the office building to go after Michael lifted under the ray of sunshine that was Josie. Some of the tension left his shoulders as her hands smoothed up his arms and to his neck where she cupped his jaw in her palms.</p><p>\u201cNot going to mark your ass tonight, baby. I did that last night. Loved every minute of it. Loved those marks on your sweet ass. But it would hurt if I did it tonight.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t want the violence he\u2019d meted out just an hour earlier to touch her in any way. He knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt her\u2014intentionally\u2014but he\u2019d give himself no possibility of slipping beyond the here and now and back into that dark place he\u2019d been when he\u2019d beat another man.</p><p>He didn\u2019t regret what he\u2019d done, but neither did he want it touching Josie. Ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d she whispered. \u201cTell me. I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed a hand down the side of her hair, staring down into her eyes awash with earnestness. So eager to please. So soft and submissive she made his gut ache.</p><p>\u201cWant you on your hands and knees, baby. Not tying you up tonight. Want you to be able to hold yourself up. Going to fuck that pussy first and then I\u2019m going to have your ass. Won\u2019t be as gentle as I was that first night I had your ass. Can you handle that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her breath stuttered across her lips and her pupils dilated rapidly as desire swamped her face.</p><p>\u201cI want whatever you give me, Ash.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her mouth, sliding his tongue in to taste her. He loved the way he swallowed her breath, breathed in the same air she expelled. There was something decidedly intimate about that. About taking the air she gave, sucking it in and savoring it before returning it.</p><p>\u201cGo get on the bed,\u201d he said in a gruff voice. \u201cHands and knees, knees perched on the edge of the mattress.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him and he was reluctant to let her go even for the time it took her to position herself as he\u2019d directed. He watched as she crawled onto the bed and presented her ass just the way he wanted. Then she glanced back over her shoulder, clear invitation in her eyes.</p><p>She wanted this. She was ready. He just had to make sure he didn\u2019t take things too far. She deserved gentleness. She\u2019d already suffered far too much at the hands of a dominant man. Not that Michael could be called dominant. What he was was an asshole. An abusive dickhead who got off on controlling the woman in his life.</p><p>Not that Ash would be any less controlling, but it was all in the presentation. Josie would absolutely heed Ash\u2019s authority, but he\u2019d give her all the things Michael had never given her. Love. Respect. Tenderness. He\u2019d absolutely cherish her.</p><p>He quickly undressed and grabbed the tube of lubricant from the nightstand drawer, dropped it on the bed next to Josie\u2019s ass and then smoothed his hands over her behind, cupping and caressing. The marks from the night before were still there. Fading, but still visible, a stark contrast against her pale, soft skin.</p><p>His marks. Evidence of his possession. Arousal splintered hard and fierce through his body until his dick swelled, threatening to burst under the exquisite torture.</p><p>He slid his fingers through the folds of her pussy, testing her arousal. She was swollen and wet, more than ready for his entry, but still, he held off, wanting to stroke her to further heights.</p><p>She twisted restlessly, pushing back against his probing fingers, clutching greedily at him as he withdrew. He stroked again, going deeper, testing the plush walls of her vagina, seeking the spot where the texture was rougher, slightly different than the rest. He pressed in and she let out a cry. A burst of wetness coated his fingers and he smiled. Yeah, she was ready. And he couldn\u2019t wait to get inside her.</p><p>Grasping his dick with one hand, he spread her with the other, positioning himself at the mouth of her pussy before pushing in, slowly, inch by inch, until they were both vibrating with need.</p><p>When he gained his depth and strained against her, his balls flattened between her ass and his thighs, she let out a breathy sigh that he felt all the way to his soul. All the ways to take her swirled in the darkness of his mind. There was something about her that called to that darkness, like she was the one person with whom it would be okay to share that. She wanted it. She could take it. She needed it. Just as he needed it.</p><p>He leaned over her, blanketing her with his body as he remained tightly wedged inside her pussy.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Josie,\u201d he said in a silky, entreating voice. \u201cDid all the talk of my threesome with Bethany and Jace make you jealous?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened and then turned her head, clear puzzlement and discomfort displayed in her expression.</p><p>\u201cAsh . . . I don\u2019t understand . . .\u201d</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t have. It came out all wrong. He cursed his tongue because it hadn\u2019t come out as he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>\u201cJust meant, did you picture yourself in that threesome? Is it something you thought about? Is it something that turned you on and you wanted?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes still perplexed. But there, just a flash. A hint of something in her eyes. He could barely see it because of the way she was turned.</p><p>\u201cI think it did turn you on,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cAnd I already said it wasn\u2019t happening. Did that disappoint you, Josie? Did you imagine what it was like to have two cocks at the same time?\u201d</p><p>He reached underneath her to stroke her clit, feeling her body respond to his touch. She tightened around him, her sweet pussy fluttering and clenching, bearing down on his erection until he was near to exploding.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI imagined what it would feel like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another way,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cNot quite as good as the real thing, but I can give you that sensation if nothing else. Have no desire to ever share you with another man, darling, but I can give you that experience at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said in a breathless, excited tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put in an anal plug. A bigger one so you\u2019re all snug and tight around it. Then I\u2019ll fuck your pussy with the plug inserted. You\u2019ll have the experience of two cocks inside you without there being another man in the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>That one word conveyed a whole host of things. Excitement. Arousal. Yeah, she wanted it. And he\u2019d give her that. He might not give her another man\u2014that was never happening\u2014but he could give her that sensation. Having her pussy and ass stuffed full.</p><p>He eased back, lifting his weight off her, withdrawing slowly through engorged, silken tissue. Then he pushed forward again, not ready to leave her tight heat. Not yet. He\u2019d tease her a bit more, get her so worked up that she\u2019d be about out of her mind.</p><p>He thrust forward, back and forth, more clinically as he sought to rein in his control. She moaned and twisted restlessly, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t fall over that edge. Not unless his fingers were on her clit. That helped him because it meant she would only orgasm when he was ready for her to.</p><p>After a few more thrusts, he looked down, enjoying the sight of his dick sliding from her pussy, wet with her juices, so snug. So fucking tight. He couldn\u2019t even imagine how much tighter she\u2019d be with that plug in her ass.</p><p>He pulled completely out and left her trembling on hands and knees on the bed while he went to retrieve one of the unopened plugs in his closet. His hands shook as he tore open the packaging. Anticipation. Desire, a razor\u2019s edge, boiling in his veins.</p><p>When he returned to the bed, Josie\u2019s hands were balled into tight fists, planted in the mattress, and she turned her head to look at him, her eyes widening when she took in the size of the plug.</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cIt\u2019s no bigger than I am, love. You\u2019ll take it and you\u2019ll take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt,\u201d she said dubiously.</p><p>\u201cPart of the pleasure is the pain,\u201d he said softly. \u201cRemember the marks on your ass from last night. I was a lot harder on you than I was that first time. But you took it and begged for more. Push aside the pain, Josie. Embrace it, because after the pain comes the pleasure. I\u2019ll give you that and a hell of a lot more.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, throwing back her head, her glossy blond hair spilling like silk over her back. He wanted to twist his hands in the strands, pull hard and fuck her even harder. But that would come. For now he had to prepare her. Ease her into the situation. Then they\u2019d both go over that edge together.</p><p>He applied a generous amount of lubricant both to the plug and to her ass, stretching her opening, sliding his fingers inside to coat her passageway. When he was certain there was enough to push the plug in with minimal effort, he tossed the lubricant aside and stepped back between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cBreathe with it, baby. I\u2019m going to go nice and slow and ease it in, but help me by breathing easy and pushing back when I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, her voice breathy with excitement.</p><p>He inserted the tip, stretching her opening the slightest bit as he began to push inward. She moaned softly and he paused, withdrawing and then pushing forward in slow fucking motions as she continued to stretch around it.</p><p>For several long seconds, he played, teasing, pushing in and out, going a bit deeper with each thrust. Then he reached around, stroking over her clit as he began to press harder and deeper.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It feels so good, Ash. Don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNot going to happen, baby.\u201d</p><p>He stroked gently over her clit, working her into a frenzy, before finally pushing the plug all the way home.</p><p>She cried out and arched her back, her legs trembling and shaking violently as breaths heaved from her chest.</p><p>\u201cShhh, darling,\u201d he crooned. \u201cIt\u2019s all the way in. Just breathe and settle. I\u2019ll give you a few seconds to come down. Don\u2019t want you coming yet.\u201d</p><p>She put her head down, resting it against the mattress, eyes closed as her body continued to shake. He wanted this to be good for her. It was all about her. No doubt he\u2019d enjoy it every bit as much as her, but this was for her. He wanted her to come screaming her pleasure. His name.</p><p>He stepped back and her head immediately came back up, turning toward him, her gaze seeking. He smiled and leaned down to kiss the small of her back, just above the curve of her buttocks.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute, baby. Want to make this good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you make it any better, I\u2019m going to die,\u201d she said with a groan.</p><p>He laughed again and then went to get the scarlet red sash at the top of his closet. He\u2019d ordered these things the minute Josie had moved into his apartment. Wanted everything he used with her to be new. Never having touched another woman.</p><p>He carried it back and then gently pulled her around so she faced him. She was up on her knees, thighs splayed to alleviate the tightness of the plug. Her face was flushed with arousal, rosy, eyes glazed.</p><p>Her eyes widened when he began to lift the sash to put over her eyes. He paused only long enough to offer her an explanation.</p><p>\u201cGoing to blindfold you. It will heighten your other senses. Want you to trust me completely to give you pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do trust you,\u201d she said in a sweet, soft voice.</p><p>He smiled his approval and then placed the sash over her eyes. He tied it tightly in back, checking to make sure it completely covered her eyes, blanketing her in darkness.</p><p>\u201cNow I want you to lie back,\u201d he directed. \u201cOn your back, legs over the edge of the bed.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, he helped her into position, taking care to position her as he wanted. She sank onto the mattress, a soft smile curving her swollen lips.</p><p>\u201cWish you could see what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking beautiful, Josie. All laid out in front of me. Blindfolded, that plug in your ass. Just waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>He knelt in front of the bed so his face and mouth were level with her open pussy. He licked over her opening and up to her clit, enjoying the shivers that cascaded through her belly.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t last long this way, Ash,\u201d she said in a strained voice.</p><p>\u201cYes you will,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cYou come when I tell you and not before.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of impatience that had him smiling. And he continued to eat her, savoring her like a delicacy, slow and sweet.</p><p>She writhed beneath him, bucking upward, each time she came back down, the plug pushing deeper inside her. She was panting, so close to her orgasm. But he knew her body well. Knew the signs of her impending release. And so he pulled back, leaving her precariously hanging off the edge.</p><p>She groaned, a sound of dismay and frustration, making him smile all over again.</p><p>\u201cWhen I say, baby. When I say, and not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t even begun yet,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cBefore I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll beg me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging now!\u201d</p><p>His smile broadened and he pushed her legs farther apart. Then he reached into the nightstand again, pulling out nipple clamps she couldn\u2019t see. He leaned over, licking one nipple and then the other, coaxing them into turgid points.</p><p>He sucked at both, setting a leisurely pace that would drive them both insane with want and need. When he had her nipples into rigid peaks, he flicked one last time with his tongue and then carefully applied the first clamp.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed when the clamp bit into her nipple. \u201cAsh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby. I won\u2019t hurt you. You know that. Just a little pain. Give you that edge. You\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>He affixed the other and then leaned back to survey his handiwork.</p><p>She was a work of art. No corny statements. She was utterly magnificent. The intricate, colorful tattoo snaked over her right side. So reflective of who she was and what she was. He could honestly say before her he\u2019d never been a fan of tattoos on women. It just wasn\u2019t something that did it for him. But from the moment he\u2019d gotten a glimpse of hers, he\u2019d been rabid with curiosity.</p><p>On her, it wasn\u2019t just a tattoo like so many others. It was her art. A reflection of herself. And it fit her to a T. He wouldn\u2019t have her any other way.</p><p>\u201cYou fascinate me, Josie. You have such a clean, wholesome, good-girl look going on. That blond hair, those gorgeous blue-green eyes. But underneath the clothes, there\u2019s that tattoo. It screams bad girl. I like it. I like it a lot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A smile curved her lips again. A dreamy smile.</p><p>\u201cGlad you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do, baby. No doubt there. I like everything about you. Everything that makes you you.\u201d</p><p>He stared a moment longer at the clamps pushing her nipples upward and then he let his hand drift down her midline, over her belly and to the wetness between her legs. Yeah, she was ready for him. No doubt there. But he didn\u2019t want to end it so soon. He would take his time. Savor her. Make it good for both of them.</p><p>He stroked his cock, holding it close to her opening as he stared down at what was his. Mine. She was his, absolutely. Never thought he\u2019d have a woman who understood him so completely in his bed. And yet here he was, staring down at a woman so beautiful that it hurt to look at her. He couldn\u2019t look at her without a heavy ache in his chest. The knowledge and recognition that she was it for him. And he\u2019d never look back. Never regret a single thing.</p><p>He pushed her knees upward, bending her legs so she was open wide to him. The base of the plug was lodged there at her ass. And he was ready to dive into that tight pussy.</p><p>Sweat beaded his forehead and his teeth clenched together as he pushed through her warm, damp folds to lodge himself at her opening. Oh hell, but she was tighter. So much tighter than before, that plug making her pussy opening that much smaller.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to be easy to get in, but it was going to feel fucking amazing.</p><p>He pushed the head farther in, eyes rolling back in his head at the exquisite feel of her tugging snugly at his dick. She moaned loudly, her hands coming off the bed and fluttering, almost as if she didn\u2019t know what to do with them.</p><p>Hell, he knew what to do about them. The idea of having her not only blindfolded, but bound, excited the visual side of him. Of being able to look down at his woman, vulnerable and helpless against his will. Oh yeah, that excited him.</p><p>He pulled back and she registered her complaint with a whimper. He caressed one leg, his imagination working overtime as he expanded on his earlier thought of tying her hands. Hell yeah. He\u2019d tie her hands and legs. Spread her impossibly wide and secure her there. All he had to do was position her at the end of the bed where he could tie her ankles to the bedposts.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute more, baby,\u201d he said, his voice rougher than he intended. \u201cGoing to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard, but didn\u2019t make a sound. Her chest rose and fell with the exertion of her breaths. He knew it excited her every bit as much as it excited him.</p><p>He retrieved the rope from his closet and then went back to the bed. He helped her up and guided her toward the end of the bed and then surveyed his possibilities.</p><p>He lifted her arms up over her head and brought them together, binding the wrists with a secure knot. Then he pulled the long end of the rope up toward the head of the bed, pulled it taut so her arms were stretched high, and secured it, testing the tautness so that it didn\u2019t put too much of a strain on her shoulders.</p><p>Satisfied that it was perfect, he returned to the end of the bed, letting his hand wander lazily down her body, appreciating and savoring the fullness of her curves, the lean lines of her narrow belly and the flare of her hips. But this time he didn\u2019t touch her intimately, a fact that frustrated her judging by the groan she emitted. He grinned again. Yeah, this was going to be perfect and he was in no hurry. He was going to savor the delectable sight of her in restraints and fuck her until they both lost their minds.</p><p>Gently, he pulled one ankle up, wrapping the rope around it before stretching it to tie it to the bedpost. Again, he tested the tautness, wanting it to be tight and spread her wide but not wanting to hurt her or cause her too much discomfort.</p><p>By the time he got to her other leg, it shook and trembled beneath his touch. Her breaths were coming more rapidly now and perspiration gleamed on her skin.</p><p>\u201cAsh?\u201d</p><p>He paused in securing the last bond to the bedpost.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget what I said about not being able to come without clitoral stimulation,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI think I\u2019m about to get there anyway!\u201d</p><p>He laughed and leaned down to kiss the inside of her calf. \u201cNuh-uh, baby. Not until I say. You\u2019re not going to leave me behind here.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed and closed her eyes, her lips tightening as she battled the desire building within her.</p><p>Then he stepped back to survey his handiwork.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he breathed. \u201cYou have no idea how turned on I am right now, Josie. I wish you could see yourself right now. Never seen a more beautiful sight than you tied to my bed, all spread out for me. I\u2019m going to feast on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ash. I\u2019m begging. Please, I need you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d promised her she\u2019d beg, but he didn\u2019t want her begging. No, he wanted to please her. To give her all the pleasure she was giving him.</p><p>His hands slid underneath her ass, lifting as much as the restraints would allow. He cupped and caressed the plump mounds as he moved in, ready to possess her.</p><p>He positioned his dick at her opening, pushing in just a bit to test the snugness. He let out a groan, one that was echoed by her when she stretched around him.</p><p>\u201cSo tight,\u201d he ground out. \u201cWant you to feel this, baby. This is what it would be like to have two cocks inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she breathed. \u201cMore, Ash. Please. Before I go crazy!\u201d</p><p>He pushed in harder, nearly dying as her body fought his intrusion. The plug had made her pussy painfully tight. But it was pain he embraced because after that edge of pain came unimaginable pleasure.</p><p>He was sweating now, rigid as he sought to maintain control. He inched forward, pushing deeper into her snug passageway.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much!\u201d she cried. \u201cOh God, Ash. I\u2019m going to come!\u201d</p><p>He stopped, gripping her legs, his fingers digging into her flesh. \u201cNot too much, baby. Never enough. Hold on for me. Go when I go.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, wincing when he saw he was only halfway in. He pulled back and then put one hand down over her mound, sliding his thumb in between her folds to her clit.</p><p>\u201cGoing to go hard, baby. I won\u2019t last and neither will you. Come with me now. Going to fuck you hard. It\u2019s going to hurt. But it\u2019s going to feel so damn good.\u201d</p><p>She moaned again, her entire body tightening around him. \u201cHurt me then, Ash. I want it. I need it. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The soft plea tore the last of his control. He pressed his thumb over her clit and then hammered forward, determined to get all the way in this time.</p><p>She cried out, her pussy convulsing around him. She went wet. Slick. So hot and velvety. He began to thrust hard and fast, and then she opened for him and he slid all the way home. But he didn\u2019t stop to savor the sensation of being completely immersed in her warmth. He was too close. She was too close. There was no stopping now.</p><p>His hips smacked against her ass, jostling her entire body. Her body swayed against the tight restraints and arched upward, bowing up off the bed.</p><p>Deeper, harder. His vision blurred. Her gasps sounded in his ears.</p><p>\u201cGet there,\u201d he growled. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Her cry splintered the room. Her wail went on and on as her body spasmed around him. His release was edgy and painful, boiling low in his balls and then exploding up his cock. He began coming in endless streams, the semen spilling from her pussy and onto the bed.</p><p>He thrust again, flicking over her clit with his thumb as she screamed again. Then he yanked himself from her pussy and grasped his pulsing cock in his hand. He pumped hard, directing the release onto her pussy and then her belly.</p><p>It jetted onto her skin, marking her. Streaming onto her flesh in thick spurts of white.</p><p>She was sobbing. His ears were roaring. And then he slid into her again, no longer able to bear being outside of her body. He went still against her, enjoying the last bursts. He closed his eyes and leaned into her, his body heaving with exertion.</p><p>Never had he been so gutted. Never had he felt more like his insides had been ripped out and laid bare. He lay there on her, his semen sticky and warm between them. Then he kissed just below her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYou undo me, Josie,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCompletely and utterly undo me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter twenty</p><p>When Josie saw the restaurant where she and Ash were meeting his friends, unease gripped her. It was a restaurant that Michael frequented with regularity. It was his favorite place to eat, a place he\u2019d taken her many times.</p><p>Shaking off her momentary hesitation, she settled into Ash\u2019s side, his arm wrapped securely around her as they walked in. If she ran into Michael, and it seemed likely she would since he ate here almost every Sunday evening, she\u2019d not act as though she was ashamed of anything. Certainly not of the fact that he\u2019d attacked her. And she certainly wasn\u2019t ashamed to be out with Ash, no matter how quickly she\u2019d fallen into a relationship after she\u2019d broken things off with Michael.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Ash murmured as they were shown to their table.</p><p>She shook her head and smiled brightly.</p><p>\u201cNot nervous are you? Relax, darling. They\u2019re going to love you.\u201d</p><p>This time her smile came more easily. \u201cI\u2019m not worried, Ash. Really.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her to his side. \u201cGood. I want you to have a good time.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at their table, situated in the far corner where they\u2019d be afforded quiet and privacy, Josie saw that his friends were already there.</p><p>She blinked when she took in the two men who rose when she and Ash got to the table. Holy hotness factor. Individually, each of the three were gorgeous. But together? They were the epitome of rich, arrogant and devastatingly handsome.</p><p>She looked right past the two females sitting, because hello, she was female and how could she even see anything beyond the three alpha men gathered?</p><p>\u201cJosie, I want you to meet my friends and business partners, Gabe Hamilton and Jace Crestwell.\u201d</p><p>The one he called Gabe stepped forward, a broad smile carving his rock-hard face. He extended his hand, and she shivered when their skin made contact.</p><p>\u201cVery happy to meet you, Josie,\u201d Gabe said in a husky voice that just screamed sexy. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you too,\u201d Josie murmured.</p><p>She turned to Jace and swallowed. The man was Ash\u2019s polar opposite. Dark and brooding where Ash was lighter and seemingly less broody, but Josie knew that appearances were deceiving. Ash\u2019s looks were in direct contrast with his true personality. He might seem laid-back and carefree, but he was utterly serious. At least with her he was.</p><p>Jace leaned in and kissed either cheek before retreating with a smile that made his dark brown eyes warm and inviting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you, Josie. Glad Ash finally let you out of his apartment long enough to mingle with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and relaxed and then turned her attention to the two women she was now insanely curious about. Anyone who managed to capture and captivate two men like Gabe and Jace had to be pretty damn special. And according to Ash, they were very much captivated. Completely and unapologetically in love.</p><p>She wanted that. Craved it. She wanted it with Ash. And if Ash\u2019s words were anything to go by, they were on their way. It still baffled her that it had happened so fast, but then he\u2019d explained that it had happened just as fast for his friends. In that context, perhaps it wasn\u2019t so unbelievable that she and Ash would become serious in such a short time.</p><p>\u201cDarling, I want you to meet two very special women, Mia and Bethany. Mia is the newlywed and I\u2019m sure if Jace has his way, Bethany won\u2019t be far behind on taking the marriage leap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Jace growled.</p><p>\u201cHello, Josie,\u201d Mia said, her smile open and friendly. She was Jace\u2019s sister according to Ash and now Josie could see the resemblance.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Josie returned. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to meet you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Josie,\u201d Bethany said, her smile no less friendly than Mia\u2019s had been, but it was obvious she was shyer and more reserved than Mia.</p><p>Remembering everything Ash had told her about Bethany, Josie studied her, taking in the fact that the young woman sitting next to where Jace had retaken his seat had come a long way and had endured a very hard life.</p><p>And there was the fact that this woman had been to bed with Ash. Ash and Jace. Josie wasn\u2019t sure whether to be jealous of the fact Bethany had had Ash\u2019s hands on her or envious over the fact that Bethany had enjoyed a threesome with two unbelievably gorgeous alpha males.</p><p>She was teetering solidly in the direction of the latter.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bethany,\u201d Josie returned warmly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you all. You\u2019re all very important to Ash. His family as he calls you. I couldn\u2019t wait to meet you all.\u201d</p><p>Ash ushered her into her chair next to Gabe and across from Bethany and Mia.</p><p>\u201cHe is family,\u201d Jace said in a firm voice. \u201cAnd we\u2019re his. Absolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful he has such loyal friends,\u201d Josie said softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo Ash says you\u2019re an artist, Josie,\u201d Jace spoke up once they\u2019d all settled into their seats. \u201cAnd that you design jewelry too.\u201d</p><p>Josie nodded, suddenly shy about having the attention focused on herself.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Ash said. \u201cHer work is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Josie turned to Ash, surprised. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen it. Or not much of it. Not yet anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Ash looked briefly uncomfortable but then smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve seen what you\u2019re working on now. It\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><p>Heat flushed into her cheeks and she knew she was blushing. What she was working on now was quite a bit more erotic than her previous works. But it was for Ash and Ash alone.</p><p>\u201cDid you design the necklace you\u2019re wearing now?\u201d Mia asked, leaning forward, her gaze riveted to Josie\u2019s collar. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>Now she was really blushing. She was convinced of it. Ash squeezed her hand underneath the table, and she controlled her awkwardness. This was important. It was what he wanted. For her not to ever be ashamed for people to know she was his.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said in a husky voice. \u201cAsh had it designed for me. It was his gift to me.\u201d</p> <p>Mia\u2019s eyes widened with understanding, and to her credit she didn\u2019t press further or try to cover the awkwardness by hastily saying more.</p><p>Josie\u2019s gaze was drawn to the choker that Bethany wore. Her hand had automatically gone to it the minute Mia had commented on Josie\u2019s. Evidently, it was a collar as well. One given to her by Jace. Did all of Ash\u2019s friends share his sexual proclivities? She could certainly see Gabe and Jace in a dominant role. It was evident in the way they looked at Mia and Bethany. Evident in their body language. How protective they were even just sitting in a public restaurant.</p><p>Maybe others wouldn\u2019t notice, but Josie did. She was in tune with that aspect because it was one she lived. It was a need in her, just like it appeared to be a need for Ash, Gabe and Jace.</p><p>She had a million questions. Nosy questions that she\u2019d love to be able to ask Mia and Bethany. But she held her tongue. She wouldn\u2019t want them prying into her relationship with Ash, and she\u2019d offer them that same consideration. But it didn\u2019t assuage the burning curiosity she had. Perhaps in time, if they became friends, she\u2019d feel more comfortable having those kinds of conversations with the other women. But still, she knew without a doubt she never wanted to get into a discussion with Bethany about the fact she\u2019d had a threesome with Ash and Jace. There was only so much envy she could handle!</p><p>Gabe and Jace were looking at her, open curiosity in their gazes. They likely were as curious about her as she was about them. But if they knew Ash, were as close as Ash had hinted, there was little doubt they knew exactly what kinds of relationships he preferred and that Josie was . . . submissive.</p><p>But if she thought they\u2019d look at her with \u201cless\u201d in their eyes, somehow looking down on her or thinking they were \u201cmore,\u201d she was wrong. There was nothing but interest. Concern for their friend, no doubt, and they were likely weighing whether they thought Josie was a good match for him.</p> <p>Ash had said that in the beginning he hadn\u2019t thought Bethany was a good idea for Jace, and in fact he\u2019d been vocal about it. Were his friends thinking the same thing about her?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be deemed unworthy. They didn\u2019t know her and she didn\u2019t want them passing judgment after only one glance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see your work sometime,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cThink we could use a little jazzing up in our office building. All we have is a bunch of boring abstract shit. Think you\u2019d be up for taking a look sometime and see what you could do to color up the walls a bit?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOf course. I\u2019d like that. But I\u2019ll warn you now. My paintings are definitely colorful. I\u2019m not into the dull, darker stuff. I like . . . vibrant colors. Themes. And I\u2019d definitely have to shift gears. What I\u2019m working on now would hardly be appropriate for a business setting.\u201d</p><p>Ash coughed, choking on a laugh.</p><p>Jace\u2019s eyebrows went up. \u201cOh? Do tell. What are you working on?\u201d</p><p>She blushed again, knowing she\u2019d stuck her foot in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you\u2019ll see what she\u2019s working on now,\u201d Ash said in an even tone. \u201cThat is for my eyes alone. But you\u2019re welcome to see whatever else she\u2019d like to show you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, now I\u2019m curious!\u201d Mia exclaimed. \u201cWhat is he talking about, Josie?\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, mortified at setting herself up this way. Her mouth had always gotten ahead of her brain, unfortunately.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, they\u2019re kind of erotic.\u201d She blushed again. \u201cSelf\u2013 portrait stuff. I mean it\u2019s not like I had anyone else to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Bethany said, her eyes twinkling with laughter. \u201cYeah, I bet Ash would go crazy if you showed them to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Ash muttered. \u201cNo one\u2019s seeing that but me.\u201d</p><p>But someone else had seen them. Or at least the first one she\u2019d taken to Mr. Downing. It had been sold with all her other paintings, and the others in that series that she\u2019d taken to the gallery after the first sale. She wondered if it bothered Ash that some unknown person out there owned those paintings of her. She wished now she hadn\u2019t sold them. Wished they could be for Ash alone.</p><p>\u201cJosie, we\u2019re planning a girls\u2019 night out this week and we\u2019d love for you to come,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>Gabe and Jace promptly groaned and Ash grinned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the groaning?\u201d Josie asked.</p><p>Ash laughed. \u201cFrom everything they\u2019ve told me, I definitely think it\u2019s a good idea for you to go. But I\u2019ll be very disappointed if you don\u2019t come home shitfaced in a sexy dress and fuck-me shoes. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve been tortured with ever since the last time they all went out. Now that I get to participate firsthand, have to say I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Josie sent them all puzzled looks.</p><p>Gabe chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s just say when our girls go out, they get drunk, have fun, but then they come home and take advantage of us poor menfolk.\u201d</p><p>Bethany snorted. \u201cLike you don\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say that, baby,\u201d Jace said, amusement thick in his voice. But his expression and his eyes said it all. They\u2019d grown positively smoldering as he looked at Bethany.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d she whispered to Ash so the others wouldn\u2019t overhear.</p><p>Ash laced his fingers with hers underneath the table but then dropped her hand and wrapped his arm around her, pulling her in close so their chairs bumped and she was nearly in his lap.</p><p>Evidently he hadn\u2019t lied when he said he\u2019d want to touch her, be close to her, and he didn\u2019t give a damn who saw it.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m okay with it,\u201d he murmured back. \u201cIf I get what Gabe and Jace get when their women go out and get drunk? Then yeah, definitely. I\u2019ll even go buy you the dress and the shoes for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cThis warrants a new dress and shoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink much, as I told you, but for this maybe I\u2019ll have to make an exception.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed as he stared back at her. \u201cMake an exception. I\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>They chatted about casual topics. Gabe and Mia\u2019s honeymoon dominated most of the conversation as Mia recounted their trip to Paris. After their meals were served and they\u2019d eaten, the dessert menus were passed around and Josie excused herself to go to the restroom.</p><p>Mia and Bethany got up to accompany her and the three women headed toward the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>Josie finished first and waited outside. She heard a door open and turned to see if it was them, but her mouth fell open when she saw Michael walk out of the men\u2019s room that was just across from the ladies\u2019 room.</p><p>He looked like hell!</p><p>Their gazes met and held a brief moment before his flickered and he looked hastily away.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat on earth happened to you?\u201d</p><p>She could swear fear flickered in his eyes. He couldn\u2019t leave quick enough and Josie was too stunned to do more than stare after him as he hurried away.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a spot on his face that hadn\u2019t been bruised. And it was ugly. Lip split, swollen eye.</p><p>\u201cJosie?\u201d</p><p>Josie whirled to see Mia and Bethany standing there, looks of concern on their faces.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that man?\u201d Mia asked. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew him, yes,\u201d Josie murmured. \u201cAnd everything is fine. Let\u2019s go back for dessert. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s there by now.\u201d</p><p>The entire way back to the table, Josie\u2019s mind was a whirlwind of what the hell. She hadn\u2019t imagined Michael\u2019s face or the fact that he\u2019d damn near broken his neck getting away from her. And she hadn\u2019t imagined the fear in his eyes. Why would he be afraid of her?</p><p>Ash\u2019s gaze was sharp when she sat down. He didn\u2019t miss a thing and his eyes narrowed as he looked at her and then over to Bethany and Mia as if he thought they\u2019d done something to upset her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re pale. Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>Without another word, Ash stood and reached for her hand. She followed openmouthed behind him as he dragged her out onto the patio to stand in front of the fountain. He pulled her to him, cupped a hand to her cheek and stared intently into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cDid Mia or Bethany say anything to upset you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her thoughts still jumbled. She couldn\u2019t keep the one prevailing thought out of her mind, even though it was ludicrous. Wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cI saw Michael,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>Ash\u2019s face darkened with fury, his eyes sparking. \u201cWhat? Did he say anything to you? Did that bastard follow you here? Why the hell didn\u2019t you immediately come to me, Josie?\u201d</p><p>She held her hand up to halt the flow of questions. \u201cThis is his favorite place to eat. He and I ate here often. And he\u2019s always here on Sundays. I would have been more surprised if I hadn\u2019t seen him.\u201d</p><p>Ash swore. \u201cYou should have told me, Josie. We would have eaten somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and glanced up at Ash. \u201cHe looked terrible, Ash. He looked like someone beat the holy hell out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he? Couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer guy. Maybe now he won\u2019t raise his hand to another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something, Ash. Did you have anything to do with him getting the crap kicked out of him?\u201d</p><p>It was a plunge. A reckless question spurred by the fear that had swamped her the minute she\u2019d seen Michael. She remembered Ash\u2019s resoluteness that he\u2019d take care of it. That she didn\u2019t have to worry about Michael anymore. She\u2019d thought they were just words to comfort her. Spoken in the heat of the moment. Everyone had moments like that. It didn\u2019t mean they followed through on them!</p><p>His eyes flickered and he stared evenly back at her, his lips tight.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you, Josie. So be careful what you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou did. Oh my God, Ash. What did you do? How could you? And why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to ask me why?\u201d he bit out. \u201cWhat the fuck, Josie. He hurt you. That son of a bitch had you on the floor. And you don\u2019t think that\u2019s reason enough to make sure he never does anything like that again?\u201d</p><p>The blood drained from her face. She wavered, unsteady on her feet. Ash cursed again and then reached for her, pulling her against him once again. He stroked his hand over her cheek, pushing back her hair.</p><p>\u201cYou put yourself in my care, Josie. That\u2019s not something I take lightly. And when you gave that to me, when you submitted to me, it also gave me the right to take care of any threat to you. You need to deal with that. Accept it. Because it\u2019s not going away. I will not hesitate to do it again if you\u2019re ever threatened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Ash. You can\u2019t do stuff like that. What if he reported it? You\u2019d get arrested. For God\u2019s sake, you could go to jail!\u201d</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cNot going to happen, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked desperately.</p><p>\u201cI took care of it. That\u2019s all you need to know. This doesn\u2019t touch you, baby. Wish to fuck you\u2019d told me we had a good chance of running into him here. I would have never stayed. I want you to forget about it and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to forget seeing him that way? Now I\u2019m not going to be able to sleep for worrying that the police will come and arrest you. Ash, this could fuck up the rest of your life! It\u2019s not worth that. Nothing is worth the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d he ground out. \u201cMe making sure that son of a bitch never comes near you again is worth everything. I\u2019m not going to argue with you over this, Josie. This was my call. We do it my way. You knew that going in. Rules don\u2019t change because you decide you don\u2019t like something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you said . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say, baby?\u201d</p><p>She huffed in a breath, expelling it long over her lips. \u201cYou said it wasn\u2019t like that. That I have a choice. That you wouldn\u2019t do something I didn\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>He sighed patiently, his gaze boring into her face. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s done. You don\u2019t get a choice because the choice has already been made. And I\u2019m not going to apologize for not discussing it with you beforehand. It was my choice to make. You belong to me. Told you from the start that I take that very seriously. That means I protect you. I do whatever it takes to make sure you\u2019re safe and well cared for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould I have ever known if I hadn\u2019t run into him?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Ash immediately shook his head. Unapologetic. Gaze steady. Unwavering.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not something I\u2019d ever want you to know or even think about. I\u2019m pissed because you had to see him at all.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and shook her head, trying to shake off the buzzing in her ears. This was crazy, wasn\u2019t it? Ash had taken a huge risk. For her. Not one she\u2019d have wanted him to take. No way in hell. How could he be so certain nothing would fall back on him? The only thing he seemed annoyed about at all was that she\u2019d run into Michael. It was obvious that Ash never had any intention of her knowing anything about it. And she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that.</p><p>The saying went that ignorance was bliss, and she supposed in this case it was. She wished she didn\u2019t know. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t feel so unsettled. And so uncertain of the man she\u2019d committed to in a huge way.</p> <p>\u201cJosie, you\u2019re overthinking this,\u201d Ash chided softly. \u201cThis is why I would have never had you know about this. No good can come of you worrying or stressing over this. And if this brings us into question for you, then I can only tell you that I\u2019ve been honest with you. I\u2019ve been straightforward. Never tried to hide the kind of man I am from you. And I told you from the start that we do things my way. You\u2019re mine to protect. To care for. I can guarantee you that nothing like this will ever touch you. Don\u2019t want you thinking about it. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath as Ash watched her intently, waiting for her response. This was huge. He was basically asking her if she could get over it and move on. That she not freak out about this. That she trust him. Those were big things to ask. She\u2019d assumed he was a businessman. A wealthy, powerful businessman. She\u2019d never imagined for one minute that he was immersed in gray, murky areas or that he would even be capable of meting out violence to someone who\u2019d hurt something he considered his own.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t surprise her, and maybe that was what she grappled with. The idea that maybe it hadn\u2019t been as shocking to her as it should have been. It would explain why she was trying to muster up outrage. Or all the appropriate responses. Because she wasn\u2019t feeling them and she thought she should be.</p><p>\u201cJosie?\u201d Ash questioned quietly. \u201cI need an answer from you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI can do that for you, Ash.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her in his arms and pressed his lips to her forehead. She closed her eyes, melting into his embrace.</p> <p>\u201cIt scares me, Ash. Not for the reasons you might think, and maybe I feel guilty over that. But what scares me isn\u2019t that you\u2019re this person who went out and beat the crap out of someone. I don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re capable of hurting me that way. But what scares me is the thought of losing you. Of you going to jail because you were protecting me. I don\u2019t want that. I never want that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and lowered his mouth, kissing her lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, darling. I\u2019ve got it covered. I didn\u2019t just go out on a whim and kick his ass. And I don\u2019t say this to freak you out, but I don\u2019t want you to worry about it anymore. After tonight, we don\u2019t talk about it. We don\u2019t bring it up. But I carried out a well-thought-out plan. I have an alibi and Michael was warned of the consequences of him ever coming near you and also of him going to the police. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have an issue with either. I made my point pretty clear.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead to his chest, the top of her head brushing the underside of his chin.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI won\u2019t worry and we won\u2019t talk about it again.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her to him. \u201cThank you, baby. For trusting me. I won\u2019t let you down. Now let\u2019s go back inside and finish dessert. You have a girls\u2019 night out to plan and you and I have a dress and shoes to buy for you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter twenty-one</p><p>Josie walked ahead of Ash when the elevator opened into his apartment. The ride home had been quiet. They\u2019d eaten dessert, conversed casually with Ash\u2019s friends and then Ash had made their excuses and he and Josie had left. She knew Ash watched her, was gauging her mood and her reaction to the issue with Michael.</p> <p>What could she say? That she felt more shamed by the fact she wasn\u2019t outraged over what Ash had done than she was with the fact he\u2019d exacted revenge on the man who\u2019d hurt her?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about the type of human being that made her. Or perhaps it just made her human. She hated Michael for what he\u2019d done. Hated the fact that he\u2019d made her doubt herself. That she\u2019d been too shocked, ashamed and afraid to file charges against him. She also hated the fact that if she\u2019d done what she should have, Ash would have never had to have involved himself in the mess. She could hardly blame him when her own inactivity contributed.</p><p>\u201cLot on your mind, baby,\u201d Ash observed as they stopped in the living room.</p><p>She turned to him, attempting a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m good, Ash. Really. I don\u2019t want you to worry that I\u2019m upset with you. Or angry. I\u2019m mad at myself, but not you.\u201d</p><p>His brow lifted and his gaze sharpened. \u201cWhy the hell are you angry with yourself?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, and then he wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her toward the couch. He sat and tugged her down onto his lap, a position she was becoming all too accustomed to.</p><p>She loved that he wanted no distance between them. Loved that he felt the need to touch her often. That he wanted her close whenever they discussed an issue. She drew great comfort from that fact.</p><p>It was pretty damn hard to fear anything when she was surrounded by Ash. She knew, just as he\u2019d done with Michael, that he\u2019d protect her from anything that could possibly hurt her.</p><p>\u201cJosie,\u201d he prompted. \u201cWaiting, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d had the guts to do what I was supposed to do, you would have never had to risk yourself the way you did by going after Michael,\u201d she said with an unhappy frown.</p><p>He put his fingers to her lips, his gaze fierce. He looked . . . pissed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI would have still kicked his fucking ass. And in a lot of ways, my method of dealing with him is far more effective than if you\u2019d had him arrested. He probably would have gotten out with a slap on the wrist, if that. And if you\u2019d wanted to pursue anything further, it would have been hell on you. And there\u2019s no telling the lengths he would have gone to in order to discourage you from seeking punishment for him. This way\u2014my way\u2014he\u2019s scared shitless, and furthermore, he now knows what it feels like for someone to beat the shit out of him. I don\u2019t anticipate him ever being a problem for you again. Did he say anything to you when you saw him today? You never said.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. He looked . . . scared.\u201d</p><p>Triumph gleamed in Ash\u2019s eyes. \u201cGood,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cSo he said nothing? Did he look at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran into him, or rather he nearly ran into me when I was waiting outside the ladies\u2019 restroom for Mia and Bethany. He came out of the men\u2019s restroom and I gasped when I saw him. He looked . . . horrible!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ash muttered again.</p><p>\u201cI asked him what happened but he never said a word. He acted like he couldn\u2019t get away from me fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Ash smirked. \u201cGuess my message got through then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess it did,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He stroked his hand through her hair and then pressed a kiss to her temple. \u201cIt still bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI think it bothers me more because it doesn\u2019t bother me. I know that makes no sense, but I feel guilty. I feel like a horrible person for not being appalled over what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, leaving his lips pressed against her head. \u201cYou not feeling guilty over that scumbag getting what he deserves doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. He\u2019s an asshole, Josie. Think about the fact that not only will he not hurt you again, but he won\u2019t hurt any other woman. Having him arrested doesn\u2019t guarantee that. Me kicking his ass and threatening to ruin him if he ever so much as touches another woman wrong does.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll get over it. He did deserve it. I almost wish I\u2019d been there so I could hit him in the nuts just once.\u201d</p><p>Ash chuckled. \u201cI got in plenty for you, baby. Don\u2019t ever want you involved in that kind of shit. Want you to shine. Not be dragged in the shadows with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSticking up for me doesn\u2019t mean you live in shadows, Ash. It means a lot that you\u2019d risk so much. For me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet on that,\u201d he said in a low, serious tone. \u201cDon\u2019t ever question it. Whatever you need, whatever you want, is yours. Never have to ask.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up to kiss him. \u201cIn that case, make love to me, Ash. That\u2019s what I really need and what I really want right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, you definitely never have to ask for,\u201d he growled against her mouth.</p><p>He shifted upward, leaned her forward before rising and lifting her into his arms. He carried her to the bedroom and gently, reverently laid her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know what you have in mind tonight, baby, but what I want to give you is the sweet. You\u2019ve had the pain. Don\u2019t want you thinking about pain tonight, not when you just saw the bastard who inflicted it on you. So tonight, I\u2019m going to give you the sweet. Going to make love to you so you not only know how I feel about you, but you\u2019ll feel it too.\u201d</p><p>God, but she loved this man, and it grew increasingly harder not to let those words slip out. How easy it would be to tell him, but she wanted it at the right moment. Right now she wasn\u2019t sure what the right moment would be. But she didn\u2019t want him to think they were just words said in the heat of the moment. She wanted him to know with absolute certainty that she meant them and that they came from her heart.</p><p>He leaned down, fusing his mouth hotly to hers. Their tongues met and slid sensuously over one another. Rough then soft. Hot, damp, electric.</p><p>He wanted to show her, but she also wanted to show him. Wanted to make love to him. Let him feel what he meant to her.</p><p>She braced her palms on his shoulders and then slid them up to the column of his neck. She pulled him lower, meeting his tongue with hers, tangling them breathlessly. She tasted him. Wanted more.</p><p>Her fingers trailed down his shirt, tugging impatiently. \u201cI want you naked,\u201d she complained.</p><p>He chuckled, the sound vibrating over her mouth. \u201cI want you naked too. What do you say we both do something about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRace you,\u201d she challenged, a broad grin attacking her lips.</p><p>\u201cOh hell no,\u201d he said with a laugh when she rolled, tearing at her clothing. \u201cCheating little wench.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, yanking at her clothing while Ash ripped at his. She kicked the clothing away and stood by the bed, palms upturned as she smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d she taunted when he kicked away his pants.</p><p>He yanked her to him, hauling her into his arms. She landed with a thump against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIf you think that took a long time, wait to see how long it takes me to get you off,\u201d he said in a silky voice.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t,\u201d she breathed out.</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cWouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t into punishments,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWho said it would be a punishment? I can\u2019t think of anything more pleasurable than taking my sweet time teasing and taunting you, making you hold off until you\u2019re screaming my name when you come.\u201d</p><p>She moaned and leaned into his chest. \u201cStop. You\u2019re torturing me, Ash. No matter what you call it, that is most definitely punishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, what do you say we do a little role reversal?\u201d</p><p>Intrigued, she glanced up at him, cocking her head to the side.</p><p>\u201cYou on top. You calling the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm, I\u2019m liking this idea. Definitely has merit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get to it, baby. Take your man to bed and ride him.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up to kiss him, palming his face in her hands as she held him for the lusty, hot kiss.</p><p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d he returned, mimicking her sound of pleasure. \u201cMy beautiful little submissive likes the idea of being in charge for a night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She loved those words from his lips. His beautiful little submissive. The way he said it. So much tenderness and affection in his voice. And she knew what he was doing. She loved him even more for it. He was wiping away the thoughts of Michael. Of her relationship with him. The fact that he never gave back anything he took.</p><p>Tonight Ash was offering her the most precious gift she could receive. Himself. His trust. Him relinquishing control to her.</p><p>This was not a man who ever handed over control or dominance. And she didn\u2019t delude herself. She was in charge but he would effectively be topping from the bottom. Because she knew he would still be in control. He would just be controlling her being in control.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cFlat on your back, head on the pillow. I want you to be comfortable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby, I have to say, you on top of me with me deep inside you? Doesn\u2019t matter where I am. I\u2019ll be comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and caressed his jaw before turning him toward the bed.</p><p>Who was she kidding? She had no idea how to do this. Didn\u2019t even have a strong desire to be the one in control. But it was what he wanted and what he wanted to give to her, so she\u2019d do it without reservation.</p><p>He did her bidding, stretching his long frame over the bed. His cock jutted upward, reaching for his navel as he lay on his back. It was straining, utterly rigid, the head dark plum and liquid already seeping from the slit.</p><p>She crawled onto the bed between his legs and slowly made her way up his body on her hands and knees. She dipped her head and licked over his sac, rolling the balls with her mouth.</p> <p>He moaned softly and twisted, adjusting his position so she had better access. She tongued the sac, sucking it lightly into her mouth before nibbling her way up to the base of his cock. Then she swiped her tongue up the underside, tracing the thick vein all the way to the head.</p><p>When she got to the top, she hesitated a brief moment, circling the tip with her tongue. Then she sucked him deep in one swift motion. His hips shot off the bed, arching up, pushing him farther into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, Josie. Feels so good, baby. That mouth of yours is pure sin.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cGlad you approve.\u201d</p><p>His hand tangled in her hair, holding her down to meet his thrust. Yes, he\u2019d relinquished control to her, but he was still very much in command of the situation.</p><p>For several long moments she sucked and licked, enjoying the way he twitched and quivered beneath her. Then he pulled her head away, his hand still wrapped tightly in her hair.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, if you\u2019re going to get on, you need to do it now. I\u2019m close, and I won\u2019t last much longer. Want you with me when I go.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, freeing her hair from his grasp. Then she swung one leg over his, straddling him. She inched forward until his erection was nestled at the juncture of her thighs.</p><p>Leaning forward, she planted both palms on his chest and levered herself up.</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPut it in me, Ash.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glittered brightly as he reached down to fist his cock. He stroked through her folds with his other hand, fingering her clit as he positioned himself. When he nudged the head of his dick against her opening, she lowered herself, capturing his erection.</p><p>He pulled his hands free and then curled his fingers around her hips, anchoring her to him as she slid farther down to fully envelop him.</p><p>With a contented sigh, she took him all the way in. The sensation of fullness was overwhelming. Even more so than when he\u2019d fucked her with the plug in her ass. She felt unbelievably small and tight and he felt enormous stuffed into her pussy.</p><p>Every movement sent a twinge of unbelievable pleasure winging through her abdomen. She lifted up, moaning when he began to slide back the way he\u2019d come.</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ash ground out. \u201cSo tight. You\u2019re clamped around me like a greedy fist, baby. Never felt anything like it.\u201d</p><p>She put more weight on her hands and pressed harder into his chest. He didn\u2019t seem to mind one bit. She watched his eyes, the way they swarmed with desire, pleasure, how they blanked and the pupils flared each time she took him whole.</p><p>His jaw was firm, as if his teeth were set hard. There were lines of tension around his eyes and across his forehead. A light sheen of perspiration glistened on his brow. He was the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever laid eyes on. And he was all hers.</p><p>\u201cTake me over, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me what you need to get there and let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy breasts and my clit.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, those gorgeous eyes sparking fire. He cupped one breast and then slid his other hand between their bodies to stroke her intimately. She closed her eyes, threw back her head and waited a moment to let herself catch up to where he was.</p><p>When the stirrings of her orgasm rose, sharp and edgy, she began to move again. She rose up and then slid down. She rotated, grinding her ass into his groin. Ash\u2019s hands never left her. He continued to caress her breasts, alternating between them. He stroked over her clit, firmly, with just enough pressure, but still infinitely gentle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost there,\u201d she panted out. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he bit out. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, baby. Whatever you do, don\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>She went wild atop him. Head thrown back, hair streaming down her back, her mouth open in a silent scream that eventually found its voice. His hands were seemingly everywhere. His cock driving deep.</p><p>Her orgasm rose higher and higher, out of control, spiraling like a skydive. And still, the pressure mounted, no relief.</p><p>Ash arched his hips, slamming into her from underneath. She went wet around him and then realized he was already coming, his release flooding her. Wet sucking sounds filled her ears, erotic. The scent of sex, tangy and musky, filtered through her nose.</p><p>He pinched her nipple between his thumb and forefinger. Just enough of an edge to the pleasure to finally, finally send her hurtling over the edge. It was a free fall like she\u2019d never experienced. Powerful. Explosive. Painful and yet so oh-my-God good that all she could do was feel.</p><p>She dug her nails into his chest, knowing she tore his skin. He\u2019d wear the marks for days, just like she wore his marks of possession. In a savage moment, she was thrilled by them. The idea that he was hers. That this was proof of her possession of him. By God, she may have chosen to submit to him, but he was every bit as much hers as she was his.</p><p>She collapsed forward, her arms no longer able to support her. Ash gathered her tightly against him, holding her as he whispered in her ear. She had no idea what he said. Couldn\u2019t hear it over the roaring in both ears. Her blood pounded. Her body was tingling from head to toe. She felt like she\u2019d just been hit by lightning and all her nerve endings were fried.</p><p>Then she became aware of another pulse. The comforting, reassuring feel of Ash\u2019s heartbeat beneath her cheek. She sighed, snuggled deeper into his arms, and he squeezed her tighter, holding on as they both struggled for breath.</p><p>\u201cAm I smothering you?\u201d she asked weakly.</p><p>\u201cNo, darling. Don\u2019t want you to move. Just stay right here with me. Just like this. I\u2019m going to stay inside you for as long as I can. We\u2019ll clean up in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as he stroked her hair with his hand. Nothing felt as good as right here, right now, sprawled atop her man after she\u2019d ridden him long and hard. And him staying inside her for as long as he could manage it? Definitely a good way to sleep. What could be better?</p><p>Nothing could touch her here. No outside world. No crazy families. No abusive ex-lovers. No fears of Ash being arrested for meting out justice to the man who hurt her.</p><p>Just her and Ash.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>The words remained locked inside her. But she knew without a doubt that soon they\u2019d find their way to the surface. Who cared if it was too soon? When the time was right, she\u2019d tell him.</p><p>Chapter twenty-two</p><p>The next day, Ash sent his driver to pick up Josie from their apartment. She was having lunch with him and Brittany at the Bentley Hotel where Brittany now worked. After meeting his friends the night before, she wasn\u2019t as nervous about meeting Brittany, although she had to admit to being really curious about the other woman.</p><p>Ash had told her that until recently Brittany had played the dutiful bitch daughter, siding with his family in their scorn and revilement of him. But that she\u2019d come to him in tears because she wanted out.</p><p>It took someone strong to stand up to the kind of family\u2014and mother\u2014Ash described. Especially after thirty years. And a marriage that her mother had pushed her into.</p><p>Ash was waiting outside when the car arrived, and he opened the door, extending his hand to help Josie out. He slipped an arm around her waist, keeping her snug against his side as they walked into the restaurant.</p><p>They were directed to the same table where she and Ash had eaten that first night, and there was a woman already seated. Josie soaked in the details from a distance so she wouldn\u2019t be staring once they got to the table.</p><p>She could definitely see the family resemblance. Brittany had the same blond hair with a variety of shades just like Ash. She also had the same green eyes Ash sported and the shape of their faces was very similar.</p><p>When they got close, Brittany looked up and a wide, welcoming smile curved her lips. Josie could swear she saw relief in the other woman\u2019s expression. Perhaps she\u2019d been worried that Ash wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>And when she smiled, Josie could see just how stunningly beautiful Brittany was. But then, Ash was a beautiful man. Brittany was more his feminine counterpart. She didn\u2019t have the hard edges that Ash had. She lacked Ash\u2019s intense gaze, his expression, the way he carried himself.</p><p>No matter how crazy or horrible his parents were, they definitely gave their children the beautiful genes.</p><p>Brittany rose but stood still, as if waiting to see how Ash would greet her. Ash circled the table and enveloped his sister in a big hug. He kissed her cheek and then took her hand, squeezing it. Brittany\u2019s reaction was sweet. She stared up at Ash, just like most sisters stared up at their big brothers when they\u2019d done something huge and nice for their baby sisters. She looked at him like he hung the moon.</p><p>\u201cBritt, I want you to meet Josie. Josie, this is my sister, Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Josie,\u201d Brittany said in a cultured voice that just screamed money and privilege.</p><p>But there was no pretension about her. She grasped Josie\u2019s hand warmly and then, to Josie\u2019s surprise, Brittany hugged her and kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cHello, Brittany. I\u2019m so happy to finally meet you. Ash has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>At that, her excitement dimmed, and her eyes grew cloudy with worry.</p><p>\u201cIt was all good,\u201d Josie hastened to say, regretting that she\u2019d already put her foot in her mouth. \u201cHe said you were doing wonderfully in your job here. He bragged that you would end up running the entire thing before it was over with.\u201d</p><p>Brittany smiled and relaxed. Ash guided both women to their seats and then motioned for the waiter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d Brittany said, once the waiter took their drink order. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be . . . useful. I\u2019m remembering how smart I am. It just took a while because unfortunately I\u2019ve become very adept at being dumb over the years.\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head. \u201cCut yourself some slack, Britt. You\u2019ll get there. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\u201d</p><p>Josie laughed at the old saying. \u201cHe\u2019s right, though. I\u2019ve made my share of really dumb mistakes. But I\u2019m through beating myself up over them.\u201d</p><p>Ash squeezed her hand under the table but then surprised her by dragging it up and over the table where he pulled it to his mouth and pressed a kiss into her palm.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear that, baby. About time.\u201d</p><p>Brittany looked inquisitively between Ash and Josie and then her eyes widened before a broad smile lit up her entire face.</p><p>Josie guessed it was pretty obvious that she and Ash were more than just a casual date. But then Ash had made it pretty clear that Josie was someone important to him. Why else would he bring her to lunch with his sister?</p><p>\u201cMom giving you any more trouble, Britt?\u201d Ash asked.</p><p>Brittany made a face and then took a long swallow of the wine the waiter had served. \u201cShe came by that one time I told you about. After that she resorted to calling every day. I ignore the calls and let them go to voice mail. She called work one time, and I told her off. I haven\u2019t heard from her since.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded approvingly. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You\u2019ll get there. Eventually she\u2019ll figure out that she can\u2019t get her claws into you anymore and she\u2019ll find another target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike she did with you?\u201d Brittany pointed out, a snort passing her lips.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe she won\u2019t,\u201d Ash said ruefully. \u201cBut you\u2019ll figure out how to handle her and after a while it won\u2019t bother you as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI envy you,\u201d Brittany said. \u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before, but I\u2019d give anything to have your confidence.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wistful tone in her voice made Josie wince with sympathy. But she sat quietly, not wanting to interrupt their conversation.</p><p>The waiter came and took their orders, and Ash leaned back, reaching for Josie. She slid into his side, their chairs mashed up against each other. His arm settled around her shoulders as he continued his conversation with Brittany.</p><p>\u201cSo how long have you two been dating?\u201d Brittany asked.</p><p>Josie went still, her mouth suddenly unable to work. What could she say? They didn\u2019t date. One could hardly call what they\u2019d done dating. They\u2019d bypassed that stage all together. And somehow, the word dating seemed so tame. Not at all indicative of the intensity of their relationship.</p> <p>\u201cJosie and I have been together a while now,\u201d Ash said easily.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s good. You look so good together. Tell me more about you, Josie. What do you do?\u201d</p><p>Apparently Ash hadn\u2019t spoken of Josie to Brittany. Josie licked her lips, suddenly feeling self-conscious in front of his sister. No matter that Ash had clearly outlined the difficulties Brittany had experienced, the woman still came from money. From a world Josie didn\u2019t fit into. She\u2019d had a wealthy husband, rich parents. Hell, her brother Ash had more money than God.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an artist,\u201d Josie said in a husky voice. \u201cI also design jewelry. But mostly I paint.\u201d</p><p>Brittany\u2019s eyes widened and Josie wasn\u2019t sure if it was surprise, judgment or what. Her nape prickled and she immediately felt defensive.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to see your work sometime,\u201d Brittany said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that can be arranged at some point,\u201d Ash said. \u201cRight now she\u2019s busy working on something for me and she has a client who buys up all her work so she\u2019s pretty focused on that at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound so successful!\u201d Brittany gushed.</p><p>Josie ducked her head. \u201cWell, yes, I suppose you could say that. It\u2019s a rather new development, though, so I still have a hard time thinking of myself that way. Someone came into the gallery where I exhibit and bought up all my stuff and demanded more. I have no idea what they\u2019re doing with it. I haven\u2019t heard anything about them doing a private exhibit. Perhaps it\u2019s for a private collection that will never be shown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still, you must be thrilled. I\u2019d love to be that independent,\u201d Brittany said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cI am thrilled,\u201d Josie said. \u201cIt means a lot for me to be able to stand on my own two feet and support myself.\u201d</p> <p>Brittany nodded, understanding bright in her eyes.</p><p>Ash had gone still beside her, his lips drawn into a firm line. Had she said or done something that displeased him? Surely he couldn\u2019t fault her for liking being able to support herself. It in no way interfered with her relationship with him. But it gave her the confidence to remain with him, submissive, because she knew she didn\u2019t have to. Didn\u2019t have to rely on him to support her. And that was important. It gave her much more power to choose to be with him rather than having no other option.</p><p>Their food came, breaking the current topic of conversation. For several moments, they ate, silence descending on the table.</p><p>Brittany looked up, her mouth open as she was evidently going to say something. But then her eyes flashed and her mouth snapped shut.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Ash frowned and started to turn around to see what Brittany was looking at, but before he could, a woman strode into view, standing between Ash and Brittany at the table.</p><p>Without needing to be told, Josie guessed that this had to be their mother. It was also obvious that she was who both siblings got their looks from. She had long, blond hair that was probably helped by a bottle to cover the gray because Josie couldn\u2019t detect any sign of her age. At least not by looking at the healthy, glossy mane of hair.</p><p>For that matter, there wasn\u2019t a single wrinkle marring the other woman\u2019s face. No indication of her age. Her skin was smooth and free of blemishes. Her fingernails were immaculately manicured and expensive jewelry dripped from her wrists and fingers.</p> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ash muttered.</p><p>His mother sent him a look that would have fried a lesser man.</p><p>\u201cWatch your language,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be vulgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? In my hotel,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>The emphasis on it being his hotel wasn\u2019t lost on Josie or his mother.</p><p>Her eyes flashed with anger as she glared at Ash. Then her gaze turned to Brittany. Josie was just glad that so far the woman was ignoring her.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to stop this silly game?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Color suffused Brittany\u2019s cheeks. No matter what the younger woman had said about handling her mother before, it was evident that she was still no match for her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d she said, rounding on Ash. She pointed her finger in an accusing manner toward Ash. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing and it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was like ice and the coldness of it made Josie shiver. These were her children and yet she treated them like they were people she hated.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, pray tell, is it that I\u2019m doing?\u201d Ash drawled.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t moved his arm from Josie and in fact he\u2019d tightened his hold around her shoulders. She could feel his fingers digging into her arm, but she made no move to get him to loosen it. She doubted he even realized how painful his hold was. It was her only indication of how his mother\u2019s impromptu visit was affecting him.</p><p>No matter what he might say about his mother, it still hurt him that she was so . . . bitchy.</p><p>His mother\u2019s eyes narrowed, fury spitting from the green eyes she shared with her children.</p><p>\u201cUsing Brittany to get back at me for some imagined slight. Really, Ash. Putting her to work in your hotel? How vulgar and common is that? Do you get a good laugh out of watching her work? Does it make you happy to know how it makes me feel?\u201d</p><p>Ash sat forward like a shot, his face dark, anger gleaming in his eyes. Brittany cast a worried look in Josie\u2019s direction, but at least it didn\u2019t reflect hurt. She hadn\u2019t believed her mother\u2019s accusation. Josie gave her a look of support and sympathy, letting her know that she didn\u2019t believe it any more than Brittany did.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck how it makes you feel,\u201d Ash gritted out. \u201cAll I care about is how Brittany feels. But don\u2019t take my word for it, Mother dear. Ask her yourself. Ask her if she feels like I\u2019m making a fool of her by giving her a real job where she gets paid a real salary for doing real work.\u201d</p><p>His mother never turned to look at Brittany. But Brittany spoke up, her tone even and unaffected.</p><p>\u201cI asked him for a job. He gave me what I asked for. Now please go, Mother. You\u2019re making a spectacle of yourself and that\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve always hated.\u201d</p><p>Fury sparked in the older woman\u2019s eyes. Josie was surprised that steam didn\u2019t rise from her ears. And then her gaze settled on Josie, almost as if she was looking for a new victim. Josie fidgeted uncomfortably underneath her gaze but refused to react. She kept her expression serene and unbothered.</p><p>\u201cIs this your latest whore, Ash? How dare you take my daughter to lunch with you and your latest piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>Brittany gasped, her face turning red. Horror reflected in her eyes as she stared at Ash.</p><p>Ash stood, the clatter loud as he pushed back his chair. Then he motioned for security who were already hovering on the fringes.</p><p>\u201cEscort this woman out,\u201d he said in a frigid tone. \u201cFurthermore, she is never to be allowed back on the premises of any of my properties. You photograph her and distribute it along with her name. The person who allows her back will be terminated immediately.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s face went white with shock. And then color invaded as embarrassment took over. She glanced right and then left, dismayed when she saw a security person on either side.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Ash said, enunciating each word. \u201cStay away from Brittany and stay away from me. And stay the fuck away from Josie. She will be my wife and the mother of my children. I\u2019ll not allow any disrespect to be shown to her. Ever. Now get the fuck out of my sight. And tell dear old dad and the old man that Brittany and I are out. We have no desire to be a part of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh, wait,\u201d his mother begged. \u201cI need to talk to you. Please. I let my temper get the best of me, but I came here today to speak to you. I didn\u2019t even know Brittany would be here. I was just caught off guard. But there\u2019s something I need to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a fuck,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cI have no interest in anything you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Josie sat there, stunned by what Ash had said. His wife? Mother of his children? Holy shit but that was deep! They\u2019d only known each other a very short time. He\u2019d said nothing to her about marriage and babies. Not that she had anything against either, but shouldn\u2019t he have at least mentioned it to her before he blabbed it in a public restaurant?</p><p>His mother licked her lips as the security closed in. \u201cI need to speak to you, Ash. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s about your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t manipulating me like you manipulate everyone else in your life. I have no interest in you or the old man. Look around, Mother. I don\u2019t need you. I don\u2019t need him. I\u2019ve made a success of myself without any of you. And perhaps that\u2019s the biggest reason you despise me so much.\u201d</p><p>She went white, but anger glittered in her eyes. Josie\u2019s heart ached for Ash. It didn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d hardened himself to his family. This was his mother! Everyone needed a mother. She could only imagine how it made him feel to know his own mother despised him.</p><p>She reached up, not knowing if it was what she should do, but she curled her fingers around Ash\u2019s hand and then rose to stand beside him. Only he shifted so she wasn\u2019t exactly beside him but more behind him, nestled into his side. He was protecting her even now from his mother\u2019s judgment and vitriol. Josie just wanted him to know that she was here. Beside him. Always. He might be protective of her, but she sure as hell would protect him from whatever she could.</p><p>\u201cEscort her out,\u201d Ash said to the two security officers.</p><p>\u201cI know my own way out,\u201d she huffed, shrugging off the hand of one of the guards.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt of that. But then letting you walk out on your own would deprive me of the pleasure of having you thrown out,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>He nodded toward the two security guards and they grasped his mother by the arms, one on either side, and began to lead her away.</p><p>Her shrieks of indignation filled the air. Josie flinched because every eye in the restaurant was on them. She\u2019d even seen a few camera flashes. She had no doubt today\u2019s incident would be all over the tabloids. Ash was one of the wealthiest men in the city. He came from money, from people with connections in society. His grandfather was a well-known figure in politics. No doubt the papers would be tripping over themselves to report the estrangement between Ash and his mother.</p><p>What if Michael saw it? Would he try to cause trouble for Ash once he realized who Ash was?</p><p>More camera flashes, this time much closer. Josie flinched away, covering her face with a hand. Ash pulled her farther behind him and then flicked his hand toward the people taking pictures. In a moment\u2019s time, more security rushed forward, effectively shutting down the impromptu photo session.</p><p>Josie sagged into her chair. Brittany looked shell-shocked. She was pale and looked mortified as she sagged against the back of her chair. Josie\u2019s heart went out to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a girls\u2019 night out Wednesday night,\u201d Josie said casually. \u201cYou should go with us. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>Brittany blinked in surprise as she stared back over at Josie.</p><p>Beside Josie, Ash had retaken his seat and he curled his fingers around hers, squeezing as she issued the invitation. She chanced a peek up at Ash and saw warm approval\u2014and appreciation\u2014glowing in his eyes. She smiled encouragingly up at him, as if to say, It\u2019ll be all right.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Brittany began.</p><p>\u201cYou should go, Britt. Josie is going with Mia and Bethany and their girls. You\u2019ve already met Bethany. They\u2019re solid. You\u2019d like them. No better women anywhere,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>Brittany\u2019s cheeks turned pink but delight simmered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, Josie. Thanks. Tell me when and where.\u201d</p><p>Josie glanced up at Ash because she didn\u2019t know the when and where. Only that she was going Wednesday night and that she and Ash were shopping for a dress and shoes after lunch with Brittany.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a car for you,\u201d Ash promised. \u201cI\u2019ll warn you, though. They take girls\u2019 night out pretty seriously. You\u2019ll need a sexy dress and some to-die-for heels. It\u2019s the dress code, or so I\u2019ve been informed.\u201d</p><p>Brittany laughed. \u201cWell, I have plenty of those. Thank God I\u2019ll have a use for them. I took a look the other day and thought to myself that I\u2019d never have a need of them again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ash smiled at his sister. \u201cBe ready at seven. It\u2019s Jace\u2019s turn to ride herd so he\u2019ll be around in a car. I\u2019ll let him know to pick you up and to drop you back off when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered with excitement. In that moment, Josie was glad she\u2019d issued the impulsive invitation.</p><p>\u201cThank you for inviting me, Josie. It sounds like fun!\u201d</p><p>Josie smiled warmly at Ash\u2019s sister and then reached across the table to squeeze her hand. \u201cUs girls have to stick together, right?\u201d</p> <p>Brittany grinned back. \u201cYep. And with guys like Ash around, it\u2019s even more important not to let them get one over on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Ash defended.</p><p>Josie elbowed him in the gut and he pretended to double over in pain.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s finish eating. Not going to let that bitch ruin the meal for us,\u201d Ash proclaimed. \u201cYou have to get back to work, Britt, and Josie and I have some shopping to do.\u201d</p><p>Brittany\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cShopping? You?\u201d</p> <p>Ash glared at her. \u201cSome things are worth going shopping for. Like the results of this shopping trip.\u201d</p><p>Josie elbowed him for real, her face flaming with heat.</p><p>Brittany laughed and Ash grinned. Josie relaxed. The awkward moment was over and Ash and Brittany hadn\u2019t let it ruin their day.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Ash was guiding Josie into the car and they rode off toward the stores Ash was taking her to.</p><p>He pulled her against him, wrapping his arm around her shoulders. He kissed her temple and left his lips pressed to her skin for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cMeant a lot that you\u2019d invite Britt on your girls\u2019 night out,\u201d he rumbled. \u201cThat was sweet of you, baby. I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p> <p>Josie smiled and then sobered. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Mia and Bethany will mind, do you? I didn\u2019t even think about asking them first.\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head, pulling back from her temple. \u201cNo, they\u2019re the best. They won\u2019t mind a bit. Especially if I put a bug in Mia\u2019s ear about Britt. It was a nice thing to do, baby. It was something you didn\u2019t have to do, but I\u2019m really happy that you\u2019re including Britt in your girls\u2019 stuff. She needs that. She needs good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy to do it,\u201d Josie said softly. \u201cEveryone needs friends. Brittany probably more than most. She looked so miserable and embarrassed when your mom showed up.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s face darkened and he went stiff next to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that. Sorry she ruined our lunch.\u201d</p><p>Josie shook her head. \u201cShe didn\u2019t ruin it, darling. You and Brittany didn\u2019t let her. I don\u2019t know the woman. Don\u2019t care what she thinks about me or that she doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough for you.\u201d</p><p>He went utterly still, his eyes blazing across her face. \u201cYou called me \u2018darling.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She blushed and looked away. \u201cSorry. It probably sounds stupid.\u201d</p><p>He took her face, not too gently, and forced her back to him. \u201cI liked it. Liked it a hell of a lot. You\u2019ve never called me anything but Ash.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah. Don\u2019t give a fuck what other men like or don\u2019t like or what anyone thinks because you call me something sweet. I like it. Makes me feel like I mean something to you, so yeah, I like it a whole lot.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOkay then, darling. I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, hard, long, breathless. His tongue pushed in, roaming through her mouth with sensual familiarity. When he finally dragged himself away, his eyes were dark with desire. He stroked her cheek, palming it with one hand as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give a shit what my mother thinks about you either, baby. As long as you remember that it\u2019s bullshit you not being good enough for me. Don\u2019t want that ever on your mind. Doesn\u2019t even need to cross it. You\u2019re fucking perfect for me and you need to always remember that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled again and leaned up to kiss him, savoring the sweetness of his mouth against hers.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter twenty-three</p><p>After hearing all about the previous girls\u2019 nights out from Ash, Josie was determined to make sure he enjoyed it every bit as much as Gabe and Jace had on previous occasions. Which meant that she didn\u2019t let him see the dress. Or the shoes. Or, well, anything at all.</p><p>He\u2019d protested the idea of her getting dressed at Mia\u2019s. He\u2019d wanted a teaser of what was to come, but Josie had told him in a firm voice that the effect would be ruined if he saw her beforehand.</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d seen the dress. He\u2019d even seen the shoes. After all he\u2019d gone with her to buy them. It had taken him twenty minutes to convince her to buy them because oh my God, they were ridiculously expensive! Clearly she was in the wrong line of work because that one pair of shoes cost three times as much as one of her paintings sold for. But he hadn\u2019t seen the dress or shoes on her nor had he seen her all made-up for the night out. She packed makeup, her dress and shoes, determined that she\u2019d do her hair and everything over at Mia\u2019s.</p><p>Ash wasn\u2019t happy about it, but he saw her into his car with instructions for the driver to take her to Mia and Gabe\u2019s high-rise apartment in Midtown. She\u2019d waved cheekily with a promise to see him much later.</p><p>When she arrived at Mia\u2019s building, to her surprise she found both Bethany and Mia waiting for her in the lobby. Bethany took one of Josie\u2019s bags while Mia herded them all into the elevator. When they reached the top floor, the elevator opened into a spacious apartment with a beautiful view of the city from the living room windows.</p><p>Gabe met them in the living room and Josie stood back, a little wary of him. He just looked so . . . formidable. Not that she thought he\u2019d hurt her. Or Mia. But he was just this quiet, intimidating guy, and she had only been around him once, so she hadn\u2019t reached a level of comfort with him yet.</p><p>Gabe pulled Mia to him and planted a scorching kiss on her that made Josie\u2019s toes curl. Bethany just smiled and glanced at Josie, a teasing glint in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you ladies to it,\u201d Gabe said. \u201cThe car and driver are waiting out front. Just call down and let the doorman know when you\u2019re ready to leave. Jace will get to the club a little later and make sure you all get home afterward. I\u2019m going to head over to eat dinner with Ash.\u201d</p><p>Mia bestowed a devastating smile on her husband, one that earned her a sultry stare that told Josie Gabe was very much looking forward to later.</p><p>\u201cYou need me for anything,\u201d Gabe said as he tipped Mia\u2019s chin up with his fingers, \u201cYou call me. I\u2019ll have my cell. You run into any problems, you call.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cYou know I will, Gabe. Besides, Jace will be there, not to mention Brandon and all his bouncer friends. They keep a very close eye on us when we\u2019re at the club.\u201d</p><p>Josie was fast getting lost in this conversation.</p><p>\u201cBrandon is our friend Caroline\u2019s boyfriend. Or rather fianc\u00e9 since he popped the question recently. That\u2019s what we\u2019re celebrating tonight,\u201d Bethany whispered. \u201cHe works at Vibe as a bouncer and he always takes care of us when we\u2019re out getting drunk.\u201d</p><p>Josie nodded.</p><p>Gabe kissed Mia one last time and then he nodded to Bethany and Josie.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time, ladies, but be careful, okay? Stay together at the club. Don\u2019t leave your drinks unattended and if one of you goes to the bathroom, take at least one other person with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe!\u201d Mia exclaimed in irritation. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, we aren\u2019t teenagers. We can take care of ourselves already!\u201d</p><p>Gabe chuckled, had the grace to look abashed and then headed toward the elevator.</p><p>The women barely had time to head into the huge bathroom before Mia\u2019s cell phone rang. She heaved a sigh when she looked at who was calling. \u201cFor the love of God. He\u2019s not even gone yet and he\u2019s already calling me.\u201d</p><p>Bethany giggled and both she and Josie waited as Mia answered the phone. She said \u201cokay\u201d and then \u201cI love you too,\u201d her voice going soft when she said the last.</p><p>Mia put her phone down on the counter and glanced up at Josie and Bethany. \u201cGabe ran into Brittany downstairs so he\u2019s sending her up in the elevator now. I\u2019ll go grab her. Bethany, get started on Josie\u2019s hair. She\u2019ll need to put on her dress before we do makeup or she\u2019ll get foundation all over her dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got this,\u201d Bethany said, making a shooing motion with her hands. \u201cGo get Brittany so we can get this evening started.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, the four women rode the elevator down to the lobby and got off, Mia leading the way. Outside, as Gabe had promised, a driver waited to usher them into the waiting limousine.</p><p>When they were all settled, Mia pulled a chilled bottle of champagne from the ice bucket and poured four glasses.</p><p>\u201cCaro\u2019s not with us. She\u2019ll meet us at the club. However, that doesn\u2019t prevent us from having a toast in her honor.\u201d</p><p>Bethany nodded solemnly as she raised her glass.</p><p>Brittany clinked glasses enthusiastically, her green eyes, Ash\u2019s green eyes, sparkled with excitement.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for inviting me to come,\u201d Brittany said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing nothing but working and going back to my apartment. I\u2019m starting to feel my age!\u201d</p><p>Mia sent her a look of horror. \u201cWe can\u2019t have that. Spend an evening with us. That\u2019ll fix you right up.\u201d</p><p>Brittany sobered and glanced Josie\u2019s way. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about my mom and what she said about you. I was so horrified and embarrassed. Even more so because I\u2019ve put up with her for so long. Ash has never let her walk over him and that\u2019s why she hates him so much. But me and my other brothers?\u201d</p><p>She broke off, cringing.</p><p>Josie\u2019s heart went out to her and she reached forward to squeeze her hand. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, Britt,\u201d she said, adopting Ash\u2019s pet name for her. Judging by the instant light in her eyes, she liked it. \u201cI\u2019m just so happy you aren\u2019t letting her run over you now.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s nose crinkled in distaste. \u201cNot to offend you, Brittany, but your mother is a bitch. And Ash is such a good guy. I have no idea how he managed it springing from that gene pool.\u201d</p><p>Brittany frowned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t offending me, Mia. I, more than anyone, know how much of a bitch my mother is. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s the way she is. I wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>Bethany\u2019s eyes simmered with sympathy. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, only what Jace has told me and the few times Ash has mentioned his family, but none of it sounds good. Jace worries about him. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about them tonight,\u201d Brittany said in a bright voice. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be having fun, right? This is the first time I can honestly say I\u2019ve looked forward to a night out with the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Josie said. \u201cAnd I need Mia\u2019s and Bethany\u2019s help because, uhm, obviously Ash is expecting something from this night, and I\u2019m not entirely certain what it is. I don\u2019t want to disappoint him!\u201d</p><p>Mia and Bethany both dissolved into laughter.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019ll fill you in on all the juicy details,\u201d Mia said smugly. \u201cI had to guide Bethany through her first night out with us, and let\u2019s just say, she had one happy man that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d Brittany muttered. \u201cI have no hot guy to go home to, and I have to say, it\u2019s been way too long since I\u2019ve had anything remotely resembling good sex.\u201d</p><p>Bethany\u2019s lips pinched together in thought. \u201cWhat about one of Brandon\u2019s friends, Mia? There is a vast array of hotness working at that club. Surely one of them is single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sic Caro on it when we get there,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to come across as desperate!\u201d Brittany protested.</p><p>Bethany shook her head. \u201cOf course not! Caro will fix you up. Maybe introduce you to one of the guys.\u201d</p><p>When they arrived at the club, the door immediately opened, and a pretty, younger woman stuck her head in, a broad smile on her lips. She shoved her hand in before anyone could get out.</p><p>\u201cLook at it!\u201d she squealed. \u201cIsn\u2019t it awesome?\u201d</p><p>Mia pounced on the woman\u2019s hand and then pulled her so she fell into the car with them.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Caro, it\u2019s gorgeous! Brandon did so good!\u201d</p><p>Caro grinned so big that it lit up the inside of the limo. Then she glanced Josie and Brittany\u2019s way and her smile got even bigger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Caroline,\u201d she said, extending her right hand. \u201cYou must be Josie and Brittany!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Josie,\u201d Josie said, returning her smile. \u201cAnd this is Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon\u2019s waiting so let\u2019s get going,\u201d Caroline said enthusiastically. \u201cHe has our table, of course, and tonight we have two waitresses instead of our usual one. We\u2019re expanding, girls! Soon we\u2019ll have the entire club to ourselves on our nights out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow there\u2019s an idea,\u201d Mia drawled. \u201cOur own private club. It has a certain ring to it.\u201d</p><p>Bethany snorted as they piled out. \u201cAll you\u2019d have to do is tell Gabe you want one and he\u2019d buy it for you.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cThis is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChessy, Gina and Trish are already inside waiting at the table,\u201d Caroline explained.</p> <p>Then a big, goofy smile attacked her face and Josie glanced up to see what she was looking at.</p><p>A tall, very muscular, very hot guy stood there, smiling indulgently. He had a goatee and he wore an earring in his left ear. It was obvious, judging by the way Caroline looked at him and the way he looked at her, that this had to be Brandon, the bouncer. He certainly looked the part.</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d he greeted. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, I\u2019ll show you to your table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did awesome, Brandon,\u201d Mia said, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cCaro\u2019s ring is gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cGlad you approve. I wanted her to have the perfect ring. It\u2019s only fair. I get the perfect girl so she gets the perfect ring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh damn,\u201d Brittany muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s the most awesome thing I\u2019ve ever heard a guy say.\u201d</p><p>Josie had to agree. It was absolutely sweet.</p><p>Caroline\u2019s cheeks flushed but her eyes shone with love for Brandon. Two weeks ago, seeing this would have made Josie insanely jealous, because Michael would never ever make his feelings known in public. Or private for that matter. But now she had Ash. Ash who had no problem whatsoever with people knowing Josie was his.</p><p>They pushed their way to the front, bypassing the long line of people waiting to get in. Then Brandon led them through the noisy crowd toward a set of tables in the corner of the room just off the dance floor.</p><p>Music reverberated through the air, invading Josie\u2019s blood, pumping along in time with her pulse. Her feet were already hurting, and she knew there was no way in hell she\u2019d dance with these shoes on. She\u2019d probably kill herself. But the shoes were more for Ash\u2019s benefit. He\u2019d actually been quite vocal about his choices when they\u2019d gone shopping. She\u2019d spare her feet for the evening, but when she headed back to Ash\u2019s apartment, they\u2019d go back on.</p><p>When they reached the table, a waitress stood there with a tray full of drinks. Mia smiled and turned to explain to Josie and Brittany.</p> <p>\u201cShe always brings us two drinks to start the evening. We drink one down immediately after a group toast and then we sip the second until she gets back with more. Bethany and I weren\u2019t sure what your preferences were so we went for girly drinks. Cosmos and amaretto sours. The sours are Bethany\u2019s favorite and one of the few things she can drink to the point of intoxication. If you let the waitress know what you like, she\u2019ll swing by with another round later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Cosmos,\u201d Brittany said over the music.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink much,\u201d Josie said ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m kind of making an exception for tonight. Ash was so eager for me to go out that I couldn\u2019t disappoint him.\u201d</p><p>Bethany and Mia both laughed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Gabe and Jace have tortured Ash with all the details of what the man gets out of girls\u2019 night out,\u201d Bethany said with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTry an amaretto sour, Josie,\u201d Bethany said, shoving one of the drinks into her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t drink much either, but this one is really good. Sweet and fruity without too much alcohol. I still manage to get wasted on them though.\u201d</p><p>When everyone had their drinks, they gathered in a tight circle as Mia made introductions between Chessy, Gina and Trish and Josie and Brittany. Once they were done, they all held their drinks up.</p><p>\u201cTo Caro!\u201d Mia yelled. \u201cAnd that big ass rock on her finger!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo Caro!\u201d the group chorused.</p><p>They clinked glasses, sloshing the drinks over the rims. Then they gulped them down, chugging until the glasses were empty. The waitress emptied her tray of the second-round drinks and with a smile left the tables to go get refills.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance!\u201d Caro yelled.</p><p>Josie allowed herself to be pulled toward the dance floor. She liked to dance. Was actually pretty good at it. It had been a while, though. Michael wasn\u2019t into dancing or clubbing. She could shake her ass with the best of them, and tonight was as good a night as any to let loose and have some fun.</p><p>She liked Mia and Bethany\u2019s friends. Brittany did too judging by her big smile and dancing eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe have a precedent to follow,\u201d Mia yelled.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Josie inquired.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Bethany interjected. \u201cWe get really sexy on the dance floor, make all the men\u2019s tongues hang out, and when whoever\u2019s drawn guy duty for the night gets here, we pull out all the stops and give them, Brandon and the rest of the guys a show they won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>Josie burst into laughter. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m starting to see where Ash is coming from with the girls\u2019 night out thing.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes twinkled merrily. \u201cOh, Bethany and I will fill you all in after we\u2019ve had a few drinks and are taking a break at the table.\u201d</p><p>That sounded fair enough. Until then? She was going to let her hair down. Just a figure of speech, however. Bethany had spent a lot of time upsweeping Josie\u2019s hair into an \u201celegant messy bun\u201d as Mia had called it. The result was sexy if Josie had to say so herself.</p><p>Soft tendrils escaped the pins holding the bun in place. Mia had used a lot of eye makeup on her, for that matter a lot of makeup in general, but the effect was stunning. The entire package was pretty awesome. Josie wasn\u2019t vain, but she knew she looked hot tonight.</p><p>Bethany had called her a bronze goddess. The dress Josie had chosen was a bronze/gold color that went perfectly with her hair and skin color. Skintight, strapless and short. There wasn\u2019t much of it there, but it accentuated her legs and then with the four-inch heels she\u2019d chosen? Yeah, her legs looked great.</p><p>The collar really stood out with her hair upswept and the dress being strapless. She\u2019d seen both Bethany and Mia eyeing it on the ride over, a hundred questions brimming in their gazes. Josie wondered how long it would take before they started prying.</p><p>Brandon checked in with them often. He and three other guys Josie surmised were also bouncers. Though one of them looked too . . . Well, she wasn\u2019t sure what he looked, but he wasn\u2019t a bouncer. Of that she was certain. While Brandon and the others were dressed casually in jeans and polo shirts, this other guy was wearing an expensive suit, silk shirt, diamond cuff links that did not look fake.</p><p>The interesting thing was that while Caro had introduced Brittany to the three bouncers who worked with Brandon, the guy in the suit had walked over and asked Brandon to introduce him to Brittany. And now? Brittany and mystery guy were standing off to the side, talking. Brittany had a glow about her that could only mean one thing. The guy was interested.</p><p>Josie nudged Mia and dipped her head in Brittany\u2019s direction. \u201cWho\u2019s that with Brittany?\u201d</p><p>Mia followed her gaze and then frowned as she studied the couple. \u201cNo idea, but Brandon will know. I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>Before Josie could tell her it was okay, Mia gestured for Brandon to come over. He came, Caroline tucked into his side, his fingers splayed possessively over her upper arm.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the guy with Brittany?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>Brandon pursed his lips a moment before returning his gaze to Mia and Josie. \u201cHis name is Kai Wellington. He owns the club.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHe owns it? Like the whole thing?\u201d</p><p>Brandon chuckled. \u201cYeah. He owns several. He\u2019s usually not here that much. He just opened one up in Vegas a few weeks ago and he\u2019s been spending all his time out there.\u201d He glanced down at Caroline and squeezed her closer to him. \u201cHe wants me to work out there. Take over security. If I go, I want Caro to go with me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Mia looked stricken and Josie\u2019s heart went out to her. Caro was her best friend. But Mia quickly got a grip on her reaction and she smiled broadly.</p><p>\u201cIs that like a promotion or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d Brandon said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you,\u201d Mia said, but Josie could see that her lower lip trembled.</p><p>Then Mia threw her arms around Caroline and hugged her tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for both of you,\u201d Mia said in a rush. \u201cAre you excited, Caro?\u201d</p><p>Caroline pulled back from Mia, smiling broadly. \u201cYeah, I am. I\u2019m so happy for Brandon. He\u2019s worked hard for this and it\u2019s huge that Mr. Wellington trusts him. But I hate to leave the city . . . and you,\u201d she finished unhappily.</p><p>Brandon pulled her back into his arms and then pulled Mia to his other side.</p><p>\u201cLook on the bright side. Your girls\u2019 nights out can be relocated to Vegas. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re given VIP treatment from beginning to end. You can plan a couple a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way he thinks,\u201d Bethany said, speaking up for the first time.</p><p>\u201cSo, Brandon,\u201d Josie said, pulling the attention back to Brittany. \u201cWhat does Mr. Wellington want with Brittany? Didn\u2019t he ask you to introduce her to him?\u201d</p><p>Brandon glanced sideways again before looking back at the women. His eyes expressed regret. \u201cI can\u2019t really say anything. Mr. Wellington is a very private man. But I\u2019d say he was interested in Brittany. He never took his eyes off her the entire evening.\u201d</p><p>Very interesting. Josie glanced their way again and Brittany hadn\u2019t once taken her eyes off him either. Ash would probably find it interesting as well, although he\u2019d most likely do a complete background check on Kai Wellington.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some drinking to do,\u201d Caroline said brightly. \u201cThe evening\u2019s going to waste and Jace will probably be here at any time. Bethany, he\u2019ll be so disappointed if you aren\u2019t completely shitfaced. He thinks you\u2019re the most adorable drunk ever!\u201d</p><p>Mia burst out laughing and Bethany smiled, though she did reach for her drink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the waitress swing by and set you up,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cBreak\u2019s over for me. Time to make another pass around the club. If you all want a quieter place to drink and relax, I\u2019ll put you in one of the boxes overlooking the dance floor. There\u2019s a button you can push to silence the music and outside noise.\u201d</p><p>Josie smiled at his understanding. No doubt he thought that Mia and Caroline would want to talk about her impending move and they couldn\u2019t really do that on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect!\u201d Bethany exclaimed. \u201cCan we move there for a bit? I need a break from dancing and standing on my feet, and I\u2019d love a quieter place to drink and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow me. I\u2019ll have the waitress round up Chessy and the others. They\u2019re still on the dance floor. She\u2019ll let them know where to find you when they\u2019re done dancing.\u201d</p><p>The women followed Brandon, but Josie motioned them to stop when they got to where Brittany and Kai were standing. She wanted to check in on Brittany and make sure she was comfortable or see if she needed rescuing.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Josie said, donning a bright smile as she greeted Kai. \u201cI wanted to let Brittany know that we\u2019re going to one of the boxes. Didn\u2019t want her looking for us.\u201d</p><p>Kai\u2019s arm slid around Brittany\u2019s waist, anchoring her to him. Okay then, it would seem the man moved fast. He smiled, and it was a gentle, warm smile, but Josie did not miss the strength in those eyes. This was a powerful, intimidating man. She glanced at Brittany to gauge her reaction.</p><p>\u201cYour concern is admirable,\u201d Kai said in a low voice she almost couldn\u2019t hear over the music. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take very good care of Brittany and I\u2019ll escort her to your box myself when she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat okay with you?\u201d</p><p>Josie directed the question just to Brittany because so far Kai had done all the talking.</p><p>Brittany smiled and Josie could see no strain or faking it. Her entire face was flushed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Thank you, Josie. I\u2019ll catch up to you and the girls in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time,\u201d Josie said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Kai murmured.</p><p>Chapter twenty-four</p><p>Ash stretched on his couch, drink in one hand, as Gabe sprawled into the armchair across from him. The two had eaten takeout that Gabe had picked up on his way over after leaving the women at his apartment.</p><p>Ash checked his watch and grinned. \u201cHow drunk you think they are by now?\u201d</p><p>Gabe grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re well on their way.\u201d</p><p>Ash chuckled, though he was willing the hours to pass. He wanted Josie back, drunk, cute, and he was dying to see her in that dress and heels she\u2019d bought. She wouldn\u2019t even let him see them when she tried them on in the store. All she\u2019d said was that she thought he\u2019d like the end result.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d like her in a sackcloth or with a paper bag over her head. Didn\u2019t matter to him what she wore, because he\u2019d get her out of it quick enough. It was what was underneath that mattered the most. But still, the image of her made-up, teetering on sexy heels and eyes cloudy with alcohol? Yeah, that did it for him. He\u2019d listened to Gabe and Jace enough to know that girls\u2019 night out was not something to miss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neither man had any issue with their women going out and having fun because afterward they came home to them and the reward was pretty spectacular.</p><p>His cell phone rang, and he picked it up immediately, thinking it might be Josie. He hoped the evening was going well and that she was relaxed and having fun.</p><p>He frowned when he saw his doorman\u2019s name as the incoming call.</p><p>\u201cAsh,\u201d he said shortly.</p> <p>\u201cMr. McIntyre, you have visitors in the lobby. They wanted to go up, but I called first. They say they\u2019re your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus,\u201d Ash muttered. Just kill him now. They had to be here tonight of all nights? They\u2019d never set foot in his apartment building, just as they\u2019d never set foot in his office building either. Hell, before the lunch his mother had intruded on earlier in the week, he seriously doubted they\u2019d ever stepped into one of his hotels either.</p><p>Such a move reeked of desperation. His mother had wanted to \u201ctalk\u201d after making her scene in the restaurant and he\u2019d let her know in no uncertain terms that he had no desire to discuss anything with her. He\u2019d banned her from his hotel properties, but perhaps he should have broadened his parameters a bit. But he wouldn\u2019t have imagined that they\u2019d come here. Making him come to them was more their style.</p><p>He glanced over at Gabe who was regarding him with a frown. He shook his head to let Gabe know it wasn\u2019t anything going on with the women.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down. Do not let them up. In fact never let them up if they show up again. They aren\u2019t allowed here,\u201d Ash bit out. \u201cI\u2019ll come down and take care of the matter personally, but in the future, if they show up, you\u2019re to show them the door. And you damn sure better not ever let them up when I\u2019m not here and Josie is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Ash ended the call and then got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, man?\u201d Gabe demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents are paying me a visit,\u201d Ash said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m going down to inform them they aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Gabe swore. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d Ash said in a calm voice. \u201cJust hang out up here. I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe got up, ignoring Ash\u2019s response. \u201cDidn\u2019t say it was necessary. But I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>Ash shrugged. Most people wouldn\u2019t want their dirty laundry and family drama aired in front of others. But Gabe wasn\u2019t just anyone. He was Ash\u2019s real family. Just as Jace was. And Gabe knew everything there was to know about mommy dearest. Except her showing her ass at lunch. It wasn\u2019t that Ash hadn\u2019t wanted to tell him or Jace, but it had slipped his mind. He\u2019d been too focused on other things.</p><p>\u201cShe showed her ass the other day,\u201d Ash said as they got into the elevator. \u201cI was having lunch with Josie and Brittany at the Bentley and she strutted in making a scene. I had her escorted out and gave instructions that she wasn\u2019t to be allowed on any of our hotel properties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Does she ever quit?\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head. \u201cEvidently not. She insulted Britt and Josie. Then she wanted to talk. As if I\u2019d give her the time of day even if she hadn\u2019t spewed her vitriol all over Britt and Josie.\u201d</p><p>Gabe shook his head as the elevator descended. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad fact but maybe you ought to look into a restraining order. Have their asses arrested the next time they come poking around. Maybe that would be a wake-up call and let them know just how serious you are about them staying the hell away from you and Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make my point face-to-face,\u201d Ash said, his face going hard over the impending confrontation.</p><p>Having it out with his parents in the lobby of his building wasn\u2019t his first choice, but no way in hell was he allowing them into his home. That was his sanctuary. And Josie\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t about to have it invaded by people he loathed. And he damn sure wasn\u2019t having this confrontation on their turf. He wouldn\u2019t give them the satisfaction of going to them. Ever.</p> <p>When they got off the elevator, Ash saw his mother and father waiting in the lobby. Neither looked happy and when they turned and saw him, there was no welcome in their eyes. No recognition that he was their son. But then there\u2019d never been. He didn\u2019t understand it. Couldn\u2019t fathom being so cold toward your own children. The hell he\u2019d ever treat his own kids this way.</p><p>He strode up to them and halted several feet away, his face drawn into a glacier of ice. He stared at them both coldly until his father actually flinched and looked away, guilt edging into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Ash demanded bluntly.</p><p>His mother\u2019s gaze flicked over him and then to Gabe, annoyance sparking in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally, Ash, this is a private matter. Couldn\u2019t we speak privately? Perhaps in your apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe is family,\u201d Ash said in a flat tone. \u201cAnything you have to say can be said in front of him.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed delicately and then schooled her features. He could swear she was actually trying to appear . . . nice. Beseeching even. His nape prickled because she resembled a bloodthirsty vampire closing in on the kill.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to apologize for my unfortunate behavior earlier in the week.\u201d</p><p>Color rose in her cheeks and it looked as though the words nearly choked her. They probably had. Issuing an apology was not something she ever did.</p><p>\u201cApology accepted. Now if that\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed in her eyes briefly before she pushed it away, once again composing herself to look more congenial.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather would like to have us all for dinner. Brittany too. He\u2014and I\u2014would like it very much if you would come. Your brothers and their wives and children will be there too, of course.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNo chance in hell.\u201d</p><p>His father cleared his throat, speaking for the first time.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d reconsider, son.\u201d</p><p>Ash stared at him in disgust. \u201c\u2018Son\u2019? When have I ever been your son? Suppose you cut the crap and tell me exactly what it is you want here. Because it sure as hell isn\u2019t some family quality time over dinner.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s lips thinned and her eyes flashed. This time she did nothing to try and hide her annoyance.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to change his will. He\u2019s pissed because our family has gone to hell as he put it. He\u2019s not happy with Brittany\u2019s defection. Said if I was more of a mother then my children wouldn\u2019t all despise me. He\u2019s made noises about how we should start to support ourselves and that he\u2019s tired of dumping money into a nest of vipers. He said that if a mother and father can\u2019t even keep their family together then why should he reward us by leaving us everything.\u201d</p><p>Ash laughed and it only pissed his mother off even more.</p><p>\u201cThis affects you too,\u201d she hissed. \u201cAnd Brittany! If he cuts us out of his will, he cuts everyone. You won\u2019t get a dime and neither will Brittany.\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head, still chuckling. \u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t been listening to me all these years, Mother dear. I don\u2019t give a flying fuck about the old man\u2019s money. I never have. It comes with too many strings. Just as everything with you has strings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t care then at least think about how this will affect your sister. She won\u2019t get anything either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll provide for Brittany so she never has to give a fuck about the old man\u2019s money or strings either,\u201d Ash said icily. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be part of this toxic family any more than I do. She wanted out. I gave her that option.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s fingers balled into tight fists at her sides. Then she turned to his father and all but shouted at him.</p><p>\u201cDo something, William! Don\u2019t just stand there like a coward. We\u2019ll be ruined if he changes his will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing he can do,\u201d Ash said calmly. \u201cThere is nothing either of you can possibly say that will make me go play nice with the family. I don\u2019t give a fuck about my brothers or the fact that they can\u2019t support their wives and children. I don\u2019t give a fuck about you and dear old dad. You made your bed and you can fucking lie in it. Brittany and I will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d his mother hissed.</p><p>He flinched, even though he knew as much. But somehow hearing those words from the woman who gave him life cut deep.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth, stop it,\u201d his father snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. He\u2019s our son for God\u2019s sake. Is it any wonder he won\u2019t have anything to do with either of us? Think about what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>But Ash knew she meant every word. It was there in her eyes. It had always been there since the day he\u2019d brushed his family off and made his own way in the world.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time you left,\u201d Ash said quietly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t come back. You aren\u2019t welcome here. You aren\u2019t welcome on any of the properties I own. And here\u2019s a warning. Stay the hell away from Brittany. Stay the hell away from me. And you sure as fuck better stay the hell away from Josie and the rest of my family. You spread your poison to any of them and I\u2019ll come after you. I\u2019ll take everything away from you. Furthermore, I\u2019ll make certain that the old man does change his will and leaves you nothing. If you don\u2019t think I\u2019m deadly serious, just try me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bluffing,\u201d his mother spat.</p><p>Ash raised one eyebrow and engaged in a stare down. He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t have to. She blanched and then looked away, her face going pale as she realized just how serious he was.</p><p>When she glanced back at him, she looked . . . old. Haggard and defeated. She took a step forward, her hand going to his arm. It took everything he had not to flinch away.</p><p>\u201cAsh, please. I\u2019m begging you. Don\u2019t do this. If you want us to back off, we will. I\u2019ll never come around again. Not even to Brittany. If you\u2019ll get him to change his mind. If you\u2019ll just come to one dinner, I swear you\u2019ll never see us again unless you want to. I\u2019ll issue that promise in writing. Whatever you want. Don\u2019t let your hatred of me ruin your brothers\u2019 lives. Think of their children. Their wives. Think of your father and me. We\u2019ll have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let her fuck with your head, Ash,\u201d Gabe growled, speaking up for the first time.</p><p>Ash held up his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t come to dinner. No way I\u2019ll expose Britt to that. Or Josie. And where I go, she goes. That\u2019s in stone.\u201d</p><p>Seeing that she might be making headway, his mother leaned forward eagerly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come to dinner. But meet with him, Ash. You can put a different spin on Brittany leaving. Tell him whatever you want. Tell him we\u2019ve reconciled. Just do whatever you have to in order to convince him not to cut us all out of his will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Gabe spat. \u201cThis is pathetic.\u201d</p><p>She sent Gabe a chilling look so full of hatred that Ash recoiled. What the hell was wrong with these people? How on earth had he come from these two self-absorbed malcontents?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the old man,\u201d Ash offered.</p><p>Gabe shook his head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing,\u201d Ash continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you now, this shit stops. If I hear of you coming near Britt or Josie, if you make another appearance at one of my hotels, my office building and especially my home, I\u2019ll yank the rug out from under you so fast that it\u2019ll break your neck. Got it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly, her eyes filled with hope. Desperate didn\u2019t even begin to cover it. The fact that she\u2019d humbled herself enough to beg for anything from him told him just how desperate and afraid she was.</p><p>He should walk way. Should wash his hands of the lot of them. But they were his family. His blood. Even if he never wanted a familial relationship with them, the idea of them being destitute left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Ash said. \u201cI\u2019m done with this. I\u2019m not letting you ruin my evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, son,\u201d his father said in a quiet voice. \u201cThis means a lot to your mother. To me. And to your brothers as well. Tell Brittany . . .\u201d He broke off with a sigh and scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cTell Brittany I love her and that I miss her and hope she\u2019s doing well.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded and then looked pointedly at the door.</p><p>His mother, evidently satisfied that she\u2019d won this round, whirled and stalked away, her nose in the air.</p><p>When Ash turned back toward the elevator, Gabe was staring at him, a grimace twisting his lips.</p><p>\u201cChrist, man, that sucks. I knew they were bad, but until I saw that, I just had no idea.\u201d</p><p>Ash shrugged. \u201cHow\u2019s the saying go? \u2018You can choose your friends, but you can\u2019t choose your family\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Chapter twenty-five</p><p>Josie followed Bethany and Mia who followed Caroline and Brandon to a private room located above the dance floor. Though you could see out to the floor below, Brandon assured them that no one was able to see into the box, so they were afforded complete privacy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back to check on you in a little while,\u201d Brandon said to Caroline as he brushed a kiss over her lips.</p><p>Caroline flopped onto the comfortable couch next to Josie. Mia took the other side of Caroline and Bethany perched on the arm.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re moving to Las Vegas,\u201d Mia murmured.</p><p>Tears filled Caroline\u2019s eyes. \u201cYeah. Brandon wants to get married before we go. We have six weeks to find a place to live there, get married and move out there before he starts his new job. Mr. Wellington is being fabulous about everything. He\u2019s paying for relocation and also helping with the down payment on the house. He\u2019s very serious about Brandon and wants him to consider this a long-term position. He\u2019s doubling Brandon\u2019s salary so we won\u2019t have to worry about money and I have plenty of time to find a job out there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Caro,\u201d Mia said softly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll miss you terribly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all will,\u201d Bethany amended. \u201cGirls\u2019 night out just won\u2019t be the same without you!\u201d</p><p>Caroline hugged them both and then rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to head to the ladies\u2019 room and see if the others are coming. I\u2019ll also snag the waitress and tell her we all want another round. Be back in a flash.\u201d</p><p>Mia watched her best friend go with an unhappy frown. When Caroline left the room, Mia sighed.</p><p>\u201cDamn, I\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cSo will I. But you still have us, Mia.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked up and smiled and then impulsively reached for both Josie\u2019s and Bethany\u2019s hands to squeeze.</p><p>\u201cOkay so we\u2019re alone now and I have to admit, Josie, that Bethany and I are bursting with nosy questions about you and Ash. I hope we don\u2019t offend you but we\u2019re dying to know all the details!\u201d</p><p>Josie laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. But I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in for a disappointment. There\u2019s nothing really exciting about our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Mia snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive us if we don\u2019t quite believe that. The first thing you have to tell us is just how good he is in the sack. I suppose Bethany already knows, but I have to admit, I\u2019m curious!\u201d</p><p>Then she promptly clamped a hand over her mouth, her eyes rounding with horror.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, Josie! I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d A low moan escaped and Mia buried her face in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m so stupid. I swear. Gabe and Jace are always telling me how I just blurt out whatever I\u2019m thinking without any consideration for what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>Josie smiled wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mia. Really. I know about Bethany and Ash.\u201d She glanced over at Bethany to see the other woman was even more mortified than Mia. Her cheeks were pink and her eyes were mirrors of discomfort.</p><p>\u201cI hope you understand,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cI mean that it didn\u2019t mean anything to Ash. Oh God, this is even more awkward than things were the first time Jace and I saw Ash together after that night.\u201d</p><p>Josie reached over to squeeze Bethany\u2019s hand. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. It\u2019s okay, really. I admit, when Ash first told me what happened, I dreaded meeting you. I wasn\u2019t crazy about having to spend time with a woman who\u2019d had sex with Ash. I hated the idea of picturing the two of you together. But after meeting you it was okay. And I think in a lot of ways, seeing how Jace was with you helped cement for me that there was nothing between you and Ash except deep friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Bethany said sincerely. \u201cI love Ash. I really do. But as a friend. I adore Jace beyond all reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I\u2019ve ruined any chance of us getting the dirt on you and Ash now, Josie,\u201d Mia said glumly.</p><p>Josie laughed. \u201cWell, no, not if you give me return dirt. I\u2019m dying of curiosity over your men too. Like for instance, is that a collar you wear, Bethany? Or is it just a necklace?\u201d</p><p>Bethany\u2019s cheeks went pink as she fingered the diamond that rested in the hollow of her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s a collar,\u201d she said softly. \u201cJace wanted me to wear it. I never take it off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs yours a collar too, Josie?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>Josie nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell damn,\u201d Mia muttered. \u201cI want one too. I think they\u2019re so cool. I\u2019d love for Gabe to pick one out and put it on me. But he\u2019s not into collars. And to be honest, I never was until I saw Bethany\u2019s. The meaning behind it is pretty awesome.\u201d</p><p>Both Bethany and Josie nodded.</p><p>Josie downed the last of her drink and set it on the table in front of the couch. She had a pretty good buzz going, but she wasn\u2019t even close to being plastered. She slipped her heels off her aching feet and stretched her toes, nearly sighing in contentment.</p><p>\u201cOh look, there\u2019s Jace,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten up and walked to the glassed-in area of the box to look down on the floor.</p><p>She turned back to Bethany. \u201cHe\u2019s here early isn\u2019t he? Or have we not been drinking enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been drinking as much,\u201d Bethany said ruefully.</p><p>\u201cWell damn. We have to fix this. And the only way I know to get shitfaced in a very short time is to do shots!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d Josie said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even had a shot of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Mia said. \u201cAfter the first one, you don\u2019t really taste them anymore.\u201d</p><p>Just then the door burst open and the rest of the women came in noisily. The waitress was with them, and handed out drinks and then listened as Mia gave her the next series of orders.</p><p>\u201cShots?\u201d Caroline asked. \u201cSince when do we do shots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re not nearly drunk enough,\u201d Mia said dryly. \u201cJace is already here, which means we don\u2019t have much longer. We have to catch up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring the bottle,\u201d Chessy called to the waitress. \u201cBetter make it two! We have a lot of women here tonight.\u201d</p><p>The waitress grinned. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>Everyone piled onto the couches and chairs, shoes going this way and that. A few moments later, the waitress returned and began lining up shot glasses on the table.</p><p>\u201cEveryone got one?\u201d Trish yelled.</p><p>After a chorus of yesses, Gina held up her shot glass in a toast. Everyone raised theirs and then amid shouts of \u201cGo, go go!\u201d they downed the first shot.</p><p>Fire blazed down Josie\u2019s throat. She coughed and sputtered so much her eyes watered. She could feel it in her belly. Hell, she could even feel it travel to her bladder. It was sitting in her bladder, hot and swirling. Already she needed to go pee.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do the next!\u201d Trish encouraged.</p><p>They picked up the next shot glasses, held them up as they did the last ones and then tossed the contents back.</p><p>A low chuckle sounded from the door. Everyone jerked around to see Jace standing there with Brandon. Both men looked amused. Jace was outright laughing. Then Jace stepped aside and Brittany appeared in the doorway, her face pink, her eyes shining brightly.</p><p>Behind her, stood Kai Wellington. He had hold of her elbow, but he let it go when she started forward.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cDid you save any for me?\u201d</p><p>Gina tossed a shot glass in Brittany\u2019s direction. Brittany caught it and then set it down so Mia could pour a shot from the bottle of tequila the waitress had brought. They were insane. All of them. Josie included. She had to be nuts to be doing this. She was going to be one hungover bitch in the morning. But for now? She was having a blast.</p><p>\u201cI was so jealous of you guys,\u201d Brittany said wistfully.</p><p>Bethany cocked her head to the side. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you all have a man to go home to. All you\u2019ve talked about is how cute they think you are when you\u2019re drunk. How they\u2019ll tear your dresses off and fuck you in your heels.\u201d Her expression went dim. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a man who wanted to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do now,\u201d Kai drawled from the doorway.</p><p>Brittany turned bright red, but warmth crept in to her gaze as she turned to look at Kai who was still standing in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cOh my,\u201d Mia murmured. \u201cBrittany, girlfriend, I\u2019d say you scored for the night.\u201d</p><p>Brittany grinned. \u201cMaybe I did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo maybe about it, babe,\u201d Kai said in a low growl. \u201cHave fun with your girls, but when you\u2019re done? You\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I just came,\u201d Gina muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cNo lie,\u201d Trish said. \u201cI need to change my underwear. Good God, Brittany. He is hot!\u201d</p><p>Brittany\u2019s smile was one hundred watts. She reached for the full shot glass and promptly tossed it down.</p><p>\u201cThey do this regularly?\u201d Kai asked, amusement thick in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d both Jace and Brandon answered in unison.</p><p>\u201cHow come the room is spinning?\u201d Josie asked, her eyes crossing as she tried to keep up with the spins. \u201cKai, you own the club, Brandon said. Why does it spin?\u201d</p><p>Kai chuckled. \u201cNo spin, babe. It\u2019s the alcohol making you spin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you serve alcohol that makes people spin?\u201d Bethany asked in a perplexed voice.</p><p>Jace laughed this time.</p><p>\u201cIt gets worse,\u201d Brandon said with a sigh. \u201cThey\u2019re really only just getting started.\u201d</p><p>The waitress bustled back through picking up empties and replacing them with clean shot glasses. She did a quick check of the bottle she\u2019d left and then set a new one down.</p><p>\u201cShe rocks,\u201d Caroline muttered as she picked up another shot. \u201cWe should totally take her to Vegas with us, Brandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink up, girlfriends. The night is still young!\u201d Chessy crowed.</p><p>Josie downed two more shots but her eyes bugged out the entire time. She was a lightweight. No way she\u2019d be able to hold any more liquor without puking. The room was spinning. Like a merry-go-round from hell. And there were two of everyone, which made the already crowded room seem even more crowded.</p><p>\u201cHow about some music,\u201d Mia blurted. \u201cAre we finished talking for a bit? Who wants to dance with me?\u201d</p><p>Josie raised her hand. \u201cI do! But someone has to help me up.\u201d</p><p>Josie was hoisted upward by no less than three sets of hands. Mia punched the button to allow the music through the sound system. The girls shrieked and then everyone was up, bumping and grinding in time to the beat.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun!\u201d Josie yelled out.</p><p>\u201cBet your ass it is!\u201d Mia yelled back.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me!\u201d Brittany exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve had so much fun, and oh my God, Kai wants me to go home with him after. Should I do it?\u201d</p><p>Josie shot a fuzzy glance toward the door where the men were still standing and most assuredly heard Brittany\u2019s drunken question.</p><p>Kai\u2019s lips twisted with amusement. \u201cDo I get a vote?\u201d</p><p>Josie turned back to Brittany. \u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>Brittany blinked. \u201cYeah. Yeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as he gives me contact info so I can check on you tomorrow and make sure he didn\u2019t murder you in your sleep then yeah, go for it,\u201d Josie urged.</p><p>There was more laughter by the door but Josie ignored them. She was having too much fun dancing with her new friends. And they were great. Just as Ash had said they were.</p><p>She closed her eyes and put her back to Mia\u2019s as they both swayed, arms up, asses shaking the entire time.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ash\u2019s phone rang and he saw it was Jace calling.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, women giving you fits yet?\u201d</p><p>Jace chuckled. \u201cYou ought to get up here, man.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s eyes narrowed and he glanced over at Gabe who was also paying close attention to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ash demanded. \u201cAre they all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, they\u2019re fine. But I think we\u2019re going to have to go to plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s plan B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, plan A was for me to get them all in the limo and home after they got plastered and had fun. However, they\u2019re currently on the floor of a private box, staring up at the ceiling and talking about shit I don\u2019t have a clue about. If you have any hope of salvaging the evening, my suggestion is for you to come collect your woman and get her ass home.\u201d</p><p>Ash chuckled. \u201cGabe and I will be there in a few. Watch over them until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Jace said as he rang off.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Gabe demanded.</p><p>Ash laughed. \u201cAccording to Jace, they\u2019re pretty shitfaced. He said they\u2019re lying on the floor of one of the boxes. He suggested we might want to go collect our women if we had any hope of later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride with you and call my driver on the way to have him meet us there.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s roll.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they pulled up to the club. Ash directed the driver to park a short distance away and remain on standby. Then he and Gabe got out and walked toward the entrance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thank God Brandon was out waiting for them. The line was still long. They would have never gotten in if it weren\u2019t for Brandon.</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to know?\u201d Gabe asked Brandon as they headed in.</p><p>Brandon laughed. \u201cNo, I doubt it. They had a good night, though. Nobody messed with them. The club owner hung out with them most of the night and security is always tight around him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this club owner and why the fuck was he hanging with our women?\u201d Ash demanded.</p> <p>Brandon laughed again. \u201cNot women. Just one. He seems pretty interested in Brittany. He\u2019s been velcroed to her all night and that\u2019s not like him. He\u2019s never short on women to keep him company, but it\u2019s rare for him to seek a woman out like he did Brittany.\u201d</p><p>Ash scowled. The man needed to stay away from his sister.</p><p>Brandon led them up a short flight of stairs to the second level where many private boxes and open tables formed a semicircle above the dance floor. At the door, Brandon knocked softly and it opened, revealing Jace and a man Ash didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Jace looked up and saw them. His smile was instant and he nodded for them to come through. When Ash and Gabe stepped inside, Ash\u2019s eyes widened when he took in the sight before him.</p><p>There were women everywhere. Really beautiful women. This was any man\u2019s wet dream. A room full of gorgeous, very drunk women.</p> <p>But his focus zeroed in on just one. Josie. She was sprawled on the end of the couch, her arm dangling over the side. Mia was lying below her, but the upper half of her body was between Josie and the couch so her head rested on Josie\u2019s hip. At the bottom, Bethany lay in the opposite direction so her feet were all but shoved in Josie\u2019s face.</p><p>On the floor, Chessy, Gina and Trish were lying down in various poses while Caroline was sprawled in a chair, her legs propped up over the arm.</p><p>They weren\u2019t passed out, but they were oblivious to anything going on around them.</p><p>Ash chuckled. Gabe sported a huge grin. The other men were no less charmed by the sight.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do we do with them now?\u201d Ash asked in a low voice.</p><p>Gabe sent him a smug, satisfied grin. \u201cIf I have to tell you that, there\u2019s no hope for you, man.\u201d</p> <p>Josie looked up, apparently only just now hearing his voice. Her smile was dazzling, her eyes completely unfocused. Her head bobbed as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cHey darling,\u201d she sang out. \u201cDid you know there are two of you? Who says you have to improvise to give me two cocks? There are two of you now. That would make an awesome threesome. Me, you and you! Just sayin\u2019. \u201d</p><p>Gabe, Jace and Brandon cracked up.</p><p>Ash groaned and hurried over to cover her mouth with his hand. \u201cJesus, baby. You can stop talking now.\u201d</p><p>She smiled underneath his hand. When he pulled it away, she sent him a completely goofy, dazzling smile that took his breath away.</p><p>\u201cAre you taking me home to fuck me in my shoes now? Mia and Bethany told me all about being fucked in their shoes after their dresses get ripped off. I\u2019m going to be very disappointed if I don\u2019t get the same,\u201d she said in a solemn voice.</p><p>He leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead. \u201cI think I can accommodate you there, baby. You ready?\u201d</p><p>She held up both arms. \u201cTake me home,\u201d she said dramatically. Then she put a finger to her lips and said, \u201cShhhh! Don\u2019t tell Ash, but Brittany is going home with a badass-looking guy tonight. I\u2019m not sure he would approve. He\u2019ll probably want to run a background check on him to make sure he\u2019s okay for his sister.\u201d</p> <p>Ash scowled and then glanced at Brittany before looking toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is she talking about?\u201d he asked in Jace\u2019s direction.</p><p>The man standing with Jace stepped forward. He was polished. Ash saw that right off. He had money. He had that quiet air about him that told Ash he had a lot of money but didn\u2019t necessarily go around screaming it.</p><p>Ash stared hard at him, not backing down an inch. To the man\u2019s credit, neither did he.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Kai Wellington,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI own the club. I\u2019ve offered to see Brittany home tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ash continued to stare him down. \u201cI don\u2019t want you taking advantage of her. She\u2019s shitfaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I won\u2019t be sleeping with her. Yet.\u201d</p><p>Ash cringed. No way did he want to get into a discussion about who his sister slept with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ensure she gets home,\u201d Brandon spoke up. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p>Kai sent Brandon an amused look. Ash could tell he didn\u2019t like Brandon speaking up for him or offering his services. But Brandon also knew how important these women were to Gabe, Jace and Ash. He\u2019d been told in no uncertain terms what would happen to him if he ever let harm come to any of them when they were out at the club.</p><p>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Ash said softly. \u201cI\u2019d like a phone call when she\u2019s home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your card. I\u2019ll see that you get that call,\u201d Kai said.</p><p>Ash fished in his wallet, pulled out his business card with his cell number on it and then handed it over to Kai.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to head out with your women, me and the other bouncers will make sure that Chessy, Trish and Gina get home safely. Caro will stay with me until I get off,\u201d Brandon offered.</p><p>Gabe nodded his agreement.</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Let\u2019s get our girls and get the hell out of here,\u201d Ash announced.</p><p>Chapter twenty-six</p><p>\u201cHuddle!\u201d Mia called out belligerently. She stood in the center of the room and waved her hand urgently toward Bethany and Josie.</p><p>Josie and Bethany struggled up from the couch. Josie swayed precariously and stared down at her feet, baffled as to why they weren\u2019t working properly. She nearly went down, and a strong hand caught her elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhoops!\u201d she exclaimed before righting herself. She sent her \u201chelp\u201d a dazzling smile and registered an amused male grin. Was it Ash? Hell, the room was spinning so much she couldn\u2019t tell who was who or where.</p><p>She teetered toward where Mia waited and caught Bethany\u2019s arm when the other woman stumbled on her way.</p><p>Giggling like fiends, they huddled with Mia.</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Mia said in a loud whisper. \u201cWe definitely have to meet up for lunch tomorrow and exchange details. I can\u2019t wait to hear how Ash reacts.\u201d</p><p>Josie frowned and then looked back over her shoulder to where the men stood, indulgent smiles on their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brittany?\u201d Josie hissed. \u201cShe\u2019s hooking up with Mr. Club Owner over there. We have to hear what goes down there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Bethany said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cBrittany!\u201d Mia yelled again.</p><p>Brittany scuttled over, breaking into the circle, her face flushed with excitement.</p><p>\u201cOkay, lunch tomorrow,\u201d Mia said. \u201cWe have to get all the down-and-dirty details!\u201d</p><p>A series of groans went up and Josie turned, silencing the males with a ferocious scowl. They laughed and Josie turned her attention back to the women.</p><p>Brittany bit her lip and then glanced over Josie\u2019s shoulder in the direction of Kai Wellington.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, guys. Maybe I\u2019m biting off more than I can chew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take good care of you, Brittany,\u201d Kai said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re eavesdropping,\u201d Mia muttered.</p><p>\u201cKind of hard not to, baby,\u201d Gabe said, laughter in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re bellowing loud enough for the entire club to hear.\u201d</p><p>Mia scowled and then lowered her voice to a loud whisper.</p><p>\u201cOne o\u2019clock. Isabella\u2019s. For all the girls\u2019 night wrap-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they always do this?\u201d Kai asked in the background.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Jace muttered. \u201cNothing like being intimidated by being rated the next day. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of pressure to put on a man.\u201d</p><p>The women giggled and then Mia put her hand in. \u201cOn three. Let\u2019s go get our men.\u201d</p><p>They slapped their hands in a pile in the middle. \u201cOne, two, three!\u201d</p><p>They raised their hands, breaking away from the huddle. Josie stumbled away, scanning the floor for her shoes.</p><p>\u201cMy shoes! I have to have those shoes,\u201d she complained. \u201cIt will ruin everything if I don\u2019t have the shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for these, darling?\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see Ash standing there, her shoes dangling from his fingers. His eyes were bright with laughter, but his gaze smoldered appreciatively over her body. She did an experimental wiggle, hoping her dress covered everything it was supposed to.</p><p>His eyes gleamed brighter and he reached over to adjust the top, his fingers brushing over the swell of one breast.</p><p>\u201cThat sight is just for me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNot that you don\u2019t look delectable, that hint of nipple, but no one else gets to see that.\u201d</p><p>She slapped her hands over her chest in horror and then stared anxiously at the other men. \u201cOh my God. Did they see my nipples!\u201d</p><p>Laughter went up and there was a series of shaking heads. Ash leaned in to kiss her, pulling her into his arms. His entire body shook with laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. Nobody but me saw.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he turned, sending a pointed glare in the direction of the other men who immediately shook their heads and donned expressions of complete innocence.</p><p>\u201cI need to put my shoes on,\u201d Josie grumbled.</p><p>Ash eased her down on the couch and then gently slipped her heels back on her feet. There was something extremely decadent about having a man put her shoes back on. His hands were warm and soothing against her skin. He squeezed one foot before stepping back to offer his hand to help her up.</p><p>She rose, experimentally testing her legs. She hadn\u2019t worn the shoes for most of the drinkfest and the last thing she wanted to do was face-plant now that she had them on.</p><p>She was shaky, but Ash firmly grasped her elbow before pulling her into his side. She sighed and melted against him, savoring the heat and scent of this gorgeous male.</p><p>\u201cThanks for looking after them,\u201d Ash said to Brandon as they walked toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about me,\u201d Jace sputtered. \u201cJust remember, it\u2019s your turn next time.\u201d</p><p>Ash grinned. \u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Ash started toward the door, holding Josie tight against his side. She stumbled a bit and he slowed his pace, matching it to her unsteady one. She was melted against him, so soft and sweet that he wished they weren\u2019t so damn far from his apartment. He wanted nothing more than to strip her out of that dress and fuck her in those shoes until they both passed out.</p><p>Gabe and Jace had definitely not lied. He was insanely jealous of them for having experienced this before. But now he had Josie. Josie was a part of his circle of friends, just like he\u2019d wanted. He looked forward with immense satisfaction, secure in the knowledge that from now on, he would have this.</p><p>Other guys might bitch about girls\u2019 night out. Some didn\u2019t like it when their women went out without them. Hell, if they had this to look forward to? There\u2019d be an instant run on sexy dresses and sparkly fuck-me shoes.</p><p>He grinned again as he led Josie toward the ramp leading down to the dance floor. Brandon appeared with another bouncer, flanking Ash and providing a protective barrier so they weren\u2019t jostled by the other club goers.</p><p>When they got outside, he directed Josie toward the waiting car and helped her inside. When he slid into the backseat, Josie was already indelicately sprawled all over the seat, her legs extending sideways. One of her shoes dangled precariously from her foot, and he slid it back on, cupping her ankle as he did.</p><p>She opened her eyes and bestowed a goofy, sweet smile on him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>He laughed and leaned over to kiss her nose. She was so damn cute. And all his.</p><p>\u201cHi yourself. Have fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she breathed out. \u201cYou were right. Mia and Bethany are the bomb. So are the rest of their friends.\u201d She frowned a minute and Ash looked curiously at her, seeking the source of that frown. \u201cCaro is moving away though. That makes Mia sad. Caro and Brandon are getting married and moving to Vegas. But it\u2019s okay. She\u2019ll still have Bethany. And me,\u201d she said, pointing to her chest.</p><p>Ash chuckled. \u201cYeah, baby. She\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Brittany!\u201d Josie said, brightening. \u201cShe had fun, Ash. She was sad because she didn\u2019t have a guy to enjoy fucking her drunk, but then she hooked up with Kai.\u201d</p><p>Ash frowned. \u201cNot sure I like the idea of her picking up some stranger in a club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s okay,\u201d Josie said slowly. \u201cHe seems really intense. But in a good way, you know? Like you.\u201d</p><p>Ash shook his head. \u201cIf he\u2019s like me, then I know I don\u2019t want my baby sister having a one-night stand with him.\u201d</p><p>Josie frowned again. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a one-night stand, Ash. He looked so . . . serious. Like he wanted to eat her up. He made me all shivery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ash scowled at that. \u201cHe made you shivery? What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cS\u2019okay. You know I only want you. But he\u2019s hot. And he thinks Brittany is hot. I\u2019m happy for her.\u201d</p><p>Ash sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of whether we\u2019re happy for her or not. I\u2019ll have to do some checking on this guy. See if he\u2019s on the level.\u201d</p><p>But then what could Ash say about being on the level? It made him a flaming hypocrite. He\u2019d done some not-so-great things. He didn\u2019t regret them, but they were there. He just wasn\u2019t sure whether he wanted his sister involved with a man steeped in gray. He knew his intentions were good. But Kai Wellington?</p><p>But enough of Brittany and Kai. He\u2019d get a call later as Kai had promised or Ash would send someone out to check on Brittany. And then tomorrow he\u2019d do some looking into Kai Wellington\u2019s background and see if he had any skeletons that would make him unsuitable for Brittany.</p><p>Right now he had a really drunk, really cute, sexy-as-hell woman he was dying to get home and out of that dress.</p><p>\u201cHave to say, baby. That dress and those shoes are you.\u201d</p><p>She sent him another dazzling smile, teeth flashing, a dimple forming in her cheek. \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell yeah I like,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019ll like them a lot better when I get you home and out of them.\u201d</p><p>Her nose bunched up and she frowned. \u201cBut not the shoes, Ash. Mia and Bethany said they always get fucked with the shoes on. We can\u2019t mess the system up. It\u2019s the girls\u2019 night out creed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh yeah, baby. The shoes definitely stay on.\u201d</p><p>When they pulled up to his apartment building, he got out and then reached in to help Josie out. After he was sure she had her legs underneath her and wouldn\u2019t take a header, he guided her toward the door, his arm securely around her.</p><p>On the elevator ride up, she put a hasty hand to her stomach and turned green as the elevator rose.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cDeep breaths, baby. Can\u2019t have you getting sick on me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cThe elevator just made me a little queasy.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened into his apartment and he helped her out, immediately heading toward the bedroom. His cell phone rang, and he glanced down to see an unfamiliar number. Knowing it could be Wellington calling about Brittany, he kept hold of Josie with one hand and answered with the other.</p><p>\u201cAsh McIntyre,\u201d he said</p><p>\u201cThis is Kai Wellington. Brittany is home and safe. You don\u2019t have to worry, Mr. McIntyre. Your sister is in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ash murmured. \u201cAppreciate the call.\u201d</p><p>They rang off and Ash made a mental note to make sure all was well with his sister the next day. Then he turned his attention to Josie, easing her onto the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, darling, we\u2019re home and you\u2019re in charge of the girls\u2019 night out seduction. What do you want your man to do?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glowed, almost neon in the faint light of the bedside lamp. Her lips parted and he almost let out a groan. God, but the woman was going to drive him insane.</p><p>\u201cFirst you have to tear off my dress. Then you have to fuck me long and hard.\u201d</p> <p>She looked so hopeful that he chuckled. \u201cAnything you want, baby. Don\u2019t ever let it be said I disappointed my girl.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, letting out a blissful sigh. \u201cI like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018my girl.\u2019 It sounds so sweet and sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my girl,\u201d he said, letting his voice go deep and low.</p><p>She held up her arms. \u201cThen tear off your girl\u2019s dress and fuck her until she passes out.\u201d</p><p>He laughed but moved in, pulling her to her feet. \u201cThat I can do, love.\u201d</p><p>She sighed again, teetered unsteadily before regaining her balance. \u201cI love all the things you call me. They\u2019re so nice.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, turning her around to unzip the dress. He let it fall to her feet and then helped her disentangle her shoes from the material. He sucked in his breath when his gaze traveled back up her body.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhere did you get the lingerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had it,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cMichael never saw it so don\u2019t worry. You\u2019re the only man who\u2019s seen me in it. I was saving it for a special occasion. I\u2019d say this qualifies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. It definitely qualifies.\u201d</p><p>She turned, leaning into him, her eyes big, and she whispered as though she were imparting a huge secret. \u201cIt has a slit in the bottoms. You don\u2019t even have to take them off to fuck me.\u201d</p><p>His body shook and he cupped her chin, leaning down to fuse his mouth to hers. She tasted of tequila and something fruity. Her tongue, hot and wild, met his in a clash. He sucked it deep, wanting to devour her whole.</p><p>She whimpered against his mouth. She kissed him lustily, her body writhing against his in need. Already he could sense that she was precariously close to her release. It wouldn\u2019t take much at all to tilt her over.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want it done so soon. If she came now, she might very well pass out in a sated alcohol-coma. He\u2019d looked forward to this for too long to have it all over in five minutes.</p><p>\u201cGoing to fuck you hard, baby,\u201d he said, purposely inflecting an edge of steel into his voice. She shivered against him just as he knew she would. \u201cYour mouth, your pussy and your ass. Going to have them all before it\u2019s over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh.\u201d</p><p>His name came out in a needy wail that had him grinning. Oh yeah, she was hot and worked up. Her entire body was flushed with heat. She was rubbing her body against his like a cat in heat.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees,\u201d he ordered brusquely.</p><p>He held onto her as she slid down his body and perched on her knees. He grabbed a pillow and tucked it underneath her before he finally let go of her. He stood a moment making certain she wouldn\u2019t pitch over and then he stepped back, unzipping his fly.</p><p>His cock surged into his hand, protesting the fact that his hand was wrapped around it and not her mouth. He pushed his free hand into her hair, pulling her roughly forward as he pressed his dick to her lips.</p><p>She opened around him with a breathy sigh that sent tingles racing down his spine. His balls drew up tight, aching as his erection slid over her hot tongue. She closed her mouth around him, sucking him deep. He let out a harsh groan, thrusting all the way to the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cFucking beautiful,\u201d he rasped out.</p><p>The wet sucking sounds she made were loud and erotic in his ears. Each time he pulled back, he met resistance as she attempted to suck him back. Her cheeks hollowed with each pull and then puffed out when he thrust forward again.</p><p>He loved the sight of his cock sliding through her lips and then retreating, wet with her saliva. She made a smacking sound that damn near had him coming on the spot. For several long moments, he enjoyed the feel of her tongue sliding over the underside of his cock. Then she circled the tip, teasing the sensitive head when he pulled out.</p><p>No way he was going to last if this kept up. Reluctant to leave the sweetness of her mouth, he withdrew and pulled her to her feet. Her eyes were glazed, a mixture of the alcohol and intense desire. They glowed, warm and bright, full of the sweet he associated with her.</p><p>He laid her back on the bed, pulling at her bra, wanting to feast on her breasts. He leaned over her, between her splayed thighs and ran his tongue over the swell before capturing her nipple and sucking it strongly between his teeth. Then he nibbled a path up to her neck, devouring the supple flesh before tugging at her earlobe, nipping with just enough bite to make her cry out. He licked the shell, sliding his tongue over the contours of her ear before dropping down again to suck at the lobe.</p><p>\u201cA-ash,\u201d she wailed, drawing his name into two syllables. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea, baby. Want you so worked up and crazy that you take me in your ass without any effort.\u201d</p><p>She shivered uncontrollably, her body arching helplessly into his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already there,\u201d she panted. \u201cI reached the crazy point about two minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He took his time, licking and devouring her nipples until they were red and straining into rigid peaks. Then he let his mouth roam lower, kissing the softness of her belly, and then lower still, nuzzling through the slit in her panties and into her velvety, plush folds. He licked over her clit, making sure he didn\u2019t spend too much time there or she\u2019d come. He sucked and kissed his way lower until his tongue found her entrance, sliding inside just like his dick would soon do.</p><p>\u201cNever get enough of you,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cYou taste so sweet. Addicting.\u201d</p><p>He continued his sensual assault on her most intimate flesh, until she was shamelessly begging him to end it. She was bucking upward, her motions frantic and needy. He grasped her hips, holding her in place as he continued fucking her with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cAsh! I\u2019m going to come!\u201d</p><p>He drew away, leaving her dangling on the edge. He stood there a long moment, his breaths coming just as harshly as hers. Then he positioned himself between her legs, pulling her ankles up so he could grasp the heels of her shoes.</p><p>Her eyes widened, excitement bursting in the aquamarine depths. He pushed her legs even farther up until they were doubled against her body, her knees spread wide. He didn\u2019t wait. Didn\u2019t prolong the agony. Making sure the slit in her panties was parted, he pushed hard and deep on the first thrust, instantly filling her to the hilt.</p><p>She let out a cry. Her pussy swallowed him up in a heated rush that had him baring his teeth as he fought to maintain control. He knew he couldn\u2019t do this long so he thrust rapidly, working them both into a frenzy. Deep. Hard. Just as he\u2019d soon do in her ass.</p><p>When he felt her quiver more urgently around him, he went still, buried balls-deep inside her. He sucked in steadying breaths, closing his eyes as he got it together. Then he withdrew, still holding on to her heels with both hands.</p><p>He let one go, hastily tearing away the silky panties he\u2019d just fucked her in. He wanted her ass, and as sexy as the lingerie was, there was only one slit that gave him access to her pussy. He slid his hand underneath her now bare ass, pushing upward so her ass was presented. Her eyes widened when she realized he meant to take her this way. Usually when he fucked her ass, she was on her hands and knees. But this way, she was a lot more vulnerable. Completely open to him, her legs hiked high in the air, her ass curved upward just ready for him to dive in.</p><p>He guided his cock to her ass, taking only a moment to reach for the lubricant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not using much this time, baby. Just enough to get inside you. I want you to feel it. Feel me pushing inside.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hiccupped over her lips. She licked them in anticipation and he damn near lost it on the spot. His jaw clenched, he hastily applied lubricant to his straining erection and then tossed the tube aside as he positioned himself. The minute he lodged the head against her opening, he removed his hand and wrapped it around her heel so both hands were holding her shoes, spreading her wide for his invasion.</p><p>He pushed in, not hesitating. She opened for him, her eyes growing even wider as she stretched to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby,\u201d he said in an approving tone. \u201cLet me in. I\u2019m going to fuck you hard until we both come. I want you to use your hand because I\u2019m going to be holding your shoes the entire time I\u2019m fucking you. But don\u2019t come until I tell you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d she said in a dreamy voice.</p><p>She slipped one hand between her thighs and over her clit, emitting a moan when she stroked.</p><p>Using that moment of inattention, when she was focused on her own pleasure, he surged forward, opening her in one ruthless thrust. She bucked upward, her cry splintering the air.</p><p>He was balls-deep, pressed against her, straining to get deeper still.</p><p>\u201cOh hell,\u201d he groaned. \u201cNot going to last long, baby. You need to get there because I\u2019m going to go hard and I\u2019m not stopping until I come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m there,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, Ash. I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>Needing no further encouragement, he began to thrust hard into her. His thighs slapped against her ass, jiggling her entire body. She closed her eyes and arched her neck upward as he began the race to completion.</p><p>She came first, her sharp cry washing over him, urging him on to his own orgasm. He began coming, jet after jet of his semen shooting deep inside her body, easing his way. Her fingers worked furiously over her clit as he rammed harder and deeper. Then she let her hand fall away, her chest heaving, eyes wild and unfocused.</p><p>He lunged into her one last time and held himself deep as he finished emptying himself into her body. Then he lowered himself onto her, carefully letting her heels go and allowing her legs to fall limply onto the bed.</p><p>They were both struggling to catch their breath, to suck in enough air into their burning lungs. He closed his eyes, gathering her tightly against him, holding her close so he felt the beat of her heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had never been like this. Never before. Only with Josie. His heart was so full, it felt near to bursting. So much he wanted to say. That he wanted to tell her.</p><p>Her fingers stroked through his hair, caressing gently before they fell away, her body going lax beneath him. He picked up his head, staring down at her, a broad smile curving his lips upward.</p><p>She was out cold.</p><p>Chuckling, he gently extricated himself from her body and then he went into the bathroom, returning with a warm cloth to clean her up. After ensuring she was clean and comfortable, he pulled her heels off, then rid himself of the rest of his clothing before picking her up and positioning her on the bed. He crawled in beside her, reaching to turn off the lamp.</p> <p>The room was doused in darkness and he pulled her close, into the shelter of his body. He stroked her body, enjoying the feel of her warm and sated next to him.</p><p>Yeah, girls\u2019 night out definitely needed to be a regular event. There wasn\u2019t anything better than having a gorgeous, very drunk, cute-as-hell woman come home to him wanting nothing more than to be fucked in killer heels.</p><p>He made a mental note to go and buy her a dozen pairs of sexy, sparkly heels. And while he was at it, he\u2019d definitely be buying more of the naughty lingerie, complete with access slits.</p><p>Chapter twenty-seven</p><p>\u201cIs Brittany coming?\u201d Mia asked when Josie slid into the booth next to Bethany.</p> <p>\u201cShe texted right when I was leaving the apartment and said she\u2019d meet us here,\u201d Josie replied. \u201cI\u2019d think she\u2019d be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything about her night?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>Josie grimaced and shook her head. \u201cNothing. She said she\u2019d fill us in when she got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least she\u2019s off today and didn\u2019t have to deal with a hangover at work,\u201d Mia said. \u201cThose shots kicked my ass! Gabe was sweet and babied me before he left for work, but I went back to bed and stayed there until it was time to meet up for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Bethany snickered. \u201cYeah, Jace was sweet too. Amazing the gratitude they show for drunk sex.\u201d</p><p>Josie laughed. \u201cAsh brought me coffee and what he called a hangover cure. I don\u2019t even know what it was. Several pills. But it did the trick. After a shower, I actually felt human again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh look, there\u2019s Brittany now,\u201d Bethany said, raising her hand to wave.</p><p>Brittany navigated the busy restaurant and then slid into the booth next to Mia.</p><p>\u201cHey, gang,\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>\u201cNow there is the face of a girl who got some,\u201d Mia said dryly.</p><p>Brittany blushed bright red, but her eyes were glowing.</p><p>\u201cSpill!\u201d Josie demanded. \u201cWe\u2019re dying to hear all about Kai Wellington.\u201d</p><p>Brittany laughed. \u201cOh my gosh, you guys. He is amazing. I don\u2019t even have words. He has this dark, mysterious thing going on with him. He doesn\u2019t say a whole lot, but when he talks, you just listen, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the good part,\u201d Mia said impatiently. \u201cWhat\u2019s he like in bed?\u201d</p> <p>Everyone burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cUhm, well, we didn\u2019t have sex last night,\u201d Brittany hedged. \u201cHe brought me to my apartment, tucked me into bed. I don\u2019t remember anything after that. But this morning, I woke up and he was in bed next to me. He\u2019d stripped down to his boxers, and let me just say, that man is built! I was drooling all over my pillowcase, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>Josie chuckled at Brittany\u2019s animated description.</p><p>\u201cHe was sooo sweet too! He made me breakfast in bed then he took me into the bathroom to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took you into the bathroom?\u201d Bethany asked. \u201cAs in got in the shower with you?\u201d</p><p>Brittany blushed. \u201cYeah. It was sweet. But also hot. I mean all that gorgeous naked male flesh. I thought I was going to have a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened then?\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cAfter the shower, we went back to bed, and then we had sex.\u201d</p><p>Brittany wore a smug, satisfied smile. Yeah, the sex must have been really good judging by her expression.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Bethany demanded. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t leave us hanging! He just looked like he\u2019d be a beast in bed. So dark and brooding. A lot like Jace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay stop,\u201d Mia said with a shudder. \u201cWe can talk about hotness all we want, but can we please leave Jace out of it?\u201d</p><p>Josie pulled a face. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun, Mia. Can\u2019t you forget he\u2019s your brother just for a little while?\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head adamantly.</p><p>Brittany laughed and then leaned back in the booth, sighing a dreamy sigh that told Josie she was in deep already. But then who was she to judge? It hadn\u2019t taken any longer for Ash to completely reel her in. She\u2019d been a goner the minute he\u2019d dragged her out of her apartment. If she was completely honest, she\u2019d admit that she\u2019d been a goner that very first day in the park. It had just taken her longer to realize that.</p><p>\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Brittany said. \u201cAnd yes, total beast in bed. So demanding and possessive.\u201d She shivered, chill bumps breaking out over her skin. Then her expression dimmed and her lips twisted into a grimace. \u201cNothing at all like my first husband. Ugh. Not even in the same universe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget him,\u201d Josie ordered. \u201cHe\u2019s in the past. Move on. Now tell us more.\u201d</p><p>The others burst into laughter again. They were drawing attention from the other tables, but Josie didn\u2019t care. Normally she\u2019d be appalled over being the focus in a public setting, but she already loved these girls and she was having fun.</p><p>\u201cI orgasmed three times,\u201d Brittany said in a loud whisper. \u201cThree times! That\u2019s three more times than I ever came with my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d Bethany said, a broad smile on her face. \u201cSo what now? Was it a one-night thing? Did he get your number? Is he going to call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne question at a time, Bethany,\u201d Mia scolded. \u201cShe can\u2019t keep up! But yes, Brittany, tell us everything.\u201d</p><p>Brittany smiled and Josie saw just how beautiful she was. Her eyes shone and the shadows that had haunted them were gone. She seemed more sure of herself. She seemed . . . happy.</p><p>\u201cOh, he got my number. Made me program all his numbers into my cell. Wanted to know what I was doing today. Where I was going and with whom. Then he told me that this was not a one-night stand and that I better get it out of my head now if that\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Mia whispered. \u201cThat sounds intense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even ask if I wanted to see him again,\u201d Brittany continued, a goofy grin plastered on her face. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d be at my apartment this evening to take me to dinner and that I was staying over in his hotel.\u201d</p><p>Josie frowned. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t have an apartment here?\u201d</p><p>Brittany shook her head. \u201cNo. He\u2019s been in Vegas getting the new club ready to open. Now that it is, he\u2019s planning to spend a lot of his time out there, or at least for the first few months. He travels a lot, going between his clubs, so he doesn\u2019t maintain a permanent residence anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will he be here then?\u201d Bethany asked, her lips turning down into a frown that mirrored Josie\u2019s own.</p><p>Brittany shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess we\u2019ll have to take it one day at a time and see what happens. Who knows? Maybe I\u2019m just an itch he wants to scratch while he\u2019s in town. I know better than to read more into the situation. Good way to get my hopes crushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could scratch his itch with me,\u201d Mia muttered.</p><p>Bethany died laughing. \u201cI\u2019m so telling Gabe you said that.\u201d</p><p>Mia glared at her. \u201cNo you won\u2019t. Girlfriends\u2019 code. What\u2019s discussed with girlfriends stays with girlfriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Bethany agreed. \u201cBut it\u2019s fun to tease you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve got more than I can handle with Gabe. I can look. Nothing\u2019s wrong with my eyes\u2014or my hormones for that matter. But I have no desire to touch another man,\u201d she said cheekily.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible to fall in love at first sight?\u201d Brittany asked wistfully. \u201cI\u2019m thirty years old and I\u2019ve never been in love. I certainly wasn\u2019t in love with my husband. I\u2019m worried that Kai just overwhelmed me and that I latched on to him because he was so attracted to me. I just wonder if I would have responded to any guy the way I responded to Kai.\u201d</p><p>Josie reached over to squeeze Brittany\u2019s hand. \u201cAbsolutely it is possible. It happens more than you\u2019d think. And you need to stop beating yourself up over your first marriage. Shit happens. But you got out. Now it\u2019s time to move on and give yourself a chance at happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have said it better myself,\u201d Bethany said. \u201cAnd Jace swears that he fell for me the first time he laid eyes on me. And from what you say, it certainly seems that Kai fell pretty hard himself.\u201d</p><p>Mia slung an arm around Brittany\u2019s shoulders. \u201cGo for it, girlfriend. Have a great time. If it works out, great. But if it doesn\u2019t? You\u2019ll have us to fall back on. Not to mention Ash and the guys will beat the crap out of Kai if he fucks you over.\u201d</p><p>Bethany grinned her agreement. Even Brittany\u2019s eyes sparkled with amusement. Josie didn\u2019t say anything since she well knew that Ash would do just that. Mia\u2019s words were just that. Words. But Ash wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go after someone for hurting someone he cared about. He\u2019d already proven that much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Brittany said. \u201cI should just go with it. Have a good time. I\u2019m reading too much into it. He probably just wants some action while he\u2019s here. And since he\u2019s the bomb in bed that\u2019s not a hardship. I just hope I don\u2019t get all whiny when he leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he won\u2019t,\u201d Josie said with a shrug. \u201cHe looked pretty into you last night and from what you\u2019ve said about him, this doesn\u2019t look like just a pussy call for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPussy call!\u201d Mia cracked up. \u201cI\u2019m so going to steal that from you. That\u2019s hilarious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d Bethany agreed. \u201cI mean that\u2019s all I thought I was to Jace that first night. I never dreamed he\u2019d turn the city over looking for me! And let\u2019s just say once he found me that was it. Not that we didn\u2019t have issues. But he was in it for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what about you and Ash?\u201d Brittany asked, turning the attention to Josie. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen my brother this intense over a woman. Not that we spent a lot of time together, mind you, but I would have known if he\u2019d been with the same woman for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong time!\u201d Josie exclaimed with a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve only been together like two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a goner,\u201d Mia said solemnly. \u201cTrust me, I know. He and Jace always fucked the same women, and it wasn\u2019t always pretty. I met their last piece of ass.\u201d She winced and cleared her throat. \u201cNot you, Bethany. Before you. Ah shit, but there goes my foot into my mouth again.\u201d</p><p>Bethany\u2019s cheeks turned pink, but Josie laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t Bethany. It\u2019s okay. Really. I love that we can talk about it and not let it be all awkward between us. Really it\u2019s better that way.\u201d</p><p>Brittany looked thoroughly confused but they didn\u2019t fill her in.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, as I was saying,\u201d Mia said. \u201cBefore I inserted the foot. Was that I met up with Jace and Ash\u2019s last chick. They took me out to eat and I swear she followed us there. No way she just happened to be in the same place we were. Totally wasn\u2019t her style if you know what I mean. We were in a pub munching down on nachos and other yummy lowbrow stuff. And she marches up like a woman scorned and made a scene. Insulted me in the process because she assumed I was her replacement.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered delicately as she said the last.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t go over too well, huh,\u201d Bethany said with a grin.</p><p>Mia winced. \u201cNo. Uh, let\u2019s just say she didn\u2019t take the \u2018it\u2019s the end\u2019 message very well. And my point in bringing this up was that Jace and Ash were banging the same chicks for a long time. And then suddenly Jace met Bethany and that was over. And then Ash met you and it\u2019s obvious that his banging random chicks is over too. I\u2019ve been around him a lot of years, and he never hung on to the same woman for as long as he\u2019s been with you, Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to know that,\u201d Josie murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you in love with him?\u201d Brittany asked. \u201cShould I be asking what your intentions toward my brother are?\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed and Josie held up her hands. \u201cI was gentle last night. Promise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d Mia said pointedly.</p><p>Josie sighed. \u201cYes, I\u2019m in love with him. I haven\u2019t told him. I wanted to make sure I told him at the right time. It sounds so stupid, but I don\u2019t want to scream it out when we\u2019re having sex or caught up in the moment, nor do I want to tell him when he\u2019s doing something really sweet for me because I want him to know I mean it and that I\u2019m not just spouting something in the heat of the moment.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHas he told you he loves you?\u201d Bethany asked softly.</p><p>Josie grimaced. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Mia said resolutely. \u201cNo doubt in my mind. Holy hell, the way he looks at you? Totally makes me shiver.\u201d</p><p>Brittany nodded her agreement. \u201cNot to mention the way he went off on Mom when she made that scene at the restaurant and said that crap about you. I thought he was going to choke her. I wouldn\u2019t have tried to stop him either!\u201d</p> <p>They all laughed again and then were interrupted by the waiter bringing their orders. For the next several minutes they shoveled food in and laughed and talked about the guys, sex and well, more sex.</p><p>Josie couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d had a better time. Everything was so . . . perfect. She had Ash, and really, if that\u2019s all she had, she\u2019d be one happy bitch. But now she also had really good girlfriends. She really liked them. They were genuine, had huge hearts and there wasn\u2019t a fake bone in their bodies.</p><p>What more could she ask for? She was now a successful artist\u2014her work was actually in demand! So what if it was only one person. It only took one. Whoever it was had loved her work enough to scoop everything of hers up as soon as she brought it in. And now she had great friends and a man she adored. And she was pretty sure he adored her too.</p><p>Maybe they hadn\u2019t said the words yet, but Josie was confident that Ash was the one. The words would come. He\u2019d already talked about their future like it was a done deal. He\u2019d even told her she\u2019d get the rock! He\u2019d even mentioned their children! No man who wasn\u2019t thinking long term talked about engagement rings and babies.</p><p>She sat back with a sigh, indulging in a glass of wine with the others. She had someone to drive her home. Why not?</p> <p>An hour later, the girls said their good-byes and got into their respective cars to head home. Josie offered Brittany a ride since she\u2019d walked to the restaurant and the two chatted all the way to Brittany\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cToday was fun,\u201d Brittany said when they pulled to the front of her building. \u201cThanks so much for inviting me today and last night, Josie. I really enjoyed myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Josie said with a warm smile. \u201cI had fun too. We absolutely have to make this a regular event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Brittany said as she climbed out of the car.</p><p>\u201cAnd keep me posted on Kai!\u201d Josie yelled after her.</p><p>Brittany turned and gave her a thumbs-up and an exaggerated smile.</p> <p>Josie settled into the backseat and texted Ash on her way back to the apartment. She\u2019d told him she was having lunch with the girls and he\u2019d told her to have fun and let him know when she was headed back. Maybe he\u2019d even get to come home early from work.</p><p>Anticipation licked up her spine as they drove through the city. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been so . . . happy. So carefree and utterly satisfied with the direction of her life.</p><p>When they arrived at Ash\u2019s apartment building, she got out and thanked the driver. As she headed inside, the doorman, who was on the phone, put his hand over the receiver and called from across the lobby.</p><p>\u201cMiss Carlysle, a package came for you while you were out. It\u2019s on my desk. Shall I have it brought up to the apartment?\u201d</p><p>Josie smiled. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s small, right? I\u2019ll take it up with me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d ordered some new brushes and knew they were coming in today.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the office. Give me just a sec and I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no need,\u201d she called. \u201cFinish your call. I\u2019ll just get it and bring it up with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Carlysle!\u201d he called after her.</p><p>She pushed inside the small office that housed deliveries and glanced at the desk where a small package was sitting. With a smile, she went over and tucked it underneath her arm. When she turned to go back out, her gaze caught on several covered paintings resting against the far wall.</p><p>She frowned because one of them wasn\u2019t fully covered and it looked an awful lot like hers. But what would they be doing here of all places?</p><p>She hurried over, unrepentant about snooping. She pulled back the covering and gasped. They were her paintings!</p><p>Chapter twenty-eight</p><p>Josie quickly rummaged through the others, her stomach knotting as she took in every single painting she\u2019d sold in Mr. Downing\u2019s art gallery.</p><p>What on earth?</p><p>She let the covering fall and stepped back, the knot in her stomach growing bigger. Oh no. No, no, no. It couldn\u2019t be. He wouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>But he had. The evidence was staring her right in the face.</p><p>\u201cMiss Carlysle, please. You shouldn\u2019t be in here,\u201d the doorman said from the door.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose I should,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>She pushed past him, ignoring his calls for her to stop. What on earth could he possibly say?</p><p>She shoved into the elevator, tears stinging her eyes. How could he have done it? She felt like the biggest fool on earth. She\u2019d never dreamed that Ash had been the one to buy all her paintings, but it shouldn\u2019t have surprised her. He\u2019d orchestrated every aspect of their relationship so far.</p><p>Desolation settled over her. She wasn\u2019t successful. She wasn\u2019t independent. Everything she had came from Ash. She was living off his money, in his apartment. Nothing had been bought with her money. Her earlier sensation of rightness, that she\u2019d found her place in the world, was gone with the discovery of those paintings.</p><p>She swept out of the elevator so agitated she couldn\u2019t even think straight. Her gaze settled on the boxes, most of which had already been unpacked. She walked right by them and sagged onto the couch, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>She was utterly humiliated. Every single time she\u2019d excitedly exclaimed to Ash over the success of her work came back to her in waves of embarrassment. And he\u2019d let her!</p><p>He\u2019d lied to her, something she wouldn\u2019t have imagined. No, he hadn\u2019t come out and denied buying the paintings, but then she hadn\u2019t asked. She\u2019d never dreamed that he\u2019d been behind it. His was a lie of omission. So huge, so monumental that she couldn\u2019t even fathom.</p><p>What else had he kept from her?</p><p>Tears burned her eyelids but she refused to give in to them. She also refused to believe she was overreacting. This wasn\u2019t something small. Her success had enabled her to say yes to Ash\u2019s demands. She\u2019d felt like she could agree because she felt capable of supporting herself. No way would she have gone blindly into a relationship with Ash with such a huge disparity between them. She\u2019d been willing and able to submit because she\u2019d been strong enough to come to him as an equal. Not that there\u2019d ever been true equality between them, but her success as an artist, having money in her bank account and the means to support herself, had been very important to her and it had evened the odds between them. At least in her mind.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t realized was just how unequal things were between them.</p><p>She was living in his apartment. All the money in her bank account was his. Not hers. Oh God, he\u2019d even paid her double. She should have questioned her good fortune. People didn\u2019t just walk into an art gallery and magnanimously offer to pay more than asking price for art.</p><p>She was so stupid. Na\u00efve. A complete and utter moron.</p><p>She\u2019d actually believed that someone had been awed by her work. She\u2019d believed she had real talent even though Mr. Downing had refused to display more of her art because it wasn\u2019t selling. Now she knew the truth.</p><p>She closed her eyes, devastated by her discovery. She\u2019d trusted him. Had kept no part of herself from him. And he\u2019d shit all over that gift.</p><p>All his words about cherishing her gift, about protecting it and appreciating it, meant nothing. He\u2019d made a gigantic fool of her. God, she\u2019d even told the others about the sale of her artwork. She\u2019d been so proud. So excited. Did they all know that Ash was her benefactor?</p><p>Ash apparently operated on a need-to-know basis. What else had he decided she didn\u2019t need to know?</p><p>She picked her head up, grief welling in her chest until she couldn\u2019t breathe. She sucked in ragged breaths, trying to assuage the burning in her chest. But nothing worked.</p><p>She loved him. She\u2019d thought he loved her.</p><p>She rubbed at her temples, weariness assailing her. What was she supposed to do?</p><p>She glanced toward the boxes, anger replacing some of her devastation. The hell she\u2019d just stay here and pretend that she didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done. How could she? She was living a complete lie. And now she was faced with the knowledge that she wasn\u2019t successful. There was no demand for her work. And she\u2019d been lax with her jewelry design business ever since she\u2019d moved in with Ash. She\u2019d been too caught up in other things to design new pieces and put them up for sale. She\u2019d been comforted by the knowledge that she was selling her artwork as fast as she could get it to the gallery and those pieces made her far more money than her jewelry did. Or at least they had.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, she forced herself to her feet. To action. It wouldn\u2019t take long to repack her belongings. And really all she wanted was her art supplies and the clothing she\u2019d brought with her. Everything else belonged to Ash. They were things he bought for her and she wouldn\u2019t bring them with her.</p><p>Mechanically, she stuffed everything in the boxes, not taking the care she had when they\u2019d been packed before. After thirty minutes, they were full, her overnight bag filled with her toiletries and her clothing. She stood surveying the room, knowing it would take several trips to get all the stuff to her apartment. Thank God she hadn\u2019t terminated the lease and still had a place to live.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she pulled out her phone and Googled a local mover. After a phone call, and a hefty bill for a last-minute job, all she had to do was wait. Wait for the people who\u2019d remove all traces of her presence in Ash\u2019s apartment.</p><p>It hurt. She hurt. There wasn\u2019t a part of her heart or soul that wasn\u2019t sick. But how could she stay with a man who\u2019d so blithely manipulate her? He might not have ever physically hurt her as Michael had, but right now Josie would take that kind of pain over the gut-wrenching agony she was experiencing over his deception.</p><p>An hour later, the movers arrived and began taking the boxes down in the elevator to the waiting truck. Josie remained in the apartment until the last box went down. She silently urged them to hurry. She wanted no chance of Ash coming home from work while she was still moving out. He hadn\u2019t called yet, so she should have plenty of time.</p><p>By the time he made it home, she\u2019d be back in her apartment. And this time, she wouldn\u2019t be swayed by pretty words and hollow promises.</p><p>Damn him for making her love him. And damn him for pulling her into his world. She liked his friends. Loved Bethany and Mia and Brittany and all the others. But they were his friends. Loyal to him. She was accepted because of him. And now she\u2019d have nothing at all.</p><p>It was on her way down that she realized two things. One, she didn\u2019t have a ride to her apartment and Ash\u2019s apartment wasn\u2019t convenient to public transportation. She could take a cab, but she\u2019d have to have the doorman call for one and it could take a while. Especially at this time of day when all the taxi drivers went off duty.</p><p>The other thing she realized was that she needed to confront Ash. She couldn\u2019t just move out and hide in her apartment. Not that she owed him anything, but she didn\u2019t want to go home, dreading the moment when he realized she was gone and the inevitable confrontation that would ensue. It would be better if she went to his office, said her piece and made it clear they were over. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about him showing up at her apartment.</p><p>For that, she would use Ash\u2019s driver. After all, he\u2019d have to pick up Ash from work anyway. A quick check of her watch told her the driver would likely still be here. If he wasn\u2019t, she\u2019d just take a cab to Ash\u2019s building, even if it meant waiting. From his office, she\u2019d just take the subway.</p><p>She rummaged for her phone in the big bag she\u2019d thrown over her shoulder. After waving off the movers and providing the keys to her apartment so they could start unloading, she called Ash\u2019s driver, who as luck would have it, was just a block away.</p><p>A few minutes later, she was on her way to Ash\u2019s office building, silent tears trailing down her cheeks.</p><p>Chapter twenty-nine</p><p>Ash leaned his head back against his chair, still holding the phone to his ear as the conference call droned on and on and on.</p><p>Christ, all he wanted was to get the fuck off the phone so he could head home to Josie. She\u2019d had lunch with the girls today and he was looking forward to hearing about her day. Afterward he\u2019d take her to dinner. Somewhere quiet and intimate. They\u2019d talk some more and then he\u2019d take her home and make love to her until they both dropped from exhaustion.</p><p>A knock sounded at his door and Eleanor stuck her head in. Ash frowned over the interruption, but then, if she\u2019d poked her head in, it must be important. She was too efficient not to know he was on an important call. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Temporarily muting the call, he lowered the receiver and looked questioningly in Eleanor\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sir, I know you\u2019re busy but Miss Carlysle is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to realize Miss Carlysle was in fact Josie. He straightened, ending the call without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cJosie\u2019s here?\u201d he asked sharply. \u201cSend her in immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor disappeared and Ash was already on his feet striding toward the door to meet Josie when she came in. Josie hadn\u2019t been to his office before. Hell, he didn\u2019t even remember if he\u2019d told her where he worked.</p><p>A moment later, the door pushed open and Josie walked slowly in, her face pale, eyes swollen. Like she\u2019d been fucking crying.</p><p>He was in front of her in seconds, pulling her into his arms. She went stiff and rigid and utterly unyielding.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s upset you, Josie?\u201d</p><p>She pried herself away from him and walked by, toward the middle of his office where she just stood, back turned, her spine stiff.</p> <p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cJosie?\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond he reached for her, turning her to face him. What he saw in her face he didn\u2019t like one bit. Dread gripped him by the balls as he took in her lifeless eyes.</p><p>Josie always shined. That was just her. She could light up a room just by walking into it. She sparkled, had a gorgeous smile and her eyes were always bright and sunny. Like every other part of her.</p><p>But not today. She looked worn. Sad. She looked devastated.</p><p>When she pulled away from him again, his lips came together in a tight line.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said, Josie. When you and I are talking and especially if you\u2019re upset about something, we do not discuss it with a room between us. You\u2019re pushing me away, and that is not an option.\u201d</p> <p>When he would have pulled her to him, she put both arms out, effectively blocking him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get an option,\u201d she said tightly. \u201cWe\u2019re over, Ash. I\u2019ve moved my stuff back to my apartment.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even control his reaction. Of the hundred different things she could have said, he would have never imagined her saying this. What the ever-loving fuck?</p><p>\u201cThe hell we\u2019re over,\u201d he bit out. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on, Josie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the paintings,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He blew out his breath and ran a hand raggedly through his hair. \u201cNot the way I wanted you to find out, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess it wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said scornfully. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine you wanted me to find out at all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not moving out and calling it quits just because I didn\u2019t tell you I was the one who bought your paintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d she said in an icy tone that was just not her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you need to calm down and let me explain. We\u2019ll talk this out and then we\u2019ll move on. But I\u2019m not having this goddamn conversation in my fucking office and I\u2019m damn sure not having it with you four feet away from me and you building a fucking wall between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou lied to me, Ash. You lied. And I\u2019m supposed to discuss and move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lied to you,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that crap. You did lie and you know it. Moreover you made a gigantic fool out of me. All those times when I was so excited over selling those paintings. You let me talk about it with your friends. You let me feel like I\u2019d done something great. That I was able to support myself. That I had money. Options. A future. God, you really did a number on me, Ash. And every single part of it is and was a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he swore. \u201cJosie that is not what I intended at all.\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cDo you know why I didn\u2019t argue with you about moving in? Why I let you talk me into it so easily? Because I felt like I could. Because I had options. Because I didn\u2019t need you. But I wanted you. I thought I was self-sufficient. Able to be somewhat equal, although I\u2019ll never have all the money you do. But it was important to me to be able to contribute something to our relationship. Even if it was just a sense of self. Me having confidence. I was on top of the world, Ash. Because I felt like for once I had everything. A career. You. Really great friends. And none of it, none of it was real!\u201d</p><p>Every single one of her words sliced through him like a knife. Her face had grown even paler, her eyes more stricken. He hadn\u2019t thought about her sense of value, of self-worth. Of her feeling like she had options. Of her not having to depend solely on him, even if that\u2019s what he wanted. But damn it, neither had he ever wanted to hurt her. That wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d done it at all.</p><p>\u201cYou manipulated every aspect of our relationship,\u201d she said painfully. \u201cYou orchestrated every point. Every move was calculated and thought out. You played me like an instrument and I fell right into your lap. I should have known better when you blackmailed me into dinner. Hell, the fact that you had me followed, that you knew about me pawning my mother\u2019s jewelry. But I didn\u2019t pay attention. I didn\u2019t think those were huge warning signs, though it makes me a complete idiot for not recognizing them for what they were. You are so used to being God in your world that you thought nothing of playing God in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJosie, stop,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. I\u2019m sorry I hurt you. For God\u2019s sake, that\u2019s the last thing I ever wanted to do! We can work this out, baby.\u201d</p><p>She was already shaking her head, and fear curled in his belly, spreading to his chest and into his throat, grabbing him, squeezing until he could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Josie, I love you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and a tear slipped down her cheek. When she reopened them, both were shiny with moisture and there was such hopelessness reflected that his stomach bottomed out.</p><p>\u201cI would have given anything for those words,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019d even convinced myself that you did love me but just hadn\u2019t said the words yet. You have no idea how much I wanted to hear them from you. But now? How can I even believe you? You\u2019ve proven what lengths you\u2019ll go to in order to manipulate the circumstances so you get your desired outcome. So how can I believe that\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing now, trying to play on my emotions?\u201d</p><p>He was speechless. Completely and utterly speechless. He\u2019d never given those words to another damn woman in his life. And she thought he said them to manipulate her emotions?</p><p>Anger burned in his veins, sizzling until he was certain he\u2019d lose his grip. He turned to the side, panicked and frustrated because he had no idea what to say, what to do. She was breaking up with him and he\u2019d been planning forever with her.</p><p>Her hand shook as she lifted it to the collar she wore around her neck.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said hoarsely, turning fully back to her as she unfastened the clasp.</p><p>She let it fall into her hand and then she held it out to him, pressing it into his palm.</p><p>\u201cI moved everything out of your apartment,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI left the keys on your bar. Good-bye, Ash. You were the best\u2014and worst\u2014thing that ever happened to me.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand, trying to stop her because no way in hell was he going to let her just walk out that door.</p><p>\u201cWait just a goddamn minute, Josie. We\u2019re not finished. No way in fuck I\u2019m giving up that easy. We\u2019re worth fighting for. You\u2019re worth fighting for and I hope to fuck you think I\u2019m worth it no matter how upset you may be right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ash. I can\u2019t do this right now,\u201d she begged. Her eyes were filled with tears and more slipped rapidly down her cheeks. \u201cJust let me go. I\u2019m too upset to form a coherent argument and the last thing I want is to say things I\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>He closed the short distance between them, pulling her against his chest. He tilted her chin up with his fingers and stared down into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Josie. That\u2019s a fact. No manipulation. No hidden agenda. I. Love. You. Period.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and turned her face to the side. He cupped her cheek and thumbed away one of the silver trails.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me why?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy did you do it? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? Why hide it from me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMaybe I thought you\u2019d react just like you have and I didn\u2019t want that. I loved the paintings, Josie. It pisses me off that because you found out I bought them you think you have no talent and that no one wants your work. That\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>She tugged herself away from him and presented her back, her shoulders shaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too upset to have this conversation with you, Ash. Please, just let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking letting it go when you just told me you moved your shit out of our apartment. You honestly expect me to just say okay, have a nice life? Fuck that. The only nice life I want to have is with you.\u201d</p><p>She curled her arms around her waist, hugging herself. \u201cI\u2019m going back to my apartment. My stuff has already been moved. I can\u2019t stay. I promised the movers I\u2019d meet them there.\u201d</p><p>Panic clawed at his throat. Helplessness gripped him. She was actually walking away. Over those goddamn paintings. He knew it was more than that. He understood why she was pissed. He\u2019d never looked beyond the fact that he\u2019d bought them to see how it would make her feel once she discovered it was all a lie. He got that. But how the fuck was he supposed to make it up to her, to make her realize how much she had to offer, if she was sleeping in another bed in another part of the city?</p><p>She started toward the door, him staring after her, utterly paralyzed, his heart in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cJosie, stop. Please.\u201d</p><p>At the \u201cplease\u201d she stopped but didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, please,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Slowly she turned, her eyes awash with fresh tears. He cursed softly because he never wanted to be the reason for those tears.</p><p>\u201cSwear to me you\u2019ll think about it. And us,\u201d he said in a choked voice. \u201cI\u2019ll give you tonight, baby. But if you think I\u2019m going to give up and let you walk away then you don\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it, Ash. That\u2019s all I can promise. I have a lot to sort out in my head. You pulled the rug out from under me. I have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do from here. I knew when I entered this relationship with you that you promised to take care of me, to protect me, to provide for me. And I was okay with that because I didn\u2019t need you to. Can you possibly understand the difference? I didn\u2019t have to be with you. I wanted to be. If I\u2019d had no other choice, no place to live, no money, then how could you ever be certain I wasn\u2019t with you for your money? I never want that between us. It\u2019s important to me to be independent and able to provide for myself even if that\u2019s not what I end up doing. But I want that choice. I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and know that I have value. That I can support myself and make my own choices.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes because so much of what she said made sense. It\u2019s how he\u2019d feel in her situation too. And he\u2019d looked right past that. Never considered how it would make her feel for him to buy the paintings and hide that from her. He fucked up. And now he could lose her because of that fuck-up.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI do, baby. I\u2019ll give you tonight. But I don\u2019t have to fucking like it. And I\u2019m not giving up on us, so prepare yourself for that. No way in hell I\u2019m giving you up.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, her face still pale, her eyes still wounded. Then she turned and walked away, taking his heart and soul with her, leaving him standing there holding the collar she\u2019d taken from around her neck.</p><p>Chapter thirty</p><p>Josie spent a miserable night tossing and turning before she finally gave up and immersed herself in her painting. For the first time, the vibrant colors didn\u2019t come. There was nothing vivid about the scene she painted. It was dark, gray. There was a sadness to it that seeped onto the canvas without her realizing it was there.</p><p>At dawn, her shoulders sagged, stiff and sore from the hours she\u2019d spent on the painting. When she took it in, she winced. It was a clear image of her mood. Miserable.</p><p>She nearly splattered paint on it to ruin it but held back, her hands trembling before she finally affixed her trademark J in the lower right-hand corner.</p><p>It was honest. It was also very good. It was just different from any of her other work. Perhaps this would be something more along the lines of what others wanted. Maybe people didn\u2019t want bright, cheerful, sexy fun.</p><p>As she stared at the painting, the title came to her. Rain in Manhattan. Not particularly original, but it suited her mood, even if it was a perfect spring morning outside. The buildings in her painting were tall and gloomy, outlined by rain and overcast skies. She also realized that the building on the canvas was Ash\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed and rose, stretching her stiff muscles. She stumbled into the kitchen to make herself coffee, thankful that she still had an old canister in the cabinet. She would have to restock her apartment. All of the perishables had been thrown out when she\u2019d moved and only a few items remained. One of them being the coffee. She needed to bypass a mug and go straight for an IV infusion of caffeine.</p><p>Holding the steaming cup in her hand, she went back into the living room and opened her blinds to let the early morning light in. Outside, the streets were quiet, only just now starting to come alive with the traffic of the day.</p><p>She\u2019d always loved her apartment. The rent for the brownstone was costing her a mint, though, and the realization hit her that she would have to move somewhere cheaper. There had been no unexpected windfall. No customer who loved her work and would buy whatever she brought in.</p><p>She needed to make a trip to the art gallery and speak to Mr. Downing. Make it clear that if she were to continue displaying her work there that he couldn\u2019t sell it to Ash. He probably wouldn\u2019t allow her to bring in anything else since she was refusing what had to be his best customer. How could she trust that Ash wouldn\u2019t simply buy it under a different name, one she\u2019d never be able to trace back to him?</p> <p>Yes, she would have to move, reorder her priorities and think about her options. She needed to create more jewelry and put it up for sale on her site. The site had languished since she\u2019d moved in with Ash, all her focus going into her art. But she needed the money from the sale of her jewelry. When she produced regularly, she sold regularly. Her art would have to take a temporary backseat until she built up enough reserves to give her time to think about a new direction in her artwork.</p><p>Mr. Downing had said she lacked vision and focus. That she was too scattered and all over the board. Evidently he was right. But what would her new focus be? If people didn\u2019t like the cheerful, colorful works she created then she had to rethink her vision.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to come up with more of the depressing, gloomy paintings that she\u2019d done this morning. She wouldn\u2019t get over Ash in a day, a week or even a month. She loved him. She\u2019d fallen hard and fast without a safety net. The old adage about playing with fire came to mind. She\u2019d definitely played, throwing caution to the wind, and as a result she\u2019d been burnt.</p><p>Shaking her head, she finished off her coffee and set the mug on the coffee table. She needed to get back to work, perhaps draw a companion piece for the Rain in Manhattan painting. She could then take both to Mr. Downing and see if he thought they\u2019d sell better than her previous offerings. If not? Plan B. Whatever that was.</p><p>She eyed her cell phone, which she\u2019d put on silent, debated whether she should check for calls or messages. Then she sighed. No one would be calling her. Except maybe Ash, and she didn\u2019t want to think about him right now. Resisting the temptation to look at her messages\u2014if there were any\u2014she went back to work, driven to complete another piece.</p> <p>Her paintings usually took days. She tweaked endlessly, frowning over every little detail. But today she put paint to canvas and didn\u2019t stop until it was done. So what if it was imperfect? It wasn\u2019t like all that attention to detail had gotten her very far before.</p><p>She shook her head. God, she sounded like a whiny, feeling-sorry-for-herself nitwit. This wasn\u2019t her and she wasn\u2019t going to let it be her. She wasn\u2019t one to give up. She\u2019d never given up her dream. Her mother had made her swear that she wouldn\u2019t. No way in hell she was going to let herself or her mother down.</p><p>For hours she worked steadily, the sun rising higher and more sunlight shining through her window. At one point she closed her blinds because she felt too exposed to the passersby on the sidewalk. She\u2019d noticed a couple of guys walking back and forth on the street outside, seeming like they were trying to get a glimpse of her painting. Painting was private. Even moreso now that she was spilling her heart and her devastation onto the canvas.</p><p>She\u2019d just put the last touches on the painting when a knock sounded at her door. She froze, dismay coursing through her veins. Was Ash here? He\u2019d been blunt about the fact that he\u2019d give her last night but that he wasn\u2019t giving up on her or them. He\u2019d wanted her to think about it but she\u2019d shoved the whole issue solidly from her mind and immersed herself in work.</p><p>She rose, hands shaking. She could ignore the door, but she wasn\u2019t a coward. And if Ash had come all this way, the least she could do was tell him that she needed more time. Space.</p><p>Her heart beating a mile a minute, she wiped her hands and went to the door. Taking a deep breath, she opened it. Blinking in surprise, she took in the fact that it was not Ash at her door. Was it disappointment she felt? She shook that idea off and stared wordlessly at Mia and Bethany who wore determined expressions on their faces.</p> <p>\u201cYou look awful,\u201d Mia said bluntly. \u201cHave you slept at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid question, Mia. It\u2019s obvious she hasn\u2019t,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Josie asked faintly.</p><p>\u201cTo answer what will likely be your next question, no, Ash didn\u2019t send us,\u201d Mia said firmly. \u201cTo answer your first question, we\u2019re here because we\u2019re dragging you to lunch with us and don\u2019t even think about telling us no.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s mouth fell open. Bethany laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou may as well give in gracefully, Josie,\u201d Bethany said, laughter still in her voice. \u201cMia is very determined and she\u2019s kind of scary when she sets her mind to something. I\u2019m sure Gabe will attest to that fact.\u201d</p><p>Mia elbowed Bethany and scowled. Despite herself, Josie smiled, relief settling over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cCan you give me just a minute to clean up? I\u2019ve, uh, been working,\u201d she finished lamely.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d Mia chirped.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Josie said hastily. \u201cHave a seat. It\u2019s kind of a mess. I haven\u2019t unpacked or anything and as I said, I\u2019ve been working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your new stuff?\u201d Bethany asked softly when they entered the living room.</p><p>Mia and Bethany were staring at the two paintings she\u2019d just finished. Josie rubbed her hands down her pants legs and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really good,\u201d Mia said. \u201cSo much emotion in them.\u201d She turned sympathetic eyes toward Josie. \u201cAnd it\u2019s obvious you\u2019re very upset.\u201d</p><p>Josie didn\u2019t know how to respond to that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll, uh, just be a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>Mia and Bethany nodded and Josie hurried into her bathroom to make herself more presentable. When she got a look at herself in the mirror she winced. No wonder they\u2019d told her she looked awful. She did.</p><p>She splashed water on her face and hastily applied foundation and powder. She brushed her lashes with light mascara and then swiped on lip gloss. She wouldn\u2019t win any beauty pageants but at least she didn\u2019t look quite so washed-out and hollow. No amount of makeup in the world was going to fix the dark shadows under her eyes.</p><p>When she returned to the living room, Mia and Bethany were waiting and quickly hustled her outside and toward the car parked just down the street.</p><p>The two guys Josie had noticed earlier caught her attention once more and she frowned. No doubt, they were Ash\u2019s men. Watching her. Even though he\u2019d sworn to give her at least last night. She shook her head. Trust Ash to do things his own way. Just as he\u2019d always done. In the back of her mind she supposed it was good that he was still protecting her, but her trust in him had been shattered. Now what should seem like protection was just one more sign of how controlling Ash was.</p><p>\u201cWe would have invited Brittany too but we worried it might be a little awkward since she\u2019s Ash\u2019s sister,\u201d Mia said in a low voice once they were inside the car.</p><p>Josie winced. Okay, obviously they did know about her breakup with Ash and they weren\u2019t just inviting her to lunch as if everything was normal.</p><p>Bethany slid her hand over Josie\u2019s and squeezed. \u201cDon\u2019t look like that, Josie. Everything will be fine. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned her eyelids and she battled fiercely to keep from breaking down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anything will ever be okay again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Mia said fiercely. \u201cYou can tell us all about it at lunch. Then we\u2019ll figure out how to kick Ash\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>Bethany laughed and Josie just looked at her in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cBut Ash is your friend,\u201d Josie said. \u201cAren\u2019t you mad at me for breaking up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our friend,\u201d Mia said. \u201cAsh isn\u2019t our only connection to you, Josie. And women have to close ranks and stick together! I\u2019m sure whatever the problem is that it\u2019s Ash\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Bethany said loyally. \u201cGabe and Jace messed up plenty of times so it\u2019s certainly par for the course that Ash would too. He is a man after all.\u201d</p><p>Josie laughed even as tears welled in her eyes.\u201d Oh God, I love you guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you too,\u201d Mia said. \u201cNow let\u2019s get something yummy and fattening to eat and bitch about men.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, they were seated at a small pub not far from Josie\u2019s apartment. They placed their orders and then Mia all but pounced on Josie.</p><p>\u201cOkay, give us the dirt. All Gabe and Jace have said was that you broke up with Ash and moved out and that Ash got shitfaced drunk last night.\u201d</p><p>Josie winced and put her face in her hands. \u201cOh God. I don\u2019t know what to do. On one hand I\u2019m pissed and hurt and a whole host of things. And on the other, I wonder if I\u2019ve overreacted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Bethany asked softly.</p><p>Josie sighed and then recounted the entire story from beginning to end, leaving nothing out. Not the fact that Ash had her followed, him buying her mother\u2019s jewelry and him insisting on her moving in with him after what happened with Michael, and then her discovery that he was the one who bought all her paintings.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Mia said, sitting back in her seat. \u201cI would say I was surprised but that so sounds like something Ash would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabe and Jace too,\u201d Bethany pointed out. \u201cThey\u2019re very determined when they want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Mia admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re persistent if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>Bethany nodded her agreement.</p><p>\u201cDid I overreact?\u201d Josie asked. \u201cPart of me says yes while the other part of me is hurt. I mean I\u2019m pissed too, but more than that I\u2019m devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t overreact, Josie,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>Mia sat forward again, her gaze earnest as she stared at Josie. \u201cI understand why you\u2019re upset. But listen to me, Josie, and I don\u2019t say this to hurt you. I\u2019m saying it to make a point. Ash could have any woman he wanted. There are literally thousands of women who\u2019d line up to have a chance with him. But he wants you.\u201d</p><p>Bethany nodded rapidly.</p><p>\u201cI absolutely get what you\u2019re saying about taking away your independence and how what he did negated a lot of what you\u2019d worked very hard to achieve. But here\u2019s the thing. Men are thick. Thick as a brick! Ash wanted to help you. Men like Ash only know one way. Their way. But, Josie, he was so proud of you. He bragged to Jace and Gabe and even to me and Bethany about how talented you are. I don\u2019t think he ever in a million years meant to hurt you the way he has. He saw a way to help you, to provide for you and to give you a sense of accomplishment. He may not have done it in the best way, but his intentions were good. I absolutely believe that. Ash is just so intense. But he has a huge heart, evidenced by the fact that he helped his sister who was a bitch to him for years. And despite the fact that his family are huge assholes, he still can\u2019t quite turn his back on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of issues with the fact that Jace wanted me,\u201d Bethany said quietly. \u201cIt baffled me that he turned the city over looking for me after that first night and that he went to such lengths to help me, to provide for me. He, like Ash, could have any woman he wanted. But he wanted me. Just like Ash wants you. We can sit here and analyze it and try to understand it, but at the end of the day, they want who they want and that happens to be us. And Jace made plenty of mistakes along the way, but we worked past those issues and I\u2019m so glad we did because he makes me so happy. I\u2019d never have this with another man. I wouldn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I\u2019m making too big of a deal out of this,\u201d Josie said ruefully.</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cNo, honey, I don\u2019t. I think it\u2019s obviously important to you and I absolutely think Ash should know that and recognize what he did was wrong. But at the same time, is it something you can\u2019t forgive him for? Because really, what did he do that was so bad? His heart was in the right place even if he went about it all wrong.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. In a nutshell. Was it really so unforgivable? Sure, she had a right to be angry, but moving out? Breaking up? That was so . . . permanent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dropped her face into her hands. \u201cOh God. I did overreact.\u201d</p><p>Bethany slid her hand over Josie\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cI should have confronted him, absolutely, but I completely overreacted. I shouldn\u2019t have done what I did. Now he\u2019s going to be so pissed at me, and I don\u2019t blame him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be pissed, Josie,\u201d Mia said softly. \u201cHe\u2019ll just be glad to have you back.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head miserably. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than what you think. He said . . .\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe said he loved me and I threw it back at him. I said some pretty horrible things. Like that I couldn\u2019t trust that he wasn\u2019t saying it to manipulate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it the first time he told you?\u201d Bethany asked gently.</p><p>Josie nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s understandable that you would have reacted the way you did,\u201d Mia said. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah,\u201d Josie breathed. \u201cCompletely and utterly in love with him.\u201d</p> <p>Bethany beamed. \u201cThere. You love each other. You can work this out. He\u2019ll forgive you and you\u2019ll forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so easy,\u201d Josie muttered. \u201cI was such a hysterical twit. I can\u2019t believe I marched into his office and said the things I said. I wish there was a Rewind button and I had it to do all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove isn\u2019t perfect,\u201d Mia said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all made mistakes. Gabe, Jace, me, Bethany. And now you and Ash. It\u2019s not supposed to be perfect. It\u2019s what you make it. And you can make it really special, Josie. Go and talk to him. Or call him. Make things right and give him the chance to make things right.\u201d</p><p>Some of the heavy weight lifted off Josie\u2019s shoulders. Hope crept in and with it the realization that this wasn\u2019t the end. Nothing Ash had done was unforgiveable. She\u2019d make mistakes. There was no doubt she would. But she absolutely believed that Ash would be a lot more forgiving of her mistakes than she\u2019d been of his.</p><p>\u201cThanks, you guys,\u201d she said, smiling with relief. \u201cI\u2019m going to go home, take a shower and call Ash and hope he\u2019s not too pissed to listen to me apologize.\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled back. \u201cOh, he\u2019ll listen. Come on. Let\u2019s go. We\u2019ll drop you back by your apartment.\u201d</p> <p>Josie shook her head. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll walk. I need some time to get my thoughts together. I want to get this just right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Bethany asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s not that far and it will give me the chance to work up my nerve to call him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you have to swear to text me and Bethany and let us know how it goes!\u201d Mia demanded.</p><p>\u201cI will. Promise! And thanks again. This means a lot to me. That you\u2019d be willing to kick his ass when we\u2019ve only known each other a short time.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d</p><p>Josie rose, hugged both of the women fiercely and promised again to text them the minute she got things worked out with Ash. Then she walked out with them and waited while they got into the car and waved as they pulled away.</p><p>Slinging her purse over her shoulder, she started walking in the direction of her apartment. Her thoughts were a whirlwind, but excitement and relief replaced her earlier gloom.</p> <p>Now she just had to hope that Ash would forgive her and that he really did love her.</p><p>The walk took longer than she\u2019d thought and by the time she reached her apartment she was tired from not having slept the night before and she was impatient to get inside, take a shower and call Ash.</p><p>She cursed the fact that she\u2019d left her cell phone in her living room. She could have already read her texts and listened to her voice mails. They would give her a good idea of Ash\u2019s mood and whether it would be a simple matter of apologizing to him.</p><p>She put her key in the lock, frowning when she realized she must have forgotten to lock it on her way out. But then the last thing on her mind hadn\u2019t been whether she locked up or not. She really needed to be more careful. Of course if she and Ash reconciled, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that because he always made certain she was protected. For that matter he had still made sure she was protected, even though she\u2019d left him. But then she hadn\u2019t noticed her two shadows when she returned to her apartment. Had they given up? Had Ash given up?</p><p>A frown tugged at her lips as she pushed inside, closing and locking the door behind her. The minute she stepped inside her living room she realized she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Her breath caught when she saw three men standing, waiting, grim expressions on their faces. She recognized two of them from before. What she\u2019d assumed were Ash\u2019s men. For her protection. In that instant, she knew she was terribly wrong. These men weren\u2019t here to protect her at all.</p><p>Before she could react, one moved in quickly behind her, barring her pathway to the door. Not that she would have had time to escape anyway since she\u2019d locked her door on the way in.</p><p>\u201cMiss Carlysle,\u201d one of the men said in a tone that sent shivers down her skin. \u201cThere\u2019s a message I want you to deliver to Gabe Hamilton, Jace Crestwell and Ash McIntyre.\u201d</p><p>Before she could demand to know what he was talking about and that they get the hell out of her apartment, pain exploded through her body. She lay sprawled on the floor, utterly bewildered.</p><p>And then pain. More pain, agonizing, splintering through her body as they meted out violence. Blood smeared her nose. She could taste it in her mouth. She couldn\u2019t breathe right. It hurt too much. She couldn\u2019t even scream.</p><p>She was going to die.</p><p>That thought hit her and, oddly, she didn\u2019t fight it because it meant escape from the horrific agony she was enduring.</p><p>Then it went silent. A hand dug into her hair and yanked her head painfully upward. A man leaned into her face, his nose just inches from her own.</p><p>\u201cYou tell them that nothing they hold dear is safe from me. I\u2019m coming after them. They will regret the day they ever fucked with me. They ruined me. And by God, I\u2019ll ruin them before I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>He shoved something into her hand and then dropped her head back onto the floor. Pain shot down her spine. She heard footsteps and then her door opening. And then it closing.</p><p>A low whimper stuttered past stiff, swollen lips. Ash. She had to get to her cell phone and call him. Had to warn him. He\u2019d come for her. Everything would be all right if she could just get to her phone.</p><p>She tried to push herself up and shrieked in agony when she put weight on her right hand. She stared down at it, her vision fuzzy, one eye nearly swollen shut. What was wrong with her hand?</p><p>Using her elbow to prop herself up, she dragged herself toward the coffee table where she\u2019d left her phone. She reached up for it, knocking it onto the floor and then praying she hadn\u2019t broken it.</p><p>With her left hand she fumbled to push the right button to bring up her contacts. Then she changed her mind and hit recent calls because his would have been the last. She hit his name and with a whispered prayer as she waited for him to answer.</p><p>Chapter thirty-one</p><p>Ash sat in on the staff meeting with Gabe and their executives, but his mind was anywhere but here in this room. He had a hangover from hell after getting roaring drunk the night before. Gabe and Jace had poured him into a car and then brought him home and tossed him on his bed. He\u2019d woken up the next morning feeling like he\u2019d been run over by a truck, but the pain of the headache was nothing compared to the pain of losing Josie.</p><p>No, he hadn\u2019t lost her. Not yet. He wouldn\u2019t let himself go there. She was upset\u2014rightfully so\u2014and he\u2019d given her last night. Time to spend apart from him and hopefully decide when she got over her initial anger that this was something they could work through.</p><p>At any rate, he\u2019d given her all the time he was going to. As soon as this fucking meeting ended, he was out of here. He was going to Josie\u2019s apartment and would get on his knees if he had to. Whatever it took to get her back home. To their apartment. In his arms and in his bed. And then he was never going to let her go again.</p><p>His phone vibrated and he glanced down, his heart clenching when he saw it was Josie calling. Without saying a word, he abruptly got up and walked out of the meeting, the phone already to his ear.</p><p>\u201cJosie? Baby?\u201d he cut in before she could even say anything.</p><p>There was a long silence and at first he thought she\u2019d hung up. But then he heard it and the sound froze his blood. A low whimper. Of pain. His heart dropped into his stomach.</p><p>\u201cJosie, talk to me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh . . .\u201d</p><p>His name came out barely a whisper and it was obvious that she was in a lot of pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, baby. Tell me what\u2019s happened. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHurt. It\u2019s bad.\u201d</p><p>Panic froze him in place. He couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t act, couldn\u2019t process anything but the agony in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cApartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way, baby. Hold tight, okay? I\u2019ll be there in just a minute.\u201d</p><p>He turned in the hallway, having gotten no farther than the door where the meeting was being held and ran solidly into Gabe.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Gabe demanded. \u201cI heard you on the phone with Josie. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ash choked out. \u201cShe\u2019s hurt. I have to go. She\u2019s at her apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Gabe said grimly, even as he started striding down the hall toward the elevators.</p><p>Not arguing, Ash ran after him, his heart beating like a hammer.</p><p>\u201cDid she say what happened?\u201d Gabe asked when they\u2019d gotten into the car.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ash clipped out. \u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, man. We\u2019ll get to her. She\u2019ll be okay. You have to believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Mia and Bethany had lunch with her. Have you heard from Mia? What could possibly have happened? They can\u2019t have finished that long ago.\u201d</p><p>Gabe paled and then immediately dialed Mia\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Gabe asked bluntly.</p><p>Then his shoulders sagged in relief. Mia must be fine. But Josie wasn\u2019t. What the fuck could have happened?</p><p>\u201cWhen did you and Bethany leave Josie?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>He listened a moment and then said good-bye without telling Mia anything about Josie.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Ash demanded, silently urging the driver to go faster. They were already driving recklessly.</p><p>\u201cShe said Josie walked back to her apartment after they had lunch. That was an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Ash closed his eyes. He should have kept a man on her. What if Michael had gotten to her? He\u2019d refused to put anyone on her, not wanting to upset her even more than she already was. He\u2019d promised her space and now that space had cost her.</p><p>A few minutes later the car squealed to a stop in front of Josie\u2019s brownstone and Ash jumped out, Gabe close on his heels. The first thing he registered when he burst through her door was the smell of blood. His own went cold, freezing in his veins. He tore into the living room, his heart seizing as he took in the sight before him.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of God,\u201d he choked out.</p><p>Josie lay in a bloody heap in front of the coffee table. Blood was smeared on the floor where she\u2019d evidently dragged herself to the phone.</p><p>\u201cCall an ambulance,\u201d Ash barked to Gabe.</p><p>God, he should have already called one but he hadn\u2019t been thinking. His only thought had been to get to her as fast as he could. And maybe he\u2019d denied that it would be this bad.</p><p>He ran over, dropping to his knees beside her, afraid to touch her because oh God, the blood. Her face was a mess, eyes swollen, lips split and bleeding.</p><p>\u201cJosie. Josie, darling, I\u2019m here. It\u2019s me, Ash. Talk to me, baby. Please. Open your eyes and talk to me.\u201d</p><p>He was pleading with her even as he put a shaky finger to her neck to feel for a pulse.</p><p>She stirred, emitting a soft moan that seared his heart and cut straight to his soul.</p><p>\u201cA-ash?\u201d</p><p>Her words were slurred, distorted by her swollen lips. He smoothed a hand over her forehead because it was the only place she wasn\u2019t bruised or bleeding.</p><p>\u201cYes, baby, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m here. Tell me what happened, Josie. Who did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hurts to b-breathe,\u201d she said and then she stopped, coughing and choking as a stream of blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Oh God. Oh God. She was hurt badly. Someone had beat the ever-loving hell out of her. Rage exploded through his chest until he couldn\u2019t breathe either. His vision went dim, his pulse about to beat out of his head. He was coming apart. Unraveling at the seams. His hands shook so badly that he had to pull them away from her skin so he didn\u2019t risk hurting her.</p><p>She tried to lift her left hand and he saw she was holding something. He gently pulled it away, frowning when he saw it was a picture. Bile rose in his throat as he stared in disbelief. It was a picture of Mia. Dear God. She was naked, tied up and spread out on what looked like a coffee table. The man in the picture was Charles Willis and he was trying to shove his dick inside her mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He quickly stuffed the picture into his pocket before Gabe could see it. Gabe would lose his fucking mind, and right now the only thing Ash was worried about was Josie and getting her to a hospital. They\u2019d deal with the picture later.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Gabe asked as he dropped down beside Ash. \u201cJesus. She\u2019s obviously not okay. Ambulance is on the way. ETA is five minutes. What the fuck happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ash said, his voice still shaking with fury.</p><p>He leaned down and pressed a kiss to Josie\u2019s forehead, too afraid to do what he most wanted and gather her in his arms. She obviously had internal injuries and he didn\u2019t want to cause her further injury.</p> <p>\u201cWho did this to you, baby? Can you tell me?\u201d he asked her gently.</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes and slid silently down her cheeks. Each one broke his heart. He wanted to cry with her, but he refused to break down. She needed him to be strong. He would be strong. No way he was going to let her down again.</p><p>\u201cHe had a message,\u201d Josie whispered. \u201cFor you. And Gabe and Jace.\u201d</p><p>Gabe and Ash exchanged quick what the fuck looks.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the message, Josie? Don\u2019t try to talk if it hurts you, though. We have plenty of time to talk later when you\u2019re not in pain.\u201d</p> <p>She licked her lips, her tongue bright red with blood. Ash was shaking from head to toe now as his reaction set in. This was bad. If she was coughing up blood it meant she was fucked up on the inside. People died from internal injuries!</p><p>\u201cSaid nothing . . .\u201d She broke off and choked, more blood seeping from her lips. Ash was panicking now. Where was the goddamn ambulance?</p><p>She took a long moment and for a second Ash thought she\u2019d slipped into unconsciousness.</p><p>\u201cJosie. Josie! Stay with me, baby. Fight it. Stay awake. Can you do that for me? Open your eyes, baby. I\u2019m right here. I\u2019m not going anywhere. The ambulance is on its way. They\u2019ll be here soon and they\u2019ll take care of you. I\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d he choked out, tears knotting his throat.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and she trained her unfocused eyes on him, pain glittering brightly in their depths.</p><p>\u201cSaid nothing you hold dear . . . is safe. S-s-said you r-ruined him . . . and now he\u2019s going to ruin y-you.\u201d</p> <p>Gabe went white even as he grabbed his phone. He stepped back and away from Josie and Ash, but Ash could hear him talking to Jace, telling him to make sure Mia and Bethany were safe. Then he told Jace to meet him and Ash at the hospital.</p><p>The sound of a siren sent relief coursing through Ash\u2019s veins. He jumped to his feet but Gabe stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them in. You stay with Josie,\u201d Gabe bit out.</p><p>Ash dropped back down, bending over Josie so she\u2019d know he was here.</p><p>\u201cThe ambulance is here, baby,\u201d he soothed. \u201cThey\u2019ll get you to the hospital and I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. You\u2019ll be okay, darling. I won\u2019t let you be anything else. Stay with me. I love you. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>She tried to lift her right hand and then whimpered in pain. \u201cH-hand h-hurts. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>He stared in horror at the obviously broken fingers. Son of a bitch! They\u2019d broken her fingers! He was precariously close to losing his composure. He wanted to get his hands on the sons of bitches who did this to her. He\u2019d kill the bastards with his own hands.</p><p>Forcing himself to focus on her and pushing everything else from his mind, he captured her wrist, holding it gently so she wouldn\u2019t let it fall back to the floor and hurt herself even more. Then he kissed the swollen fingers ever so gently as tears gathered in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cJust some broken fingers,\u201d he said shakily. \u201cNothing the doctor won\u2019t fix right up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy painting hand,\u201d she said as more tears squeezed from her swollen eyes.</p><p>\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay, baby. You\u2019ll be back to painting before you know it.\u201d</p><p>Even as he spoke, his gaze caught on the two paintings propped against the wall. Dark. Full of turmoil. He\u2019d done that to her. He\u2019d taken her vibrancy away. The essence of her work. These weren\u2019t the Josie he knew and loved. This was Josie hurting and expressing her emotions in the only way she knew how.</p><p>The EMTs burst through the door and into the living room, immediately assessing Josie\u2019s condition. Ash moved back so he didn\u2019t interfere, but he stayed close, hovering anxiously as they went through the assessment.</p><p>\u201cDecreased breath sounds on the left side,\u201d the paramedic said grimly as he pulled his stethoscope away. \u201cGet the O2,\u201d he barked at his partner.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Ash demanded.</p><p>The paramedic shook his head. \u201cNo way to know without x-rays. I\u2019m guessing she has several broken ribs. Probably punctured a lung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful with her hand,\u201d Ash said. \u201cIt\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a mess,\u201d the medic said bluntly. \u201cWe need to load and go. I\u2019ll get a c-collar on her and bag her on the way.\u201d</p><p>Ash went pale. The words sounded so grim and utterly serious.</p><p>\u201cWill she live?\u201d Ash whispered, voicing his darkest fear.</p><p>\u201cNot my call, but she sure as hell isn\u2019t going to die on my watch.\u201d</p><p>A stretcher was brought in and the medics worked quickly, securing the c-collar and then giving her oxygen. She was just as quickly wheeled out and loaded into the ambulance. Ash barely had time to jump into the back before they roared away in a rush of sirens and lights.</p><p>He slid his hand into his pocket, feeling for the photo Josie had had in her hand. Gabe had a hell of a lot to answer for, and then Ash was going after the son of a bitch who\u2019d put his hands on Josie.</p><p>Chapter thirty-two</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Jace demanded as he strode into the ER waiting room.</p><p>Ash turned and then motioned Gabe and Jace into one of the smaller private rooms where doctors met with families.</p><p>\u201cWe have a serious problem,\u201d Ash said grimly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to Josie?\u201d Jace asked. \u201cGabe called worried about Mia and Bethany, told me to lock them both down and make sure they were safe. I called Kaden Ginsberg and now I have two very pissed-off women because I made Kaden sit on them both and they\u2019re scared and want to know what the fuck is going on, which I couldn\u2019t tell them because I don\u2019t know myself!\u201d</p><p>Ash held up his hand and then reached into his pocket with the other. He pulled out the photo that was in Josie\u2019s hand and held it out to Gabe.</p><p>Gabe\u2019s face was a mixture of shock and rage. And then, oddly, guilt. He went gray and then staggered back to sit in one of the chairs. He buried his face in his hands, the photo crumpled in his fist.</p><p>Jace snatched the photo from Gabe and then he went pale as he stared at his sister naked, tied up, another man trying to force himself on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s explosive demand echoed through the room.</p><p>\u201cJosie was holding that when I got to her,\u201d Ash said quietly. \u201cAnd then she told me the man who beat the crap out of her had a message for me, you and Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jace said in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHe told her that nothing we held dear was safe from him. That we ruined him and now he was going to ruin us. I\u2019d say Josie was probably the first target because she was the easiest. She was alone and vulnerable. It would be a lot harder to get to Mia or Bethany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know what the fuck that picture is about,\u201d Jace said in a furious tone. \u201cThat was Charles Willis in that photo. Is he the one who hurt Josie and is threatening us now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabe said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know that you haven\u2019t told us,\u201d Ash asked in a dangerously low tone. It was obvious by the look on Gabe\u2019s face that there was a lot that Ash and Jace evidently didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Gabe rubbed a hand wearily over his face, his eyes sick.</p><p>\u201cWhat I have to say is going to piss you both off. I thought it was behind me and Mia. I was wrong, apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say so,\u201d Jace bit out. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do, Gabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Mia and I were together, before, when we were keeping it a secret from you, right before we went to Paris on business, my ex-wife came into my office saying all sorts of crazy shit. Then she accused me of being in love with Mia. Accused me of being in love with her when I was still married to Lisa. It hit me all wrong. I wasn\u2019t ready to admit my feelings for Mia. And in an effort to distance us, to prove to myself that she was just sex, I set up a thing in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of thing,\u201d Ash growled.</p><p>Gabe blew out his breath. \u201cMia and I had discussed, before, her interest in being with another man. With me, I mean. I guess kind of like you and Jace sharing women. So I set it up that Charles Willis and two other men were in our hotel room. Jesus, this is complicated.\u201d</p><p>Jace stared stonily at Gabe, his eyes glittering with anger.</p><p>\u201cThings got out of hand. I was going to let them touch her, nothing else. I made it clear they weren\u2019t to do anything but touch, which meant keeping their dicks in their pants. But as soon as it began, I knew it was wrong. I realized what I was doing, but before I could put a stop to it, Charles got rough with Mia. He was trying to shove his dick down her throat and then he hit her when she protested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Jace swore. \u201cWhat the fuck, man? How could you do that to her? What were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Gabe held up his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s more. It gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ash muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhen we got back, Charles confronted Mia outside the office building when she went out to get us something to eat. He tried to blackmail her into giving him information on the bids. He knew I had no intention of doing business with him, but he figured if he bid low enough we wouldn\u2019t have a choice. He showed her that picture and said that if she didn\u2019t give him what he wanted that he\u2019d go public with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUn-fucking-real,\u201d Jace growled.</p><p>\u201cMia came to me instead of caving in, and I took care of the matter. Or at least I thought I had,\u201d Gabe said wearily.</p><p>Ash\u2019s jaw bulged. Rage smoldered through him like a wildfire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it,\u201d Gabe said quietly. \u201cI fucked up. I\u2019ll make sure that son of a bitch doesn\u2019t get his hands on Mia or Bethany and I\u2019ll make sure he pays for what he did to Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ash said, the word whipping through the room like a gunshot.</p><p>Gabe and Jace both looked at Ash with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou had your chance,\u201d Ash said in an even tone. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the little bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s face flashed with alarm. \u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, man. Your emotions are running high. Let me and Gabe take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no,\u201d Ash snapped. \u201cThis is mine. Gabe had his chance. He fucked up. I\u2019m not leaving this to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh,\u201d Gabe began but Ash silenced him with a look.</p><p>\u201cIf it were Mia or Bethany lying in a hospital bed, bruises, broken bones, punctured lung and God only knows what else, would you just sit back and let someone else take care of the asshole who did that to her?\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s lips twisted and then he sighed. \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t. But Jesus, man. After what went down with Michael, this is too risky. You got away with the first. You won\u2019t get away with this. Charles Willis has nothing to lose. He\u2019s not going to sway under threats. You touch him and he\u2019ll have your ass in a sling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about threats?\u201d Ash asked calmly. \u201cIn my world, threats are meaningless unless you do something to back them up. I have no intention of threatening Charles Willis. But I have every intention of taking him down.\u201d</p><p>Gabe and Jace exchanged worried looks but Ash ignored them. They\u2019d try to talk him down but in this he would not be dissuaded.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t touch you. It damn sure won\u2019t touch Mia, Bethany or Josie. Not ever again. You don\u2019t have to worry. You won\u2019t be remotely tied to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh fuck you,\u201d Jace said rudely. \u201cThe hell I\u2019m letting you take this shit on by yourself. We\u2019ve already been over this. You never have to ask. We\u2019ll always have your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans a lot,\u201d Ash said quietly. \u201cBut I\u2019m not pulling my family down. You and the girls mean far too much to me. I\u2019m not going down either. You can take that to the bank. No way in hell I\u2019m leaving Josie to survive on her own. I\u2019m going to be there for her every step of the way and she will never have to worry about some asshole with a grudge against us using her to get to us. That will not happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Gabe asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better off not knowing,\u201d Ash replied.</p><p>Gabe ran a hand through his hair. \u201cJesus, man. This is on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had your shot,\u201d Ash said carefully. \u201cNot saying you did wrong, but whatever you did was not enough. I\u2019m going to make sure that this time it is. He didn\u2019t beat your woman half to death, even if she was the intended mark. He fucked Josie over, and I\u2019m going to make damn sure that never happens again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t you tell us this before?\u201d Jace said to Gabe. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you kept this from us.

And then after, it didn\u2019t seem so important. He went away. Months passed and he seemed to disappear off the face of the planet. I thought he wasn\u2019t going to be a problem any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did was piss him off to the point that he beat the shit out of Josie and now he\u2019s gunning for Mia and Bethany,\u201d Jace said in a furious tone.</p><p>\u201cYou need to close ranks around the girls,\u201d Ash said, veering the subject away from Jace\u2019s fury. He had a right. Mia was his sister. But that wasn\u2019t what was important right now. The women\u2019s safety was all that mattered.</p> <p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d Gabe growled. \u201cThey\u2019ll go nowhere until he\u2019s taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll let you know when the issue has been resolved.\u201d</p><p>Jace\u2019s expression was still uneasy but he kept silent, though it was obvious that he and Gabe weren\u2019t finished with their conversation.</p><p>\u201cMr. McIntyre?\u201d</p><p>Ash whirled around to see a nurse standing in the doorway. He rushed forward.</p> <p>\u201cHow is Josie?\u201d he demanded. \u201cCan I see her yet?\u201d</p><p>The nurse smiled. \u201cThe doctor will see you now. She\u2019ll update you on Josie\u2019s condition and then you can ask her if you can go back. Stay right here while I let her know where you are.\u201d</p><p>Ash fidgeted with impatience. It had been too long with no word and he was slowly losing his mind. He didn\u2019t like that Josie was alone. Or at least surrounded by strangers. She\u2019d wonder where he was. He\u2019d sworn to her that he wasn\u2019t leaving her, that he would be with her every step of the way. How could he keep that promise when he\u2019d been barred from her room while they gave her treatment?</p><p>A moment later a woman dressed in scrubs walked in the door. She looked young, the ponytail her hair was pulled back in contributing to her youthful appearance.</p><p>\u201cMr. McIntyre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s me,\u201d Ash said, stepping forward.</p> <p>She extended her hand and firmly shook his. \u201cDr. Newton. I\u2019m the ER doctor handling Miss Carlysle\u2019s care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Ash asked anxiously. \u201cWhen can I see her?\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s expression softened. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty banged up. Of most concern is the traumatic pneumothorax. I\u2019ve inserted a chest tube to help suck out the air trapped between the lung and the chest cavity and it will also help the lung reinflate. We\u2019re going to be closely monitoring her for infection as well as seeing how the lung heals. Right now I don\u2019t think she requires surgery, but a surgeon will be consulted and he\u2019ll make the final determination.</p><p>\u201cShe has several broken ribs, a concussion and broken fingers on her right hand. She also has a hairline fracture of her right wrist. Numerous contusions and other more minor injuries. She was badly beaten, Mr. McIntyre. She\u2019s lucky to be alive.\u201d</p><p>Ash blew out his breath while Gabe and Jace swore softly behind him.</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go in. She\u2019s back from x-ray and she\u2019ll be moved to ICU as soon as the paperwork gets done on her admission. I can\u2019t say with any authority how long she\u2019ll remain in ICU. That will be up to the internal medicine physician assigned to her care. But you can stay with her until they move her up to the unit. They\u2019re usually pretty lenient about letting family members back even when it\u2019s not the scheduled hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving her,\u201d Ash bit out.</p> <p>The doctor\u2019s expression was sympathetic. \u201cI understand. And as I said, they\u2019re usually pretty lenient. Unfortunately when she\u2019s first moved, you\u2019ll have to wait until they get her settled, but they\u2019ll let you know when you can go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ash said in a low voice. \u201cI appreciate all you\u2019ve done for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job, Mr. McIntyre,\u201d she said in a cheerful voice. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend. If you like I\u2019ll walk you back and show you which room she\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Ash turned to Gabe and Jace. \u201cAre you going to let Mia and Bethany know what happened? They\u2019ll be worried about Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let them know,\u201d Jace said. \u201cI\u2019ll have Kaden drive them here and they\u2019ll stay with us until we leave.\u201d</p><p>Ash nodded and then turned back to follow the doctor to Josie\u2019s room.</p><p>When he walked into the small cubicle where Josie was, he sucked in his breath and tears burned the corners of his eyes. It hurt to breathe. His chest was so tight that his hand automatically came up to rub it, trying to rid himself of the discomfort.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>It gutted him that she was lying in a hospital bed all because some asshole had an ax to grind with him and Gabe and Jace. He went to her bedside and tentatively reached out a hand to stroke her forehead. He smoothed her hair back and then leaned down to brush his lips across her brow.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m here. With you, just like I said I\u2019d be. I\u2019ll always be here, Josie. You and me are forever, baby. Not letting go of that.\u201d</p><p>She lay perfectly still, the only sound the low hum of the machine that made oxygen flow through the mask over her face and the steady beeping of the heart monitor. She looked so fragile, bruised and swollen. The blood had been cleaned away, but the dark purpling of the bruises was already vivid against her pale skin.</p><p>He touched her neck where the collar he\u2019d given her had rested. It looked bare. He wanted that collar back around her neck. Wanted his ring on her finger and her promise to marry him. He wanted to tie her to him in ways she\u2019d never escape. But they\u2019d be the most loving, silken ties in the world.</p><p>He\u2019d pamper her, cherish her, adore her every single day of his life.</p><p>He stood at her bedside for two hours, only moving when one of the nurses came in to check on her. And then finally, they came to move her to ICU.</p><p>To his frustration they told him it would be a while before he was allowed back to see her. But that was okay because he had the problem of Charles Willis to take care of. The sooner he was out of the picture, the sooner they could all relax and not worry that Mia or Bethany would be next.</p><p>After updating Gabe, Jace, Mia and Bethany on Josie\u2019s condition and exacting a promise from them to stay with Josie until he returned, he strode out of the hospital, determined to seek vengeance on the bastard who\u2019d put Josie there.</p><p>Chapter thirty-three</p><p>Pain. It came to her piercing like a nail being driven into her head by a hammer. She hurt everywhere. It hurt to breathe. It hurt to open her eyes.</p><p>There were voices, or at least one voice. It was hard to tell because there was a roaring in her ears she couldn\u2019t make go away.</p><p>And then a warm, gentle hand on her forehead. A kiss. Sweet, soft words whispered over her skin. She gave a little sigh and promptly regretted it because pain speared through her chest.</p><p>\u201cH-hurts,\u201d she said in a pitiful voice that she wasn\u2019t even sure was actually audible.</p><p>\u201cI know it does, baby. The nurse is coming to give you something for pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsh?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, darling, it\u2019s me. Open those pretty eyes and you\u2019ll see me right here.\u201d</p><p>She tried. She really did. But her eyes wouldn\u2019t cooperate and it hurt to try and force the issue.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d she managed to get past stiff, swollen lips.</p><p>Again he pressed his lips to her brow and she felt his hand in her hair. That felt nice. The only part of her that wasn\u2019t hurting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he soothed. \u201cDon\u2019t try too hard. Just know that I\u2019m with you and you\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>But still, she wanted to see him. Wanted to make sure her imagination wasn\u2019t playing nasty tricks on her. So she braced herself against the pain and tried harder. A small sliver of light seared her eyeballs and she promptly shut her eyes again. She lay there, nearly panting with exertion and the agony such a small movement had caused. Then she tried again, this time prepared for the light.</p><p>At first all she saw was a blurry haze. And then he moved into her line of vision.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She tried to smile, but that hurt too, so she just lay there slowly blinking to bring him into sharper focus.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she returned just as quietly.</p><p>To her utter shock, his eyes were glossy with moisture and he looked like hell. He hadn\u2019t shaved, his hair was rumpled and his clothes looked like he\u2019d slept in them.</p><p>She licked her lips and moaned softly. \u201cW-what happened to me?\u201d</p><p>Ash frowned, his eyes going dark. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>She concentrated hard but it was all a blur. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>He touched her hair, his expression worried. \u201cHow long what, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise despite the discomfort it caused her. \u201cTwo days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby. You\u2019ve been in ICU for two days. Gave us quite a scare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>It was a question she was afraid to ask but she had to know. She wouldn\u2019t hurt this much if it wasn\u2019t bad.</p><p>His face softened, his eyes going warm and loving. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine. I won\u2019t allow any other possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p><p>His head came back in surprise. \u201cWhat the hell are you sorry for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overreacted,\u201d she said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it. I\u2019m sorry. I was going to call you but then . . .\u201d</p><p>And it was then she remembered everything that had happened. She sucked in her breath at the impact the memories had. Her terror, her pain, the worry that she was going to die. Tears welled, burning her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d he said in an aching voice. \u201cDon\u2019t cry. And don\u2019t apologize. You have nothing to be sorry for. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were they?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy did they do this? Why do they hate you and Gabe and Jace?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and then leaned down, touching his forehead to hers. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this right now, darling. I don\u2019t want to upset you. I\u2019d rather talk about how much I love you and what I\u2019m going to do to pamper you and spoil you while you recover.\u201d</p><p>She had to ask another question, had to know where they stood and if she\u2019d screwed up any chance of them being together.</p><p>\u201cAre we back together?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. So sweet and tender it warmed her to her toes and took away some of the overwhelming pain. Relief shone in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBet your ass we are.\u201d</p><p>Her own shoulders sagged in relief. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cGod, baby, it\u2019s torture being so close to you and unable to hold you and kiss you the way I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as fatigue and the pain grew stronger. It was becoming overwhelming and she had so many questions. She needed answers. She needed to know exactly how serious her injuries were. For that matter she didn\u2019t even know exactly what they were.</p><p>\u201cThe nurse is here, darling. Bear with me a few more seconds and the pain will be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d she begged. \u201cI just want to hear your voice. Stay here and tell me what happened and how bad it is. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>He wiped a hand over her forehead as the nurse injected pain medication into her IV. She felt the slight burn travel up her arm and then, right on its heels, blessed relief. A feeling of euphoria enveloped her. She felt light and floaty like she was on a cloud. The ceiling suddenly seemed right on top of her and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d Ash asked in concern.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>He went silent and her eyes fluttered open in panic as she tried to see where he\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, darling. Not going anywhere. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d she said again, woozy and sleepy. But she didn\u2019t want to go to sleep. Not yet.</p><p>He kissed her brow. \u201cGive me just a second, baby. I want to talk to the nurse about you but I\u2019ll be right back. Can you stay awake for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She felt him move away and she was suddenly cold. She hated that feeling. Fear and panic seeped all the way to her bones. Her lips chattered but they were so swollen that it felt weird, like they were ten times their size.</p><p>Or maybe it was just the medication.</p><p>Why did it hurt so bad to breathe? It was then she became aware of the oxygen blowing through her nostrils. Her chest was so tight and her muscles ached from head to toe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had they wanted to kill her? But no, that couldn\u2019t be the case. They\u2019d given her a message to give to Ash. Had she given it to him?</p><p>Panic flared all over again. She had to tell him! Mia and Bethany were in danger, and she\u2019d never forgive herself if they were hurt because she hadn\u2019t warned Gabe and Jace.</p><p>\u201cAsh,\u201d she called out as loudly as she could.</p><p>\u201cRight here, baby. What\u2019s wrong? You need to slow down your breathing. You\u2019re going too fast. Can you do that for me?\u201d</p> <p>She sucked in a deep breath and tried to steady herself. The pressure building in her chest was intense. She dragged in another breath, blew it out and then tried again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Josie? What are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia. Bethany,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cHe\u2019ll hurt them like he hurt me. Have to tell Gabe and Jace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d he soothed. \u201cYou told us. Gabe and Jace are making sure that Mia and Bethany are safe. You don\u2019t have to worry about them. I\u2019ve taken care of Britt too. You\u2019ll be happy to know that Kai has her under lock and key.\u201d</p><p>She tried to smile. She may have even managed half of one judging by Ash\u2019s look of delight.</p> <p>Then she sobered because the big question remained unanswered. And she was getting groggier and groggier. It was getting harder to stay awake. She wanted nothing more than to drift off into oblivion where there was no pain, no worries. Nothing but a black void of nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ash sighed. Didn\u2019t even try to misunderstand her.</p><p>\u201cThey hurt you because of me,\u201d he said, pain thick in his voice. \u201cBecause of the business. Me, Gabe and Jace. He\u2019s an asshole who hurt Mia before. I didn\u2019t know it, but he and Gabe have history. He was retaliating because we shut him down and refused to do business with him. It\u2019s not going to happen again, Josie. I swear to you it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The resoluteness of his words worried Josie. It was the same matter of fact way he\u2019d spoken of Michael and the fact that Michael would no longer be an issue.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cNothing you need to worry about,\u201d he said as he brushed another kiss across her forehead.</p><p>She frowned, her eyes half-closed already. She struggled to remain awake and focused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d she slurred out.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about anything but getting better. This doesn\u2019t touch you, Josie. It never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to lose you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He stroked her hair, his eyes soft with love. \u201cYou won\u2019t lose me. Never that. I\u2019m always going to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest now, baby. You\u2019re about to go under. Go to sleep. I\u2019ll be here when you wake up.\u201d</p> <p>She fought only as long as it took to whisper the words. Words she\u2019d never given him before.</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>This time there were tears in his eyes. Turning the green to aqua pools. His breath caught and stuttered over his lips as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, darling. Now get some rest. I\u2019ll be here watching over you while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>She gave in, closing her eyes, surrendering to the pull of the medication. But she was still aware of the warm hand cupped over her brow. And of the lips against her temple.</p><p>Chapter thirty-four</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Mia asked anxiously when Ash walked into the ICU waiting room. \u201cHas she woken up yet?\u201d</p><p>Ash gathered Mia in a hug and then put an arm around Bethany, who wore the same worried, grim expression. He hated that this touched them. That they\u2019d been threatened and now had to live with that knowledge.</p><p>More than that he hated that Mia\u2019s past had been dragged into the present. Shame burned bright in her eyes. She carried guilt she had no business carrying. It wasn\u2019t her goddamn fault that Charles Willis was a fucking coward who preyed on women to get his point across. He was pissed beyond belief that Charles had put that fear in Mia and Bethany\u2019s eyes. More than that, he was enraged that Josie bore the bruises and broken bones from Charles\u2019s attack.</p><p>The man would pay. It was only a matter of time.</p><p>Gabe and Jace also looked expectantly at Ash as they waited for an update on Josie\u2019s condition. None of the men had slept since this all began. They were too worried that Mia or Bethany could be next and so they\u2019d taken steps to ensure neither woman would ever be at risk.</p><p>Mia and Bethany weren\u2019t thrilled, but neither did they object.</p><p>\u201cShe woke up for a few minutes,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Bethany breathed. \u201cHow was she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain. They gave her pain medication and she slipped back under. She managed to say a few things. She\u2019s confused. She was very worried about Mia and Bethany. She didn\u2019t remember that she\u2019d already warned us so she was frantic to tell Gabe and Jace that he\u2019d threatened Mia and Bethany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Jace muttered. \u201cWhat has the doctor said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will we be able to see her?\u201d Mia asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the next time she wakes up,\u201d Ash said. \u201cAnd the doctor said she\u2019s making remarkable progress. They were able to take the chest tube out and she\u2019s breathing on her own with the aid of oxygen. They\u2019ll likely move her to a step-down unit tomorrow if she continues to do well and shows no sign of infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pissed this happened to her,\u201d Mia said tearfully.</p><p>Gabe immediately went to her, wrapping his arm around her waist and pulling her into his side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d she continued, tears slipping down her cheeks. \u201cIt should have been me not her.\u201d</p><p>Ash scowled and Gabe didn\u2019t look any better. Guilt weighed heavily in Gabe\u2019s eyes. He looked haggard and gray, suddenly older than his thirty-nine years.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Jace growled. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Mia. I won\u2019t have you saying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know it\u2019s my fault,\u201d Gabe said grimly. \u201cIf I\u2019d taken care of the asshole the first time, we wouldn\u2019t be standing here and Josie wouldn\u2019t be lying in a hospital bed.\u201d</p><p>Ash wasn\u2019t going to refute that. If it had been him and the situation with Mia had happened to Josie, Ash would have taken care of the issue then and there. But assigning blame did none of them any good. Gabe was kicking himself enough without Ash and Jace piling more on.</p><p>Jace sent Gabe a dark look that said he still hadn\u2019t forgiven the other man for what had gone down in Paris and then afterward when Charles had tried to blackmail Mia. But Jace remained silent, his lips pressed together in a tight line.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s been taken care of,\u201d Ash said. \u201cThere are other more important things right now.\u201d</p><p>Jace shot a worried look in Ash\u2019s direction but Ash ignored it. He wasn\u2019t about to get into specifics in front of Mia and Bethany. They had enough to deal with as it was.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of making up to do with Josie,\u201d Ash continued. \u201cApart from the fact that she\u2019s lying in a hospital bed in horrific pain, there\u2019s also the issue of the paintings I bought. I hurt her by doing that and keeping it from her. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019ll do anything,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>Ash squeezed her to him, his arm still wrapped around her. \u201cThanks, sweetheart. That means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need us to do?\u201d Gabe asked.</p><p>\u201cI want to arrange an art show for her and I want to go all out. I need you to call in every favor owed you to make this huge. We can use the ballroom at the Bentley for the showing. Make sure everyone who is anyone is invited and that the show is hyped as the must-attend event of the year. Politicians, celebrities, the whole nine yards. I want Josie to have a venue where her art will shine and prove to her that she has incredible talent. She just needs the right exposure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, when?\u201d Jace asked.</p><p>\u201cIt will have to be in a couple of months. I want to make sure that Josie is recovered enough to enjoy her big night. The last thing she\u2019d want is to show up to her own event with bruises and a cast. But we need to start working on it now so everything goes off without a hitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Gabe said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Ash murmured. \u201cMeans a lot you always having my back.\u201d</p><p>Mia moved from Gabe\u2019s hold and hugged Ash fiercely. \u201cWe love you, Ash. And we love Josie too. We\u2019ll be happy to help. Just let us know if you need anything else.\u201d</p><p>Ash\u2019s lips curved into a half smile. \u201cAs a matter of fact there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it,\u201d Bethany said.</p><p>\u201cNeed you to stay here in case Josie wakes up again. I have a ring to buy.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s and Bethany\u2019s delighted smiles warmed his heart. He squeezed both women to him and dropped kisses on their temples.</p><p>And then he went to Tiffany\u2019s to buy Josie\u2019s ring.</p><p>Chapter thirty-five</p><p>Josie managed to sit up in bed propped on several pillows, no small feat considering the pain in her ribs. But after several days and a move from ICU to a step-down unit and finally to the floor, she was able to sit up and actually move some. More importantly, she was able to eat!</p><p>Not that they\u2019d busted out the real food or even something remotely palatable, but she\u2019d been so hungry she had fallen on the jello and pudding like it was manna from heaven.</p><p>Ash had gone out to meet Gabe, Jace, Mia, Bethany and even Brittany and he was bringing them all in to visit with her. She was extremely self-conscious about the fact she looked terrible. But she was so anxious to have company she didn\u2019t care. All the makeup in the world wouldn\u2019t hide her face, but hopefully the bruising would heal quickly.</p><p>Already some had faded from the purple, almost black, to green and yellow. She didn\u2019t even want to know what the rest of her body looked like. She\u2019d made it a point not to look when Ash had helped her shower.</p><p>The door opened and she eagerly looked up to see everyone spill through the door. Ash led the way and right behind him were Mia, Bethany and Brittany. They swarmed her bed, giving gentle hugs and exclaiming how much better she looked. They were total liars but she loved them for it.</p><p>To her surprise, Kai Wellington came in with Gabe and Jace. She arched an eyebrow in Brittany\u2019s direction and Brittany blushed like a schoolgirl getting caught making out with the quarterback.</p><p>\u201cHe insisted on coming,\u201d Brittany whispered. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t left me alone since this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d Kai growled. \u201cNot going to let some fucker get to you and hurt you. Bad enough he got to Josie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounds so possessive,\u201d Josie whispered to Brittany. \u201cI take it things are going well?\u201d</p><p>Brittany\u2019s eyes glowed and she nodded vigorously. \u201cOh yes. Definitely.\u201d</p><p>Josie squeezed her hand with the fingers that weren\u2019t casted. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Mia asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d Josie said.</p><p>At Ash\u2019s skeptical look, she flushed. \u201cOkay. Not wonderful, but I am better. I can sit up now without feeling like my chest caught on fire. And I can breathe normally again. They took the oxygen off this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Josie!\u201d Bethany exclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you guys?\u201d Josie asked in a low voice. But her question was mainly directed at Mia. Ash had told her about Mia\u2019s history with Charles Willis.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay,\u201d Mia said, but her eyes were haunted. \u201cI still feel like it\u2019s my fault. I mean I\u2019m the one who pissed him off.\u201d</p><p>Josie shook her head and winced at the pain it caused. \u201cHe\u2019s an asshole, Mia. You aren\u2019t to blame for his actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that right,\u201d Ash growled.</p><p>\u201cI hate that I share a last name with him,\u201d Bethany said, pulling a face. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone thinking we\u2019re related!\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cLike Willis isn\u2019t a common last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that much longer, baby,\u201d Jace said, satisfaction written on his face. \u201cYour last name will soon be Crestwell.\u201d</p><p>Bethany\u2019s face flushed with happiness and she automatically stared down at the ring on her left hand. And it was a gorgeous ring. Huge diamond but it didn\u2019t look gawdy at all. It was tastefully expensive and it suited her perfectly.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of, have you set a date yet?\u201d Josie asked.</p><p>Jace looked unhappy and Bethany laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it. I wasn\u2019t planning anything until you\u2019re completely recovered and can stand for me at my wedding.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s heart warmed and she smiled big, allowing her pleasure to show.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I\u2019m still in a cast. Don\u2019t wait on me! I don\u2019t want to delay your big day.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the same without you,\u201d Bethany said, putting her hand on Josie\u2019s. \u201cI want you all there. Brittany too! All the girls will be there. Caro has promised that she\u2019ll come even if it means flying in from Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Kai cleared his throat. \u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem. If Brittany and I are in Vegas by then we\u2019ll fly in on my jet and bring Brandon and Caro with us.\u201d</p><p>Josie\u2019s eyes widened and her gaze went to Brittany. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Vegas with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kai cut in before Brittany could answer.</p> <p>Ash\u2019s eyes narrowed but he kept silent. Josie had no doubt he\u2019d be talking to his sister later. And Kai as well.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Bethany said to Kai, ducking her face in shyness. \u201cIt means a lot that you\u2019ll make sure they get to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Kai said, a smile on his ruggedly handsome face. \u201cMaybe seeing you get married will entice Brittany to take the plunge again. Her last husband was a fool to let her go, but I won\u2019t make that same mistake.\u201d</p><p>Whoa. This guy was moving fast! Josie risked another look at Brittany to see her face drawn in consternation. It seemed as though Kai wanted to move fast and that Brittany wasn\u2019t quite on board yet. Her money was on Kai, though. He struck her as being a very determined man when he wanted something. Just like every other man in this room.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you all brought food with you?\u201d Josie asked hopefully. \u201cI\u2019m starving and all they\u2019ll give me is clear liquids, which means lots of jello and chicken broth.\u201d</p> <p>Ash sent her a look of reprimand. \u201cNo real food yet, baby. Not until tomorrow, and even then you\u2019ll start out slow.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt was worth a try. Maybe the girls will smuggle me in something when you\u2019re not looking.\u201d</p><p>As she said it, she sent a pleading look in the women\u2019s direction that had everyone laughing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on it,\u201d Mia said firmly, shooting Ash a glare.</p><p>Ash shook his head and rolled his eyes. \u201cJust remember you have to get by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to sleep sometime,\u201d Bethany said lightly. \u201cIf the smell of food just happens to wake you up, I\u2019m sure it will be from the next room.\u201d</p> <p>They all laughed and Josie felt lightness enter her chest. Things were going to be okay. She\u2019d get through this. The doctor had even said she could go home in the next day or two if everything continued to improve as it was doing currently. After so many days in the hospital she was ready to scream.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even been able to get out of the bed except to shower and pee. She was dying to get up and stretch. Anything but lying here in this bed all day.</p><p>They talked more, laughing, joking and chatting until Josie began to yawn, fatigue settling over her. Ash noticed and sent a not-so-subtle look in the others\u2019 direction. They immediately took the hint and announced they were leaving.</p><p>They crowded around Josie\u2019s bed, giving her gentle hugs and kisses. Even Kai dropped a kiss on her cheek before stepping back to anchor Brittany to his side.</p><p>\u201cI hate that you all are going so soon,\u201d Josie said mournfully. \u201cIt gets boring just lying here all day. I\u2019m about to climb the walls!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Mia promised. \u201cAnd we\u2019re bringing food!\u201d</p><p>Mia sent Ash another warning glare as she said the last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be looking forward to it!\u201d Josie said.</p> <p>Ash bent over her bed and kissed her softly on the mouth. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk them out, darling. But I\u2019ll be right back, okay? Want me to bring you something hot to drink? Doctor said you could have coffee or hot chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds heavenly,\u201d Josie sighed. \u201cCoffee would be perfect. I don\u2019t suppose you could bring me a latte?\u201d</p><p>Ash grinned. \u201cAnything for you. I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything except food you mean,\u201d Josie grumbled.</p><p>He caressed the side of her head and gave her an affectionate pat. \u201cAnything except food.\u201d</p><p>She waved him away and settled back against her pillows, sagging precariously to one side. The visit had exhausted her. Maybe she wasn\u2019t quite as recovered as she wanted to think. But she was glad they\u2019d all come.</p><p>Everyone filed out of the door and Ash turned back, sending her a look so filled with love that her breath caught in her throat. Then he turned, quietly closing the door behind him.</p><p>She sighed and closed her eyes, taking the opportunity for some rest. She\u2019d just drifted off when she heard her door open. Surely she hadn\u2019t slept that long. Ash hadn\u2019t had time to go down with his friends, get her coffee and get back so soon.</p><p>Two men in suits appeared in her doorway and she recognized them as the detectives that had questioned her right after she\u2019d been hospitalized. She didn\u2019t remember a whole lot about the interview. She\u2019d been groggy, in pain and doped up on pain medication. But maybe they\u2019d arrested Charles. This time she\u2019d done what she should have done when Michael assaulted her. She was pressing charges. She wanted Charles to go to jail for what he\u2019d done because she was terrified of what Ash might do to him.</p><p>\u201cMiss Carlysle, we\u2019d like to ask you a few questions, if you don\u2019t mind. Do you remember my partner, Clinton? I\u2019m Detective Starks. The last time we saw you was right after your attack. I wasn\u2019t sure how much you\u2019d remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you, Detective Starks. And no, I don\u2019t mind. Have you made an arrest yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we want to discuss with you,\u201d Starks said in an even tone.</p><p>The looks on their faces put Josie immediately on guard. She glanced between them, trying to gauge what was going on.</p><p>\u201cCharles Willis was found brutally murdered this morning,\u201d Starks said bluntly. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know who killed him.\u201d</p><p>Chapter thirty-six</p><p>Josie stared at the two policemen in shock. Fear raced through her veins. Oh God. Surely Ash hadn\u2019t . . . He wouldn\u2019t. Would he? Panic clutched her stomach and she had a hard time breathing, pain jolting through her chest with the effort.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Miss Carlysle?\u201d Clinton asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not all right,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cYou just told me that the man who assaulted me was murdered.\u201d And then another thought occurred to her. She glanced sharply at both detectives. \u201cYou said you want to find out who killed him. Surely you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a suspect. I\u2019m hardly capable of killing a man in my current condition.\u201d</p><p>But Ash would be a suspect. He\u2019d made no secret of his rage over what had happened. And worse, Josie couldn\u2019t immediately discount the notion that he could have done it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a suspect, now,\u201d Starks in a bland tone. \u201cBut Mr. McIntyre is. Can you tell me if you know of his whereabouts last night between seven and ten P.M.?\u201d</p><p>Relief surged, making her light-headed. She gripped the bed rail with her left hand because it felt like she\u2019d pitch right over the side. If that was the time they were asking about then Ash couldn\u2019t have done it because he had been with her.</p><p>\u201cHe was here with me,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cYou can ask any of the nurses who were on duty. He sat with me the entire night and slept on the couch over there.\u201d</p><p>Clinton was busy scribbling notes on a pocket notebook while Starks continued to stare at her until she shifted uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cPretty convenient that the man who attacked you turns up dead wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting at, detective?\u201d she snapped. \u201cIf you\u2019d done your job and arrested him, he wouldn\u2019t be dead now, would he? I\u2019ve already told you that Ash was with me. If you don\u2019t believe me, there are plenty of other people who can support his alibi.\u201d</p><p>Starks nodded slowly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be checking, absolutely. But what about Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Crestwell. Did you see either of them last night?\u201d</p><p>The blood seeped from her face. \u201cAre you crazy? Why would either of them kill Charles Willis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d Clinton interjected.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see them, but I\u2019m sure if you ask them they\u2019ll be able to tell you where they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we will,\u201d Starks said grimly.</p><p>The door opened and Ash walked in, abruptly halting when he took in the two police officers. Evidently he saw something on her face he didn\u2019t like because his expression became thunderous.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cMr. McIntyre,\u201d Starks acknowledged with a dip of his head. \u201cWe\u2019re questioning Miss Carlysle in the murder of Charles Willis.\u201d</p><p>Ash blinked, no expression betraying his thoughts. \u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Clinton nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ash said savagely.</p><p>Josie gasped. He wasn\u2019t helping matters any with his declaration. Now they\u2019d be convinced that Ash had something to do with it.</p><p>\u201cThey think you had something to do with it, Ash!\u201d</p><p>Ash arched one brow. \u201cDo they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem too torn up over the fact he\u2019s dead,\u201d Starks commented.</p><p>Ash turned his furious gaze on the detectives. \u201cTake a good look at her. Now you tell me, if that was your woman that he nearly beat to death, would you be upset that someone killed the bastard?\u201d</p><p>Clinton shifted uncomfortably and Starks had the grace to look abashed.</p><p>\u201cNot saying what I think,\u201d Starks replied. \u201cWhat I think doesn\u2019t matter and it doesn\u2019t change the fact that a crime was committed. I have to investigate it as I would any other murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d Ash said flatly. \u201cBut you leave Josie the fuck alone. You aren\u2019t to so much as look at her unless she has a lawyer present. Are we clear? Furthermore, if you want to speak to her again, you\u2019ll call me and set up an appointment and it won\u2019t be when she\u2019s in pain and about to drop from exhaustion. You\u2019ve upset her and that\u2019s the last thing she needs right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps you wouldn\u2019t mind stepping outside with us to answer a few questions,\u201d Starks said in a clipped tone.</p><p>\u201cI would mind,\u201d Ash bit back. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Josie. If you want to talk, I\u2019ll give you my lawyer\u2019s number and you can arrange an interview through him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this difficult,\u201d Clinton broke in. \u201cJust answer a few questions for us and we\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve already told you what you need to do if you want to talk to either of us again,\u201d Ash said flatly.</p><p>He fished in his wallet and then pulled out a card, handing it to Starks. Neither detective looked pleased, but they backed off.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be investigating you, Mr. McIntyre. If you had anything to do with Charles Willis\u2019s death, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d Starks said grimly.</p><p>\u201cMy life is an open book,\u201d Ash said in a calm voice. \u201cThough if you look into Charles Willis\u2019s business practices, you\u2019ll find your suspects. There is plenty of motive there. Do yourself a favor and spend your time looking into his dealings and not wasting it by looking into mine. You won\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for investigating me.\u201d</p><p>Clinton and Starks exchanged sharp glances.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Starks said to both Josie and Ash.</p><p>Then they turned and walked out. Ash followed, closing the door forcefully behind them.</p><p>He turned back, striding toward the bed, his expression fierce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, baby. Never thought they would have come in here like that. I\u2019m sorry I left you alone to deal with that. It won\u2019t happen again. If they show up, you aren\u2019t to talk to them without a lawyer present. If for some reason I\u2019m not with you, you call me immediately.\u201d</p><p>Her hand was shaking despite the grip she still had on the bed rail. Ash carefully pried her fingers away and cupped them in his hand, stroking soothingly with his thumb.</p><p>\u201cThey asked where you were last night between seven and ten,\u201d she said, her voice quivering. \u201cThey think you did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was here with you,\u201d Ash said in a soft voice.</p><p>\u201cI know. I told them that. But they still think . . . and they asked about Gabe and Jace. Ash you have to warn them. They think one of you did this. You didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d</p><p>Her voice had a pleading note she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>Ash slowly shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, baby. I was here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut did you have it done?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He leaned over and kissed her brow, leaving his lips there a long moment.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to. He stole from a lot of people. Fucked over a lot of people\u2014the wrong people\u2014in his business dealings. Once they found that out, his life wasn\u2019t worth a dime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave him a perplexed look when he stood back up. \u201cHow did they find out?\u201d</p><p>Ash smiled, but it wasn\u2019t a warm smile. She shivered at the darkness in his eyes. This was a man you didn\u2019t fuck with. No matter how he appeared. Laid-back, charming and easygoing, underneath that carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade was an intense man with unbreakable determination.</p><p>\u201cThey may have had a little help,\u201d he said in a dark tone.</p><p>She sucked in her breath as she stared back at Ash. \u201cSo you did have something to do with his murder.\u201d</p> <p>Ash shook his head. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t. If you\u2019re asking if I have blood on my hands then yeah, no doubt. I slipped the right information to the right people. What they did with it was up to them. I didn\u2019t kill him. Didn\u2019t have him killed. But I made it possible with the information I provided. I guess you have to decide if you can live with that. And me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she nodded, a little numb, but relieved too. She couldn\u2019t face the idea of Ash going to jail because of her. Of it ruining both their lives. Not when she planned a life with him.</p><p>\u201cHe deserved to die. He wasn\u2019t a good man. And that goes against everything I\u2019ve ever believed in. It\u2019s not for me to judge. Before I would have been appalled over justice being taken this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed me, Ash. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all good. Or all bad. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s either. It just is. You\u2019ve changed me. Made me better in some ways. Murky in others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to ever be touched by the gray areas I\u2019m immersed in, baby. I want you clean. I want you to shine, just like you always do. We\u2019ll never talk about this again. Don\u2019t ask and I\u2019m not going to say. You may know things\u2014I will not lie to you\u2014but you will not be confronted with them. Ever. Can you live with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d Ash said in a tight voice, filled with emotion. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve your love or your shine, but I want it because with you I can feel the sun. I don\u2019t want to go back to those shadows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cStay in the sun. With me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, darling. Nothing will touch our children, Josie. You have my word. Nothing ever touches you or our kids. Gabe or Jace, Mia and Bethany. You\u2019re my family. I\u2019d die for any one of you and you\u2019ll all stay in the sun where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou belong there too, Ash. And I want you there with me.\u201d</p> <p>She broke off, frowning as she realized what he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cWait, are we having children?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, slow and sexy, his eyes knowing. Arrogance and male confidence radiated in waves. \u201cYou\u2019re having my babies, Josie. Bank on that. How many is up to you. I want boys first. And then a little girl. Because she\u2019ll need big brothers who\u2019ll always look out for her. They\u2019ll be different from my brothers. They\u2019ll give a shit. We\u2019ll be a real family.\u201d</p><p>Josie sent him a tender smile, full of her love for him. \u201cYeah. We\u2019ll be a real family. I want six. Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>Ash looked dumbstruck. \u201cSix? Holy shit, woman. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of knocking you up I gotta do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded solemnly. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should get started?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be an old bastard when you have the last one. But you have to get well and out of the hospital before we start working on that first baby.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out a tiny box.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to do this at just the perfect moment,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cBut I can\u2019t think of a more perfect time than when we\u2019re talking about our kids and how many we\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>He opened the box and Josie gasped as she stared down at a gorgeous diamond ring. It sparkled and caught the sunlight streaming through her window, dazzling her with its brilliance.</p><p>He lowered himself to one knee beside her bed and gently took her left hand in his.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me, Josie? Have my babies and put up with me for the rest of your life? No one will ever love you more than me and I\u2019m going to spend every day for the rest of my life making sure you know that.\u201d</p><p>The ring wobbled and went blurry in her vision as he slid it onto her finger.</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh yes, Ash! I\u2019ll marry you. I love you so much. And I want those babies. Lots of babies.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and pushed himself back up so he could lean over, gathering her carefully in his arms. He kissed her tenderly, her heart melting.</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Josie. Never want you to doubt that. I have a lot to make up for and I\u2019m working on that right now. But it\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re out of the hospital and home where I can fuss over you and spoil you rotten.\u201d</p><p>She reached up with her left hand to cup his cheek, her ring sparkling on her finger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that, my love.\u201d</p><p>Chapter thirty-seven</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this for me,\u201d Josie said in awe as she stared at the very full ballroom of the Bentley Hotel.</p><p>Ash wrapped his arm around her and squeezed her tightly against him. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, baby. It\u2019s all you. They love your work. You\u2019re going to sell out in the first half hour. A bidding war has begun over your erotic series of paintings.\u201d</p><p>Josie took in the glittering array of people who were admiring her work while drinking very expensive champagne. Everyone was here. The mayor, oh my God. And there were celebrities everywhere! She was agog at the names of some of the people in attendance. And they were here for her paintings!</p><p>She glanced back up at Ash and leaned further into him. \u201cDo you hate that they\u2019re seeing those paintings of me? I know you didn\u2019t like showing them and wanted to be the only one to see them.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and dropped a kiss on her upturned lips. \u201cI have the real thing. What do I need the paintings for? They only get to imagine what they can\u2019t see in those paintings, but I get to see it and touch it every night. That\u2019s only for me. No one else will ever have that.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back, delighted at his response.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you ever venture into something more revealing, then yeah, I\u2019m going to buy those. I don\u2019t care what you say. Nobody but me gets to see you completely naked.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and elbowed him in the ribs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. That\u2019s the extent of the bravery I have concerning me in the buff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank fuck,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t want to have to beat the asses of any men who drool over you in a painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh look, there\u2019re the girls!\u201d Josie exclaimed, breaking away from Ash to go and greet them.</p><p>\u201cJosie!\u201d Brittany cried, engulfing Josie in a huge hug. \u201cYou\u2019re famous! Have you seen all the people here going bananas over your paintings?\u201d</p><p>Josie hugged her back and smiled up at Kai who stood indulgently to the side while Brittany attacked Josie.</p><p>Mia and Bethany shoved past Gabe and Jace the minute Brittany let Josie go and hugged her fiercely.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, you guys look gorgeous!\u201d Josie said, surveying the cocktail dresses worn by each. \u201cAnd your shoes!\u201d Her voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cI know what you guys will be doing later!\u201d</p><p>They all laughed and then Mia said, \u201cHey, where\u2019s the champagne! We need to get our drink on!\u201d</p><p>The men groaned but there wasn\u2019t a single one who didn\u2019t have a smug gleam in his eyes. Yeah, they knew what they were getting later. Josie hoped to have her own after-party romp between the sheets with Ash.</p><p>He\u2019d been exceedingly gentle and patient during her recovery. She\u2019d eventually had to jump him because he\u2019d refused to so much as touch her, much less have sex with her, until he was absolutely certain she was healed. And he still hadn\u2019t done more than make sweet, exquisite love to her, not that she was complaining. But she was eager to resume a normal sexual relationship with her dominant man.</p><p>She could see in his eyes the desire not to remind her of what had happened. He\u2019d been extremely careful, worried that he would somehow be correlated with the assault on her. But she loved that edge, that fine line between too far and not enough. She wanted it back. Wanted him to lose his tightly held control and to unleash his dark hungers on the both of them.</p><p>She shivered just thinking about it. Tonight. Definitely tonight she\u2019d give him no option. She wanted everything he could give her. Wanted to feel the snap of leather against her ass. Wanted him to tie her up and have his wicked way with her. She wanted Ash back!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to steal Josie and take her around the room. I want to introduce her to a few people. Drink up and we\u2019ll be back in a few minutes,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>The girls waved and then turned back to their own men who were more than happy to get them back. Ash led her through the crowd, stopping and introducing her to people she could barely stammer hello to.</p><p>She was tongue-tied and had no idea what to say to the people who gushed about her work. She\u2019d never dreamed that anyone would be that excited over her paintings. And she had Ash to thank.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, slipping her arm around his waist as they threaded back through the crowd. \u201cThis is the most awesome night of my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re enjoying yourself, darling. This is your night to shine. But don\u2019t worry because there will be many more. Judging by how fast your paintings have sold, you\u2019re going to be in high demand. I may regret doing this because you\u2019re going to be spending all your time painting and you\u2019ll forget all about me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and hugged him tighter. \u201cNo chance of that. You\u2019ll always come first, Ash.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, long and lingeringly, uncaring of the people in the crowded ballroom. She sighed, blissfully happy. So much had happened over the last two months. She\u2019d been released from the hospital after having to stay for nearly two weeks. The police had questioned her and Ash, this time with his lawyer present. They\u2019d also questioned Gabe and Jace and had combed through Ash\u2019s life, leaving no stone unturned. But there had been nothing to find.</p><p>Then they\u2019d turned their attention to Charles Willis\u2019s business practices and it was there that they\u2019d struck a gold mine. He\u2019d stolen from numerous people. Embezzled money. Set up fake accounts. He\u2019d billed for work never done, and at least three offshore accounts had been discovered with millions of dollars in stolen money.</p><p>Worse was the people he\u2019d stolen from. They weren\u2019t exactly the legitimate businessmen that Ash and his partners were. They were not the kind of people you steal from because, if discovered, it wasn\u2019t jail time you had to worry about. As Charles had no doubt discovered far too late. He even had ties to the mob, and Josie hadn\u2019t even realized the mob still existed outside of books and movies.</p><p>The police had investigated one man in particular, convinced that he was behind Charles\u2019s murder, but had been frustrated by their inability to pin anything on him. As a result, the case was still open, but Ash was no longer a suspect.</p><p>Josie had breathed much easier when the police backed off. She knew Ash hadn\u2019t been directly behind Charles\u2019s death, but he had been involved to an extent. But as he\u2019d promised that day in the hospital, they never spoke of it again, and she didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>Maybe that made her just as murky and gray as Ash thought he was himself, but she couldn\u2019t spare any real remorse over Charles\u2019s death. He\u2019d hurt a lot of people and she could have died from the beating she\u2019d received. She was ready to move on with her life. With Ash.</p><p>\u201cHave something I want to ask you, baby,\u201d Ash murmured next to her ear.</p><p>She looked up, curious as to why he sounded so serious all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cJace and Bethany have asked if we want to get married with them. A double wedding. I told them I\u2019d discuss it with you. It\u2019s something they\u2019d really like. Jace is impatient and wants the wedding to be soon. But I don\u2019t want us to do it with them if you want or need more time. If you want your own big day separate from theirs, I understand. I want it to be special for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you?\u201d Josie asked softly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Ash smiled. \u201cAll I want out of the deal is you. Nothing else matters. Don\u2019t care where it happens or when, though I\u2019m not a fan of waiting very long. I want you to have my name. For me to know you\u2019re legally mine. How we do it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would be really special to share a wedding with Jace and Bethany,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s your best friend and I adore Bethany. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou okay with getting married soon?\u201d Ash asked. \u201cJace wants it done as soon as possible. He thought about hitting a beach somewhere. Maybe go to Bora-Bora and get married on the sand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat sounds so romantic,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t care when or where either, Ash. I just want to be married to you. Anything else is just icing on the cake.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cLet\u2019s go tell them, then. We need to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>She hooked her arm through his as they made their way back to where their friends stood together across the room. Their friends. Not just Ash\u2019s. These people were hers too and it filled her heart with warmth.</p><p>Brittany was over the moon with Kai. She\u2019d already moved to Vegas with him but they visited the city often. Josie was glad that Ash had at least his sister. The rest of his family had backed off after he\u2019d called his grandfather. He still didn\u2019t know what the old man was going to do with his will, but Ash had done what he\u2019d promised and then washed his hands of them all.</p> <p>But Brittany and he were close now and she spent a lot of time with Josie and Ash. But his real family stood just a few feet away. Gabe, Jace, Mia, Bethany. Her family too.</p><p>They erupted in cheers when Ash announced that he and Josie would be getting married with Jace and Bethany. Then champagne was passed around again.</p><p>\u201cHope you\u2019ll also come to mine and Brittany\u2019s wedding,\u201d Kai interjected with a smug grin. \u201cOnly just talked her into it today.\u201d</p><p>Brittany held up a huge diamond engagement ring that Josie hadn\u2019t noticed until now. Her face was flushed with happiness and her eyes glittered brightly.</p><p>\u201cA double toast, then,\u201d Ash said, holding his glass up. \u201cTo Josie and her success. And to Brittany and Kai.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone held up their glasses, noisily clinking them together before downing the bubbly liquid.</p><p>\u201cTo girlfriends,\u201d Mia called out, holding her glass up to Josie, Bethany and Brittany.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that!\u201d Bethany exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cAnd here\u2019s to us providing the guys many more girls\u2019 nights out,\u201d Josie said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d Ash said.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Jace put in.</p> <p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Gabe said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely fly Brittany in for the occasion,\u201d Kai said, his eyes twinkling with amusement.</p><p>Josie pulled Brittany and Bethany to her side, hugging them both while Mia slid in next to Bethany. They raised their glasses.</p><p>\u201cTo girls\u2019 night out!\u201d they chorused. </p> </body></html>"]
