She\u2019d sat on this very bench, musing on the fact that even the ducks couldn\u2019t be nonviolent as her mind fought frantically to find a way out of the mess in which she\u2019d found herself\u2014a mess that had seen her tracking a mad archangel for another immortal as lethal.</p><p>Shimmering white-gold over her vision as she lifted her eyes to the sky, an echo of that fateful day. \u201cHello, Archangel.\u201d</p><p>Raphael folded away his wings, his eyes on the ducks. \u201cWhy do you find them so fascinating?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I just like this spot.\u201d Her own wings uncomfortably squashed against the seat built for humans and vampires, she rose to her feet. \u201cThough I think you need to sponsor a new bench over there.\u201d She pointed to a beautiful spot across the way; it\u2019d be shaded by the delicate green leaves of a flowering cherry tree in summer, the soft pink blooms in spring. Right now, with winter\u2019s kiss in the air, the tree was all bone, stark against the evergreens.</p><p>\u201cIt will be done,\u201d Raphael said with a cool arrogance that made her want to drag him back to bed. \u201cYou realize you\u2019re capable of sponsoring many such benches?\u201d</p><p>Elena blinked as she always did when she remembered she was rolling in it. Not in comparison to older immortals, of course, and way below Raphael\u2019s league, but her personal fortune was more than respectable when it came to a fledgling immortal. Earned in the hunt that had broken her back, made her bleed until her throat filled with the iron dark fluid, and brought Raphael into her life, the money was currently amassing ridiculous amounts of interest in her Guild account.</p><p>\u201cDamn\u201d\u2014she whistled\u2014\u201cI need to start thinking like a rich chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be most amused to watch this transformation.\u201d</p> <p>Narrowing her eyes, she said, \u201cJust you wait. Before you know it, I\u2019ll be one of the angels who lunch.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, her dangerous lover who wore his strength as a second skin and had a face of such violent masculine beauty that she was stunned anew each time she realized he belonged to her. Hair of darkest midnight and eyes of a painful blue found nowhere else on this earth, Raphael was a man blooded with power\u2014no one would ever mistake him for anything but what he was: an archangel who had the capacity to snuff out a life as easily as she might crush an ant.</p><p>The wings that arced over his shoulders only deepened the sense of dangerous temptation. His feathers were white, but for fine filaments of pure gold that caught the eye and the light. Flawless wings, but for the astonishing \u201cscar\u201d of golden feathers where she\u2019d once shot him. A few months back, his primaries, too, had begun to turn gold, only for the process to continue past yellow-gold and to a glittering metallic white. Now the sun caught on those primaries as he laughed, igniting an illusion of white fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said after the laughter faded, \u201cI have some news that may regretfully turn your attention in another direction.\u201d</p><p>Put on guard by his tone, she ignored the people in the distance whose mouths had dropped open at the sight of Raphael\u2019s amusement, the Archangel of New York not known for laughter. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two pieces of . . . interesting news.\u201d</p> <p>Elena\u2019s stomach dropped. \u201cLijuan?\u201d According to Raphael\u2019s spymaster, the batshit old archangel was creating reborn again, if only in small numbers. Lijuan called it giving \u201clife,\u201d but her walking dead servants were nightmares, a plague upon the world\u2014and the worst thing was, many of them knew it, their eyes screaming for help even as their bodies shuffled to follow the commands of their mistress.</p><p>Then there were the strange desiccated bodies found near her stronghold that no one could figure out. The general consensus was that they were failed attempts at creating reborn, but whether that was good news or bad news was anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cShe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head before she could complete her question, the black silk of his hair rich and dark. \u201cMy mother,\u201d he said, \u201chas invited us to a ball.\u201d</p><p>Elena pulled a blade from one of the butter-soft forearm sheaths that had been a gift from Raphael. \u201cExcuse me while I stab myself in the eyes\u2014and disembowel myself while I\u2019m at it.\u201d The last time Elena had attended an immortal ball, she\u2019d ended up bathing in the blood of the reborn while Beijing burned around her. And oh yeah, let\u2019s not forget smashing to the earth after being ripped out of the sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I cannot permit that,\u201d Raphael said, in what she thought of as his \u201cArchangel\u201d voice, formal and ruthless. \u201cWho would then keep me amused at the ball? I may otherwise be driven to pluck out my own eyes and I believe you are quite fond of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Sighing, she leaned her head against the muscled strength of his arm, his skin bared by the brown fighting leathers that told her he\u2019d come from a sparring session, likely with Illium. \u201cWhy is Caliane having a ball?\u201d</p><p>He spread his wing across her own in a susurration of sound that was a familiar intimacy. \u201cHer city and people have fully awakened, and she wishes to formally greet the other powers in the world.\u201d A pause. \u201cMy mother may have been many things, but the one thing she has never been is impolite; as an Ancient, she is cognizant of her responsibility to take a part in the ruling of the world, even if it is from a distance.\u201d</p><p>Complex, intelligent, once-insane, Raphael\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t a woman who could be put easily into any kind of a category. The Ancient had left her son broken and bloodied on a forsaken field an eon ago, but she\u2019d also risen perilously early from a centuries-long Sleep to save the life of that same son. \u201cWhen\u2019s the ball?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn less than two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure my jewels are glittering and my nails done.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s lips curved again as she slid away the knife and held out her hands to display unpolished nails clipped hunter-short. The back of her left hand was bruised from a tussle with a recalcitrant vampire she\u2019d retrieved for the Guild a few hours before, and her palms, when she flipped over her hands, proved to have a plethora of calluses.</p><p>Even her newly immortal body couldn\u2019t erase those calluses, not when she worked constantly with weapons. \u201cI don\u2019t think a manicure is going to cut it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould you ever touch me with court-softened hands, I will know an imposter walks in your skin.\u201d</p><p>Some women might\u2019ve taken his words as an insult; they made Elena want to initiate a very public, very hot kiss. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, promising herself she\u2019d indulge that particular need as soon as they were alone, \u201cwhat\u2019s the other piece of news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should take your weapons first.\u201d</p><p>Elena tried to think of what could be worse than attending a ball with the most powerful, most vicious angels and vampires in the world, and came up with, \u201cMy father wants to have dinner with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not Jeffrey.\u201d The suddenly brutal angle of his jawline made his opinion of her father clear. \u201cCome, we cannot talk of this where we may be overheard.\u201d Stepping a little away from her, his wing sliding off her own, he said, \u201cDo you wish to attempt a vertical takeoff?\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the number of witnesses, pitted that fact against the straining effort it would take for her to get aloft. That teeth-gritting struggle would betray weakness in a way that would reflect not only on her, but on Raphael\u2014and an archangel could never be seen as weak, for the sake of mortals and immortals alike.</p><p>In all probability, she\u2019d have made a different choice even a few months ago, she\u2019d been fighting so hard to retain her sense of self in the new world into which she\u2019d been thrust. Now she understood far more about the intricacies of the balance of power in the world, understood, too, that while Raphael might occasionally frustrate her with his protectiveness, he had no desire to clip her wings.</p><p>\u201cNo, not here.\u201d Walking into his arms, she folded back her wings, and he took them effortlessly into the air, his hold steel around her waist, his heartbeat strong and steady.</p><p>Crashing waves and the salt-laced sea, rain clean and bright, that was Raphael\u2019s mental scent and it lingered in her every breath, made her body ache. Always, he made her ache. Shifting slightly in his hold, she pressed her lips to his throat, felt his pulse speed up.</p><p>\u201cWould you dance with me above Manhattan?\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught at the sensual murmur, the idea of their bodies and wings intertwined in the rawly sexual act pure adrenaline in her blood. \u201cNot yet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that brave.\u201d Raphael might possess the archangelic ability to shield them from all sight, but she would still be able to see the city below. \u201cI like dancing with you above the sea.\u201d Loved feeling the sheer power of him as they plummeted from lethal heights to hit the water. \u201cTonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am seduced.\u201d Easing his hold above the cloud layer, he claimed her mouth for a darkly passionate kiss that made her breasts tighten, her body eager for the wild promise of the night. \u201cReady?\u201d he asked when their lips parted, his body hard against her own.</p><p>At her nod, he removed his arm from around her waist and she fell through the gossamer kiss of the clouds . . . to unfold her wings and circle up on an updraft, the exhilaration of flight in no way lessened by the fact that she\u2019d had a year to get used to the astonishing wonder of it. Is it urgent? she asked. What we have to discuss?</p><p>Not so urgent that we cannot fly.</p><p>Looking up, she watched him wing his way higher and higher with breathtaking ease, until he was a faraway dot in the sky . . . then felt her heart stop as he dropped, a sleek arrow of white-gold that shot past her, accelerating until she could see people screaming in the park below. A second before what would\u2019ve been terminal impact for a mortal, Raphael spread his wings and shot back up.</p><p>You terrified everyone. Her own pulse was in her mouth, her blood thunder in her ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Humans need to be terrified every so often. It keeps them from crossing lines that shouldn\u2019t be crossed.</p><p>You ever think maybe archangels should be challenged once in a while? she countered. That it\u2019d take care of the whole arrogance issue?</p><p>Anyone may challenge me.</p> <p>When he executed a turn toward the Hudson, Elena followed, the river winds riffling through the strands of hair that had escaped her braid. How can people challenge you when they\u2019re so afraid?</p><p>It didn\u2019t stop you.</p><p>Well, he did have her there. But\u2014I\u2019ve always had a dash of crazy in me.</p><p>Flying wing to wing with him, she swept out over the water, following the river north, before turning to head to their house in the Angel Enclave. Situated along the cliffs on the opposite side of the Hudson from Manhattan, it was a magnificent building that offered sweeping views of the city, but for Elena, it was simply home.</p><p>Montgomery has prepared something special for you. Do not break his heart.</p> <p>Elena grinned at the thought of the butler. You know Montgomery and I have a mutual love affair. Coming down on her feet on the still-green grass of the lawn that ended in a steep drop into the Hudson, she watched Raphael land, his wingspan incredible.</p><p>\u201cA storm,\u201d he murmured, his eyes on the clouds that had begun to boil over Manhattan. \u201cIt grew quickly.\u201d</p><p>So quickly that she hadn\u2019t noticed anything while in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s not another Ancient waking up, is it?\u201d she asked, the tiny hairs on her arms standing up at the memory of the last time the city had suffered inclement weather.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said to her relief. \u201cIt\u2019d be an extraordinary thing for two to rise within the span of a year\u2014this is likely nothing but the first lash of winter. Still, we will watch to make certain. We cannot forget that the Cascade is in full effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and it\u2019s not exactly a flowers-and-butterflies kind of thing.\u201d The Cascade, according to everything they\u2019d been able to discover, was a confluence of time and certain critical events that led to a surge of power in the Cadre. All of the archangels would grow in strength, some might be touched with madness, but none would remain the same. Neither would the world, for the archangels were part of its very fabric.</p><p>\u201cDoes the second thing you want to discuss have to do with the Cascade?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Those eyes of endless blue met her own. \u201cMichaela has asked permission to remain for an extended period in my territory.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cOh, hell no.\u201d The female archangel had made it clear she considered Elena something lesser, a bug to be ground beneath her designer boot. \u201cWhat makes her think I\u2019d want her in my city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe Michaela thought of you at all.\u201d Brutal words from her archangel, but Elena knew the anger wasn\u2019t directed at her.</p><p>\u201cMichaela,\u201d he continued, his tone as cold as a scalpel slicing across the throat, \u201cwould\u2019ve had a better chance of receiving my assistance had she not insulted my consort in the asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact we\u2019re discussing this means you\u2019re considering her request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wishes sanctuary because she is with child.\u201d</p><p>Shock rooted Elena to the spot. It suddenly made sense, why the woman many considered the most beautiful in the world hadn\u2019t been spotted in the media for at least two months, when she\u2019d always loved that kind of attention. \u201cWhat about the father of her child?\u201d she asked at last. \u201cI assume it\u2019s Dahariel?\u201d At Raphael\u2019s nod, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s a powerful angel in his own right, second to an archangel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichaela might\u2019ve slept with Dahariel, but she doesn\u2019t trust him not to stab her in the back while she is vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Elena couldn\u2019t imagine such a situation. She knew Raphael would fight to the death to protect her if and when they decided to try for a child. \u201cWill she be? Vulnerable?\u201d Michaela wasn\u2019t an archangel simply in name\u2014she had the blinding power to go with it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Raphael\u2019s eyes followed a squadron of angels coming in to land at the Tower, their bodies angled to slice through the rising wind. \u201cPregnancy can be difficult for archangels. Michaela\u2019s power will remain, but her hold on it may become erratic. It is why a consort is so necessary during this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t have mine,\u201d Elena said, well aware Michaela was cunning enough to use her condition to further her aim of gaining Raphael for a lover. \u201cWon\u2019t Dahariel consider it an insult if she chooses your protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He isn\u2019t yet her consort.\u201d</p><p>Much as she disliked Michaela, Elena couldn\u2019t help but think of the anguish she\u2019d once witnessed on the other woman\u2019s face, the unutterable pain of a mother who\u2019d lost a child. \u201cWe can\u2019t say no, can we?\u201d</p><p>Raphael cupped her cheek, brushing his thumb over her cheekbone. \u201cYour heart is too soft, Guild Hunter. I can and will say no if that is needed.\u201d His eyes glowed incandescent, the flames lightning blue. \u201cI have not forgotten that she has attempted to hurt you more than once.\u201d</p><p>Instinct urged Elena to push him to decide exactly that; nothing good could come of having Michaela nearby. However, this wasn\u2019t only about the female archangel and her machinations, but about the innocent she carried in her womb. \u201cI would never forgive myself if we said no and then she lost the child in an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere the situations reversed, you know she would leave you in the streets to starve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Michaela.\u201d It was a line in the sand, one she would not cross.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re far more than she will ever be.\u201d He dropped his hand with a single hard kiss, his eyes returning to the gathering storm. \u201cI\u2019ll consider her request\u2014and I\u2019ll consider the rules should I grant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely don\u2019t want her in the house next door.\u201d There was a difference between showing compassion for a vulnerable woman, and stupidity. \u201cIf\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something soft slammed to the ground in front of them.</p><p>Startled, Elena looked down to see a bloodied pigeon. \u201cPoor thing.\u201d From what she could see when she crouched down, its neck had snapped in a sudden, violent death. \u201cIt must\u2019ve suffered damage to its wings in the air, been unable to stay aloft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not think it is that simple,\u201d Raphael said, as she was thinking they should bury the dead bird in the woods that bordered the house on either side.</p><p>Looking up, she followed Raphael\u2019s gaze to see hundreds of tiny splashes in the Hudson, the air above dark with a swirling cloud that had become fat and black. Another bird landed on the very edge of the cliff, its wing lifting limply before it slipped off the rocks and into the water.</p><p>\u201cThis storm,\u201d Raphael said softly on the heels of a third bird hitting the ground at Elena\u2019s feet, its tiny body broken, feathers matted a dull red from the crushing impact, \u201cis not so ordinary after all.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Elena stood inside their home, staring out at the world through the sliding glass doors of the library. That world had gone insane. Birds continued to fall from the sky, the \u201ccloud\u201d created of thousands upon thousands of their tiny forms. Elena\u2019s instincts urged her to do something, stop the terrible rain, but there was nothing she could do.</p><p>The river had quickly emptied where the birds circled, and Elena hoped most people caught under the edge of the massive cloud that now encompassed part of Manhattan would have the good sense to duck under shelter, or into the subways to escape the bombardment.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of anything like this?\u201d she asked the archangel beside her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014\u201d Words slicing off in midthought, he slid open the doors. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you\u2014\u201d Her question caught in her throat as she realized the wings above and crashing into the Hudson were suddenly far bigger than those of the dying birds.</p><p>Angels were falling from the skies.</p><p>Though the urge to follow Raphael as he dove off toward the water filled with broken wings was a drumbeat in her skull, Elena forced herself to use her brain. The birds were falling at speeds akin to a fastball, complete with sharp beaks that would shred wings if they hit at the wrong angle, and she wasn\u2019t powerful enough to survive many of those hits in the air, nor agile enough in flight to avoid them. She\u2019d only be a liability out there.</p><p>But she could be an asset here. \u201cMontgomery!\u201d she cried, running out of the library.</p><p>The butler ran out into the central core of the house just as she reached it. \u201cGuild Hunter?\u201d He was dressed in his usual impeccable black suit, but his eyes held the same disbelief that was ice in Elena\u2019s blood.</p><p>\u201cWe need to set up an infirmary,\u201d she said. \u201cRaphael is closer to this side of the river and likely to bring the fallen here.\u201d She looked around the central core\u2014it was huge by any measure, but angelic wings took up space, and they had no way of knowing the number of injured about to come in. \u201cWe\u2019ll start here, but we might also have to rig up something in the yard. It\u2019ll have to be strong enough to block the birds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get things under way.\u201d The butler disappeared in a startling rush of speed that was a silent reminder that beneath his dignity and plummy British accent, Montgomery was deadlier than any vamp she\u2019d ever hunted.</p><p>Her cell phone rang as she was about to make her way to the cliffs\u2014if she could help haul the injured inside, then Raphael could focus on rescue. Glancing at the screen as she ran to the doors, she saw it was her best friend. \u201cSara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, we have angels hitting the streets.\u201d Stark shock, but below that was the steely strength that made Sara head of a guild formed of some of the most lethal men and women in the country. \u201cOur people are rendering aid where they can, but I have reports of angels hanging broken off gargoyles on skyscrapers and stuck on church steeples.\u201d</p><p>Elena blew out a shuddering breath at the horrendous images. \u201cCall the Tower.\u201d She rattled off a number that\u2019d give Sara direct access to Aodhan. \u201cIf he\u2019s out of action\u201d\u2014dear God\u2014\u201csomeone else will be there to cover.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hanging up without further words, confident Sara would understand, Elena ran across a lawn scattered with bloodied birds, their eyes filmed over with the oblivion of death. However, the tiny corpses were far enough apart that it was clear both the house and the grounds were under the very edge of the affected zone. Fear a metallic taste on her tongue, she hoped the deaths had been caused by the impact, and not by the reason for the fall, because, unlike the birds, an angel could survive countless broken bones.</p><p>\u201cI have him!\u201d she called out to Raphael as he came in, an angel in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not breathing, his back is broken, and his heart has stopped.\u201d Putting the lithely muscled angel on the clifftop, Raphael swept off, but his mind remained connected to her own. Tell Montgomery to take medical measures\u2014the male is too young to survive otherwise.</p> <p>I will. Hauling one of the angel\u2019s thankfully unbroken arms over her shoulders\u2014ignoring the conventional teachings about broken backs because this wasn\u2019t a mortal\u2014she gritted her teeth and got to her feet. The victim\u2019s shattered body was soaked from his fall, his wings dead weight. It was as well that as a born hunter, she\u2019d always been stronger than most humans. Her growing immortality had only cemented that strength.</p><p>Still, she was glad to see Montgomery race out to take the angel\u2019s weight on the other side, neither one of them flinching as two birds hit their backs hard enough to bruise. \u201cMedical measures,\u201d she managed to get out as they traversed the distance to the house as fast as possible; she hadn\u2019t known until now that there were any medical measures\u2014at least of the ordinary kind\u2014that could be applied to angels.</p><p>More of the household staff, and a number of unaffected angels from other parts of the Enclave, ran or flew past them as they took the injured angel in through doors that led directly into the central core. The space that a couple of minutes earlier had been all shining wooden floors, an elegant statuette set against the wall, was now a temporary hospital.</p><p>A young vampire Montgomery had taken on as his apprentice was throwing down large futons that must\u2019ve come out of storage, and a slender angel\u2014Sivya\u2014who was normally in charge of the kitchens, was snapping open a large black leather bag that looked like an old-fashioned medical kit.</p><p>As soon as they laid the angel on a futon, Sivya stabbed a large-bore needle directly into his heart and depressed the plunger. Elena had a thousand questions, but now wasn\u2019t the time to ask them, Montgomery beside her as they raced back out. When she saw wings of silver-blue rising into the air after dropping off a victim, she felt an intense sense of relief . . . mingled with horror as she realized exactly how many winged bodies floated in the murky waters of the Hudson.</p> <p>Another bird hit her as they ran, the beak carving a line down her face, but she shook it off and kept going. On their second trip inside, she heard a cough, saw the first angel they\u2019d rescued retching on his side. His left wing and legs were mangled\u2014but at least he was alive.</p><p>Leaving their current charge in Sivya\u2019s hands, she ran back out with Montgomery at her side. It felt like an eternity, but she would later find out the actual hell of what came to be known as the Falling lasted five short minutes. Then the birds stopped dropping from the skies . . . and so did the angels.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Four hours later and they finally had some real numbers. Eight hundred and eighty-seven angels had gone down over the city in that horrific period no one would ever forget. Eight hundred and two of the fallen had been part of the two-thousand-strong defensive force stationed at the Tower, the remaining eighty-five composed of nonwarrior angels, visitors to the city, and two couriers who\u2019d had the bad luck to come in just as things went horribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cAll of the injured,\u201d Aodhan told Raphael, as the three of them stood on the railingless balcony outside Raphael\u2019s Tower office, the sky above painted in the fiery palette of an agonizingly stunning sunset, \u201chave been retrieved.\u201d</p><p>Raphael, his wings and clothes streaked with blood, glanced at the angel who was made of fractured pieces of light. Each strand of Aodhan\u2019s hair appeared coated with crushed diamonds, his wings so brilliant as to hurt mortal eyes under sunlight, his irises shattered outward from the pupil in splinters of crystalline blue and green.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve checked the fallen against the master list we keep of all angels stationed at the Tower or otherwise resident in the area.\u201d Aodhan resettled his wings, light sparking off the faceted filaments of his feathers. \u201cIllium has accounted for all visitors\u2014and we\u2019ve had no reports from the Guild\u2019s network of informants about unrecovered angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many did we lose?\u201d Elena didn\u2019t want to ask the question; her hands fisted in rejection. Angels might be immortal in the eyes of humans, but they could be killed . . . the younger they were, the easier they died. A destroyed heart, a broken spine paired with significant internal injuries, decapitation: none of that would kill Raphael, but inflict the same physical insult on a newly adult angel and the outcome would be lethal.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s face was stripped of all emotion as he waited for Aodhan\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d the angel answered. \u201cIt was the secondary trauma that caused the deaths, not the inciting incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Raphael ordered.</p><p>Aodhan\u2019s voice was quiet, his words violent. \u201cAn impalement on a spire where the heart and spine were both destroyed almost simultaneously\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStavre. He was on his first placement. A bare hundred and fifty.\u201d</p><p>Jaw clenched against the injustice of it, Elena made herself listen as Aodhan completed the recitation, his tone without emotion, but she knew the words he spoke must cut like razors.</p><p>First, he named the fallen, then said, \u201cTwo died as a result of decapitation combined with major heart damage when they fell into traffic in front of vehicles that couldn\u2019t stop in time; another was decapitated after she hit the sharp corner of a building, her body breaking into multiple pieces on impact with the street; and we lost the last when he fell into a rooftop exhaust system.\u201d A pause. \u201cThe humans did all they could, but the velocity of his fall into the blades meant there was no hope of survival. His body was sliced into shreds.\u201d</p><p>Five out of the nearly three thousand angels in and around the city at any one time. It didn\u2019t sound so bad . . . until you realized that angels didn\u2019t reproduce as humans did. Only a single, cherished child might be born in the space of a decade. A century might go by without any new births. The loss of five angels in the prime of their lives was an unspeakable tragedy.</p><p>\u201cThey must have an escort home.\u201d At that moment, Raphael was very much the Archangel of New York, a leader icily furious at the loss of his people. \u201cContact Nimra,\u201d he said, naming an angel Elena knew to be a power within the territory. \u201cShe will understand what must be done.\u201d</p><p>And her presence, Elena realized, would be a sign of respect and honor from an archangel to his fallen soldiers.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Aodhan inclined his head, the rain clouds that had begun to creep across the sunset doing nothing to dull the glittering shine of his hair.</p><p>\u201cThe injured?\u201d Raphael asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re moving them all to dedicated floors inside the Tower. The transfer will be complete by midnight.\u201d</p><p>Raphael, his wings glowing in a silent testament to his rage, continued to stare at a city that had gone eerily silent. No horns blew, no brakes screeched, no one fought, the events of this day so nightmarish as to erase the petty problems of life.</p><p>\u201cStatus?\u201d he asked after several minutes.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred and fourteen required emergency medical intervention as a result of life-threatening injuries,\u201d Aodhan answered, \u201cand will be down for months. The rest have broken bones, and most will need at least four weeks to recover.\u201d</p><p>Despite explanations, Elena didn\u2019t quite understand the drug used today, except that the closest human analog was epinephrine, though the two weren\u2019t identical. According to Montgomery, the drug was a last-ditch option, because while it could kick-start the self-healing process in a badly injured angel\u2014when that angel\u2019s body might otherwise simply shut down\u2014it had one very bad side effect: it extended the normal recovery time by months.</p><p>After seeing the stuff revive an angel who\u2019d been all but decapitated, his head attached to his body by the gleaming wetness of his spinal column alone, and his lower body torn off to leave him a bloody stump, Elena didn\u2019t have any argument with the drug.</p><p>\u201cThe Tower-based healers were able to speak to a number of the injured who regained consciousness,\u201d Aodhan added, the world turning to twilight as the clouds succeeded in hiding the last rays of the sun. \u201cThey all report a sudden sense of dizziness, followed by unconsciousness before they could land.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Aodhan when Raphael didn\u2019t respond, Elena spoke with her eyes. Unlike with Illium, her relationship with this member of Raphael\u2019s Seven was new yet, but he was one of the most empathic angels she\u2019d ever met. Now, he gave a small nod and disappeared inside the Tower.</p><p>\u201cAre you subverting another one of my men, Elena?\u201d Raphael said into the quiet.</p><p>She came to stand beside him, their wings touching. An instant later, the rain clouds released their store of water in an unexpected deluge. It would, Elena thought, wash away the blood on the streets and the buildings, but the trauma of this day would never be erased. \u201cI think nothing on this earth is capable of subverting your men.\u201d The Seven were as loyal to Raphael as hunters were to the Guild.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she said, blinking the rain from her eyes as Raphael\u2019s wing rose over her in a protective curve, \u201cI do have certain rights as your consort, including the right to stand with you against this thing, whatever it is.\u201d</p><p>His arm sliding around her waist, Raphael brought her against his body, the midnight strands of his hair even darker with the rain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Raphael,\u201d she whispered, spreading the fingers of one hand over his heart, needing to feel the life of him as a ward against the awfulness of what had taken place. \u201cI know an archangel can\u2019t be seen to grieve, but I know you grieve for the people you lost.\u201d Her own throat was thick, her eyes burning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey were under my protection,\u201d he said and it was all that needed to be said.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t try to comfort him with words. She simply stood with him as the rain pounded over them both, cold and harsh as the death that had come so darkly to their city. Lightning burst in the distance, the roiling clouds turning the early evening into midnight. As if in defense, warm golden light began to flood the windows of every skyscraper within sight, but there was nothing eerie or \u201cother\u201d about this wild black storm. It was a simple, beautiful display of nature\u2019s power.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever flown in something like this?\u201d she asked, protected from the ferocious wind by the shelter of his muscled body, his wings.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Raphael looked out over the downpour, the lights in the windows refracted by the hard rain coming in from the left. \u201cIt was above an island in what is now called the Pacific, the sky a rage of thunder, the lightning a violent dance. My friends and I, we made a game of dodging the strikes.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to smile at the image, but the wounds of the day were too raw to permit it. \u201cAn immortal game of chicken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Blinking away the rain, he stepped back. \u201cCome, we must see to the injured.\u201d</p><p>They stopped in at their Tower suite only long enough to dry off and change, before heading down to the infirmary. It made no difference that she\u2019d already seen the damage\u2014it was as bad now as it had been the first time. An angel with wings patterned like a sparrow\u2019s had lost most of his internal organs, his chest a gaping cavity, but at four hundred, he\u2019d survived the damage and now slept in an induced coma that would help him heal.</p><p>Beside him was the near-decapitation victim, his life signs flickering. Kneeling beside the young male, Raphael placed his hand over the gruesome injury. Only Elena was close enough to see the faint blue glow that was an indication of Raphael\u2019s growing but nascent healing ability. He couldn\u2019t fix all the damage, but he could give the hurt man more of a fighting chance.</p> <p>Two beds down lay an angel who\u2019d lost both legs at the upper thigh and broken most of the remaining bones in his body, including those in his brutalized face. But whether through luck or through fate, his brain was still inside the cracked eggshell of his skull, his heart in his chest, his spine damaged but not fatally so\u2014because Izak wouldn\u2019t have survived otherwise, being far too young to heal such trauma.</p><p>\u201cSorry! Sorry! I just got out of the Refuge. I\u2014\u201d A gulp. \u201cI wasn\u2019t supposed to tell you that! Please don\u2019t tell Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Anger and worry combined into a knot in her throat at the memory of their first meeting. He\u2019d been hanging upside down off the roof over the little balcony of her old apartment, all yellow curls and huge eyes as he tried to sneak a peek at a real-live hunter. To see someone so young and innocent lying broken and silent, his body a mass of bruised and torn flesh . . .</p><p>Elena wanted to do violence, make someone pay for this horror, but as of right now, they had no answers as to the origin of the nightmare, their enemy invisible.</p><p>3</p><p>It was well past the midnight hour when Raphael and his consort found their beds. He didn\u2019t need rest as Elena did, but she slept better if he was in the bed with her. When she woke to find herself alone\u2014and she almost always woke in the middle of the night if he wasn\u2019t there\u2014she came looking for him.</p> <p>The first time it had happened, he\u2019d thought she\u2019d been wrenched from her rest by nightmare echoes of the horror that had ended her childhood, but she\u2019d said she just missed him. Such simple words. Such powerful words. So now he slept with her, at least for certain critical hours of the night.</p><p>Tonight, though, neither one of them was ready to surrender to slumber. \u201cLijuan,\u201d she said at last, her head against his shoulder. \u201cAre you thinking the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe possibility had occurred to me.\u201d The Archangel of China was rapidly becoming the Archangel of Death, her abilities touched with the putrefaction of a final ending that was without mercy or dignity, for all that she called herself a giver of eternal life.</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s version of life was a horrific shambling shell fed of human flesh.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d Elena raised herself on her elbow so she could look down at him, the near-white strands of her hair brushing over his skin, a thousand fleeting caresses.</p><p>He spread his fingers on the warmth of her lower back, stroked along the delicate arch of her spine. His tough hunter was still so vulnerable in countless ways, could well have been among the fallen today, for it was the youngest who\u2019d borne the brunt of the damage, and Elena was the youngest angel in the city.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d he said, crushing the thought before it could take damaging hold, \u201ccontacted me with a report an hour ago.\u201d His spymaster was currently on the other side of the world, but he\u2019d spun into action within seconds of the deadly events in New York. \u201cAs always, he has ways of gathering information unavailable to the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>The fine rim of silver around Elena\u2019s irises glowed in the dark of their bedroom, a silent indicator of her growing immortality, though that immortality was not yet set in stone in any way. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat he knows for a fact Lijuan was in her own territory during the entire span of the Falling.\u201d Considering the certainty in his spymaster\u2019s tone, he added, \u201cI have a strong suspicion Jason may have attained the impossible and tracked Lijuan to her innermost lair.\u201d</p><p>Elena sucked in a breath, and he saw she understood the danger. Should Jason be discovered, he wouldn\u2019t make it out alive; Lijuan knew too well how loyal the Seven were to Raphael. But, Raphael thought, his spymaster would take no unnecessary risks, not now, when Jason knew his loss would be a fatal wound on the heart of the princess who awaited his return.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t Lijuan\u201d\u2014dark realization in her eyes\u2014\u201cthen . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The Cascade is apparently moving ahead with the speed of a\u2014\u201d He paused at Aodhan\u2019s mental touch. A problem? he asked the angel who, with Illium, was currently in charge of Tower operations.</p><p>The Archangel Caliane has informed me she wishes to speak to you, Sire.</p><p>I\u2019ll contact her from the house. Returning his attention to Elena, he touched the curve of her wing where the midnight feathers segued into indigo. \u201cWe might be about to get some answers,\u201d he said, telling her of Caliane\u2019s call. As the only Ancient who was awake and in the world, his mother knew much that had otherwise been lost to the pages of history.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay out of view,\u201d Elena said when they reached the screen in his study, her skin glowing against the robe of cerulean silk he\u2019d gifted her on the anniversary of her mortal birthday.</p><p>Irritation simmered to life in his blood. \u201cElena, you are my consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how she gets,\u201d was her unshaken response where others would\u2019ve quivered at the edge in his tone. \u201cShe\u2019ll be far more forthcoming if she\u2019s not feeling insulted by my presence.\u201d Leaning against the wall beside a framed piece of art, she blew him a kiss.</p><p>We\u2019ll discuss this later, he said and made the call. His mother continued to abhor technology for the most part, but she\u2019d begun to accept the usefulness of certain aspects of the modern world. He hadn\u2019t expected otherwise; Caliane might prefer what she termed the more \u201ccivilized\u201d mores of centuries gone, but she was an Ancient, and no one lived so long by miring herself in the dusty past.</p><p>Twin flames of blue on the screen, his mother\u2019s hair a river of black, her face the template used to cast his own. \u201cMother,\u201d he said, his heart yet unused to the fact that she breathed once more, that should he wish, he could fly to her, feel the touch of the hands that had rocked him in childhood . . . and left him broken on a bloody field far from civilization.</p><p>\u201cRaphael, I have heard of the events in your city.\u201d Her fingers rose to the screen in a familiar gesture of love. \u201cYour people?\u201d</p><p>No other archangel would he have trusted with the truth, but for all that she\u2019d done, his mother had never once backed anyone else against her son. \u201cWe mourn,\u201d he said quietly and saw the pain in her eyes.</p><p>It was from Caliane that he\u2019d learned how an archangel should rule. Even when her madness distorted the truth of who she was, he\u2019d never forgotten she was also the archangel whose people looked to her with love in their eyes. He wasn\u2019t Caliane\u2014he inspired fear as often as not\u2014but, like those who were hers, his men and women knew he\u2019d fight with unrelenting fury to protect them.</p><p>\u201cFive began their journey home this night.\u201d Raphael had led the flight out over the dark lick of the water until Manhattan was a silhouette far in the distance, Elena on one side and Nimra on the other. Every other angel in the city who could fly, but for the squadron needed to hold it secure, had been part of the silent cavalcade, and each had held a lantern that protected the candle within, lighting the way home.</p><p>Then they\u2019d hovered in place as Nimra and the squadron he\u2019d placed at her command pulled away into the starless night, the fallen carried in flower-covered biers that would reach the Refuge in twenty-four hours. It would\u2019ve been faster to send the bodies home in a jet, but they were creatures of the wind and the sky, and so it was by the sky road that the fallen would return home.</p><p>\u201cWe mourn with you,\u201d Caliane said, a single tear rolling down her face. \u201cI will send a squadron to the Refuge to act as an honor guard for those who are carried home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you, Mother, but in this time of unrest, I believe you should keep your people near.\u201d Caliane remained Lijuan\u2019s most dangerous foe, and she had only two winged squadrons, having taken the people of Amanat alone into her Sleep.</p><p>Her expression altering from sorrow to one that betrayed an acute political intelligence, his mother sat back in her chair, her gown a vibrant turquoise that framed her dazzling beauty, until he could hardly believe the truth of her extraordinary age.</p><p>\u201cI know you wish to ask me if I saw anything such as this in the previous Cascade,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I must tell you there was no Falling in my time.\u201d A sudden shadow across her expression, and he knew she thought of the madness she believed had touched her during that Cascade. \u201cThere were, however, other strange events.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael waited while his mother thought. He knew the delay was no power play, no arrogant posturing. Caliane was simply very, very old, her memories hidden in long-forgotten corners of her mind.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d she murmured into the silence, \u201can entire city of angels turned against each other for a single minute. Blows were exchanged, knives thrown\u2014then everyone seemed to wake up and no one knew why they had acted so.\u201d A frown. \u201cThere were some who believed the chaos must have been caused by the use of a new archangelic ability, but there was never a repeat of the incident.\u201d</p><p>It was tempting to believe the Falling had been another such aberration, but\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t be complacent, not given the changes occurring in the Cadre.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one who dispenses death.\u201d Caliane\u2019s wings glowed a sudden, lethal, brightness. \u201cShe who styles herself an Ancient, you think she has a hand in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to be Lijuan\u2019s handiwork.\u201d Raphael\u2019s mind flickered with images of another time when his mother had glowed . . . during an execution that had broken her spirit and splintered their family. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, closing the lid on the memories of his father\u2019s violent death, \u201cwe\u2019ve barely begun the hunt for answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not permit this to keep you from my lands.\u201d It was an order.</p><p>He infused his response with unbending steel. \u201cI\u2019ll make that decision when it is time.\u201d His mother had a way of forgetting that he was an archangel with a territory of his own.</p><p>Caliane\u2019s lips curved, the music in her voice reminding him of the songs she\u2019d sung to him as a boy, songs that had held the Refuge in thrall. \u201cYou were always a stubborn child. The only way your father could get you to let go of anger, as an infant, was to scoop you up in his arms and take you flying. Oh, how you loved to fly with Nadiel.\u201d Love and a haunting sadness in her every word. \u201cYou always came back laughing, your hair wild and your cheeks red, my beautiful boy.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael touched his fingers to the screen as she\u2019d done, his heart aching for the losses that marked his mother. He didn\u2019t know if he could ever forgive her crimes, didn\u2019t even know if she was truly sane or if this was a fleeting lull, but he knew that he loved her. \u201cI hope,\u201d he said as her fingers touched the screen on her end, \u201cyou will not tell such stories when we are in company.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter was a song, her eyes iridescent. \u201cI promise you\u2019ll be a babe only in my eyes, always my son.\u201d Laughter fading into sadness once more, she said, \u201cI am sorry, Raphael. To lose any of one\u2019s people is a deep sorrow.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Elena once the call had ended, he found her knuckling away a tear, his tough hunter whose shell was not so tough to those who knew her. \u201cHbeebti.\u201d He took her into his arms, the silk of her robe sliding over his skin.</p><p>\u201cShe loves you so much.\u201d Elena\u2019s whisper was rough, husky. \u201cIt\u2019s there in her every breath, every word. I can\u2019t imagine what it must do to her to know that she hurt you during her madness.\u201d</p><p>Raphael understood that his mother hadn\u2019t been in her right mind when she sent him plummeting to the earth, his wings shredded, but some part of him was still that broken boy who\u2019d lain bleeding on the dew-drenched grass\u2014as her feet danced away over the green blades speckled with viscous red. \u201cI cannot forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Elena said, that painful understanding binding them on a level no one else would ever comprehend. \u201cI know.\u201d Her mother had loved her, too, but Elena\u2019s most enduring memory of Marguerite was of her high-heeled shoe lying on its side on designer black and white tile.</p> <p>Strange, how the memory of that shoe made her skin chill, her lungs struggle for air. But that was how it was. Some memories dug deeper, held on tighter.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis city, my Tower, cannot be seen to be weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Anything else might be taken as an invitation to conquer by certain others in the Cadre. \u201cWe have to convince them the Falling did far less damage than it actually did.\u201d Almost half of the Tower\u2019s defensive force was down for the foreseeable future: a staggering deficit.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Raphael reached between them to tug open the tie of her robe, slide his hands inside. \u201cAs part of that,\u201d he said to her responsive shiver, \u201cmy consort must be seen to be indulging in her strange fetish for hunting vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d Undoing the buttons of the shirt he\u2019d pulled on for the call, she pressed a kiss to the firm muscle of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Sara not to strike me from the roster.\u201d Chasing delinquent vamps hardly seemed important in the wake of the tragedy that had befallen the city, but if it would help create the illusion of a Manhattan undamaged by the horror that had taken place in a few short minutes, then that was what she\u2019d do.</p><p>She knew angelkind in general remained fascinated with her, the first angel Made in living memory and one who continued to hunt. According to what she\u2019d heard from Illium, there were as many angels glued to news reports about her as there were humans and vampires. So why not use that notoriety to the city\u2019s advantage?</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hands stroked off her robe to leave her naked, her skin igniting under his touch. \u201cYou need to rest,\u201d she argued halfheartedly, a clawing need inside her to taste life in its most primal form. \u201cYou pushed your new ability to the limit in the infirmary.\u201d</p> <p>Lips on hers, his mouth claiming everything she had. \u201cThere are,\u201d he said, backing her against the wall, \u201cother ways of revitalizing the self.\u201d</p><p>Elena gasped as he lifted her, her legs locking around his waist to leave her intimately exposed.</p><p>He was hard and demanding that night, her archangel, his fury at the attack on his city a rage in his blood\u2014but she was no fragile bird. Giving back kiss for passionate kiss, she took the pounding thrusts of his cock and demanded more, until there was no more thought, only the most beautiful firestorm of sensation.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael had thought only to hold Elena close as she slept on the thick carpet in front of the study fireplace, their bodies and wings entangled, but he must have been more tired than he\u2019d understood, because all at once, he realized he wasn\u2019t awake. Instead, he found himself on the forgotten field where Caliane had left him more than a thousand years ago, when he\u2019d been a boy at the dawn of his existence.</p><p>A boy who\u2019d thought to kill his mother before she became an even bigger monster than the one who had orchestrated the death of two thriving cities, the adults drowned, the children broken in ways even Keir, their greatest healer, couldn\u2019t repair. No immortal would go to the ancient ruins of those cities even now. There was too piercing a silence, created of the pain of thousands of souls, such silence as Raphael would never forget, the pain of it an icy wind.</p><p>Today, as he stood draped in a quiet heavy with the echo of memory, he saw blood on the grass, the crimson liquid that had dripped out of him as he lay splintered on the earth underneath a crystalline sky so blue it hurt. Yet he wasn\u2019t on his face on the grass as he\u2019d been then, his wings torn and heavy on his body, parts of him missing. No, he stood on his feet and he was a man, an archangel, not that scared, determined, heartbroken boy.</p><p>Flexing his hands as if in readiness for battle, he took a step forward . . . and walked into a wall of whispers. Hundreds of voices, each one raspy and somehow unused, the words interlaced and incomprehensible. They came from every side, yet when he rose up into that sky of cutting clarity, he saw nothing but the gnarled bodies of the trees that surrounded the field, sentinels of such age that they had stood through eternity.</p><p>And still the voices whispered and murmured, pushing at him in waves that ebbed and flowed, until at last, he heard a single strong voice slice through the chaos. The other whispers died away, but did not fade altogether as that one voice asked him a question. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Feet touching the grass once more, the dew wet on the very tips of his wings, he felt a roaring surge of anger. \u201cWho are you to ask questions of an archangel?\u201d</p><p>The murmurs rose again, the volume rising to a thunderous crescendo.</p><p>Archangel. Archangel. Archangel!</p><p>4</p><p>\u201cArchangel.\u201d Elena gripped Raphael\u2019s shoulder, his skin strangely cool under her fingertips. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get up.\u201d</p><p>He always woke at her first touch, but today she had to call him a second time before his lashes lifted, the relentless blue of his eyes shadowed by a darkness that muted their vivid hue. \u201cIt\u2019s daylight,\u201d was the first thing he said, his gaze taking in the lacy streamers of light coming in through the study windows.</p><p>\u201cYou were in such a deep sleep, I thought I\u2019d give you a few extra minutes.\u201d It was the only gift she could give; to protect an archangel was an impossibility. \u201cIt\u2019s barely dawn.\u201d Watching him get to his feet, this magnificent and lethal male who was her own, she rose and pulled on her robe. \u201cYou had an angry look on your face at the end. Bad dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad so much as strange.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak again until they\u2019d both showered and begun to dress, their bedroom drenched in dawn sunshine from the skylight and open balcony doors. \u201cI dreamed of the field where I fought Caliane.\u201d</p><p>Tying off her braid, she busied herself checking her crossbow, though she saw nothing of the weapon, every ounce of her being concentrated on Raphael. He spoke rarely about that agonizing day, and she hadn\u2019t pushed him, because the whole \u201ctime heals all wounds\u201d thing? It was a load of bullshit. \u201cWas your mother in the dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Walking to the balcony, his upper body bare, he spread his wings as if soaking in the sun\u2019s rays, the golden filaments hidden in the white sparking with a fire so brilliant, Elena found herself brushing her fingers along the living silk.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see, Elena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of fire in your feathers now.\u201d She almost expected to capture a piece of piercing white flame in her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael glanced at his wing, shrugged. \u201cSo long as they work.\u201d Folding them in, he turned to pick up one of her throwing blades and slid it into the sheath on her left arm. \u201cThe dream was not . . . what it should be,\u201d he said, as she made a minor fix to one of the sheath straps. \u201cOf course, yesterday was no ordinary day. It\u2019s not inexplicable that I should dream of violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be that simple.\u201d Elena held out her right forearm, sheath in place, so he could slide in the other throwing blade. \u201cBut I\u2019ve seen way too much freaky stuff since you first summoned me to do your bidding to take anything at face value.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were abysmal at doing my bidding.\u201d It was a cool reminder. \u201cI thought you the most fascinating creature I had ever met.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did not.\u201d She pointed a gleaming knife at him before slotting it into a thigh sheath strapped over her slimline black leather pants, her clothing designed to reduce drag in the air. \u201cYou thought I was a nuisance you might have to throw off the side of the building in order to teach me manners.\u201d As it was, he\u2019d made her close her hand over a blade, her blood dripping to stain the roof, a being so terrifying she\u2019d seen nothing of humanity in him. \u201cYou were kind of a bastard, if we\u2019re being brutally honest.\u201d</p><p>Lips curving, he picked up the long, thin blade she wore hidden along her back in a sheath built into her long-sleeved black top, the fabric tough enough to take the demands of a hunter\u2019s life. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, sliding the blade into place when she turned, \u201care the only individual who would ever say that to my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me to tell you sometime about how I decided I should get Big Idiot tattooed on my forehead.\u201d Facing him once more, she smoothed her hands over his gorgeous shoulders. \u201cAnd what does it say about me that I thought you were fascinating and sexier than sin, even after you made me cut myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re a warrior who knew she\u2019d finally met her match.\u201d</p><p>Elena snorted. \u201cIt says I\u2019m a dumbo who doesn\u2019t know when to be meek and subservient and save my ass, that\u2019s what it says.\u201d</p> <p>Smile deepening until his cheeks creased with it, Raphael curved one hand around her nape, using the fingers of his other to caress the sensitive upper arch of her wing with long, firm strokes. \u201cHad you been meek and subservient,\u201d he murmured as her knees threatened to melt, \u201cI would\u2019ve never summoned you to do my bidding.\u201d</p><p>His kiss threatened to finish what his strokes had begun. Licking her tongue against his, her breasts crushed against the hard muscle of his chest, Elena wanted nothing more than to stay in this stolen minute, to forget the outside world, but the ugly reality that awaited couldn\u2019t be ignored.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been away from the Tower for over six hours,\u201d Raphael said when they drew apart, his expression shifting in a way that reminded her he wasn\u2019t simply her lover, wasn\u2019t simply the man who wore her ring on his finger. No, he was an archangel, responsible for the lives of millions, mortals and immortals alike.</p><p>\u201cFinish dressing.\u201d Releasing him, she headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll bring up some food. You need to refuel after all the healing you did.\u201d</p><p>By the time she returned, the transformation was complete, the Archangel of New York a grim-eyed power beside her as they ate standing on the balcony. He\u2019d chosen to wear a simple black shirt and pants, the cut pristine, rather than the leather combat gear he often chose. All part of the illusion, she realized, an elegant \u201cfuck you\u201d to whoever had dared attack his city and harm his people.</p><p>Elena watched him slice through the biting cold of the wind only minutes later, the early morning sunlight sparking white fire off the altered filaments in his wings, and felt her heart tighten in a deep, chill fear. Never had she expected to find him, to fall so deeply, wildly, insanely in love\u2014and sometimes, her soul-deep joy in their passionate entanglement terrified her, the fear of losing him as she\u2019d lost her sisters, her mother, a stealthy intruder in her mind.</p> <p>After yesterday, that intruder had forced its way to the forefront of her consciousness.</p><p>Fingernails digging into her palms, she returned to the bedroom to pick up her phone. She didn\u2019t currently have an active assignment, but she could put in some time teaching a class at Guild Academy\u2014not as high visibility as a hunt, but perfect in its utter normality. However, as part of her contribution to Raphael\u2019s \u201cfuck you,\u201d she stopped at a rooftop coffee stand set up by a human shrewd enough to realize angels liked coffee, too.</p><p>She made herself laugh at the barista\u2019s joke, heard phone cameras clicking quietly as the businesspeople from the building took advantage of her proximity to update their social media pages. Take that and smoke it, she thought to the unknown enemy who\u2019d caused such carnage and loss. You might have managed to kill five of us, but you haven\u2019t come close to breaking this city.</p><p>Anger a rock in her throat as she thought of the biers even now on their way to the Refuge, she took off in a showy sweep that ignited more photo taking, the coffee held in hand.</p><p>The head trainer at Guild Academy was more than happy to have her take the advanced crossbow class, the staff used to adjusting the schedule to take advantage of active hunters who had some downtime.</p><p>Lesson complete, she\u2019d just walked onto the roof in preparation for takeoff toward Guild HQ when her phone rang. \u201cEve,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cI was just thinking we needed to talk.\u201d Much to Jeffrey\u2019s anger and disgust\u2014the damn hypocrite\u2014Elena\u2019s youngest half sister was also hunter-born.</p><p>\u201cE-Ellie, can you c-come now?\u201d Sobs in Eve\u2019s usually ebullient voice.</p><p>Smile fading, Elena said, \u201cAre you at school?\u201d Both Evelyn and her older sister, Amethyst, had been boarders at a private school upstate until the bloody events there this past spring. It was in the aftermath that Eve\u2019s hunting abilities had come to light, leading to a transfer to a private school closer to Guild Academy. Amethyst had chosen to come with her.</p> <p>Eve sniffed. \u201cY-yes. I\u2019m hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Her sister must\u2019ve been watching for Elena from her hiding place, because she ran from around the imposing redbrick building just as Elena landed on the manicured lawn out front.</p><p>Eve had turned eleven a week earlier, but she appeared much younger today, her face blotchy, her sobs deep and silent and heartbreaking. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d Elena said, waving off a teacher who\u2019d appeared on the front steps.</p><p>The suit-clad older man frowned but returned through the heavy wooden doors carved with some kind of a crest.</p><p>Gathering Eve\u2019s school-uniform-clad body in her arms, Elena gritted her teeth and achieved a vertical takeoff through sheer strength of will. According to every known fact of angelic development, she shouldn\u2019t have been capable of the maneuver yet, her body not having formed the necessary musculature, but the idea of being grounded and helpless was untenable\u2014so she\u2019d learned to lift. It wasn\u2019t graceful, and it hurt, but she could do it.</p><p>She caught the excitement at the school\u2019s windows as they passed. Good. No one would tease Eve for her tears now; the other students would be more interested in her stories of flight. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said when Eve, realizing her feet were no longer on the ground, clutched at her. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>A few more sniffles before her sister began to crane her neck to see around Elena\u2019s wings, her hair whipping in the wind. By the time they landed at the Enclave house, her face was gleeful, cheeks happily windburned.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to play hooky,\u201d Elena said, relieved to see Eve\u2019s tough spirit rising to the surface, \u201cdo it in style.\u201d</p><p>That got her a bright-eyed grin, the gray of Eve\u2019s irises a stamp Jeffrey had put on them both. \u201cCan we do that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we have a snack. Come on.\u201d Walking past the house, dead certain Montgomery wouldn\u2019t let her down, she took Eve to her greenhouse.</p><p>\u201cOooh.\u201d Eve touched her fingers to the petals of a wildly blooming daisy inside the heated enclosure. \u201cDid you grow this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You should see this one.\u201d</p><p>It was only three minutes later that Montgomery proved her faith in him once again.</p><p>\u201cHot chocolate and cakes for your guest, Guild Hunter,\u201d he said, placing the tray he carried on the little wrought-iron table Elena had situated in a cozy corner the first time Sara came to visit.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, aware of Eve standing politely by her side, hands folded in front of her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met my youngest sister, Evelyn.\u201d Of her three living sisters, only Beth had been to the Angel Enclave house and she\u2019d been so overawed she hadn\u2019t spoken a peep the entire time. \u201cEve, this is Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>An elegant bow. \u201cMiss Evelyn.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Eve stuck out her hand. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Elena had never seen Montgomery shake anyone\u2019s hand. Expecting him to be scandalized by the idea, she found herself charmed instead at the solemnity with which he accepted Eve\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything further,\u201d he said, after the formalities were over, \u201cI will be at the house.\u201d</p><p>Wiggling into one of the chairs at the table after the door closed behind Montgomery, Eve leaned in close to whisper, \u201cWas he a butler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best one you\u2019ll ever meet.\u201d Picking up the gorgeous little teapot, Elena poured hot chocolate into delicate cups she\u2019d never before seen, the edges curlicued and the white china surface painted with tiny pink flowers.</p><p>Perfect for a young girl.</p><p>\u201cWow. We have a housekeeper, but I don\u2019t know anybody who has a butler.\u201d</p><p>Elena grinned, thinking of her own reaction the first time she\u2019d seen Montgomery, and put a cupcake on Eve\u2019s plate, the frosting swirls of yellow decorated with crystallized violets. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, once her sister had finished the confection, \u201ctell me what made you cry.\u201d She\u2019d never have been so direct with Beth, but Eve was built tougher, for all that she was a child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Face falling, her sister pushed a crumb around her plate. \u201cI feel dumb now. I shouldn\u2019t have called you\u2014I know you must be sad and busy because of the Falling.\u201d She squashed the crumb, staring at it as if it were the most important thing on the planet. \u201cI was scared you\u2019d fallen, and Amy was, too. Thanks for messaging me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks needed.\u201d Elena reached over to tuck the deep black strands of Eve\u2019s hair behind her ears. \u201cRemember what I said? I\u2019m always here for you.\u201d The angry bitterness between her and Jeffrey might\u2019ve kept her a stranger from her half siblings for most of their lives, but that was a mistake Elena would never again make. \u201cIt was nice to get your message yesterday, and I\u2019m glad you called me today.\u201d</p><p>A hiccuping breath, and Eve looked up, eyes huge and wet. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t have, but this morning I told Father about how I aced an exercise at the Academy.\u201d</p> <p>Elena\u2019s stomach twisted. She knew what was coming, but she listened anyway, because Eve needed to release the poison before it could fester\u2014as it\u2019d festered in Elena and in Jeffrey, until it\u2019d worn a jagged hole through the once-strong fabric of their relationship.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always so proud when I do well at school,\u201d Eve continued. \u201cI thought he\u2019d be proud of this, too . . . even though I know he hates hunters.\u201d Lower lip trembling, she swallowed. \u201cI thought if I could make him happy, then maybe he\u2019d be nice to you, too, except h-he told me to get out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Eve.\u201d Chest aching for her sister\u2019s hurt, she went around the table to kneel beside Eve\u2019s chair.</p><p>Sobbing in earnest now, Eve threw her arms around Elena, her face wet against Elena\u2019s neck. Elena said nothing, simply stroked her sister\u2019s back, let her cry out the pain. It was better this way. As a child, Elena had swallowed her own pain again and again until it had become a knot inside her she wasn\u2019t sure anything could unravel.</p><p>Some wounds were inflicted too young, scarred too deep.</p> <p>It took time, but Eve finally cried herself out. Wiping her sister\u2019s cheeks with a napkin she dampened using water from the small jug Montgomery had left on the table, Elena kissed each in turn. \u201cJeffrey hurt you, and he has no right to do that, no matter if he\u2019s your father.\u201d Even as she spoke, she knew she had to tread carefully, make sure her scars didn\u2019t color Eve\u2019s view of Jeffrey.</p><p>Because notwithstanding the bastard he\u2019d become as far as Elena was concerned, he\u2019d apparently been a good if remote father to Eve and Amy. Not the same man who\u2019d thrown Elena into the air as a child and danced with his first wife in the rain\u2014that part of him was buried in the same grave as Marguerite\u2014but a father Eve and Amy could rely on nonetheless.</p><p>Elena would never do anything to damage that bond, not when she knew what it did to a child to be estranged from the man who was meant to protect her at her most innocent and vulnerable. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d she said gently, her wings spread on the greenhouse floor as she continued to kneel beside Eve\u2019s chair, \u201cJeffrey\u2019s not rational on this one thing.\u201d</p><p>I have no desire to house an abomination under my roof.</p><p>Words Jeffrey had thrown at her during the final, ugly fight that had destroyed the last, brittle threads of the bond that had once tied them together.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Eve fisted her hands, jaw jutting out as she asked the one question Elena had never been able to answer. \u201cIf I\u2019m hunter-born and you\u2019re hunter-born, doesn\u2019t that mean that Father must be hunter-born, too?\u201d</p> <p>5</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elena said, answering the question she could, \u201cit means someone in his family was, and he carries the genes for it.\u201d A fact he\u2019d consciously hidden from Elena until the emergence of Eve\u2019s ability had thrown a grenade onto that particular secret. \u201cBut the ability isn\u2019t active in him, like it is in me and you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>A thoughtful nod, frown lines marring the creamy skin Eve had inherited from Jeffrey\u2019s second wife, Gwendolyn. \u201cLike he\u2019s asleep and we\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Elena got to her feet, spreading her wings in a light stretch that had the white-gold primaries grazing a pot of chrysanthemums in bloom. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good way to put it.\u201d However, their father couldn\u2019t keep on being asleep, continue his willful, damaging blindness. Elena would not allow him to hurt Eve as he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>\u201cHe might never understand, right, Ellie?\u201d Eve said with her customary openness of nature a few minutes later, as they got ready to leave. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s always so mad at you.\u201d</p><p>Elena squeezed her sister\u2019s hand, her calluses encountering the ones just beginning to form on Eve\u2019s soft palms. \u201cJeffrey and I,\u201d she said, \u201chave other problems.\u201d</p><p>Slater Patalis had been drawn to their suburban home because of Elena. Until that awful, cruel day a lifetime ago, they\u2019d been a family of six. Jeffrey, Marguerite, and their four girls. Mirabelle, with her hot blood and wild affection. Ariel, even tempered and bossy and protective. Elena, who wanted to do everything her older sisters did, and Beth, too young to truly remember now who they\u2019d been together before Slater Patalis walked through the kitchen door.</p><p>Where the murderous vampire had butchered Ari and Belle in a horrifying reign of blood, tortured their mother over and over . . . tortured the woman who was, and would always be, Jeffrey\u2019s greatest love. Beth hadn\u2019t been home, but Elena had. And though it was all her fault, she was the one who\u2019d survived.</p> <p>\u201cHe loves you,\u201d Elena said, as the memories bruised her from within, hoping she wasn\u2019t about to lie to her sister. \u201cIt might take him time, but he\u2019ll accept your hunting.\u201d</p><p>Dropping Eve back at school and taking responsibility for her absence, Elena flew straight to the tony brownstone Jeffrey used as a private office, only to find it closed, his assistant nowhere in evidence. Figuring her father would call her soon enough, Elena didn\u2019t bother to slide a note under the door and headed toward Guild HQ. Once again, her phone rang before she made it there. Answering in the air, she found Sara on the other end.</p><p>\u201cEllie, I know you probably can\u2019t take this with what happened yesterday, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually on my way to see you, wanted to ask if you had a hunt for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because we have a serious problem.\u201d Taking an audible breath, she said, \u201cOne of our hunters has gone off the rails. We might be talking murder if we don\u2019t stop him.\u201d</p><p>Elena landed on a nearby roof, her pulse suddenly in her mouth, her palms clammy, Sara\u2019s words having unlocked a hidden vault: Bill James had been a celebrated hunter, Elena\u2019s mentor . . . and a serial killer. One so good at hiding his crumbling psyche that none of his friends had realized what was happening until the first dead child. \u201cWho?\u201d she asked, throat raw.</p><p>\u201cDarrell Vance.\u201d Relief that it wasn\u2019t a friend had Elena lifting a trembling hand to her face. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t fair or right to feel this way, but she\u2019d already had to execute one friend, would never forget the look of betrayal in Bill\u2019s eyes as he died in her arms, his blood hot on her skin.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d Confusion in his voice. \u201cWhy, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Sara\u2019s voice broke into a memory that still woke her up some nights, mouth full of cotton wool and the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d on her lips.</p><p>\u201cDarrell had a hunt go seriously bad,\u201d Sara told her. \u201cVamp had second thoughts after being Made, went back to the mortal family he\u2019d left, only to find his wife had remarried and another man was now raising his son.\u201d</p><p>Elena had seen this script before. \u201cHe killed the husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would\u2019ve been bad, but\u2014\u201d When Sara had to pause as if girding herself for what was to come, dread began to crawl up Elena\u2019s spine. \u201cHe tore out the husband\u2019s throat, then tied up his son and wife, wrapped them in his arms, and set himself on fire.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jesus.</p><p>\u201cDarrell found them while they were still burning, tried to put out the flames, but you know how vamps burn. It\u2019s like they\u2019re doused in petrol.\u201d</p><p>Elena had once witnessed a vampire burn as a result of a hate crime. It had been horrific, the smell of roasting meat threatening to make her retch as she tried frantically to beat out the flames. But to find a woman and child in the mix? Her stomach twisted. \u201cDarrell\u2019s fallen off the radar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The way this went down wasn\u2019t his fault\u2014he did the track in record time\u2014but his head\u2019s probably so messed up, he can\u2019t see that. As it is, he attacked an innocent vampire and put him in the hospital two nights ago; a couple more punches and he\u2019d have fatally damaged the heart. I found out a half hour ago when the vamp woke up.\u201d</p><p>Vampires might be strong, but an average untrained one didn\u2019t stand a chance against a member of the Guild. \u201cHave you contacted the Slayer?\u201d Elena asked, referring to the often anonymous hunter whose task it was to hunt those of the Guild gone bad.</p><p>\u201cShe took a bad injury in a recent situation, is out of commission. This one we\u2019ll have to handle without her\u2014Ransom is lead; he has the sketchy details we have so far, and I know he wants you as his backup.\u201d An unspoken acknowledgment of the bond that had formed between them the day Bill died. \u201cAs it is, he\u2019s just come across something that\u2019ll probably need to be referred to the Tower, so you\u2019ll be doing double duty.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael glanced at the mortal news channel running on one wall of his Tower office and smiled. It wasn\u2019t a smile of humor, but of pride. His consort had done exactly as he\u2019d asked, the media mystified by the apparent nonchalance with which she\u2019d bought a cup of coffee that morning. Pundits who\u2019d the previous day termed the Falling a catastrophic disaster were now beginning to question their judgment. More and more often, he heard it being termed an accident of some kind that had \u201cfortunately not caused lasting harm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cElena certainly knows how to leave an impression,\u201d Dmitri said on the other end of the phone, having been watching the same news feed.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s second and his consort had never seen eye to eye, for to Dmitri, Elena was a lethal chink in Raphael\u2019s armor, but today he heard grim admiration in the vampire\u2019s tone. \u201cIf we can continue to manipulate the media,\u201d he said, switching the screen to silent, \u201cand maintain a stranglehold on any news that leaves the Tower, we can convince the enemy that the five we lost represent the only real damage.\u201d Those five would be halfway home by now, crossing over the blue-green span of a mercurial sea.</p><p>\u201cAcknowledge a few serious injuries, or allow that information to leak.\u201d Dmitri spoke with the icy intelligence that made him a master strategist. \u201cIt\u2019ll take care of the images already out there of angels who fell into traffic or were otherwise publicly injured, and it\u2019ll explain the healers. Illium\u2019s very good at whispering the right words in the right ears.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael sent the instruction to the blue-winged angel as he continued to speak to Dmitri, his eyes on the glittering steel and glass metropolis that was Manhattan. \u201cWe need to quietly bring in troops from outlying areas.\u201d No enemy who wanted to be taken seriously in the immortal world would launch an attack at any target but the Tower\u2014in the game of archangels, to conquer was to strike at one another\u2019s base of power.</p><p>\u201cI need you to assist Aodhan in organizing that shift.\u201d Aodhan was yet new to the territory, having previously been Galen\u2019s right hand in the Refuge. \u201cI have Illium focusing on creating new working squadrons.\u201d With so many angels down, the current squadrons had become unbalanced in critical areas.</p><p>\u201cSire, do you wish me to return to the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said, conscious Dmitri\u2019s wife was still regaining her strength after her transformation from mortal to vampire. \u201cYour continued absence serves my purpose for the time being.\u201d Everyone knew Dmitri was the oldest of Raphael\u2019s Seven, the one Raphael considered a friend. \u201cWhen the war breaks, I\u2019ll want you by my side, but that time isn\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>Not quite yet.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Elena landed in front of an old-fashioned two-story villa set in the middle of a derelict street twenty minutes after her call from Sara and stared. Surrounded by tall weeds and smothered in ivy on one side, the building in front of her could\u2019ve stood in as the prototypical haunted house; in point of fact, the entire street had escaped any attempt at modernization. Even the streetlamps were wrought iron, the frames rusted, the glass cracked to splinter the pavement, not a single electrical or telephone wire in sight.</p><p>That was hardly surprising in a city filled with angels and vampires, not all of whom embraced change. If, however, this place belonged to an immortal or almost-immortal, it had been permitted to fall into remarkable disrepair. The older ones who liked to keep things the way they\u2019d been at some point in the past, took great pride in maintaining the historical detail and beauty of their properties.</p><p>It didn\u2019t appear anyone had touched this house for decades.</p><p>The paint, which might\u2019ve once been white, was peeling and blackened from the dust of the city streets, the windows shattered, the eaves hung with cobwebs thick and sticky, the curtains within rotten shreds from what she could see from her position on the street. The wood itself was warped out of shape, until the house couldn\u2019t be in any way weather-tight\u2014and an unusually tall tree had fallen onto part of the roof, caving in one side of the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this place?\u201d she said to Ransom when he appeared from the other side of the porch.</p> <p>Green eyes vivid against skin of copper-gold, he raised an eyebrow. \u201cAre you talking about this multimillion-dollar piece of real estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time land went for sale in Manhattan?\u201d he asked, shrugging wide shoulders hugged by the battered black leather of his motorcycle jacket, his legs encased in old blue jeans over scuffed heavy-duty boots. \u201cThis entire street is one parcel. Developers have fucking public orgasms dreaming about getting their paws on it.\u201d</p><p>Elena whistled. \u201cSomeone\u2019s sitting on a gold mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. Now he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Heart slamming against her ribs, she jerked her attention from the rotting house next door. \u201cNot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t Darrell, but it\u2019s someone the Tower\u2019s going to be interested in.\u201d Ransom\u2019s blade-sharp cheekbones cut against his skin as he said, \u201cWe need to clear this fast and continue with the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Agreeing, she walked gingerly up the front steps, not trusting them not to collapse and dump her on her ass. \u201cHow do we get in?\u201d Front door was boarded up, the nails corroded and the wood obscene with graffiti.</p> <p>Angling his head to the left, the glossy black tail of his hair tied at the nape of his neck with a strip of rawhide, Ransom led her around the house. \u201cYour angel friends okay? That young blond one who follows you around like a big, goofy puppy?\u201d</p><p>Stabbing pains in her stomach, her mind rebelling against the brutal images of Izak\u2019s torn-off legs, his flayed skin. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. He\u2019s just a kid.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s throat knotted as she thought of the other young soldier who hadn\u2019t survived, whose family even now held vigil for the return of his body. \u201cThe angel you rescued from in front of the truck?\u201d she said, forcing herself not to give in to useless anger. \u201cIt\u2019ll take time, but she\u2019ll heal.\u201d</p><p>Ransom blew out a jagged breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d make it. She was . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI had to collect her arm from under the tires, Ellie.\u201d Gesturing for her to take care over a broken board, he said, \u201cWhat I found today? It\u2019s going to add to the shitpile.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. The city didn\u2019t need any further problems. \u201cYou tracked Darrell here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarrell didn\u2019t go loco right after that clusterfuck with the mother and the kid,\u201d was the surprising answer. \u201cHe came in, had counseling, said all the right things, and was assigned a slam-dunk retrieval to ease him back into things.\u201d</p><p>Reading between the lines, Elena realized the counselor had known something was off and asked for Darrell to be kept within reach.</p><p>\u201cVamp who owned this place was his assigned target.\u201d Ransom drew his guns from the shoulder holsters he wore under his jacket, the action deadly silent. \u201cI figured I might as well use him as a starting point for the track, since Darrell did send in a report to say he was on the guy\u2019s trail.\u201d</p><p>Elena had her throwing blades in hand when they turned the corner. Half of the back wall was just gone, leaving a gaping entrance filled with street detritus, dead leaves, discarded hypodermic needles, and other things she didn\u2019t want to think about too deeply. Trying to keep her wings from trailing in the crap, she took a step inside . . . and a rat as big as a goddamn cat scurried over her boot.</p><p>Biting back her instinctive scream, she glared at Ransom\u2014who was very conspicuously not grinning. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t warn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tough-ass hunter who gets naked with a freaking archangel, has a miniature flamethrower\u2014which, by the way, you should leave to me in your will\u2014and a crossbow, all within easy reach.\u201d His cheeks creased, eyes glinting. \u201cRats quiver at your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I remember why you\u2019re only an almost-friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ellie, you wound me.\u201d He paused. \u201cDid you stop and get the masks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Reaching into a side pocket of her pants, she passed him a collapsible mask. Like her, he was hunter-born, his sense of smell acute.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He pulled it on over his mouth and nose, tightened the elastic band. \u201cSmell\u2019s worse upstairs.\u201d</p><p>Since it reeked down here\u2014a disgusting miasma of droppings, spoiled food, and urine\u2014Elena didn\u2019t waste any time following his lead. Tugging out a pair of latex gloves from another pocket as Ransom did the same, she nodded at him to lead, and they skirted past what looked like the mummified body of a feral cat, and out of the kitchen.</p><p>The hallway beyond was narrow enough that Elena had to lean slightly to the right to avoid scraping her wing over the dark brown thickness smeared on the wall, all her air coming in through her mouth now . . . because her brain had identified the major component of the putrid stink as that of a decomposing corpse.</p><p>6</p><p>Stopping at the foot of the narrow staircase that ran along one wall, Ransom murmured, \u201cKeep to the left and wait till I\u2019m at the top, then come up.\u201d</p><p>The stairs creaked under his weight, again under Elena\u2019s, but held.</p><p>Guns out, Ransom led her down the upstairs hallway and into a room so pungent with death her stomach would\u2019ve revolted if she hadn\u2019t steeled herself against the gag reflex. The second slap was of humidity, something about the way the room was built acting to trap what little heat there was . . . and accelerate the decomposition process.</p><p>Immediately identifying the filthy mattress below the boarded-up windows as the source of the scent of putrefaction, Elena walked across, trusting Ransom to watch her back. The body was bloated with the gases of death, skin a sickly green, but the head remained attached to the neck, and the shirt-clad chest was unmolested, judging from a surface glance. That meant his heart was likely still inside his body.</p><p>Going down on her knee, Elena blinked rapidly to dry out eyes that threatened to water from the pulsing waves of smell, ignored the maggots, and peeled back the corpse\u2019s lip.</p><p>Canines, sharp and gleaming white.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t a baby vamp,\u201d she said through gritted teeth, \u201cso this isn\u2019t a Making gone bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the throat.\u201d</p><p>Wings rustling against God knew what on the dirty floor, she retrieved the slimline flashlight she kept tucked alongside the knife on her left thigh and pointed the beam at the victim\u2019s neck. \u201cHell.\u201d Thick pustules filled with bloody fluid covered the male\u2019s throat, all the way to the open collar of his shirt . . . and down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSmell\u2019s getting to me, Ellie,\u201d Ransom said, just as her own stomach began to churn.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>They both ripped off their masks to take deep gulps of the crisp winter air the instant they hit the street. Gloves went next, Elena\u2019s skin itching to breathe. When Ransom retrieved a couple of bottles of water from the panther-black body of his motorcycle, throwing her one, she took it with a nod of thanks.</p> <p>\u201cVampires aren\u2019t supposed to get sick,\u201d he said, after emptying half the bottle.</p><p>Splashing some water into one hand, Elena wiped it over her face, knowing it would take multiple showers to get that foul smell out of her nose. \u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChop off their heads, they die,\u201d Ransom continued. \u201cSet them on fire, or cut out their hearts, they die unless they\u2019re strong and old old. But soon as they\u2019re Made, they don\u2019t get sick. One thing\u2019s for sure\u2014Darrell definitely didn\u2019t have anything to do with this.\u201d</p><p>Elena agreed. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to bring in a consult from the Tower.\u201d One of the more experienced angels or vampires; maybe there was a weird vamp virus that got a minority of them and she simply didn\u2019t know about it. \u201cWhoever it is will probably ask you to sign a nondisclosure agreement in blood.\u201d</p><p>Ransom pretended to plump up a vein while she made the call to Aodhan. \u201cI think this is serious,\u201d she said to the angel, after describing the situation. \u201cRansom and I need to continue our hunt\u2014can you spare someone to guard the body until it can be moved to a morgue?\u201d</p> <p>Aodhan asked her to give him five minutes but it was almost fifteen minutes later that he personally escorted another angel to the site. A bare five foot six and slender as a boy, the unexpected angel\u2019s uptilted eyes were a gentle brown, his lips lush in a face saved from near-feminine prettiness by the sense of sheer maleness that clung to Keir.</p><p>Her frustration at the wait dissolving into deep affection, she leaned down into Keir\u2019s kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou must have left the Refuge as soon as it happened.\u201d It. The Falling. An awful malice reduced to two simple words.</p><p>\u201cRaphael had a jet prepared for me so I would not be tired upon my arrival,\u201d he told her, eyes painfully wise. \u201cIt was strange to fly in the belly of a metal creature when I have wings of my own, but he was right.\u201d</p><p>When Aodhan was unexpectedly recalled to the Tower a second later, Elena remained at the house to watch Keir\u2019s back, while Ransom continued to circle out from the house, searching for any sign that Darrell had made it this far. Stomach muscles clenched against the noxious stink, Elena led Keir to the corpse, where the healer examined it in silence, not saying a word until they were back out on the deserted street.</p><p>\u201cA true infection.\u201d Troubled darkness in the lush brown of his eyes. \u201cI must autopsy the body under better lighting, see if I can pinpoint how the infection was introduced into his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRansom and I were talking before you arrived, and we thought maybe the victim drank from the wrong person.\u201d</p> <p>His expression grew darker, even more serious. \u201cThe bodies of our blood kin,\u201d Keir said, \u201care built to filter out impurities in blood\u2014that is why a vampire can feed from any donor, even the most diseased.\u201d Strands of silky black hair fell across his dusky skin as he looked at the ground, lost in thought. \u201cIf that mechanism failed . . .\u201d</p><p>A sudden brilliance of blue, Illium landing in front of her. Having contacted her while Keir looked over the body, he\u2019d brought a body bag to transport the victim to the research labs underneath the Tower, a small biohazard container for her, as well as better masks and replacement gloves, and didn\u2019t argue when she made him use the safety gear.</p><p>\u201cThis house needs to be burned to the ground,\u201d he said when he returned with the body, his expression harsher than most people ever saw. \u201cWe can\u2019t take the risk that the cause of the infection might lie within.\u201d</p><p>Sensing Keir was anxious to examine the body, and aware Raphael had to need Illium, she told the blue-winged angel she\u2019d take care of the situation and made a call to Ransom as soon as they lifted off. \u201cI\u2019m going to do a final run through the house.\u201d After which she had an idea about its destruction. \u201cI need to finish this\u201d\u2014stop the disease here if it hadn\u2019t already spread\u2014\u201cso if you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cI\u2019ll join you. Trail\u2019s so dead it\u2019s in rigor\u2014don\u2019t think Darrell made it this far. Background report should come in soon, so we\u2019ll have a better idea of other places he might frequent; may as well try to figure out what happened here in the meantime.\u201d</p><p>Freshly gloved and masked, she and Ransom went through the entire place one more time, looking for anything that might provide a clue. \u201cWhy did you say this track was a slam-dunk?\u201d she asked, placing the hypodermic needles she\u2019d noticed earlier into the biohazard container.</p><p>\u201cVamp wasn\u2019t a runner. He just got homesick every so often\u2014his angel would give him three or four days, then send a hunter to pick him up.\u201d The quiet pity in his tone resonated with the same emotion inside Elena. \u201cRecords say he never resisted, was always polite and apologetic and full of stories about his plans to renovate the house.\u201d</p><p>It was a poignant image, of a harmless man who hadn\u2019t deserved death. As the five angels Nimra\u2019s squadron carried home in flower-strewn biers hadn\u2019t deserved it. Embers of anger burning slow and dark inside her, she didn\u2019t reply and the two of them finished the rest of the sweep in silence.</p> <p>\u201cI have to agree with the pretty boy\u2014house needs to be toast,\u201d Ransom said, once they were back out in front of the dilapidated villa.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling Illium a pretty boy?\u201d Elena snorted, glad to focus on something other than the heavy cloud of death that hung over the city. \u201cHave you looked in the mirror lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have scars, like any respectable male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough guy.\u201d Staring at the house where a vampire had died in what she hoped was a quick death, she put her hands on her hips. \u201cThink Sara would be pissed if we just set it on fire and said \u2018oops\u2019 when the fire department arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s forgiven you for the whole being-chased-by-a-vampire-through-Manhattan incident.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cArson would make a good cover story, though. It\u2019s just the kind of place some firebug would light up.\u201d</p><p>An hour later and thanks to Sara\u2019s connection to every agency in the city, the house underwent a controlled burn initiated by the fire department. If only, Elena thought, they could as quickly erase the threat posed by a disease that had decimated the cells of a near-immortal.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Having flown to the Tower to drop off the biohazard con tainer, Elena took the chance to duck into her and Raphael\u2019s private suite to shower and change. Ransom had roared off to do the same\u2014not only were they stabbing blindly in the dark with the background report still MIA, neither one of them would be much good at sneaking up on a fellow hunter with the stink that clung to their clothes and skin.</p><p>\u201cMight as well wear a bell,\u201d had been Ransom\u2019s succinct assessment.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished scrubbing her hair and body clean several times over when her cell phone rang, Jeffrey\u2019s name on the screen. Grabbing fresh gear from the clothing she kept at the Tower, she let the call go to voice mail, having no intention of hashing this out over the phone.</p><p>Once dressed, her hair braided and her weapons in place, she got in touch with Ransom. \u201cDo you need me right this sec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to check out a tip on my own.\u201d</p><p>Figuring he needed to connect with one of his street contacts, wary people who trusted Ransom alone, she agreed to meet up with him at an Upper East Side address in an hour and, walking out to the balcony, flew off into the cold wind coming off the water. She\u2019d spoken to Raphael while she\u2019d been in the shower, so she knew he was heading back to the Tower over that water, Aodhan by his side and two integrated squadrons at his back, having just completed a critical drill.</p><p>Preparation, Elena thought, for an unprovoked and already ugly war.</p><p>Words that might as well apply to her relationship with Jeffrey.</p><p>The woman who opened the door to the brownstone office had skin of gleaming mahogany, her hair cut in a glossy bob and her body encased in a neat skirt-suit of jewel green. Nothing at all like the vamp-addicted brunette who\u2019d been Jeffrey\u2019s last assistant, her skin pale from too many donations in too short a time.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201d the current PA asked, her throat moving as she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell Mr. Deveraux I\u2019ll wait for him in the back garden.\u201d As she made her way to that tiny green enclosure through a narrow access path, her mind filled with images of another brownstone, another door. Sara and Deacon had changed the layout and size of their house so that Elena would feel welcome, and yet her own father had done exactly nothing to ensure the same. Not that Elena was surprised, only furious at herself for continuing to permit him to wound her.</p><p>Jeffrey appeared in the back doorway as she arrived. \u201cElieanora. I have a meeting in five minutes.\u201d Curt impatience in eyes of pale gray set in an aristocratic face and hidden behind spectacles framed in fine gold, his pure white hair combed with neat perfection, his stone gray suit sitting easily on his shoulders.</p><p>No doubt, her father was a handsome man, the kind of confident male irresistible to women young and na\u00efve enough to think they could penetrate his icy exterior. He\u2019d have no trouble finding another mistress to take the place of the one who\u2019d been brutally murdered during the hunt that had forever altered Elena\u2019s life. Perhaps he\u2019d already done so, already replaced the woman who\u2019d looked nothing like the elegant beauty who was Jeffrey\u2019s current wife. No, the poor woman had been a pale imitation of Marguerite . . . and a living symbol of the pain her father had never once acknowledged aloud after those first brutal days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead he\u2019d wiped Marguerite from their home in what Elena now understood had been a cold rage. His wife had betrayed him the day she wrapped that noose around her throat, and Jeffrey was still so angry at her for it. Elena could\u2019ve forgiven him that rage, but what she couldn\u2019t forgive was that he\u2019d thrown one of Marguerite\u2019s children out with the trash, too.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I\u2019m here,\u201d she said, fighting to remain calm, to not be reduced to the level of a screaming teenager.</p><p>\u201cYou had no authority to take Eve out of school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop. I am not doing this dance with you today.\u201d She kept speaking despite the chill of his eyes. \u201cThe reason I went to Eve was that she was hiding in a corner crying.\u201d</p><p>Skin white over bone, a tic in his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d she said, merciless in her love for a sister who was yet an innocent. \u201cShe\u2019s your baby, and you told her to get out of your sight?\u201d Elena made no attempt to hide her disgust. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do that, Jeffrey, not to her. She thinks you hung the fucking moon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch the language,\u201d he snapped, hands still in the pockets of his suit pants. \u201cAnd my daughter is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my sister, you bastard. Same blood, remember?\u201d Voice vibrating with old anger that threatened to savage her intention to remain rational, she didn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou made us, and you know what, I don\u2019t even care anymore.\u201d It was a lie she wished would become the truth. \u201cBut Eve, she cares. So grow a pair and be a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElieanora!\u201d Striding across the grass, he grabbed her shoulders and shook hard enough to make her teeth rattle. \u201cI\u2019m still your father and you will not talk to me that way. Marguerite taught you better than that.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time in over a decade that she\u2019d heard him say her mother\u2019s name and for an instant, they both froze, before fury ignited in her blood. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare bring her into this! You chose to stop being my father a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Fingers digging into her shoulders, he ground out his next words. \u201cI will always be your father . . . and I wish to God I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Flinching at the vicious emotional blow, she finally remembered her hunter training and wrenched away, her wing smacking hard against his body as she twisted. \u201cYeah, me, too.\u201d How could he do this every time? Cut her so deep? \u201cBut me and you, it doesn\u2019t matter. Ancient history.\u201d</p><p>The father who\u2019d loved her had died with her mother, the shell left behind this cruel stranger capable of aiming a kick at a child\u2019s soft heart. \u201cYou just think about whether you want to be having this same conversation with Eve ten years from now.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have done it, not with having already strained her wings once today, but she made a vertical takeoff, ignoring the words Jeffrey spoke as he reached for her. And when tears poured down her face, she told herself it was from the pain in her muscles. It wasn\u2019t a total lie, her body screaming at the abuse.</p> <p>Two minutes later, a tendon tore with an audible snap, and she realized she was now not only useless to Ransom, but that, in her unthinking fury, she might have made a fatal mistake.</p><p>7</p><p>She barely made it to the Tower, her knees slamming hard onto the concrete of the balcony outside the suite she\u2019d left only twenty-five minutes earlier. When a tiny blue feather fluttered to the hard surface as she leaned on her palms in an attempt to fight the bright pain of the impact, she knew she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Illium landed beside her an instant later, his hands going to her shoulders and his wing sliding across her own. \u201cEllie, you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged him off, still able to feel Jeffrey\u2019s grip on her arms. \u201cHow long have you been following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a minute\u2014it didn\u2019t look like you were going to make the landing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did, so go,\u201d she said. \u201cGo. Go!\u201d</p><p>An instant after the words were out, she raised her head to apologize, but Illium was already dropping off the balcony. Hating herself for allowing Jeffrey to mess her up until she\u2019d hurt one of her closest friends, she crawled and dragged herself into the living area of the suite, collapsing flat on her face the instant she was concealed from the windows, the carpet against her cheek and the crossbow digging into her hip. Reaching down, she managed to get it off, along with the miniature flamethrower, placing both on the left side of her body.</p> <p>A whisper of sound not long afterward told her Illium hadn\u2019t been offended\u2014he\u2019d simply gone for stronger weaponry. \u201cGuild Hunter.\u201d Words deadly and cool from the Archangel of New York. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt your wings.\u201d</p><p>Fingers digging into the carpet, she admitted her mistake. \u201cI did two hard vertical takeoffs today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie still. I will attempt to fix the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said through the screaming agony. \u201cThe others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be bedbound for weeks or months, regardless of my actions. Your stupidity, meanwhile, I may be able to mend immediately.\u201d</p><p>Lashed by his tone, she struck out. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your help!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, instead you did your best to ensure I\u2019d have to deal with a dead consort when you are meant to be helping to protect the city by evidencing your strength.\u201d</p><p>Jaw clenched against the anger dammed up inside her, she didn\u2019t say a word, and a bone-melting warmth invaded her wing muscles a second later, trickles of it reaching her knees, as if Raphael\u2019s ability had sensed the fractures that cracked her kneecaps. The pain began to dim almost at once, and she realized he\u2019d become far stronger than he\u2019d been even a month before . . . but that didn\u2019t alter the fact that, in stark contrast to the violent physical abilities manifesting in the rest of the Cadre, Raphael\u2019s new power was a pacific one.</p><p>Ironically, his ability to heal might end up being a lethal weakness.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a war,\u201d he\u2019d predicted weeks earlier as they watched midnight come to their city, the night winds thrusting covetous fingers through his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable during a Cascade\u2014from all we know, one or more of the Cadre will either touch madness or gain a power that so eclipses the abilities of the others, he or she will seek to seize the world. I can\u2019t afford to stagnate, to have only the strength that has always been at my command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour power negates Lijuan\u2019s,\u201d she\u2019d pointed out. \u201cAnd she\u2019s the biggest threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA negative power won\u2019t be enough to win, and, while she may be the biggest threat, she isn\u2019t the only one.\u201d The cold-eyed candor of a man who\u2019d held his territory for half a millennium. \u201cNeha creates fire and ice, Astaad is rumored to control the sea, and there are whispers Favashi holds the winds in the palm of her hand. For the Cadre to remain in balance, I cannot stand in place.\u201d</p><p>Now, the guilt that had been gnawing at her since that conversation combined with her impotent anger at Jeffrey to create a caustic mess in her gut, corrosive and damaging. Raphael would never blame her, but it was Elena who\u2019d made him a little bit mortal, a little bit weaker\u2014exactly as Lijuan had once warned.</p><p>\u201cYou tore a tendon.\u201d The ice in his tone hadn\u2019t thawed. \u201cDo that again and I\u2019ll leave you to heal on your own. Perhaps then you\u2019ll develop some respect for your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pissed off and I acted before I thought,\u201d she said, giving him one truth even as she hid the more noxious one that continued to eat at her. \u201cI know it was childish and dangerous\u2014you don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeffrey?\u201d Raphael said, allowing her to sit up, which she did without a twinge of pain.</p><p>\u201cHe hurt Eve.\u201d Raphael knew her well enough to understand what that meant.</p><p>Chrome blue eyes flat with renewed fury. \u201cIs she well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Twisting her braid in his fist with that single word, Raphael tugged back her head and took her mouth in a kiss that was hot red passion and the cool brush of an archangel\u2019s anger. If you did not love him, he said into her mind, his hand closing possessively over her breast, I would sever this man from your life like the diseased limb that he is.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I love him or hate him, she confessed as he took her down to the carpet once more, but Beth, Amy, Eve, they need him.</p><p>A gasp, her back arching; Raphael had burned away the laces that held her top together to bare her breasts to the air. His mouth touched her sensitive flesh an instant later, his teeth grazing her nipple. Hissing out a breath, she dug her nails into his shoulders and tried to flip him using her legs, wanting the advantage . . . but her lover was an archangel, and he didn\u2019t want to be moved.</p><p>He bit down deeper, until it skated the edge of hurt. When you decided to continue flying, did you think about the fact I might have to scrape you off the street? Releasing her breast with that angry question, he ravaged her mouth and, at the same time, ripped open the fly of the cargo pants she\u2019d changed into a half hour earlier.</p><p>His fingers speared through her damp flesh, her panties who the hell knew where. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she gritted out as he rubbed his thumb deliberately hard against her clit, knowing it would send her over the edge . . . only to relax the pressure right when her body hovered on the brink of excruciating pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Chest heaving, she stared into a masculine face that held more than a hint of cruelty right this instant. \u201cThat was mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling mean, Guild Hunter.\u201d He touched her again, thrusting two fingers inside her and using his thumb to play with her clitoris as he bent his head to her exposed breast once more, his teeth marking her soft flesh. Very mean.</p><p>Body quivering as he denied her an orgasm for the second time, Elena snarled and raked her nails down his back, tearing the fine black fabric of his shirt. Blood scented the air, Raphael\u2019s head snapping up to reveal eyes gone incandescent, his wings glowing above her. Slamming his mouth down on her own, he tore open his pants and she felt the blunt hardness of his cock pushing against her . . . but he didn\u2019t thrust, clearly still in one hell of a mood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Do it! Biting down on his lower lip hard enough to break skin, she locked her legs around his hips and jerked her own upward.</p><p>A single hard inch, and then all of him as he thrust deep, stretching her tight flesh with his thickness. Elena came without warning, her body clenching around his so possessively that he broke the kiss to brace his fisted hands on either side of her head. Refusing to lose that connection even as her body spasmed in a near-painful orgasm, she grabbed his face, initiated another kiss that was all tongue and heat and fury.</p><p>His cock slid over her oversensitized muscles as he pulled out his entire length, only to slam back in so hard she felt him in her throat. Then he was coming inside her, the intimate wetness pushing her over the edge into a pleasure so vicious, it tore her to pieces.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still wearing all your knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve used them,\u201d Elena muttered from her position trapped beneath Raphael\u2019s body, his cock still inside her, and his breath hot against her neck. \u201cBastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drew blood, so I believe we\u2019re even.\u201d</p><p>Arms wrapped around his neck, she kissed his temple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I scared you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the done thing for an archangel to admit fear, but he was hers, and she\u2019d hurt him without meaning to; it was up to her to fix her mistake.</p> <p>His wings shifted, but he didn\u2019t extricate their bodies. \u201cI didn\u2019t know fear until you, Elena. Use the power wisely.\u201d</p><p>It was a punch to the heart, that naked admission. \u201cWell,\u201d she said in an attempt to make him smile, \u201cif it gets me this well fucked . . .\u201d</p><p>Rising onto his elbows, his hair a turbulent mess and his lower lip already healed, he pinned her with a gaze kissed with more than a touch of male arrogance. \u201cHave I not been satisfying you?\u201d</p><p>God, he was sexy. She wanted to tear off his clothes and drive him wild when he got that look on his face. \u201cGiven that I screamed the greenhouse down the night before last,\u201d she said, her toes curling at the reminder of how he\u2019d taken her from behind, her hands braced on her workbench, \u201cI think you know exactly how well you\u2019ve been satisfying me.\u201d She moaned as he withdrew from her body, her tissues deliciously swollen. \u201cThough angry sex does have something going for it.\u201d</p><p>A faint curve of his lips at last, his head dipping to press a kiss over the bite he\u2019d taken of her breast, the mark red yet. \u201cYes.\u201d He rose, did up his pants, and dragged her to her feet. \u201cIt may become my favorite way to work out our differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you do this to all my clothes,\u201d she said, realizing the ripping and tearing sounds had been for real. \u201cDamn it. I just changed.\u201d Sudden panic, a glance at her watch. \u201cI still have fifteen minutes to make the meet with Ransom.\u201d Racing into the bedroom, she stripped off her weapons, slithered out of her clothes, and\u2014after a quick dash into the bathroom to wash some hotly personal fluids from her body\u2014returned to re-dress.</p> <p>An insane three minutes later, and Raphael, wearing a black shirt identical to the one she\u2019d shredded, slid her longest blade down her back again. \u201cThe hunt might run late,\u201d she said. \u201cSo don\u2019t send the squadrons out looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither you have forgotten your prior engagement,\u201d Raphael said as she rapidly rebraided her hair, \u201cor you\u2019re attempting to avoid it.\u201d</p><p>It came to her in a rush of memory\u2014heavy embossed paper, a polite invitation it had taken her hours to draft, a response elegant and formal but with a delicate, whimsical drawing of a lemur in one corner. \u201cThey didn\u2019t cancel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah offered, but I told him we\u2019d like to see him and Hannah at our table.\u201d Folding his wings tightly to his back, he walked out onto the balcony, the winter air a cold blast as she followed. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we began to build some true friendships among the Cadre. Other alliances are already forming that may be destructive in the war to come.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing at her bare arms, she tried to remember if she\u2019d left spare full-length sheaths at the Tower. However, it wasn\u2019t only the wind and the thickening cloud layer that had the hairs rising along her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about Neha and Lijuan.\u201d The two powerful archangels were neighbors, had always had a cordial relationship.</p><p>\u201cIt could be a lethal liaison.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of a Manhattan under siege from a hail of fire and ice, while the reborn fed on mortal flesh in a bloody plague across the city, and felt her gorge rise. \u201cJason said he\u2019s positive Neha hasn\u2019t been taken in by Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeha also has a twin in her territory who may yet lead her army against Neha,\u201d Raphael pointed out. \u201cAnd she blames me for the death of her child.\u201d A reminder that no matter Neha\u2019s acceptance of Jason into her territory in the recent past, certain wounds continued to fester. \u201cLijuan, meanwhile, has been very polite about keeping both her reborn and her forces away from their shared border.\u201d</p> <p>Put that way Elena could see the alliance forming in front of her eyes. \u201cElijah and you\u2014you\u2019re friends already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf a sort. He has always offered his support to me in matters of the Cadre.\u201d Acknowledging a passing squadron led by Illium, who looked every inch the blooded fighter she so often forgot him to be, Raphael shot out a random bolt of energy.</p><p>Elena sucked in a breath as Illium gave a single command and the squadron split to avoid the bolt . . . which Illium deflected with the sword he\u2019d pulled from his back. It hit the Tower without causing damage, and Illium saluted them with a grin before continuing onward. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t angelfire.\u201d An archangel killer, angelfire could shatter concrete.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was a weak strike meant to test the squadron\u2019s alertness.\u201d Eyes on the city, Raphael returned to their earlier topic of conversation. \u201cIf Elijah and I are to create a true friendship, an alliance that\u2019ll hold in the fighting to come, then I must not only invite him into my territory, but trust him on a level beyond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell him the full effects of the Falling?\u201d Open surprise in his consort\u2019s tone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He trusted none of the Cadre enough to share the compromised status of his defenses. \u201cElijah may have offered the olive branch of friendship, but he has also held his territory for longer than I\u2019ve been an archangel. He is as ruthless as any of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Elena asked quietly. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve had a chance to assess all the injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve begun the process of transferring in men and women from outlying areas to bolster our defensive force, but Tower personnel are chosen for a reason. They\u2019re the best of the best, each personally tested and selected by Galen.\u201d Furthermore, his weapons-master made it nonnegotiable that each fighter return to the Refuge once every two years for intensive training.</p><p>\u201cThe outlying areas\u2014they won\u2019t be left vulnerable?\u201d Checking the gun she carried in an inner thigh holster, having swapped out one of her blades for the sleek piece, Elena slid it back, the fine lines of her face troubled in the stormy light. \u201cSince we\u2019re taking their people.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly the kind of question a consort was meant to ask, one that challenged without judgment. He knew Elena often thought she didn\u2019t know the \u201crules\u201d of immortal behavior, but knowledge of pomp and ceremony was useless without the heart to love their people and the courage to speak her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s considered cowardly to nibble away at a territory and no archangel wishes such a stain on his or her honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, as a spit of rain hit her cheek, the sky holding the deluge for now, \u201cI guess that\u2019s good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a sense. But there\u2019s no shame in being clever about your invasion.\u201d Immortals valued intelligence as much as strength. \u201cTo soften up a city for an attack by engineering an event such as the Falling? It would be considered a good strategy in the aftermath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe diseased vamp.\u201d Eyes of winter gray met his, the rim of silver faint in this light. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll know nothing for certain until Keir completes his tests, but I\u2019ve told all senior angels and vampires to report any aberrant or troubling behavior. No such disease can be permitted to gain a foothold anywhere in the territory.\u201d He looked to the clouds once more. \u201cComplete your task for the Guild, Elena. Be visible in the doing. Our objective remains the same\u2014not to give our enemies any indication that the city has been so grievously wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Elena bit out, \u201cif the Falling was a planned attack, it wasn\u2019t clever but cowardly. Murder from a distance.\u201d</p><p>Words he\u2019d expect from a warrior.</p><p>A fleeting kiss, her weapon-roughened fingertips on his cheek. \u201cI won\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><p>He watched her leave in a sweep of midnight and dawn, her wings unlike any other, and he knew he\u2019d damn his own honor and take vengeance on the world should anyone dare lay a finger on her.</p><p>8</p><p>Ransom was sitting on his bike staring at a taped-up fold out map when she landed beside him only four minutes behind schedule. His black leather jacket undone to reveal a dark green tee, paired with leather pants and the heavy black boots he\u2019d been wearing earlier, mirrored sunglasses hiding his vivid green eyes, he looked like an ad for the bike company, far too pretty to actually be dangerous.</p><p>Except, of course, for the guns strapped to his thighs, the blades and extra firepower he wore hidden underneath his jacket. \u201cAnything from your sources?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cZip,\u201d he said, without taking his eyes off the ancient map he refused to give up, even though, like every hunter, he had a Guild-issued smartphone with full GPS capability. \u201cBut at least we now know Darrell isn\u2019t crawling around in the underground.\u201d</p><p>Not in the mood to tease him today about his infamous map, she glanced around and forced herself to return the polite smile of the vampire who passed on the sidewalk, his cane and hat as dapper as the suit that encased his short, bowlegged form. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Copper dust and cinnamon spice, with an underlying hint of burnt oak.</p><p>Complex and interesting and unique.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to ask something,\u201d she said in a deliberate attempt to get her mind off the repulsive nature of the attack against the city\u2014and after Raphael\u2019s comments about \u201csoftening up\u201d a city, she had few doubts that that was exactly what it had been. \u201cDo you scent the same things I do?\u201d</p> <p>Ransom made a face when she described what she\u2019d picked up from the passing vamp. \u201cYeah, except I don\u2019t say shit like \u2018cinnamon spice with a hint of burnt oak.\u2019 I say \u2018dude smells like an electrified tree with a side of doughnut topping.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Choking on unexpected laughter, she leaned her arm on his shoulder and looked down at the map, aware of two stroller-pushing nannies stopping to sneak photos of them from the other side of the quiet street. \u201cSo who are we going to see?\u201d A whiff of citrus, strong and clean. \u201cNice shampoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemons, smart-ass. My gran says it\u2019s the best way to get rid of bad smells. Darrell\u2019s grandmother, on the other hand, owns that building there\u201d\u2014a nod to the right\u2014\u201cand if Darrell is close to anyone, it\u2019s likely to be his gran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, not really. We were on one hunt together three years ago.\u201d Folding away the map, he gave it to her to slide into the daypack he wore. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say much, but I picked up that his gran pretty much raised him\u2014a quick online search gave me this address for her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t have the background report?\u201d With a hunt this time-critical, they needed the information yesterday. If Vivek had been in charge . . . but he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cApparently\u201d\u2014a clenched jaw that told her he was about to deliver bad news\u2014\u201cthere was some kind of computer meltdown. Guild\u2019s working manually to put the report together.\u201d</p><p>Frustration churning in her gut, she stepped back so he could swing off the bike, keeping her eyes open for any movement from behind the curtained windows of the regal old home that was their destination. Complete with fancy cornices marred by not a speck of city grit, the entire place was painted a gleaming white.</p><p>\u201cMs. Flaherty is indisposed,\u201d a maid told them when they reached the door.</p><p>\u201cThis is about her grandson, Darrell.\u201d Ransom showed the stately white-haired woman his Guild license. \u201cI think she\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>A hint of what looked like true concern on her face before she gestured them into a room off the hallway. \u201cPlease wait in the morning room.\u201d</p> <p>Wings just fitting through the doorways, Elena walked to stand in front of a window that overlooked the street, while Ransom prowled around the room after dropping his daypack on a chair upholstered in burgundy with swirls of gold, the arms and back carved of honey-colored wood.</p><p>They heard the quiet hum of what might\u2019ve been an elevator several minutes later, then the maid wheeled Ms. Flaherty into the room. Darrell\u2019s grandmother wore a peach-colored turban on her head, her body thin underneath a flowing caftan of soft violet, her mocha-colored skin papery thin. However, the hand she reached up to squeeze the maid\u2019s appeared strong, her brown eyes alert and clear.</p><p>A face, Elena thought, that held as much strength and character as beauty. Not a woman who\u2019d break under the troubling news of her grandson\u2019s mental state\u2014if she didn\u2019t already know. Could be Darrell had come home to hole up, try to get his head on straight. It\u2019d be the best possible outcome.</p><p>Folding her hands on her lap rug after the maid left, Ms. Flaherty looked straight at Elena. \u201cIs my grandson dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as we know, he\u2019s alive,\u201d she said at once, because if Ms. Flaherty didn\u2019t know of Darrell\u2019s whereabouts, any other answer would be a torment.</p><p>The tiniest slump of her shoulders before the elderly lady took control of the situation. \u201cStop looming and sit.\u201d She didn\u2019t speak again until they\u2019d both obeyed. \u201cSo, if he\u2019s not dead, then he must be in trouble. How bad is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t crossed the line yet.\u201d Ransom had apparently come to the same conclusion as Elena about Darrell\u2019s grandmother: she might appear weak but this lady wouldn\u2019t thank them for pussyfooting around. \u201cWe need to haul him in before he does something the Guild can\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put an innocent vampire in the hospital,\u201d Elena elaborated, when Ms. Flaherty turned to her. \u201cThe beating was merciless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucky for him, he chose a vampire just out of his Contract, with dreams of cruising the world and no time for hassles with an official case.\u201d Ransom leaned forward, arms braced on his thighs. \u201cThe Guild Director convinced him to accept a payout in lieu of laying charges, which means the Guild doesn\u2019t have to officially suspend Darrell\u2019s license, but he hurts anyone else and he\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my boy.\u201d Ms. Flaherty\u2019s body vibrated with unhidden outrage. \u201cDarrell does his job. He doesn\u2019t abuse those he hunts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe things we see in the course of the job?\u201d Elena held the elderly lady\u2019s sharp eyes. \u201cIt can cause cracks that don\u2019t heal without intervention, and Darrell recently walked into a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Flaherty\u2019s fingers trembled on the lap rug, but her voice didn\u2019t crack when she spoke. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen or heard from him in a week, and he always calls me every couple of days, especially since I\u2019ve had this dratted cold I can\u2019t seem to shake.\u201d A deep breath that caught, but she waved off their concern to point a finger at Ransom. \u201cYou find my boy before he comes to harm. Don\u2019t you let him down\u2014you\u2019re his Guild. He always said you were like family.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cWe are family,\u201d Ransom muttered once they returned to the bike, neither one of them of the opinion that Ms. Flaherty had lied. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the idiot just come in when he realized he was losing it? He knows no one would\u2019ve blinked an eye if he needed more counseling\u2014or, hell, if he wanted to get drunk every day for a week. We would\u2019ve gone with him, carried him home from the fucking bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a bad place, not thinking straight.\u201d Elena refused to fail at bringing Darrell home. Maybe she couldn\u2019t halt an archangelic war, or make her father into a decent human being, but this one fracture she could and would mend. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have specifics, how about we start trying the usual Guild haunts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I w\u2014\u201d Grabbing his phone at the chime, he gave her the thumbs-up. \u201cSara\u2019s been talking to his friends, sent us a list of his other known hangouts. One of his buds already scoped the apartment, found it empty.\u201d Sliding on his sunglasses, he e-mailed the list to her phone. \u201cYou take the top half, I\u2019ll take the bottom, see if we can pick up a trail. If you think you have him, call me\u2014with his head screwed up as it is, he might forget we\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me, too.\u201d Scanning her half of the list after getting his nod, Elena noted a gun shop, a clothing resupply store that catered to hunters and cops, an apartment that apparently housed a discreet pro, and the New York Public Library. \u201cHe must like to read.\u201d Somehow, that small, unexpected fact made him more human, more real.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Always has a paperback in his back pocket.\u201d Tugging on his helmet, Ransom straddled the bike, flicked up the kickstand with a boot, turned the key, and kick-started the engine. The machine roared to purring life. \u201cGet on. I\u2019ll run you over to a building you can use as a launchpad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019ll have to spread my wings to keep them off the street and next thing I know, I\u2019ll be clipped by some cabbie in a bad mood.\u201d Elena wasn\u2019t going to flirt with being grounded again. Not to mention she\u2019d then have to deal with one extremely pissed-off archangel.</p><p>Devil-may-care grin on his face, Ransom gunned the bike. \u201cCome on, Ellie. I bet we stop traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe visible in the doing.\u201d</p><p>She had a feeling Raphael hadn\u2019t considered this when he\u2019d spoken those words. It was no doubt a bad, bad idea, but damn if it wouldn\u2019t get a stupid amount of coverage, maybe give the city something to smile about.</p><p>\u201cThey should make motorcycles for angels.\u201d</p><p>It was a kick to the gut, that splinter of memory. The words had been spoken by the young angel whose funeral cortege would reach the Refuge after darkfall, his statement directed at a friend as the two of them sat with their legs hanging off a Tower balcony to the left of where Elena stood. She\u2019d smiled at the time, but now the words incited a renewed wave of angry sadness.</p><p>This one\u2019s for you, she thought and swung her leg over the thrumming machine. However, she didn\u2019t sit\u2014that would leave her wings touching the street. Instead, she placed her hands on Ransom\u2019s shoulders and stood on the footholds. She had to spread her wings a little to avoid tangling them in the bike, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as she\u2019d feared. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to deal with considerable drag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sweet girl eats drag for breakfast.\u201d Then they were off, the wind slamming into her face and her wings as Ransom executed a turn and roared down the street to the wide-eyed astonishment of everyone they passed. Laughing, Elena threw back her head and enjoyed the ride as that young soldier would\u2019ve, had he only been given the chance.</p><p>She and Ransom had unquestionably made an impression by the time he brought the bike to a gentle stop in the silent street behind an older building. \u201cThis do?\u201d he asked, nodding at the external fire stairs that led all the way to the roof.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Hopping off the bike, she checked her wings. \u201cStill in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold ya.\u201d</p><p>Bumping his fist to her own, he roared down the street.</p><p>I do believe that is the first time any angel has ridden a motorcycle.</p><p>Grinning at the kiss of the wind and the rain inside her mind as she climbed up the fire escape, she said, I bet that gets our would-be invader\u2019s panties in a bunch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An . . . interesting image, but as a distraction from the state of our defenses, it was inspired. If, however, I didn\u2019t know Ransom was much in love with another, I\u2019d now have to kill him.</p><p>No touching my friends, remember?</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have to touch him to kill him.</p> <p>Very funny. Having made it to the roof, she flared her wings and, sweeping off the edge of the building, flew in the direction of the gun shop as Raphael returned to Tower business. She\u2019d debated heading for the pro first, men being men, but according to Sara\u2019s intel, Darrell hadn\u2019t visited the woman in over two months. The gun shop, however, was one he went to every time he was in town.</p><p>The owner, bearded and with a serious beer gut, was happy to cooperate once she reassured him he hadn\u2019t somehow earned the wrath of the Tower. \u201cDarrell? He\u2019s a good customer, nice guy, too, but I haven\u2019t seen him for, let\u2019s see . . . going on a week now.\u201d A chuckle. \u201cHe really stocked up that last time.\u201d</p><p>When Elena heard what Darrell had bought, her head almost exploded. He has an arsenal, she messaged Ransom and got #%&amp;! as a reply, then a call.</p><p>\u201cIndoor shooting range was a wash. Literally.\u201d Ransom\u2019s tone was taut. \u201cBurst water pipe five days ago, but the owner says Darrell came in every day before the damage, was a crack shot with multiple guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d If Darrell had moved from fists to guns this fast, they could be talking massacre.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m heading to check out his mother\u2019s place. They\u2019re not close, but if he was angry, he might\u2019ve turned up there.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s next stop, the resupply store, had her slamming up against an ex-cop who gave her a blank face and said he didn\u2019t gossip about customers. Too fucking worried to put up with bullshit, Elena laid her cards on the table, no sugarcoating. \u201cDarrell is in trouble. The kind of trouble where he might pick up a gun\u201d\u2014not to mention the freaking assault rifle he\u2019d bought\u2014\u201cand put it to his head or someone else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what?\u201d Flat cop eyes. \u201cThe Tower cares?\u201d</p><p>That was his problem? \u201cThe Guild cares.\u201d She slapped down her license.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were still hunting,\u201d he said, after examining the badge, \u201cbut I guess I figured that was horseshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it isn\u2019t.\u201d She slid away the license. \u201cNow, Darrell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSaw him three days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t here. I saw him at the corner bar couple of blocks over with a stacked redhead. Legs up to her ears.\u201d A shrug. \u201cI figured the man was enjoying his time off, and who was I to bother him.\u201d</p><p>The pro\u2019s apartment, too, Elena realized, was only two blocks over.</p><p>People pointed and whispered the instant she stepped out of the store, this part of town busy, but no one crowded her. All it had taken for her to get her space was shooting a crossbow bolt into the boot of an idiot who wanted to get up close and personal. He\u2019d lived, despite his whining, and now she had a rep. Exactly as she liked it.</p><p>\u201cRansom,\u201d she said, cell phone to her ear as she walked, just like every other New Yorker on the street, \u201cthe pro. Redhead with long legs?\u201d Curving around a businessman engrossed in his miniature tablet, she heard a crash and turned to find him staring openmouthed at her, his expensive gadget on the ground.</p><p>\u201cTourist,\u201d sniffed a passing black-suited executive, her hair a sleek blonde bob and a cup of take-out coffee in her hand.</p><p>The acerbic comment made Elena grin, then they\u2019d moved past one another.</p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d Ransom said. \u201cI was just looking up her photo\u2014yes, that\u2019s her. Double D chest, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould\u2019ve known you\u2019d notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to be dead not to notice that. I got a nibble about a bar on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see your bike.\u201d Hanging up, she jerked up her head. \u201cBar staff know anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey saw him three days ago, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Crossing the street without a word, they made it to the pro\u2019s apartment building in under a minute. Her doorman, his eyes bugging out at the weapons bristling from their bodies, didn\u2019t put up a fight at their questions, divulging that the woman hadn\u2019t left her apartment for forty-eight hours and counting.</p><p>\u201cAnd Honey, she never misses her book club. That was last night.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s eyes met Ransom\u2019s at the doorman\u2019s coda, the acrid taste of fear on her tongue. There was a very good chance that Honey Smith was no longer able to read a book, able to do anything, her decomposing body lying irreparably broken in her apartment.</p><p>Elena was so sick of being too late.</p><p>9</p><p>Having taken the stairs to the roof, Elena swept down, intending to look through the windows of the apartment, only to find the blinds shut. She returned to meet a gun-toting Ransom in front of one of the doors that lined the stylishly decorated and dimly lit penthouse floor. Her own gun out of its holster, she moved quietly to the other side of the door wide enough that her wings wouldn\u2019t be a hindrance in a fight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t smell decomp.\u201d It was a bare whisper.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t either, but what if their quarry had been smart and changed the temperature inside? \u201cAir-con,\u201d she mouthed and saw Ransom\u2019s lips flatten into a thin line.</p><p>\u201cAsk or go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo soon as we have an in.\u201d Ransom slid away his weapon. \u201cCan\u2019t take the risk he has a gun to her head if she isn\u2019t already dead, and he\u2019s in there with her.\u201d</p><p>Motioning for her to keep out of sight, he put on his shades and pounded on the door. \u201cHey, sweetheart.\u201d It was just loud enough that the resident, if she was alive, would worry about her neighbors. \u201cOpen up. We had a date and I paid in advance!\u201d</p><p>Hearing rustling sounds from inside the apartment, Elena scowled at Ransom to pull away from the door in case Darrell shot through it. When he stayed put, she gritted her teeth and prepared to shove him out of the way the instant she picked up anything that sounded even vaguely like a weapon.</p><p>Except the next thing she heard was the door being unlocked and pulled open, the security chain jerking it to a stop. \u201cShut up, you drunk moron,\u201d hissed a clearly irate woman. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Honey Smith? I made the appointment through your website.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking new bookings.\u201d Unhidden frustration. \u201cYou must\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a fucking confirmation number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Lowering his hand into a pocket, Ransom slammed out with some kind of a metal tool and the security chain was gone.</p><p>The redhead screamed as they came in, guns out . . . to find themselves facing the wrong end of a Glock semiautomatic held by a tall, lean man in jeans that hung low on his hips and at least three days of beard growth on his face. \u201cHoney.\u201d The black-satin-robe-clad woman slid behind him at the curt order.</p><p>Ransom was the first to lower his gun. \u201cShit. We thought you fucking lost it, man.\u201d</p><p>Darrell didn\u2019t lower his own gun an inch until Elena slid hers back into the holster.</p><p>\u201cThe Guild,\u201d she said to Honey, in an effort to defuse the tension, \u201cwill pay for the damage.\u201d</p><p>The other woman rolled pretty hazel eyes set in a Botticelli face. \u201cI\u2019ll send them a bill. Now shut the damn door and come in before you get me kicked out of my apartment. I\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie found out about the weapons,\u201d Ransom said to Darrell after the redhead disappeared down the hallway. \u201cWe were afraid you were planning to go on a rampage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it.\u201d A flat statement, his skin several shades lighter than his grandmother\u2019s, eyes a dark gray. \u201cIt was when I started working out the best vantage points for a sniper that I locked all weapons except this one in my gun safe, changed the combination blind so I couldn\u2019t open it without a blowtorch, and came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever your excuse,\u201d Elena said, tone hard because Darrell needed it to be hard, \u201cyou should\u2019ve checked in with the Guild\u2014and your gran.\u201d</p><p>It was her final statement that got his attention, his eyes tortured. \u201cI knew she\u2019d be able to tell I was in trouble, and she\u2019s so sick. I didn\u2019t want to worry her.\u201d</p><p>Elena threw him her phone, unable to forget the trembling of Ms. Flaherty\u2019s hands. \u201cDo it now.\u201d</p><p>The smell of coffee filtered into the air just as he finished the call, and Honey padded back to the entranceway. \u201cY\u2019all planning to come in and visit, or just stand around looking badass?\u201d</p><p>Elena grinned, deciding she liked the other woman, just as Ransom folded his arms high on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m always up for looking badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the hair, right?\u201d Darrell said, a glint in his eye.</p><p>Ransom showed him the finger and all at once there was no more tension.</p><p>A half hour and a cup of coffee later, Darrell turned himself in to the Guild, ready to undergo a psych evaluation and to actually cooperate with the counselor. It was a small win for the good guys, but Elena would take it. Now she had to fly home and do her best to help Raphael forge an alliance that could mean the safety of hundreds of thousands, the scale of death that might result from an archangelic war incomprehensible.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>After a day that had involved countless subtle strategic moves as he positioned his city in readiness to defend against an attack from an unknown enemy, Raphael stood beside his consort on the lawn of their home, watching Elijah and Hannah come in to land. The other pair had decided to stay at an undisclosed location about an hour\u2019s flight from the Enclave, though they\u2019d notified Raphael the instant they crossed over into his territory.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a courtship, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Elena murmured, her flowing gown of blue-green silk a cool kiss of spring in the arms of winter. \u201cBoth of you being so well behaved and formal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I understand the allusion, hbeebti, but perhaps you can find another term. He brushed his wing over her own, pleased to see she appeared to carry no residual soreness. I have no desire to court Elijah.</p><p>Amusement in a face that showed only the faintest touch of immortality, the transition far too slow to protect her from the dangers on the horizon. Yet Elena was not one to sit in safety. No, his hunter would fight beside him, come what may. That was who she was, as he was an archangel who\u2019d battle to the death to protect his own.</p><p>\u201cElijah\u201d he said, once the visiting couple had folded away their wings, \u201cmy consort and I welcome you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe are glad to be here, Raphael.\u201d Elijah\u2019s gaze met his before he turned to acknowledge Elena with a formal bow of his head, his aristocratic profile the inspiration to countless sculptors over the millennia of his existence, his hair golden against skin of a paler gold.</p><p>Raphael made the introductions, was unsurprised when Elena greeted Elijah with warmth and poise, despite her reservations about \u201cnot knowing which fork to use,\u201d as she\u2019d put it. Then, before he could warn her that protocol between two consorts dictated she must call Hannah by her title of Consort until invited otherwise, she smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you at last, Hannah.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s consort beamed and held out her hands instead of taking insult, her exuberant black curls swept back with jeweled combs, the ebony of her skin glowing in the red-orange of sunset. The storm clouds had passed with only a single heavy shower and the air tasted of ozone, clean and fresh, erasing any final traces of the blood that had soaked into the earth on which they stood . . . but the scar remained. No one would ever forget the day the angels fell.</p><p>\u201cI say the same, Elena.\u201d Hannah\u2019s response was made in a voice clear and musical, the two women\u2019s hands touching. \u201cI came to the Refuge especially to see you, you know, but Raphael was remorselessly protective and did not trust me at all. He was right\u2014had I seen your wings up close, I would\u2019ve hounded you until you agreed to sit for me.\u201d</p><p>Face alight, Elena drew the shorter woman in the direction of the house, Hannah\u2019s gown of deep bronze brushing against her own. \u201cI was as graceless as a baby bird when I first woke and irritable about it,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI\u2019d have been a dreadful subject.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael didn\u2019t hear Hannah\u2019s answer, the two women having moved a small distance away, but their mingled laughter floated on the air. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we\u2019ve done the right thing in bringing together the only two consorts in the Cadre,\u201d he said to Elijah as they followed in the women\u2019s wake.</p><p>\u201cAh, but could we have stopped it?\u201d</p><p>Exchanging a glance with the other archangel that would\u2019ve been understood by no other in the Cadre, he led the other man through the main doors, the dinner to take place in the sprawling formal living area/dining room off the hallway. Soaring ceiling, hand-polished floor of rare wood, and arching windows that drenched the room in sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day, it was a room meant to impress.</p><p>Elena had taken one look at it, in the days after she moved in, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re eating at the table by the library windows, where I can talk to Your Archangelness without needing a megaphone.\u201d</p><p>Did you bring your megaphone, Guild Hunter? he asked, aware of Montgomery and his staff clearing away, having quietly carried in champagne and canap\u00e9s.</p><p>A narrow-eyed glance over her shoulder. Where exactly would I put it in this dress? I couldn\u2019t even figure out a way to wear panties without ruining the line of the slinky thing.</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s blood heated as Hannah said, \u201cElijah, look,\u201d her voice potent with wonder.</p><p>Grabbing her consort\u2019s hand, the dark-haired woman tugged him to the glorious painting of the Refuge that dominated the far end of the room. It ran across the entire wall and was a study in painful blue and piercing white over rocky gray, but for the wings of the angels flying above the city, each painted in intricate detail.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dahariel.\u201d Hannah brushed her fingers reverently over wings patterned like an eagle\u2019s, and Raphael knew her admiration wasn\u2019t for the named angel but for the artist who\u2019d captured him on canvas. \u201cAnd, oh, it\u2019s Galen with three of Jessamy\u2019s little ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the Hummingbird\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is Aodhan\u2019s,\u201d Hannah said in response to Elijah\u2019s murmur.</p><p>Scowling, Elijah leaned closer to the work. \u201cWhere\u2019s the signature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither one signs their work in the usual fashion.\u201d Hannah scowled back at her consort. \u201cWe must find the clue in the image.\u201d</p><p>You are wearing no panties with another male in the room? Raphael ran his hand down Elena\u2019s spine and over her lower curves, searching for lines and finding nothing but firm feminine flesh. You truly aren\u2019t.</p> <p>Elena\u2019s shoulders shook, deep creases in her cheeks. Oh, my God, you\u2019re scandalized! Eyes tearing up in the effort to fight her laughter, she pressed her hands to his chest and stared down at the floor. Should I tell you I did find a way to wear a knife? In a thigh sheath.</p><p>Of course you did. What do panties matter so long as you have your steel.</p><p>Stop it! Her shoulders shook harder, the diamond-studded pin that anchored the knot at the nape of her neck catching the light as her touch seared him through the crisp white of his formal shirt. I\u2019m trying to be elegant and graceful and consortlike.</p><p>Cupping her nape, he squeezed. Our guests are about to turn.</p><p>Refusing to look at Raphael for fear any eye contact would set her off, Elena walked with the other couple into the living area of the large open-plan space.</p><p>\u201cThis is a lovely room.\u201d Hannah took a seat on an elegant gold settee, as Elena had learned the piece of furniture was called, her wings flowing gracefully around the back support. The other woman\u2019s feathers were a deep, luxuriant cream with blushes of peach on the primaries and appeared so lushly soft that Elena was tempted to commit social suicide, sneak a touch.</p><p>\u201cThe little tables there,\u201d Hannah said as Elena fought the uncivilized and very unconsortlike impulse, \u201cwho was the designer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to fess up and admit ignorance.\u201d Elena showed her empty palms from the opposite settee. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019d get a D in that aspect of consort life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are to get a D in such things, then I\u2019m afraid I must confess I\u2019d get an F in defensive training.\u201d Sparkling eyes, a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cElijah has resorted to teaching me how to stab people in the eye with my paintbrushes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really excellent idea if you always have paintbrushes at hand.\u201d Elena tapped a finger on her lower lip, her mind on the other tools of Hannah\u2019s craft. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Aodhan with a paint scraper\u2014you could sever someone\u2019s jugular with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew your consort was a smart woman, Raphael.\u201d Elijah took a seat beside his own consort and, despite his slight smile, Elena couldn\u2019t help but be alert to the lethal power that pulsed in his very skin. It made her realize what her friends must see when they looked at Raphael, and why other rough-and-tough female hunters had toasted her on her \u201cbrass balls\u201d in going to bed with him.</p><p>Elena put her hand over his on the fine velvet of the settee when he sat down next to her, their wings overlapping. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing this, even given the circumstances. While a political alliance had to be their first, critical goal, Elena also knew she couldn\u2019t rebuff the warm overtures of a woman who not only understood the pressures of being consort, but whose friendship could take her through the millennia to come.</p><p>Because one day, if they survived the coming conflicts, she\u2019d pick up the phone to call Sara, only to remember her best friend was no longer there, her bright light having faded into the final goodnight. Sara called her a silly goose for worrying so much about a time that could be decades into the future, but Elena\u2019s heart broke at the idea of not having Sara\u2019s warmth and love in her life.</p><p>\u201cElena,\u201d Hannah began.</p><p>\u201cEllie,\u201d she said, swallowing the knot of pain in her chest and remembering her promise to Sara that she\u2019d give Hannah a real chance, rather than keeping her at arm\u2019s length out of loyalty to Sara. \u201cAll my friends call me Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie. I am honored to be given the right.\u201d</p><p>The conversation continued to flow effortlessly through the hours that followed. Conscious of Hannah\u2019s preference to stay out of angelic politics, Elena had been willing to stifle her own hunger to sit in on the coming dialogue between Raphael and Elijah and lead the other woman to her solar for quiet discussion. Hannah, however, waved off the invitation when she made it after dinner. \u201cIn such a dark time,\u201d she said, voice soft but eyes resolute, \u201ca consort must stand beside her archangel.\u201d</p><p>The discussion segued into weightier matters almost immediately, and, but for a poignant minute of conscious silence when Raphael received word from Galen to say the fallen were home, the focus was on the consequences of the Cascade.</p><p>\u201cI hear,\u201d Elijah said, as the clock ticked over midnight, \u201cyou\u2019ve gained the ability to negate Lijuan\u2019s power.\u201d</p><p>The air seemed to go motionless, silence filling the room; it was the first time either of the two men had come even close to touching on their own new abilities.</p><p>10</p><p>Trust, Raphael. Elena met eyes the hue of Prussian blue, except no pigment could ever be as intense, as pure. It has to start somewhere.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No indication in Raphael\u2019s tone of the momentous step denoted by that single word. \u201cI can cause her pain and a certain level of harm, though whether I can deliver true death remains a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, too, have gained an intriguing new ability,\u201d Elijah said, sending his consort a look so openly affectionate that Elena found herself seeing the man behind the power for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s one that initially caused Hannah some consternation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOtherwise known as unadulterated terror.\u201d Hannah\u2019s tone was dry. \u201cWhat,\u201d she said to Elena, \u201cwould be your reaction if one sunny morning, you walked, blissfully unknowing into the greenhouse you told me of, and found a family of pumas had settled in overnight?\u201d Hannah nodded at Elena\u2019s wide-eyed look. \u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I found in my studio.\u201d</p><p>Raphael looked to Elijah. \u201cYou can speak to animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about speak, but I can certainly make cats large and small attend my commands. My first command, of course, was that they vacate my consort\u2019s studio and stop snarling at her.\u201d Hannah\u2019s gentle laughter filled the air before he added, \u201cI can also command birds of prey. They are now sentinels in my territory.\u201d</p><p>Big cats and birds of prey? Elena knew South America had plenty of those, thanks to the expansive sanctuaries sponsored by Elijah, a point that once again proved the archangels\u2019 new abilities had their roots in who each member of the Cadre was as an individual. That\u2019s an army on its own.</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>\u201cNeither one of us, it is clear,\u201d Raphael said aloud, \u201cis defenseless against an attack. But\u201d\u2014his eyes locked with Elijah\u2019s golden brown gaze\u2014\u201cwe\u2019d be stronger together.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s response was solemn. \u201cYour friendship is one I welcome. I have no desire to live in a world overrun by Lijuan\u2019s monstrosities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Hannah whispered, her hand sliding into Elijah\u2019s, \u201cin one where angels fall from the sky.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>The other couple didn\u2019t leave till dawn, the information shared as the city slumbered and Montgomery slipped unobtrusively in and out with wine, then coffee, and finally orange juice, going far beyond what either couple had expected, the birth of a trust that had Elijah telling them what he\u2019d discovered about Titus.</p><p>\u201cIt appears he has gained power over the earth\u2014my man says Titus can now cause earth tremors. If his ability continues to develop in the same vein, he may one day soon be able to collapse the ground under the feet of an invading army.\u201d</p><p>In turn, Raphael shared Jason\u2019s information about Astaad\u2019s domination over the sea, and possibly other bodies of water. \u201cThere are also rumors Favashi can control the winds,\u201d he added, \u201cthough I have no confirmation. Michaela and Charisemnon remain a mystery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, too, have been unable to discover what they may have gained,\u201d Elijah said, skin taut over the bones of his face and jaw tight. \u201cBut knowing what I do of Charisemnon\u2019s appetites and Michaela\u2019s cruelty, it can be nothing good.\u201d</p><p>Raphael could do nothing but agree, his distaste for Charisemnon deeply hewn. The other archangel took girls barely budded to his bed, having somehow convinced his people that such was an honor to the children chosen. As for Michaela, he was deadly certain she\u2019d egged Uram on when it came to making the fateful decision that had turned the other man into a blood-soaked monster, her effect that of the spider that eats its mate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll share anything further I learn of the others if you\u2019ll do the same,\u201d Elijah said when they walked out onto the lawn, offering his arm to seal the pact.</p> <p>Raphael accepted the offer, his hand closing over the top of Elijah\u2019s forearm and the other man\u2019s over his, theirs the clasp of warriors. \u201cIt is done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis might\u2019ve been my first official gig as your consort at our home\u201d\u2014Elena hid a yawn behind an open palm as they watched Elijah and Hannah fly high into the sky\u2014\u201cbut I call that an unqualified success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah\u2019s cooperation causes me concern.\u201d Sliding an arm around her waist, he drew her to his chest. \u201cNo archangel shares so readily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReadily?\u201d Mouth falling open, Elena cupped his face in her hands. \u201cIt took you two six hours to get to the point. It was like watching a couple of tigers circling each other, deciding whether to be friends or to bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst a courtship, now tigers?\u201d He ran his hand down her spine, and when she yawned once again, drew her toward the house, her wing brushing the underside of his arm. \u201cYou must rest. Hannah may be able to take a night without sleep, but you are a babe in immortal terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be this tired,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI pulled all-nighters at Guild Academy, for crying out loud, then aced my exams the next day.\u201d</p><p>Spreading his hand on the silken curve of her hip, he leaned down to kiss her scowling mouth. \u201cYou are becoming immortal, Elena. Not a single cell in your body ever truly rests.\u201d</p><p>A pause, her feet halting on the grass. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it ever bother you?\u201d</p> <p>Surprised at the piercing vulnerability of the question, he tilted up her chin so he could see her eyes. \u201cThat my consort needs sleep?\u201d</p><p>Elena realized he hadn\u2019t understood her question. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cand the fact that she will for a long time yet.\u201d As a human, she\u2019d been stronger than most; it made her weakness as an immortal even more difficult to accept. \u201cRight now, Hannah, with her lack of offensive skills, could beat me in a fight, simply by holding on until I was too tired and weak to go on.\u201d</p><p>Raphael raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo, she could not, because should it come to a fight to the death, you would slice off her head in the first ten seconds, cut out her heart in the next twenty, then burn her body to make sure she\u2019d never again rise.\u201d</p><p>Blinking at the cold-blooded response, she stared. \u201cYou really think I\u2019m capable of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Hannah should prove a threat to me or the others you love, yes.\u201d A faint smile, his kiss a flagrantly sexual branding, his fingers thrusting into her hair to send pins scattering to the grass, his body all hard ridges and heat against her own. \u201cYour love is a fierce thing, Elena, a thing with claws and teeth when it comes to protecting those you claim.\u201d</p><p>He was right; she\u2019d take on that batshit crazy Lijuan herself if it meant saving the lives of the people she loved. \u201cDoes that bother you? That I\u2019m so bloodthirsty?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he reached down and swung her into his arms with an easy strength that made her feel like a gently reared Southern belle out of a period drama. \u201cI\u2019ll answer that upstairs. After I see your knife sheath.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, he sounded like he was purring. \u201cSleep is overrated,\u201d she whispered, wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing the delicious slope of it. \u201cI\u2019d much rather get naked with my man.\u201d</p><p>The instant they were behind the closed doors of their bedroom, he threw her on the bed and divested her of her dress and shoes, leaving her wearing only the slim knife strapped to her thigh. When she reached down to get rid of it, he shook his head and, holding her gaze, stripped off his own formal clothes to reveal a body that made her whimper before he got on top of her.</p><p>A kiss to her hip, his tongue flicking out to taste her skin; his fingers tracing the strap of the sheath; his wings spreading; the exotic, erotic taste of angel dust on her lips; her breath locked in her throat.</p><p>Then his mouth was a heated dampness on her navel.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d His name came out a caress as she tangled her hands in the midnight silk of his hair to hold him to her, her love for him a huge thing inside her.</p><p>He kissed her hip again, licking out at the bone in a light flick that made her tremble. A very male, very Raphael smile against her skin. When he shifted up over her, she was ready for his kiss . . . but she was never truly ready for Raphael\u2019s kiss. He made her burn, the pleasure a hot, liquid burst that shimmered over her skin in rolling waves. \u201cI could kiss you forever,\u201d she murmured against his lips, sucking at the lower one, playing with the upper, his body weight a luscious pressure. \u201cI love feeling you against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say such things, Elena. You will make me your slave.\u201d Wings spreading wider above her, he cupped the side of her face and leaned into the kiss, deepening it until their tongues tangled in sweet, hot battle, Elena\u2019s breath lost. Gasping in just enough air to continue, she stroked her hands against the taut muscle of him, and returned to the kiss.</p><p>More? It was an intimate question between lovers.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>One arm braced above her head, he gave her what she wanted, continuing to kiss her while caressing the highly sensitive upper arch of her wing with his free hand. She shivered, sliding her own hands to his nape, then down, her fingers brushing his wings. He loved it when she kissed her way down the inner arches where his wings grew out of his back, and she loved that she knew that about him, about her lover.</p><p>\u201cStop that, hbeebti,\u201d he said, their lips parting on a wet kiss of sound.</p><p>She smiled, her nipples flush against the hard wall of his chest. \u201cYou like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much. And today, I wish to pleasure my consort.\u201d Pressing his thumb down on her jaw to part her lips, he kissed her again, angel dust glittering in the air.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She rubbed against him. \u201cDid you make a change to your special blend?\u201d Angel dust, he\u2019d told her, was normally rich and exquisite, but not sexual. Elena had only ever tasted Raphael\u2019s blend, and it was always oh-so-sexual\u2014today, it also held a dangerous bite.</p><p>Kisses down her throat. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish my consort to suffer ennui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d It took some time for her brain cells to unscramble after he took one of her nipples into his mouth, rolling it over on his tongue like it was a plump berry, then turning his attention to the other. Chest heaving when he lifted his head to lave a kiss just below her breasts, she managed to say, \u201cEnnui, yes, that\u2019s exactly what I feel right now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glinted. \u201cSo, my consort challenges me. Very well.\u201d</p><p>Shivering, because his voice . . . it was fur over her senses, across her tight, damp nipples, along her lips, she watched him dip his head, place a wet kiss on her navel. He blew a breath over the wet, kept going past her renewed shiver. \u201cNow,\u201d he purred, \u201cit is my turn to be intoxicated.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her spine curved off the bed at the first touch of his mouth on her most private flesh. As she knew her lover, he knew her. Every tiny, nerve-laden curve. Now, lifting her thighs up over the wide breadth of his shoulders, he cupped her buttocks in his hands and kissed her with an intimacy that stole her senses, making her feel delicious, decadent, beautiful.</p><p>Hands buried in his hair, she held on to him as her body shuddered again and again, the orgasm a slow, exquisite ride. He licked her to the end, stroking his hands over her thighs to shift her legs to either side of his body, his fingers lingering on the strap that held the knife to her thigh. \u201cMy warrior.\u201d Another kiss to her navel before he rose up over her again, his arousal nudging at her pleasure-swollen dampness.</p><p>She gripped at his upper arms, muscle and tendon flexing under her touch as he clamped one hand over her hip, the other braced on her wing\u2014an added pleasure\u2014and thrust his cock inside her. Moaning at the erotic storm of sensation and needing him even closer, she drew him down to her mouth. He came, his hand sliding up her body to mold her breast as he stroked in and out of her in a deep, lazy rhythm that said he had nowhere else to be, his attention only and absolutely on her.</p> <p>Her body sparked to new life under the relentless focus of her archangel to clasp him in sensual pulses. Breaking the kiss so she could watch him find his own pleasure, she caressed her fingers down the line of his throat, over his shoulders, and to the rising arch of his left wing. He shuddered and thrust home when her fingers closed over that arch. \u201cElena.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s pleasure, his kiss, sent her over a second time . . . and it wasn\u2019t until they both stirred again that Raphael reached down and undid the strap of her knife sheath, putting it and the knife on the bedside table. \u201cBeautiful as this sheath is,\u201d he said, touching the leather, \u201cI much prefer the one which holds my blade.\u201d</p><p>Elena thumped a fisted hand on his shoulder, laughter bubbling in her veins and her body boneless. \u201cI\u2019m happy to know I beat leather that finely worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Lips curving in a smile that made her body tighten on the \u201cblade\u201d still inside her body, he bent his head to her lips.</p><p>And a certain blade and sheath once more proved their perfect fit.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Leaving Elena happily exhausted and asleep in their bed, Raphael flew not to the Tower but toward the house that belonged to Jeffrey Deveraux and his family. A single expertly timed burst of angelfire and he could eliminate the mortal male from the face of the planet, while leaving his wife and children unharmed.</p><p>Or he could simply fly down and thrust his hand through Jeffrey\u2019s rib cage to tear out his shriveled, useless heart. It would be intensely more satisfying than spilling the other man\u2019s blood from a distance.</p><p>Except taking either action would break Elena\u2019s faith in him, while doing nothing to seal the gash Jeffrey had torn in her psyche. It\u2019d continue to rip open at unexpected moments, as it had this morning. It had taken every ounce of his considerable control not to respond in anger when he\u2019d realized the import of Elena\u2019s question\u2014and that it was the same thing she\u2019d asked him in more subtle ways in the past months.</p><p>Anger would\u2019ve bruised and confused her, for his consort didn\u2019t recognize the fear that drove her to ask such questions, a fear that could be encapsulated in seven simple words that formed a vicious sentence: Will this flaw make you reject me?</p><p>What Jeffrey had done, it had scarred Elena on a level beyond the conscious. She knew she held Raphael\u2019s heart, she knew, and yet a wary, wounded part of her worried he\u2019d change his mind one day, find her no longer worthy of loving.</p> <p>Raphael. It was a murmur half drugged with sleep. Why are you growling in my head?</p><p>Teeth gritted, he made the deliberate decision to turn away from the Deveraux house and toward the Tower, not confident he could hold to his resolve not to murder Jeffrey if he saw Elena\u2019s father. My apologies, hbeebti. I didn\u2019t realize you could sense it.</p><p>\u2019S okay.</p><p>Sleep, he said, and because he couldn\u2019t bear to think of her in pain: As you dream, know that you are loved.</p><p>\u2019Course I am. I\u2019m yours.</p><p>The sleepy mumble was enough to soothe his rage, telling him that despite the fears that haunted her, Elena understood the truth of who she was to him so deep within her, she remembered it even heavy with sleep. No more growling in your head, he promised, but she was already gone, lost in slumber.</p><p>Sire, said another voice an instant later.</p><p>Yes, Aodhan?</p> <p>Augustus will reach the meeting point in an hour.</p><p>Thank you. He\u2019d already met with Nazarach and Andreas, two of his angelic commanders\u2014each in charge of running a particular section of his territory. Augustus would be the third. Step by quiet step, he was making certain every one of his commanders knew to prepare their regions for a long absence in the near future. He\u2019d need them in New York when war screamed into being, a war that had been inevitable from the instant Lijuan created the first reborn.</p><p>Should her perversions of life be permitted to run free, they\u2019d infect the world, turning it into a charnel house before it became a monument to death given flesh.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Seven hours later, after five hours of deep sleep, followed by an hour\u2019s teaching at the Academy and some high-visibility flying around office buildings, Elena landed at the Tower to find Raphael wasn\u2019t yet back from a meeting with one of his commanders. Aodhan, however, was in the office from where Dmitri had run Tower operations before he left the city with his wife.</p><p>Seeing her, the angel held out a paintbrush, its handle wrapped in a piece of paper.</p><p>She accepted it, mystified. \u201cThank you, but why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sire asked me to make sure you received it.\u201d</p><p>Tearing off the paper, Elena found seven simple words written on the slim wooden handle: Each consort has her own unique weapons.</p><p>God, she thought, her entire face a smile, her Archangel had serious moves.</p><p>Happy, plain old heart-deep happy, she stored the slender brush carefully in a zippered side pocket of her tight cargos, where it would be in no danger of falling out. Seeing Aodhan\u2019s quizzical look, she realized she hadn\u2019t had a real conversation with him since his transfer to the Tower, this angel who was beautiful in the most inhuman of ways. Fractures of light, that was Aodhan.</p><p>His eyes splintered outward from an obsidian pupil in shards of crystalline blue-green, his skin alabaster stroked with gold, his hair so pale as to be colorless . . . and yet so bright it was as if each strand had been coated in crushed diamonds. The illusion of light was echoed by his wings, until in sunlight, he dazzled the eye beyond the human ability to bear, his beauty a painful blade. Though Illium had wings of blue, and Venom the eyes of a viper, it was Aodhan who was the most \u201cother\u201d of Raphael\u2019s Seven.</p><p>He was also the most remote, his unseen scars leaving him averse to any physical contact. Elena couldn\u2019t imagine a life devoid of touch, yet Aodhan had lived an eon divorced from that simple, necessary sense of connection. It had to have been something beyond vicious to have scarred him in such a violent way, but that was Aodhan\u2019s story to tell and he hadn\u2019t chosen to tell it to her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you liking New York?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Walking out onto the balcony with her, he stepped to the very edge to look down at the city below. \u201cI\u2019m not yet certain.\u201d Wings glittering in the sunlight, he appeared to be watching the streams of yellow cabs below. \u201cI\u2019ve never before experienced a place such as this. The Sire\u2019s domain was not thus the last time I was stationed here.\u201d</p><p>Elena hadn\u2019t realized Aodhan had ever before been stationed at the Tower, but of course it made sense, given that he was close to five hundred years old. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly one-of- a-kind.\u201d She loved the energetic chaos of the city, but knew it wasn\u2019t for everyone; though since Aodhan had requested the transfer after centuries at Raphael\u2019s Refuge stronghold, something in New York had resonated with him.</p><p>\u201cMost people still don\u2019t know you\u2019re here.\u201d It had surprised her when Aodhan\u2019s arrival hadn\u2019t made the splash she\u2019d expected. Then she\u2019d discovered he never flew at a height where he could be discerned by mortal eyes. Those who glimpsed the light sparking off him during the rare instances when he dropped below the cloud layer assumed it to be a trick of the light, or a stunning spark off the metal body of a passing aircraft.</p><p>\u201cIllium enjoys dancing with the world. I prefer to watch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to explore the city, fly above the streets?\u201d She could understand why he wouldn\u2019t want to land where he might accidentally be touched, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t see New York up close and personal.</p><p>Aodhan gave her a searching look, those eyes of shattered glass refracting her face into a million fragments. \u201cYou are right, Consort. I should be seen in the city, especially at this time\u2014there are those who have forgotten my power because I don\u2019t choose to display it.\u201d</p><p>Elena had no doubt Aodhan was as lethal as the rest of the Seven. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about the politics of it. I\u2019m more worried about you.\u201d From what she knew, of the immortals in New York, he was close to Illium alone . . . but there, too, he maintained a painful distance.</p><p>\u201cEven when we were young, Aodhan was serious where I was full of mischief, but he had laughter in his soul and enough wickedness to be my true friend in all things. I miss him.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she said now, the piercing sadness of Illium\u2019s words echoing in her mind, \u201ccan go through life alone.\u201d Not even a woman who, as a girl, had seen her mother\u2019s high-heeled shoe on the hallway tile, and vowed never again to give anyone that much power over her heart. Sara alone had managed to break through, and that after years of trust.</p><p>Then had come an archangel as dangerous and as fascinating as the wild winds above a storm-darkened sea. \u201cIt isn\u2019t only hurt you avoid by avoiding bonds\u201d\u2014she tried to make him see the truth it had taken her almost two decades to understand, this angel so haunting in his aloneness\u2014\u201cyou also miss out on the painful joy that comes with throwing your heart wide open and going hell-for-leather.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A pause, then words that were stones thrown into the tranquil mirror of an unbroken lake. \u201cAre you not afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified,\u201d she admitted, thinking of the violent stab of vulnerability that had hit her just that morning. \u201cBut you know what? Fuck fear. I won\u2019t allow it to steal my life from me\u2014and you shouldn\u2019t, either.\u201d No, she didn\u2019t understand the hell that had shaped Aodhan, but she\u2019d been through her own hell, had firsthand knowledge of the cage such horror could create. \u201cFly hard and fast, Aodhan. You never know what you\u2019ll see. And what\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d</p><p>Aodhan\u2019s response was quiet and bloody. \u201cI could crash to the earth, my wings broken and my body a fleshy pulp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut imagine what you\u2019d experience in the interim . . . and ask yourself if safe aloneness is all you ever wish to know.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the solemn angel to his thoughts when he didn\u2019t respond, she squared her shoulders and made her way back inside the Tower, and to the first of the strictly guarded floors that held the wounded angels. The majority remained in the healing comas Keir had induced, their bodies shattered into pieces, but the faces of those who were conscious lit up the instant she came into view.</p><p>Calling her \u201cConsort,\u201d they asked her for news of what was happening in the city and with their squadrons and apologized for being unable to rise from their beds. It was the first time she\u2019d had real personal contact with many of the fighters who defended the Tower, and it humbled her that they saw her visit as an honor, for she was \u201cconsort to their liege.\u201d</p><p>Thankful for Keir\u2019s quiet whisper that so concisely explained a response she\u2019d been struggling to understand, Elena settled in. As she spoke to the injured in the hours that followed, she began to comprehend another aspect of her responsibilities when it came to her position by Raphael\u2019s side. She was no doubt the weakest angel in the room in terms of power, but that wasn\u2019t who the men and women around her saw, wasn\u2019t what they needed from her.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d Keir murmured when she walked out to the corridor after seeing the brutal injuries done a dark-eyed angel who\u2019d proudly shown her the sword he\u2019d been given by Galen himself\u2014a sign of the weapons-master\u2019s respect for his skills. The angel\u2019s left wing was nothing but tendon clinging to bone, his face pulped on one side, his arm severed at the shoulder.</p> <p>Hands on her knees, she sucked in gulps of air and, when she could speak again, said, \u201cWill he heal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, though it\u2019ll mean months of hurt for him.\u201d A gentle hand on her hair, a healer\u2019s touch. \u201cIn the hours past, have you come to understand why they respond to you as they do?\u201d</p><p>A lump of emotion in her throat, Elena rose to her full height, topping Keir by several inches. \u201cI\u2019m their conduit to Raphael.\u201d She hadn\u2019t understood until this instant that the general fighting troops had the same awe of Raphael as many mortals. Even among angelkind, an archangel was a being to be feared and respected.</p><p>Dmitri, Aodhan, Galen, Illium, all of the Seven, they were only a rung below the Cadre as far as the troops were concerned. The fighters would go to any one of them without hesitation when it came to issues to do with the Tower\u2019s defenses, but would never think to bother them with anything else. \u201cI\u2019m meant to be the one who looks below the formal, structured surface and to the individuals beneath.\u201d The one who kept her finger on the living heartbeat of the Tower, made certain people were happy.</p><p>\u201cYou feel foolish that it has taken you until now to apprehend this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone couldn\u2019t have clued me in?\u201d Not that she would\u2019ve known what to do\u2014she didn\u2019t now\u2014but at least she would\u2019ve tried. \u201cIt\u2019s been months!\u201d</p> <p>Keir\u2019s frown was a silent rebuke. \u201cNo one expected you to take up these responsibilities for years, if not decades, yet. You are a young consort; it is understood that you have much to learn . . . but the trauma of the past days has altered that timeline.\u201d Shadows heavy on the fine bones of his face, his tone holding a haunting sadness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201d It was a confession torn out of her soul. \u201cNot long ago, I told Aodhan to take risks, but God, Keir, I think I\u2019m at my limit. I\u2019m not sure my heart is big enough to encompass thousands.\u201d Some of whom would inevitably die in battle. The pain of the loss wouldn\u2019t be a distant, manageable one if she knew their names, their dreams, their hopes. Each death would be a kick directly to her battered heart. \u201cI\u2019ve lost too many people already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourage, Elena.\u201d Brushing his fingertips over her cheek, he led her back to the infirmary. \u201cOf that I know you have an imprudent amount.\u201d</p><p>It took all of her courage to visit the one person in the infirmary she\u2019d avoided till the last possible moment. \u201cIzzy.\u201d The young blond angel, his curls having been shaved off to reveal his fractured skull, had a sweet crush on her. Even so badly hurt that she couldn\u2019t believe he was awake and aware, his brutalized face glowed when she took a seat by his bedside.</p><p>It was impossible to do anything but smile back, he was so adorable in his devotion.</p><p>\u201cI thought you forgot me.\u201d Shy words, his cheeks going pink as she flirted with him in an effort to take his mind off the excruciating pain of his injuries.</p><p>\u201cOur bodies are capable of healing the most horrific wounds,\u201d Keir had said, \u201cbut the cost is pain. No drug to numb pain will work on angelic bodies, though we\u2019ve tried to find such for centuries upon centuries. I, too, can only soften the hurt, not eliminate it, and while the babes and the ones over three or four hundred can be placed under for a long duration, the younger adults wake constantly and thus are too often conscious.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she was careful not to accidentally cause Izak any further hurt when she pressed a kiss to the single unbroken patch of his face. \u201cRest, heal. I\u2019ll come by again soon.\u201d Maybe she was scared at what was being asked of her, but if Izak could smile through his agony, she\u2019d damn well find the guts to be what he needed her to be.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you create your guard,\u201d he said abruptly as she turned to leave, \u201cwill you at least consider me?\u201d Eyes huge with entreaty. \u201cI know I\u2019m young and I don\u2019t mind having the least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She tilted her head to the side. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t have bodyguards.\u201d It had taken more than one drag-down fight with Raphael to carve that rule into stone, and Elena had no intention of altering that fact.</p><p>\u201cNo, not guards. A Guard.\u201d</p><p>This time, Elena heard the capital G.</p><p>\u201cLike Raphael\u2019s Seven,\u201d Izak continued, aching hope in his expression. \u201cYou\u2019re a consort. Elijah\u2019s consort has a Guard.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t know what she would do with a Guard, but saying no to this fragile, broken, hopeful boy was out of the question. \u201cConsider yourself the first member.\u201d</p><p>His smile lit up the whole room.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It was well after nightfall when she left the infirmary and went up several floors to find Raphael ensconced in a strategy session with his Seven, those not physically in the city having called in on visual feeds. She could\u2019ve gone in, taken a seat, and listened, but she needed to clear her head after the intense emotional strain of the past day.</p><p>Digging out her cell phone, she messaged her best friend. The munchkin asleep?</p><p>Snoring like a champ. Want to come over for coffee?</p><p>I won\u2019t interrupt you and your love bunny?</p><p>My love bunny has abandoned me for his workshop. He\u2019s making some super-special nifty weapon for another woman. Good thing I love you or I\u2019d have to kill you.</p><p>A smile breaking through the sadness and anger inside her, she sent a message to Raphael\u2019s phone instead of interrupting his thoughts, then flew to Sara\u2019s. The last time she\u2019d been by, the roof had been a construction site, but today, her best friend waved at her from the now flat surface, two steaming mugs and a baby monitor sitting on the battered wooden coffee table in front of an equally battered sofa.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d Elena said, taking in the currently empty planters set in the corners, the wall around the roof high enough that Zoe could play here without any risk she\u2019d fall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to help me pick out some plants in the summer.\u201d Sara held up a mug of coffee and, when Elena took it with a sigh, patted the sofa next to her. \u201cNo proper furniture yet, so your wings will be a bit squished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually so soft, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d Sinking in, Elena propped up her boots on the coffee table, taking care not to jiggle the monitor. \u201cHow\u2019s Darrell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMessed up.\u201d Sara brought up her legs to sit cross-legged, her hands cupped around her mug, her skin a rich, smooth brown against the white ceramic. \u201cBut I think he\u2019ll be okay. You and Ransom got to him in time.\u201d</p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for several minutes, their eyes on the stars above, the sky holding the sharp clarity of the coldest of nights, their breath frosting the air. When they did talk, they meandered from topic to topic, their friendship old enough that they could skip from their worry about the predicted archangelic hostilities to a discussion on Sara\u2019s side-swept bangs to bursting out laughing when they both muttered, \u201cMen,\u201d at the same time.</p><p>Then Sara, having curled up against the arm of the sofa, poked at Elena\u2019s thigh with a sock-clad foot. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>Startled by the burst of inexplicable anger, Elena stared. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about what\u2019ll happen when I\u2019m gone.\u201d It was an arrow to the heart. \u201cYou ever think about the fact that maybe I\u2019ll have to watch you die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m becoming immor\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her friend snorted. \u201cSince when has the immortal world been a happy-happy-let\u2019s-hold-hands-and-sing-\u2018Kumbaya\u2019 kind of a place, huh? Weren\u2019t we just discussing a war, genius?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mouth dropping open, Elena blinked and realized Sara was right. Her life was no less dangerous now than it had been during her time as a hunter. In fact, it could be argued she swam in far deadlier waters as Raphael\u2019s consort. \u201cWell, damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So don\u2019t let me see that look in your eyes again.\u201d Sara clicked her mug to Elena\u2019s. \u201cYou know what I\u2019ve learned from my baby girl? To enjoy the now. It\u2019ll be gone soon enough, and no one knows what the next hour, much less tomorrow, will bring.\u201d</p><p>Elena decided she should engrave those words on her brain, saying as much to Raphael two hours later as they lay skin to skin in their Enclave bedroom. He\u2019d come to her with a grim look in his eyes and battle plans on his mind, his touch so tender, tears had wet her cheeks. \u201cThat was a pretty wonderful now,\u201d she whispered afterward.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d A deep masculine murmur.</p><p>Her head on his chest, she soaked in his warmth, knowing they were lucky to have these hours together, possible only because of his trust in his Seven. Word had come from Jason that the other members of the Cadre were currently confirmed as being in their territories, which gave New York some breathing room.</p><p>\u201cI visited the injured,\u201d she said, knowing the respite was a temporary one\u2014like Raphael, she didn\u2019t believe in coincidences, especially a coincidence that brought death to angels and vampires alike. \u201cI managed to speak to everyone who was conscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hand fisted in her hair. \u201cYou acted as a consort should, despite the cost. I\u2019m proud of you, hbeebti.\u201d</p><p>Chest tight at the simple acknowledgment, she ran her foot over his shin. \u201cI also seem to have acquired the start of a Guard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? Who have you chosen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIzzy,\u201d she said, and told him how it had happened.</p><p>Raphael laughed. \u201cI will, of course, have to throw the boy into training with the toughest men in my employ as soon as he has recovered. He may regret volunteering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually expect him to do for me what the Seven do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you dent his pride?\u201d</p><p>Elena sighed, having the sinking feeling she\u2019d inadvertently ended up with a real Guard. \u201cHow was I supposed to say no to someone that adorable?\u201d She lifted her head to scowl at her lover. \u201cIt\u2019d have been like kicking a puppy then stomping on his heart.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael folded one arm behind his head, his biceps flexing. \u201cHe\u2019s not as much a babe as you believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Leaning in, she grazed her teeth over the firm muscle.</p><p>His fingers curved over her bare breast in return, neither one of them in any hurry. \u201cIzak\u2019s been in training with Galen since he was younger than Sam.\u201d</p><p>Galen with babies? \u201cImpossible,\u201d she said, even as she recalled Hannah pointing out the opposite in the painting downstairs. \u201cGalen eating babies I can understand, but training them?\u201d</p><p>Open amusement. \u201cI think you miss our weapons-master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d</p><p>That got her a long, lazy kiss, their tongues licking against each other, his thigh pushing possessively between her own. \u201cWhen Galen was first courting Jessamy,\u201d Raphael said with a brush of his thumb over her nipple when their lips parted, \u201che began to teach flight skills to the little ones. Over time, it has become a tradition\u2014Galen is always the one who gives basic flight instruction to the babes, and some, like Izak, never stop training with him.\u201d</p><p>The idea of Galen, with his wings akin to a northern harrier\u2019s, leading a squadron of babies\u2014not all of whom could fly exactly straight\u2014had Elena shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I need to see to believe this. It\u2019s like you just told me the sky turns purple every Wednesday.\u201d</p> <p>Sensual laughter twining around her, Raphael\u2019s mood no longer black. \u201cFor his age, Izak is exceptional. In comparison to older fighters, he has much to learn, part of the reason Galen organized a Tower placement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he could study under more experienced men.\u201d It was similar to what the Guild did, pairing up a neophyte hunter with an experienced one for the first year after graduation.</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cIzak may be comparatively weak at present, but he\u2019ll grow with you and so will the bond between you.\u201d His eyes closed when she reached out to stroke the most sensitive part of his right wing, her damp flesh rubbing against the hard muscle of his thigh. \u201cAodhan was a stripling, Illium even younger, when I accepted them into what became my Seven.\u201d</p><p>She was leaning in to kiss him again when his eyes snapped open, languid relaxation erased by cold-eyed focus in a single heartbeat. \u201cKeir is on his way to see us.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the decomposing vampire found in that house now burned to the ground, the wounded angels in the infirmary, the five carried to the Refuge on flower-covered biers, and knew the news could be nothing good.</p><p>12</p><p>Looking out toward the glittering mirage of Manhattan from their balcony a couple of minutes later, she saw the dark shadow of wings over the Hudson. \u201cIs Illium providing escort?\u201d Even with the wild blue and shimmering silver lost to the night, the angel had a distinctive style of flight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve ordered that no one fly alone at night\u2014or should they be heading into an isolated area.\u201d A hard glance. \u201cThat applies to my consort, too. You left the Tower tonight before I could speak to you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo arguments here.\u201d Tugging at the belt of her robe, she said, \u201cI should put on proper clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll do.\u201d Raphael, dressed in jeans and a white T-shirt, ran his knuckles down the side of her face. \u201cKeir is one of the few men whom I will allow to see my consort naked of her armor.\u201d</p><p>Because, Elena thought, the healer had seen every part of her broken body\u2014and he\u2019d helped bring her back.</p><p>\u201cAs for your Bluebell, his heart is already yours.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers clenched on the belt. \u201cRaphael, he\u2019s not truly . . . not that way, is he?\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear to hurt Illium.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Raphael said, as the night wind brought with it the whispering promise of snow, \u201cIllium needs to heal and you are safe.\u201d</p><p>Elena rubbed her face. \u201cI hope that\u2019s all it is.\u201d Regardless, she did change into jeans and a simple green-and-white-checked shirt, Raphael doing up the buttons on the wing slits for her before they walked down to open the library doors and step out onto the lawn.</p><p>The two angels made a quiet landing a minute later.</p><p>Keir\u2019s face was solemn, his face showing a strain Elena had never before seen on him, certainly not when she\u2019d left the infirmary earlier that night. Gut twisting, she took his arm and led him inside to find the fire lit and the table by the windows set with coffee and tea, as well as a tray of fruit, nuts, and a rich, creamy cheese. Crackers lay neatly on a different platter, alongside a thin flatbread flavored with herbs.</p><p>Thank God for Montgomery.</p><p>Nudging Keir into an armchair in front of the crackling flames, she poured the healer the tea she knew he liked, as Illium fixed him a plate. \u201cYou have to eat,\u201d she said, when he would\u2019ve waved off the food.</p><p>Expression drained, eyes devoid of their natural warmth, he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Elena wasn\u2019t ready to admit defeat. Taking the plate from Illium after setting the tea on the little side table beside the healer, she nodded at the blue-winged angel to go speak to Raphael, while she took a seat in the armchair opposite Keir. Putting a piece of cheese on a cracker, she held it out. \u201cPlease, Keir.\u201d</p><p>Gaze flicking to her, he took the morsel. \u201cSo, the patient looks after the healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe patient knows that if she gets herself damaged again, she\u2019s going to need you, so it\u2019s self-serving.\u201d</p><p>A glimmer of light in his expression. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis healer once told me I had the unbreakable will of a mule.\u201d It had been a compliment, Keir\u2019s delight at her progress unhidden.</p><p>His beautiful lips curved slightly at last and he ate the cracker, took the next one. She managed to get that and some flatbread into him, as well as a peach she sliced into pieces. \u201cYou did this for me once, remember? When I was bored and grumpy after you told me I had to stay in bed.\u201d It had been in the aftermath of Lijuan\u2019s ball. \u201cStupid balls. They should be banned.\u201d</p><p>Soft laughter, the peach eaten quarter by quarter while Illium and Raphael stood at Raphael\u2019s desk, talking quietly about the ongoing holes in their defensive line. The firelight glinted off the white-gold of Raphael\u2019s feathers, and since he was right next to Illium, the filaments of silver in Bluebell\u2019s wings also catching the light, the difference in effect was crystalline.</p><p>\u201cWhite fire.\u201d Keir\u2019s intrigued expression told her he was back. \u201cExtraordinary.\u201d</p><p>It was, Elena thought in wonder, a resonance to the shifting fire that gave Raphael\u2019s wings a sense of movement though he stood in place.</p><p>Settling back in his chair, Keir said, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen such an effect in the others who are Cadre.\u201d</p><p>Elena forced herself to look away from Raphael, her antennae on alert. \u201cDo you know anything of what\u2019s happening with Michaela\u2019s abilities?\u201d</p><p>Keir shook his head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t trust me, though she knows I would never break my vows as healer. It is also true that I have always favored Raphael.\u201d Putting down his tea, he looked at her with his old, wise eyes. \u201cAs I favor the consort who has brought him back from the cruel edge of immortality.\u201d</p><p>Elena set aside the plate on which she\u2019d cut the peach, and leaned forward after a quick glance to ensure Raphael remained absorbed in his conversation with Illium. \u201cLijuan warned Raphael I\u2019d make him a little bit mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have.\u201d Quiet equanimity. \u201cAnd you worry you\u2019ve weakened him. You have.\u201d</p><p>Elena flinched.</p><p>\u201cElena.\u201d Shaking his head, Keir waited until she met his gaze again. \u201cEven an archangel needs a weakness\u2014absolute power is a corruption. Of that, Lijuan is the perfect example.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A rustle of wings, Illium and Raphael walking across to join them before she could point out that while the latter might be true, Raphael needed to be at full strength to beat Lijuan and her ilk.</p><p>Raphael wasted no time or words. \u201cWhat did you discover, Keir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe disease that killed the vampire, it is akin to the pox.\u201d</p> <p>Elena sucked in a breath as Illium came to lean against her armchair, his eyes liquid gold in the firelight and his wing warm against her own. \u201cThe disease that has so often killed tens of thousands of mortals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Keir held up a hand when they would\u2019ve spoken again. \u201cIt isn\u2019t identical\u2014it has a more virulent effect on the internal organs, turning them to liquid, yet doesn\u2019t appear to be as infectious.

A few droplets, perhaps even a small feed, though I cannot be certain on that last point.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t fly to us when you are so clearly exhausted if you had good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known me too long.\u201d The healer took a deep breath. \u201cMy tests show the disease has an incubation period of six hours. After that, it appears to progress at vicious speed\u2014the victim would\u2019ve been too debilitated to go for help by the time he understood he was ill. Terrible as that was for him, it\u2019s good in the wider scheme of things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there\u2019s a very high chance he wouldn\u2019t have had an opportunity to infect others.\u201d</p> <p>Keir nodded at Illium\u2019s words. \u201cThe bad news is the pox shows every indication of being designed to attack vampires.\u201d Turning to Raphael, he said, \u201cYour instincts led you true\u2014I detect an intelligence behind the disease. It is no natural thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst my angels fall from the sky, and now this.\u201d Raphael\u2019s expression was brutal. \u201cThere is no longer any question the city is under attack.\u201d</p><p>Illium said something in a language Elena didn\u2019t understand, but his last word was cuttingly identifiable and the same one on the tip of Elena\u2019s tongue. \u201cCowards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Raphael said, his voice ice. \u201cWe\u2019ve focused on Lijuan because she\u2019s a known enemy, but we must not wear blinders.\u201d</p><p>They all nodded.</p><p>\u201cSuch cowardice eliminates Titus,\u201d Raphael continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a warrior in the oldest sense and unless there are indications he\u2019s been touched by madness\u201d\u2014a glance at Keir, the healer shaking his head\u2014\u201cthen he wouldn\u2019t stoop to stratagems that skate so close to the line of what is permitted in a war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAstaad,\u201d Keir said softly, \u201cdespite his occasionally secretive ways, believes absolutely in honor, and I think such actions would stain it. He continues to feel a deep shame over his violent actions toward his concubine during your mother\u2019s waking, though we all know he wasn\u2019t in his right mind at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeha\u2019s too busy holding off her twin to bother about us.\u201d Worried what the Archangel of India would do in her continued grief about the execution of her daughter, Elena had read every one of Jason\u2019s reports as they came in. \u201cIs Elijah two-faced enough to offer friendship with one hand and stab us in the back with the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli has a noble heart and the inclination not to cause you or yours harm,\u201d Keir said to Raphael, then glanced at Elena. Obviously noting her surprise, the healer smiled. \u201cHe is the rarest of archangels, one who didn\u2019t show signs of such violent power as a youth or as a young male.\u201d</p><p>From the way Raphael was staring at the healer, he didn\u2019t know this particular story, either. \u201cYou will not stop now, Keir.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, the healer said, \u201cEli was a seasoned and loyal general in another archangel\u2019s army on the day of a great battle against\u2014\u201d Cutting himself off, Keir shook his head. \u201cI will tell you that tale another time. It is far too long and interesting to shorten so precipitously.\u201d</p><p>Fascinated, Elena waited for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cEli,\u201d Keir said into the silence, \u201chad just cut down the last of the enemy and raised his sword to declare victory when it hit: a sudden and total ascension that sent him screaming into the skies. It was extraordinary, as all ascensions are extraordinary, but what is most important is that when he returned from the sky to the earth, he was no longer a general but one of the Cadre.\u201d</p><p>Raphael said what Elena was thinking. \u201cHe was Caliane\u2019s general.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, so unless you betray him, he will not first betray you. He would\u2019ve hunted your mother in her madness had she not disappeared into Sleep, but he would\u2019ve taken no pleasure in it, for he has never forsaken the vows he took to cause no harm to her and those of her blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliane\u2019s never mentioned him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ask her?\u201d An arch question. \u201cYou know her age. It\u2019s very possible she hasn\u2019t quite assimilated that you are now Eli\u2019s peer, for he was an archangel before you were born, and in her eyes . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a child still.\u201d Raphael thrust his hand through his hair. \u201cI wish you\u2019d shared Elijah\u2019s past with me earlier. It would\u2019ve made certain negotiations much less fraught.\u201d</p><p>Keir stood to pour himself a fresh cup of tea. \u201cYou are your mother\u2019s son, Raphael. Until you had judged and decided to accept Eli\u2019s friendship for yourself, it would\u2019ve done no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d Illium said into the thoughtful pause that followed, \u201cmuch difference between death and disease. Lijuan remains a prime candidate.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stared into the flames. \u201cNot for the Falling,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI cannot believe such a large-scale act didn\u2019t need a closer hand, and Jason confirmed she was in her own territory at the time, busy with her reborn. For the vampire pox, however, she could\u2019ve simply sent in a carrier of the disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could even be a mortal.\u201d Keir retook his seat, his expression intent. \u201cMy gifts tell me the disease is passed through blood, and a donor would be in the best position to infect many.\u201d Frowning, he shook his head. \u201cYet if it is thus, we should have more bodies\u2014the dead vampire had been so two days at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the victims die at such speed,\u201d Illium said quietly, \u201cthey might be locked up rotting in their homes.\u201d</p><p>It was a horrible image, and Elena was glad for the distraction when Montgomery appeared in the doorway, his eyes sending her a silent message. \u201cGuild Hunter,\u201d he said when she excused herself to walk over to him. \u201cThere is an urgent call for you from the Guild Director.\u201d</p><p>Taking the portable house phone, she said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Ten seconds into that call, and her gut churned. Because Ransom had just found those other bodies, and Illium had been right: they were locked up inside their home, rotting slowly from a malicious disease that had ended their chance at immortality.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>All four of them landed on the tiny drive of a run-down house in a dingy part of the Bronx within the hour. Having been waiting outside, Ransom led them into the building without anything more than a nod, his cheekbones slicing against his skin from the way he clenched his jaw. She smelled the reason for his rigid self-control as soon as she stepped inside the house, the air putrid with disease and heavy with a warmth that told her the central heating had been on for the duration.</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d Raphael asked, wings limned in a lethal glow.</p><p>\u201cFive, and they\u2019ve been dead a couple of days at least.\u201d Ransom went left, heading toward what was probably a bedroom, while Keir and Illium broke off toward the other side of the house. \u201cI turned off the heat and opened the windows to release the worst of the smell.\u201d</p><p>Why is it always Ransom who shows up with these bodies?</p><p>Hearing the deadly supposition in Raphael\u2019s tone, Elena locked eyes with the man who was her lover . . . but who she knew didn\u2019t see other mortals the same way she did. Don\u2019t get any ideas. Ransom grew up on the streets and still has all his old contacts. The people who talk to him, tell him things, wouldn\u2019t ever talk to anyone from the Tower\u2014or even most of the other hunters in the Guild.</p><p>\u201cWho discovered the bodies?\u2019 Raphael asked aloud.</p><p>Ransom\u2019s answer was immediate. \u201cI did. Got a tip about the smell, broke in when I recognized it.\u201d</p><p>He is lying.</p><p>He\u2019s protecting someone. It was what Ransom did when it came to the street people, who were as much family to him as his fellow hunters.</p><p>I can\u2019t permit news of this to spread, Elena. It would incite a panic. Either Ransom talks or I\u2019ll have to take the information from his mind.</p><p>Stomach tight, her hand clenched on the blade she\u2019d dropped into her palm when they entered the house. He\u2019s my friend.</p><p>I trust Ransom to keep his mouth shut. The sea, clean and bright, the wind an icy blast. I do not trust those he trusts.</p><p>And if I ask you to let it go?</p><p>I won\u2019t.</p><p>13</p><p>Jerking at the vicious bluntness of Raphael\u2019s response, at the realization that she was helpless to protect someone she cared for deeply, she stopped Ransom in the bedroom doorway. \u201cYou need to tell the truth,\u201d she said, each word a razor in her throat. \u201cWho found the bodies?\u201d</p><p>A shake of his head, his jaw stiff. \u201cIf I do, I make that person a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will take this memory alone and do the witness no harm.\u201d Raphael came to stand beside Elena. \u201cHe or she will live and remember nothing of this night.\u201d</p><p>Ransom\u2019s eyes slid to Elena and in them she saw the harsh realization that if he didn\u2019t answer the question, Raphael would take the information anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, ready for anger.</p><p>But Ransom shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s an archangel, Ellie. We\u2019re just rats to him.\u201d</p><p>She knew he hadn\u2019t meant anything by it, had in fact been trying to comfort her, but Ransom\u2019s words brought home how little power she had in this relationship. Raphael could override her in so many ways, but she\u2019d become used to having him listen to her, to being able to argue her points. Never had she expected to hear a flat negative, with no room for negotiation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t touch her other memories?\u201d Ransom asked Raphael, while she was still reeling under the force of the cruel emotional slap.</p><p>\u201cQuestioning the word of an archangel is a good way to end up dead.\u201d</p><p>Raphael! Stop it. Furious, she met Ransom\u2019s green eyes. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want anything but this particular memory.\u201d Don\u2019t make me a liar, she said mind to mind at the same instant.</p> <p>A dangerous pause. You question my word, too, Elena?</p><p>Ransom is right. We are rats to you.</p><p>You aren\u2019t part of any other group. You are my consort.</p><p>Ransom spoke before she could respond and it was just as well, since what she wanted to say would probably only have thrown fuel on the ugly fight brewing between her and Raphael.</p><p>\u201cCici lives down the street,\u201d he said. \u201cShe came to buddy-watch the latest episode of Hunter\u2019s Prey like she does every week, and when no one answered, she used the key they gave her a while back when she needed a place to hide out from a violent ex. She knew something was wrong as soon as she got a whiff of the smell, but she figured maybe the cat had dragged in a dead rat or something while everyone was out.\u201d</p> <p>Running a hand through his hair, he messed it up, tugged off the rawhide tie to put it back in order. \u201cShe\u2019s a tough working girl, has come up against knife-wielding assailants and walked out the winner, but I found her curled up in a ball sobbing when I arrived.\u201d A look at Raphael. \u201cJanvier is with her. We were out riding together when I got the call.\u201d</p><p>That explained the unfamiliar red motorcycle out front, parked next to Ransom\u2019s black one. As for how Ransom knew the vampire who held the trust of senior Tower personnel, Janvier had some kind of a relationship\u2014no one quite understood what\u2014with one of their fellow hunters.</p><p>\u201cWhich house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an apartment. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Remaining behind after Raphael left with Ransom, Elena forced herself to go through the house, while Keir focused on the victims and Illium stood watch outside to make sure no one decided to get curious.</p><p>Three males and two females lay dead. Five more lives snuffed out. Two couples, judging from the photos she could see in the bedrooms. One couple was in bed, the two men spooned together as if they\u2019d held on to each other as the sickness became too much to bear. The male half of the other couple was slumped on the couch, his girlfriend on the floor, and to Elena, it looked as if the girl had fallen in a spasm and been unable to get back up. The second girl was in a tiny room at the back, the petite prettiness evident in the photos tucked under the edges of her vanity obliterated by the pox.</p> <p>This victim\u2019s room might have been the smallest in the house, but it was well kept and made individual by the framed Broadway posters on the walls and the glittering masks hung around the same vanity mirror that held the photos. A dancer, Elena realized, seeing the costumes in the doorless cupboard. She recognized one of them from an off-Broadway show that had closed six months ago, after a respectable run.</p><p>Since the dead vampire was living in this part of town, she must\u2019ve been a backup dancer and not yet a lead . . . had probably embraced the near-immortality of vampirism so as to have more time to pursue her dream of the stage. Elena understood why someone would sign on for a hundred years of slavery on the back of such overwhelming desire; dreams could be a commanding force.</p><p>Belle had been a dancer. Long legged and with a thousand dreams in her eyes as she practiced in the backyard. She\u2019d laughed when Elena tried to copy her, but it had been the affectionate laughter of a big sister, and many times, she\u2019d stopped her own practice to teach Elena how to do the moves.</p><p>\u201cLike this, Ellie. You have to become the music, become the air.\u201d</p><p>Sadness weighing down her shoulders, Elena whispered, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d before leaving the bright little room, its color and flamboyance a painful foil for the small, rotting body that lay curled up on the bed.</p><p>As she went through the house more carefully, she noted another poster, this one from a Hollywood blockbuster that had a sticky note at the top proclaiming Extras rule! Then there was the marked-up television script on one bedside table, a musical score on another, next to a violin of glowing wood so beautiful, Elena didn\u2019t dare touch it.</p><p>\u201cThey were artists,\u201d she said to Keir, watching as he examined the body of the girl in the living room. \u201cDancers, actors, musicians. Must\u2019ve banded together to rent this place so they could save on costs.\u201d It surprised her. \u201cI always figured after a hundred years of service to an angel, vampires would come out with at least some savings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every angel is generous.\u201d Keir kept his eyes on the body, his hands gentle and respectful as he opened the girl\u2019s shirt to check the progression of the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s an unspoken rule that the blood kin who complete their Contracts should be given enough money on leaving to begin a new life, but that sum is open to interpretation.\u201d</p> <p>He closed the sides of the shirt, doing up two buttons so it wouldn\u2019t gape. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, shifting to look at the male, \u201cthere are the vampires who come out of their Contracts so used to being told what to do that they have no idea how to manage their money and end up going through it like water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe musician,\u201d Elena said, \u201cI think he spent his money on his violin; the actor on drama classes, from the brochures I found in her room; so these five, at least, were working toward something.\u201d There was a vibrant sense of promise in every room of the house, the kind of energy that said all five had been on the same wavelength. \u201cIt seems so unfair. They were the good ones, the ones who did their hundred years, and this is their reward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is rarely fair, Elena.\u201d Keir\u2019s voice held the echoes of thousands of years of existence. \u201cBut this, at least . . . no, it should not have happened.\u201d</p><p>Finding nothing in the living room that might provide a clue as to how all five roommates had apparently been infected simultaneously\u2014a fact that seemed to negate their blood donor theory\u2014Elena moved on. Ransom returned while she was in the kitchen. \u201cRaphael is one scary motherfucker,\u201d was his greeting.</p><p>Elena\u2019s hand tightened around the edge of the fridge door, the cold air seeping into her clothes to scrape over her skin. \u201cCici?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping like a baby. And yeah, your scary boyfriend\u2019s returned to the Tower to deal with something else.\u201d Lines of strain around his mouth, he blew out a harsh breath. \u201cPart of me is glad Cici won\u2019t be haunted by this horror, won\u2019t wake up whimpering and screaming night after night, but we took a piece of her life, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would rather die as Elena than live as a shadow.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d said that to Raphael once, and he\u2019d kept her faith, hadn\u2019t messed with her memories. Maybe that was why she\u2019d become complacent, forgetting he\u2019d do so to others without blinking. Even to the people who were more her family than Jeffrey would ever be. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again, door edge digging into her palm from the force of her grip.</p><p>Ransom shoulder-bumped her. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019d have had to report this to the Tower whether or not you were with Raphael. Only difference is, I\u2019d have been wiped, too, and never known it, so thanks for having my back.\u201d Bending, he began to move things around in the fridge. \u201cHey\u201d\u2014utter motionlessness\u2014\u201cdid you see this?\u201d</p><p>Alerted by his response, she pushed the door wide and bent down beside him. \u201cBlood.\u201d Bottles of it, tucked away in back of the second shelf. Most vampires preferred the vein, but bottled blood was like fast food\u2014every city vamp had some within easy reach. \u201cSupplier?\u201d</p><p>If it was one of the major vamp-focused blood services, this could go nuclear very, very fast. Those services didn\u2019t test for disease, because vampires weren\u2019t supposed to get sick. Instead, they took in donors the human banks rejected, paying them enough that, for some, donating \u201cfood blood\u201d was a steady source of income. And with New York being a Tower city, with a strong vampire population, demand was high. It would\u2019ve been child\u2019s play for the carrier of this deadly pox to slip into the donor line.</p><p>\u201cBlood-for-Less,\u201d Ransom read out. \u201cThat\u2019s a new outfit in the Vampire Quarter.\u201d</p><p>Known as Soho in the daytime, the area wasn\u2019t exactly a cheap-rent part of the city, which meant, Elena thought, the business had to be at least moderately successful.</p><p>\u201cSmall-time blood caf\u00e9 but with a growing fan base,\u201d Ransom continued, closing the fridge door. \u201cLower-quality blood, according to my vamp contacts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can it be lower quality than diseased blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord is they take anemics, people who overdonate, might even be watering the blood down a little, but it\u2019s cheap. There\u2019s a market for that\u2014blood that\u2019s enough for a snack, not a meal. And since that\u2019s the Blood-for-Less motto, no one feels cheated.\u201d</p><p>Elena walked across to flip open the lid of the garbage bin.</p><p>No bottles.</p><p>Then she spied a white plastic crate off to the side marked Recycling in sparkly purple pen that erased any distance she might\u2019ve managed to keep from the victims. \u201cHere we go,\u201d she said through a throat gone raw. \u201cOne large bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was that half-eaten cake in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The remnants of the word Congratulations had still been readable, white icing over chocolate frosting. \u201cA celebration, complete with cake and a shared bottle of blood to do the toast.\u201d God, it pissed her off that these people had died so an archangel already bloated with power could gain more.</p><p>\u201cI can reach out to my contacts\u201d\u2014stress lines bracketed either side of Ransom\u2019s mouth as he spoke\u2014\u201cfind out if there are any other budget operations like Blood-for-Less, if that information will help with whatever the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>Elena could taste his frustration, but she wasn\u2019t about to risk his mind or his memories. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, and the responding flash of anger on his face cut like a knife; she had the sense of a wall going up between her and someone who\u2019d been a part of her life since the day she\u2019d first walked into the Academy. \u201cI\u2019ll check out Blood-for-Less.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Less than a minute later, she said, \u201cI have to fly out,\u201d to Illium, having grabbed the address from Ransom before he left, his expression tight. \u201cI want you to stay here, keep a watch on Keir.\u201d No sane archangel would target a healer, but there was no guarantee they were dealing with anyone sane. And what better way to cripple New York than to eliminate the one person who had any real handle on the disease?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fly alone at night,\u201d Illium reminded her. \u201cIt\u2019s a blanket ban.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She\u2019d forgotten the precaution and it wasn\u2019t one it\u2019d be smart to flout, given the current situation. \u201cWho\u2014\u201d She broke off as the gleaming red motorcycle, which had disappeared in the time she\u2019d been inside, purred to a stop in front of the house once more.</p> <p>The tall male who slid off after removing his helmet had eyes of deep green and hair of chestnut, his face holding an inherent and lazy sensuality reinforced by his every movement. It would be a mistake, however, to trust that first impression\u2014because while Janvier wasn\u2019t one of the Seven, he worked directly with them. No one held the respect of men that dangerous without being deadly himself.</p><p>\u201cI return as per your command, dear Bluebell,\u201d the vampire now said, the cadence of his voice invoking images of bayous dark and mysterious.</p><p>Illium\u2019s order was to the point. \u201cMake sure no one gets to Keir. Aodhan is arranging aerial backup\u2014someone should be here within ten minutes.\u201d When Janvier flicked a salute, his motorcycle jacket shifting to reveal the gleaming black butt of a serious gun, Illium turned to Elena. \u201cA lift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His hands around her waist, her own on his shoulders, Illium took off. Though he was whiplash-fast and could maneuver like nobody else she knew, he didn\u2019t have as much brute strength as Raphael, the lift taking longer than it did when it was her consort who held her. Eyes of gold looked into her own as they rose into the starlit sky, the lashes thick black tipped with blue in a natural echo of his hair. \u201cYou look angry, Ellie.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, she was. It didn\u2019t matter that she understood she was being irrational\u2014humans couldn\u2019t be permitted certain knowledge for the good of mortals and immortals alike. And if anyone leaked the news of this disease, it would not only incite panic, it might give Raphael\u2019s enemies the sign of weakness for which they no doubt waited.</p><p>Regardless of all that, she was angry at Raphael for being so much an archangel. That, too, was in no way logical or rational, simply a sign that she\u2019d lost sight of the truth of him because he\u2019d become someone else to her. It was a bone-jarring shock to be so bluntly reminded that the man who was her lover was that man only for her. To the rest of the world he was\u2014must be\u2014the lethal, dangerous, and sometimes cruel Archangel of New York.</p><p>None of that was something she could share with Illium, this battle a very private one, so all she said was, \u201cIt\u2019s been a hard night.\u201d</p><p>His expression told her he knew that wasn\u2019t all of it, but he released her without further words as soon as they\u2019d gained the correct altitude, and they flew in silence to the cute little warehouse that functioned as Blood-for-Less\u2019s current base of operations . . . and the heart of the infection.</p><p>14</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the blood caf\u00e9 was open, the doorway glowing with a muted light that would be too dark for most humans, but perfect for its clientele. While the warehouse was technically in the Vampire Quarter, it was on the very fringe, no other vampiric businesses around it. As a result, the area was currently deserted, devoid of foot traffic.</p> <p>Inside, the warehouse had been partitioned into two sides using heavy black drapes in lush velvet, one side acting as the store and office, while the other was set up with three sets of unexpectedly lovely seating arrangements featuring wine-red sofas accented with black rugs. There was even art on the walls, the black-and-white photographs carefully chosen to add to the darkly sensual ambience.</p><p>It was the kind of place that might tempt a group of friends to linger, drink a glass of blood together . . . maybe buy another more expensive one\u2014because when Elena picked up a menu from a nearby side table lacquered in glossy black, she saw that Blood-for-Less also offered a premium service tailored to its market: rich blood flavored or spiced in a number of different ways, but at a price that wouldn\u2019t break the budget, as each serving was relatively small. Attractive enough pricewise that a couple on a date, for example, might buy several flavors to share, and fancy enough that it\u2019d feel like a special occasion.</p><p>Smart business.</p><p>\u201cWelcome\u2014\u201d The pretty Hispanic woman who\u2019d walked out of the office cut off her spiel the instant she saw them. \u201cConsort.\u201d Ruffles of white lace at her throat and cuffs, teamed with a tightly fitted vest and pants in black, she lowered her upper half in a deep bow. \u201cHow may I be of service?\u201d Her gaze flicked to the door that Illium was closing as she rose back up, fear crawling into her eyes with a quickness that told Elena this vamp\u2019s angel hadn\u2019t been kind to her. \u201cI assure you I\u2019ve completed my hundred years. I have my discharge papers\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elena held up a hand to relieve the woman\u2019s panic. \u201cI\u2019m not here to take you in, but I need you to answer some questions. How much blood do you have in storage?\u201d</p><p>Blinking, the vampire pulled herself together with commendable speed. \u201cI just began this business three months ago, so it runs on a shoestring. My present stock is two hundred bottles.\u201d</p><p>A knock somewhere beyond the velvet curtains had the owner glancing over her shoulder, before she jerked her gaze back to Elena, perspiration glimmering on her skin. \u201cThat\u2019s the donor entrance. I get enough walk-ins to keep the stock relatively steady, but I haven\u2019t yet built up a strong network of regular donors. It can get hairy sometimes\u2014last week I was down to twenty bottles before a group of college students dropped by.\u201d The explanation came out staccato-fast, as if she was attempting to hold back suspected bad news by drowning the air in words.</p><p>\u201cI need to see the blood,\u201d Elena said, hating the fact that she now inspired so much fear in a legal, hardworking vampire.</p> <p>A jerky nod. \u201cOf course.\u201d The shorter, curvier woman led her inside the office and to three large fridges. \u201cIs\u2014is there a problem with my blood?\u201d Her fingers trembled as she tugged at the lace of her cuffs.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you yet. If you could step out, stay with Illium.\u201d</p><p>Opening the nearest fridge once the vampire left, Elena picked up the first bottle, unscrewed it and took a sniff.</p><p>Cold iron, a hint of disease . . . but it was a disease she\u2019d scented before.</p><p>\u201cCancer,\u201d she muttered and screwed the lid back on.</p><p>It took her a number of hours to go through the entire stock, and by the time she was halfway through, she\u2019d found three that pulsed with the putrid stench she associated with the vampire pox. An angel dispatched earlier for courier duty took the infected blood to Keir as it was discovered, the healer having returned to the labs underneath the Tower.</p><p>No others set off her senses.</p><p>Regardless, none of the blood in this warehouse could be permitted into circulation. When she informed the owner, the vampire\u2014who, Elena had learned, was named Marcia Blue\u2014almost broke down in tears. \u201cI put my entire payout into this business,\u201d she said, hugging her arms around her body. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to rebuild my stock from scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have insurance?\u201d</p><p>A shake of the woman\u2019s head. \u201cPremiums were too high, given my location and clientele.\u201d Trembling, she bit down on her lower lip and swallowed in a clear effort to hold back tears. \u201cI made a profit for the first time last week.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the heartrending unfairness of so much of what had happened over the past three days, culminating in the broken dreams of this vampire who\u2019d put in her time, done her hundred, and she made a decision. \u201cI\u2019ll stake you for a percentage of future profits,\u201d she said, knowing she couldn\u2019t simply give Marcia the money.</p><p>Harsh as it might seem, that would make the Tower appear far too generous, the association between it and Elena automatic. And the Tower couldn\u2019t afford to be anything but ruthless . . . as Raphael couldn\u2019t afford to let her humanity alter the balance of power that kept the city stable.</p><p>Marcia\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I need to start investing my money, and I like your idea. But,\u201d she added when Marcia would\u2019ve spoken, \u201cyou understand I\u2019ll have to go over your long-term business plan to make sure it\u2019s a sound investment?\u201d That seemed like the kind of thing an investor would say.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A shaky smile, Marcia\u2019s heart in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll send it to the Tower at once.\u201d Bowing again, the other woman looked up, tears rolling down her cheeks. \u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Uncomfortable, Elena turned the conversation back to the hunt. \u201cIn the meantime, we\u2019ll advance you some clean blood\u2014and you\u2019ll start operations again tomorrow at your normal time. Accept donors as usual but don\u2019t sell any of their blood. Sell only the blood you receive from us. Understood?\u201d</p><p>A quick nod.</p><p>About to continue, Elena had a thought. \u201cDid you put up a sign explaining tonight\u2019s closure?\u201d If the carrier had returned during that time and become suspicious, he or she might not come back.</p><p>It was Illium who answered. \u201cFront and donor door. Just said, Family emergency, back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Since vampires often considered other vampires with whom they\u2019d served, family, that was an excuse no one would question. \u201cDo you have surveillance?\u201d she asked Marcia.</p><p>\u201cNo. There was no money for that.\u201d</p><p>A quick glance at Illium, a nod in return, and she knew the cameras would be in place before the doors opened the next day. \u201cI need you to keep strict data on who donates what blood,\u201d she said to Marcia. \u201cTag and label everything.\u201d</p><p>The vampire nodded, eyes shrewd. \u201cSomeone is selling tainted blood, and the taint\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Carrying on before Elena could interrupt, she said, \u201cI won\u2019t speak a word of this, and I\u2019ll ensure none of the donated blood leaves the caf\u00e9.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Elena said softly. \u201cAnything else would cost you.\u201d</p><p>Sweat broke out over the vampire\u2019s face once more, a slick sheen. \u201cI do not lie, Consort.\u201d</p><p>Stomach tight at the renewed fear pulsing in the woman\u2019s eyes, Elena told the vampire to leave them the keys and return the following day an hour before she typically opened up.</p> <p>\u201cI just scared her on purpose,\u201d she told Illium. The act had been instinctive, the realization of what she\u2019d done horrifying.</p><p>Illium shrugged. \u201cThe fear will keep her alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I don\u2019t want to become that, become someone who controls others through fear.\u201d It sickened her to think she was being corrupted by the power now at her disposal. \u201cWhat if a hundred years from now, I look into the mirror and see Michaela?\u201d Cruel and capricious and nasty.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we\u2019d permit that?\u201d Lips curving, he tapped a finger to her nose. \u201cRaphael would be the first to warn you were you in danger of losing yourself.\u201d</p><p>Elena wasn\u2019t so certain. The man who owned her heart saw nothing wrong with acts that deeply troubled her. She was the human one in their relationship. Raphael had said more than once that she\u2019d brought him back from the abyss of age and power\u2014what would happen to the balance between them if she survived war only to break under the relentless pressure of an immortality textured by the power of being consort to an archangel?</p> <p>Rubbing a fisted hand over her heart, she said, \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d His fingers brushing lightly over the back of her wing, careful to avoid the sensitive zones, but an intimacy nonetheless. \u201cWhen have we ever been so formal? Ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have you never resented me?\u201d It was a question for which she\u2019d needed an answer since the day she\u2019d learned about his past. \u201cResented Raphael?\u201d</p><p>Illium had been punished with the loss of his own mortal lover centuries ago, after he broke the greatest taboo of his race and spoke angelic secrets in her ear. Erasing the woman\u2019s memories of the blue-winged angel and all he\u2019d told her, Raphael had also stripped Illium of his feathers, grounding him until the wounds healed. Even when he could fly again, there was no surcease; he\u2019d had to keep his distance, eventually watch his former lover fall for someone else, live her life without him.</p><p>Golden eyes shadowed with old sorrow, Illium withdrew a small metal pendant from the pocket of his jeans, the surface worn smooth by centuries of handling. \u201cWhen did Raphael tell you our secrets?\u201d he said, not having to explain to her that his lover had given him the pendant.</p><p>Her heart ached at the sadness he ordinarily hid beneath a stunning joie de vivre. \u201cAs we fell,\u201d she whispered. \u201cRaphael told me as we fell.\u201d Everything within her rebelled against the agony linked to that fragment of time\u2014not of the flesh, for her broken body had been beyond that, but of the soul, because Raphael was dying with her.</p> <p>\u201cOn the eve of what he believed would be your death and his.\u201d Putting away the pendant, Illium shook his head, the blue-tipped black strands of his hair kissing the sides of his face. \u201cI had no such excuse. My lover was young and headstrong, and angry that I kept secrets from her. I couldn\u2019t bear her remoteness . . . so I told.\u201d</p><p>A sad, rueful smile that spoke of the besotted youth he\u2019d been. \u201cI\u2019m certain other angels have told their mortal lovers over the centuries, the secrets going to the grave with those men and women, but I told a girl who could not keep her silence, who began to whisper hints to others in her village.\u201d</p><p>This time it was Elena who touched his wing, the silken silver-blue a living piece of art beneath her fingertips. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo angel can afford to break with such ease,\u201d Illium continued, \u201cand though I loved her with all of my being, I also knew her down to the soul, knew she didn\u2019t have the will to hold secrets within. Raphael was right to punish me.\u201d</p><p>When he spread his wing and lifted his arm, she went, hugging him with the embrace of a friend, was hugged in turn, his grip so fierce she knew he fought not to splinter under the deluge of memory.</p><p>\u201cThe Sire,\u201d Illium said, his chest rising against her in a long, jagged breath, \u201cwas wounded at what he had to do. I could see it, feel it, and it is the greatest shame of my life that I drove him to the point where he had no other option.\u201d</p><p>Of everything he\u2019d said, that was the least expected, but Illium wasn\u2019t done. \u201cIf only,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d come to him as soon as I realized my mistake in telling, he would\u2019ve quietly erased her memory of angelic secrets, warned me not to make the same mistake again, and I would\u2019ve been free to love her. But I didn\u2019t and he could not help me once others learned of my transgression.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s heart twisted as she understood at last. Ruthless he might be, but Raphael protected those who were his own. For him to not only be unable to do that, but to actually be forced to cause harm instead, would\u2019ve exacted a terrible price. Especially when it had been Illium, son of an angel who had both Raphael\u2019s respect and his love: the Hummingbird, someone he treated with heartbreaking gentleness.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever price I paid,\u201d Illium said into the quiet, \u201che paid it twice over.\u201d</p><p>Hurting for the loss that defined the blue-winged angel to this day, and the circumstances that had led to it, Elena leaned back, raised her hand to touch his face, and found herself hesitating.</p><p>\u201cBe careful with Illium, Elena. He\u2019s vulnerable to the humanity you carry within.\u201d</p><p>The echo of Dmitri\u2019s voice, sin and seduction and violence, the vampire\u2019s expression unexpectedly serious as he cautioned her about Illium not long after her return to New York.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Ellie.\u201d A lopsided smile, Illium\u2019s body heat pressing against her own. \u201cYou are the Sire\u2019s and I would tear off my own wings before I would break that trust.\u201d</p><p>Dropping her hand, she took a step away, putting more distance between them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to cause you pain,\u201d she said, affection intertwined with worry. Her worry wasn\u2019t only for how he reacted to her, but also the fact that he continued to mourn a woman who\u2019d turned to dust centuries ago, having forgotten she\u2019d ever been so unbearably loved.</p><p>When Elena had been human, she\u2019d sometimes wondered how mortal-immortal couples handled the aging of one, while the other appeared as young as the day they\u2019d first met. Never once had she considered that if the love was true, the pain would be endless for the one left behind. \u201cYou have enough hurt inside you already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that\u2019ll hurt is if you allow my mistakes to damage our friendship.\u201d A slow smile that painted over the sadness, eyes of liquid gold backlit with wickedness. \u201cShall I tell you about my lovers so you don\u2019t feel sorry for me?\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cIn the plural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to give anyone the wrong idea.\u201d Tugging playfully on her braid, he headed for the door. \u201cThe blood pickup team has arrived.\u201d</p><p>The vampiric team, gloved up and masked, made quick work of clearing the fridges. Locking up after them, Elena got a quick lift from Illium and angled her wings toward the Tower. Regardless of her personal anger with Raphael, they were and would always be a unit when it came to protecting their city, and she wanted to update him on the Blood-for-Less situation, as well as find out why he\u2019d left the site of the five vampiric deaths so precipitously.</p><p>The light-filled column of the Tower a cold burn in front of her, she reached out to make certain he was inside. Raphael?</p><p>The answer came immediately, but it held the slight remoteness that denoted a certain amount of distance. There is a situation, Elena. Michaela is here.</p><p>15</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t shift his eyes off Michaela as he instructed Illium to lead Elena to Gable House, the place the female archangel had taken in the short term. He\u2019d left the house of disease as soon as one of his far advance scouts had spotted her flying into the territory, and made the long flight to escort her\u2014a gesture she\u2019d seen as welcome, but that he\u2019d done to make certain she brought no army.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t, her escort consisting of a single angelic squadron and a vampire, the vampire catching a lift with the angels by way of a light carrier designed for that purpose. Had Michaela been in distress, or in fear of an imminent assault, he\u2019d have waited to have this discussion, but dressed in a green catsuit that hugged her curves, she moved with opulent sensuality, her actions designed to remind him she was considered the most desirable woman in the world.</p><p>Raphael would rather sleep in a pit of venomous snakes than with Michaela.</p><p>He had, however, allowed her time to rest and have a meal after her journey, for he would not harm the babe in her womb. \u201cI\u2019m glad you had the sense not to impinge on my home,\u201d he said now.</p><p>An insinuating smile. \u201cIt is an inconvenience not to use my own property, but I know you\u2019re protective of your little mortal\u2014and Riker has a taste for her. It would\u2019ve been impossible to stop him from crossing the woods to get to her had we been neighbors.\u201d</p><p>Riker, Raphael thought, wouldn\u2019t touch Elena. Last time he\u2019d come close to her, Raphael had simply ripped out his heart and left him twitching on the earth. Should Michaela\u2019s pet vampire have forgotten that lesson, Raphael would be happy to teach it again\u2014this time, with a permanent conclusion. \u201cDo not bring Riker into my territory again unless you want him dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Raphael, I didn\u2019t mean to make you angry.\u201d All but purring, she went as if to place her hand on his chest.</p><p>He gripped her wrist before she could, her bones slender under his hold, and, driven by instinct that said her every word was a honeyed lie, activated his healing ability. Knowledge poured into him, of Michaela\u2019s physical strength, of the sickening acid-green taint she carried within as a result of the day Uram had cracked her rib cage open to play with her blood-slick heart . . . of the emptiness in her womb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Releasing her with enough force that she stumbled back a step, he said, \u201cDo not cross more lines than you\u2019ve already done by entering my lands without invitation. I am not yours to touch.\u201d Only a single stubborn, intelligent, and dangerous woman had that right.</p><p>A tightening of lush brown skin over the blades of her cheekbones, rejection anathema to a woman used to being worshipped by the male sex. \u201cI thought to plead my case in person.\u201d Tilting her head to the side, the glossy black curls of her hair shining with bronze highlights, she placed her palms flat against the concave slope of her abdomen. \u201cI thought you, of all the Cadre, would show kindness to a woman with child.\u201d Her tone altered, became huskier, her dawning smile painful in its apparent tenderness. \u201cYou watched over the angelic nurseries as a young man. I have ever respected that about you, Raphael\u2014your willingness to protect our most precious treasures.\u201d</p><p>Raphael wondered if Michaela was so used to manipulating men that she simply didn\u2019t understand he couldn\u2019t be molded to her requirements with sweet words buttressed by an undertone of sex. \u201cI am no longer a young man,\u201d he said, seeing her eyes narrow at the continued ice in his tone, \u201cand you have come perilously close to a fatal breach of the rules of Guesthood.\u201d</p> <p>Dropping her hands, she turned in a dramatic sweep of shimmering bronze, her wings arcing gracefully over her back. \u201cYou are being cruel.\u201d Vivid green, her eyes were sheened wet when she turned to face him once more. \u201cI ask you for sanctuary and you want me to play with formalities? You know I lost a child! I cannot lose another.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, he almost believed her, thought that perhaps she\u2019d miscarried the embryo and \u201cforgotten\u201d the knowledge in her agony . . . but then she betrayed herself, her lips curving up the slightest fraction at his hesitation. The feline smugness of her answered his final questions, told him he had no need to be gentle. \u201cEnough of the charade, Michaela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharade? You mock me!\u201d A thin ring of acidic green pulsing around the richer hue of her irises, an unmistakable physical sign of Uram\u2019s influence. \u201cI am vulnerable; you are strong. I ask for your help! Where is the charade?\u201d</p><p>Allowing his own power to rise, he felt his wings begin to glow. \u201cYou carry no babe.\u201d</p><p>Silence, her shock morphing rapidly into fury. \u201cAn accusation of deliberate falsehood! You incite a war!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Golden light filled the wide mullioned windows of the graceful house where Illium indicated Elena should land.</p><p>\u201cPretty hunter, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>She hissed out a breath, blades falling into both hands as she recognized the blond vampire who\u2019d shaped the simple statement into a threat, the bones of his face refined to an unearthly beauty that made it clear he was far beyond a hundred years of age.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen Riker, he\u2019d been pinned to the wall of the house next to their own, a torn-off chair leg through his throat and blood dripping down his temples. Today, Michaela\u2019s favorite guard bared his teeth at her in a feral grin that was nothing natural, nothing sane, then waved his arm toward the front door in mocking welcome.</p><p>\u201cMy mistress flayed the skin off my back and made it into a purse.\u201d</p> <p>Hairs rising on her nape at the memory of the way he\u2019d made that admission with the same creepily fixed smile, Elena tightened her grip on the blades. \u201cI see you\u2019ve healed.\u201d</p><p>A lascivious stroke of his tongue along his upper lip. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long time to be alone with you.\u201d His eyes flicked over her head just as she heard the cold whisper of sound that was Illium unsheathing the sword he always carried along his spine, the weapon hidden by a glamour that spoke to Illium\u2019s growing power.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he murmured, then raised his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll watch Michaela\u2019s rabid dog, put him out of his misery if he proves troublesome.\u201d</p><p>Riker\u2019s eyes glowed bloodred, his fangs flashing, but he kept his distance when she walked past him and through the front door. Raphael, how bad is it?</p><p>Michaela is not with child, has likely never been with child.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe she used the memory of her own dead child in a scheme. Sickened by the callousness of such an act, she followed the sound of a raised voice to the large but otherwise unremarkable central core of the house. Raphael stood in the center, Michaela a few feet from him.</p><p>The female archangel\u2019s exquisite skin, the color of coffee swirled with milk and dusted with gold, was flushed, as if as a result of passionate argument; her body the epitome of female perfection in the emerald green catsuit that caressed every curve and valley.</p><p>Raphael answered whatever it was Michaela had said just as Elena took the first step toward him. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lie you can hope to maintain\u2014so unless you do wish a war, cut your losses and leave.\u201d</p> <p>Shooting Elena a dagger-sharp glare, Michaela said, \u201cLook, your pet has arrived,\u201d the words saccharine-sweet. \u201cHas she learned to sit and beg on command yet?\u201d</p><p>Elena made her tone just as sweet as she played a throwing knife over her fingers. \u201cNo, but my aim\u2019s even better now.\u201d It might\u2019ve been petty, but she enjoyed seeing the fury in Michaela\u2019s expression at the reminder that Elena had once buried a blade in her eyeball.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d It was a soft warning from Raphael as Michaela raised her hand, her fingertips crackling with dramatic green.</p><p>A ball of angelfire formed in Raphael\u2019s palm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so amused by the creature.\u201d Michaela closed her fingers. \u201cBut I suggest you teach it manners.\u201d</p><p>Bristling, Elena nonetheless realized Michaela wanted an excuse to hurt her, and held her silence as Raphael spoke in a tone that could\u2019ve drawn blood. \u201cI judge it\u2019ll strain your squadron to make the return journey at once, so you may remain as a guest until midnight. Any later and I\u2019ll consider it an act of trespass.\u201d</p><p>Brushstrokes of violent red across Michaela\u2019s cheekbones, the sign of emotional intensity only serving to highlight her incredible beauty. \u201cOne day,\u201d she purred, \u201cone day you\u2019ll understand what you reject this night, and then you will beg for my favors.\u201d</p><p>Can I stab her?</p><p>Only if she is still here after midnight.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Neither one of them spoke again until they landed on the lawn of their own home. In the short time that Elena had been inside Gable House, night had begun to give way to day, and across the river, Manhattan was wrapped in soft, swirling gray, the lights in the high-rises muted.</p><p>\u201cI want you to keep a discreet watch on Michaela and her people,\u201d Raphael ordered Illium, the blue-winged angel having flown back with them. \u201cIt\u2019s almost dawn, so you can go alone, but check in with Aodhan every ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Illium lifted off with a bare rustle of sound, the silver-blue of his wings swallowed up by the gray as he ascended above the cloud layer.</p><p>Wings brushing the dew-laden grass, Elena paced across the lawn. \u201cWas it just me or was the Bitch Goddess \u2018off\u2019 tonight? She had this odd jerkiness to her movements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUram\u2019s taint.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s gorge rose at the thought of Michaela\u2019s former lover, the insane archangel who\u2019d left a trail of mutilated and bloody bodies in his wake . . . including Jeffrey\u2019s mistress, that pitiable, pale copy of Marguerite. Ripped-off limbs thrust into screaming mouths, rib cages torn open to reveal glistening entrails, bodies hung and bled, Uram had committed atrocities Elena hadn\u2019t even imagined possible.</p><p>\u201cUram tore out her heart,\u201d she said, recalling her horror at the gaping wound, \u201cleft that glowing red fireball in her chest. Direct contact.\u201d The only other person to have such intimate contact with Uram, and survive, was Sorrow, and she\u2019d undeniably come out of it altered on a fundamental level.</p><p>The young woman wasn\u2019t human any longer, but neither was she a vampire; she\u2019d starve without blood as she\u2019d starve without food. Then there was the would-be assailant twice her size whose neck she\u2019d snapped in a self-defensive fugue. Now in training to learn how to consciously manage her strength and speed, Elena knew Sorrow was also under constant watch for signs of the same murderous insanity as her \u201cblood sire,\u201d the term one she\u2019d heard Dmitri use.</p><p>It infuriated Elena that the gutsy young woman couldn\u2019t escape Uram, but Sorrow wasn\u2019t the issue right this instant. \u201cWhat if Michaela refuses to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll force her out.\u201d</p><p>Guilt gripped her in its bony hands. If Michaela had gained an offensive power in the Cascade, any battle would be a treacherously uneven one for Raphael.</p><p>\u201cI would wash off the night, Elena.\u201d Raphael turned toward the house.</p><p>Stomach in knots, her earlier anger at him buried under the chilling reminder that she might just have killed him, she went in silence.</p><p>Shutting the bedroom door behind them, Raphael walked across to open the balcony doors, letting in the cold morning air. \u201cCome here, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to know\u201d\u2014his tone a serrated blade\u2014\u201cwhy my consort is keeping secrets that make her fly into herself.\u201d</p><p>She flinched, stepping past him to stand on the very edge of the balcony. \u201cI\u2019m angry at you, for what happened with Ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be angry, but you understand the decision.\u201d As ruthless an answer as the way he\u2019d dealt with Cici. \u201cThat isn\u2019t what you\u2019re keeping from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, you lie to me?\u201d Cold, deadly, each word honed as bright as sword steel.</p><p>Spinning to face him, she fisted her hands. \u201cStop trying to intimidate me\u2014I\u2019m your consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have the capacity to be intimidated,\u201d came the icy response, but his eyes, they were violent blue flames. \u201cWhat are you hiding, Elena?\u201d</p><p>Relentless and used to getting answers to his questions, he wouldn\u2019t drop this, she knew, but the thought of telling him the truth was a rock in her gut. \u201cLeave it,\u201d she said, jaw clenched. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to just let it go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen it puts shadows under your eyes and makes you swallow your words?\u201d He strode across to grip her jaw. \u201cNo. You\u2019re hurting and I will know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t and he could not help me once others learned of my transgression.\u201d</p><p>Illium\u2019s words dashed cold water on the heat of her self-protective response. She couldn\u2019t do the same to Raphael, couldn\u2019t make him helpless in the face of her pain. Taking a shaky breath, she placed a fisted hand on his chest and knew it was time to stop hiding from the damage she\u2019d done.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>About to tell Elena that they wouldn\u2019t leave this balcony until she told him the truth, Raphael was silenced by the light weight of her fist against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIn the Refuge,\u201d she began, \u201cI heard what they said: that you were the most powerful youth anyone had ever seen.\u201d Her voice was raw emotion, her features bleak. \u201cYou became Cadre at the end of your first millennium\u2014it makes you extraordinary. And now . . .\u201d</p><p>He saw it then, the torture she\u2019d been inflicting on herself, and had to willfully temper his anger that she\u2019d do this, cause herself harm in such an insidious way. Releasing his grip on her chin so he wouldn\u2019t inadvertently hurt her, he ended the statement she\u2019d begun, not bothering to conceal his fury. \u201cNow others are gaining vicious powers, while I appear to have gained only a negative ability.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn as always, his consort held his gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s true and it\u2019s because of me.\u201d Visceral pain. \u201cI\u2019m your assassin\u2014no one else!\u201d</p> <p>16</p><p>Elena could push him to the edge faster than any other, but Raphael fought his rising anger to say what she\u2019d forgotten. \u201cMy ability is the only one that has had any impact on Lijuan.\u201d The Archangel of China had been stunned that he\u2019d managed to cause her physical harm.</p><p>\u201cYes, but we both know it won\u2019t be enough.\u201d Skin pale from the way she held herself, all taut muscle and tendon, Elena dropped her hands to her sides. \u201cNot against Lijuan\u2019s reborn and not against Neha\u2019s ability to create fire and ice, just to name two of the others. You said it yourself.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never meant for her to take his words as an indictment. Even more, he\u2019d never expected Elena, brash and honest, to hold such damaging thoughts within . . . but he should have. His hunter, after all, had held the horrific loss of her family inside herself for nearly two decades, keeping it even from her trusted best friend.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he said, infuriated with her even as he wanted to bring Slater Patalis back to life so he could send him to a torturous death, \u201cdo not make a habit of hiding accusations behind the words I speak to my consort.\u201d That she may have believed such of him had rage lacing a film of red across his vision. \u201cAnd I will not tolerate you concealing your thoughts from me in this way.\u201d</p><p>A glint in his consort\u2019s eye. \u201cI told you\u2014don\u2019t speak to me like I\u2019m some soldier you\u2019re disciplining.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would break every bone in the body of any soldier who dared lie to me.\u201d Elena had never held her tongue around him, even when it might\u2019ve been the smarter option, and he had no intention of allowing that to change.</p><p>Violence in those eyes of silver-gray. \u201cYou\u2019re making me want to go for a blade.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, well aware she\u2019d read it as a taunt.</p><p>Releasing a hissing breath, she thrust her hands into his hair and, tugging down his head, pressed her lips to his instead of slicing cold steel across his flesh.</p><p>He took the kiss, demanded more, demanded everything. Even angry and on edge, she was his, would always be his. Wrapping his arms around her as their tongues lashed against each other, their bodies primed for a furious intimate battle, he said, Tighten your wings, and took her into the air, spreading his glamour to cover her, until they were invisible to the world.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Chest heaving, Elena broke the kiss to see that Raphael was flying them across the river toward Manhattan. \u201cLet me go. I have my own damn wings.\u201d And she was pissed with him for the way he\u2019d spoken to her.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He kissed her this time, the hand he thrust into her hair unraveling her braid as he used the grip to hold her mouth to his own.</p> <p>She could\u2019ve escaped if she\u2019d truly wanted to, her training as a hunter as well as that under Galen having given her more than one dirty trick, but she wanted to fight with him. So she bit at his lower lip and when he responded by deepening the kiss, his arms steel around her, his tongue licking at the roof of her mouth, had to battle her body\u2019s instinctive response, the place between her thighs slick.</p><p>Wrenching away her head, she glanced down . . . and saw he\u2019d taken them high, high above Manhattan, to an altitude she couldn\u2019t yet reach on her own. Her eyes widened. \u201cNo.\u201d She glared at him. \u201cI told you I will not dance with you above the\u2014\u201d Her words ended in a scream as he flipped them so their heads pointed toward the city . . . and closed his wings.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d The wind was a roar in her ears as they plummeted like a bullet shot from the sky. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you if we survive this!\u201d</p><p>His laughter dark and dangerous and sexy, he snapped out his wings to shoot them through the narrow space between two high-rises, the early morning skies almost empty. \u201cAlmost\u201d being the operative word. \u201cHome, now!\u201d she ordered, but he took them back up into the sky, his body hard and muscled and flexing against her in ways that made her breasts swell, her entire body an erotic zone.</p><p>Baring her teeth, she gripped his hair once again and forced him to meet her gaze. \u201cHome, or we\u2019re never, ever having sex again.\u201d</p><p>An arrogant smile as he shifted her so his rigid cock pushed against her soft slickness, the clothing between them no barrier to the sexual heat. \u201cCould you resist me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush me and find out.\u201d She narrowed her eyes as they shot through the clouds and higher. Higher. And then\u2014\u201cGod damn it!\u201d Hair streaming down her back, she stared down at the skyscrapers getting closer at violent speed . . . and felt the adrenaline junkie in her take over, the dangerous pleasure a drug.</p><p>When she demanded another kiss, Raphael\u2019s response was hot and hard. But he broke the connection far too soon. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Elena had thought she\u2019d seen Raphael fly. She hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Skimming down the side of a high-rise, he flipped them backward in a spiral that had her gritting her teeth to hold back a scream of exhilaration. Just when they would\u2019ve kissed pavement, he snapped out his wings and swept back up, slicing through a gap so narrow that his wings brushed the edges of the buildings on either side, the early risers inside having no idea the Archangel of New York was giving his consort one hell of a ride.</p><p>That was nothing in comparison to the way he spiraled around the Tower, so fast she thought they\u2019d smash through the glass more than once, then punched into the sky in a burst of incredible speed. \u201cRaphael, watch out for the plane!\u201d They were on a direct collision course with a commuter jet.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s smile was lethal. Shooting past the nose of the plane with inches to spare, he brought them down light as a feather until her feet touched one of the metal wings, the thin film of precipitation slippery. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>Wobbly for a second until her boots gained traction, she said, \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Releasing her, he flew over and across to the other wing, so the plane wouldn\u2019t unbalance. The young ones sometimes do this\u2014they call it jet surfing.</p><p>Elena laughed, her arms spread to hold her balance against the roaring wind that caught at her wings. I read a report once in a newspaper, but I figured someone had had a few too many margaritas on a flight.</p><p>It\u2019s highly discouraged, but I look the other way every so often.</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d She almost slid off when the plane banked, and Raphael was there, his arms locking around her as he lifted off before she could be sucked into the engines. Strong and protective against her, he was her everything and, all at once, she\u2019d had enough playing. Kissing his throat, she whispered, \u201cNo more.\u201d</p><p>No response, but less than a minute of breathtaking speed later, they were in the privacy of their bedroom. Tugging off her clothes as he kissed her, Elena then pulled at his own until he got rid of the impediments to her touch, his body heat rough against her own. Hushed whispers and hungry caresses, their language that of lovers who know each other\u2019s every pleasure point, they moved together with raw intimacy.</p><p>Holding himself inside her toward the end, his thickness stretching her flesh, Raphael held her gaze. \u201cEternity would mean nothing without you. For no power on this earth would I trade my Elena.\u201d</p><p>Heart splintering at the piercing tenderness of his words, she touched trembling fingers to his lips and hoped his choice wouldn\u2019t doom him, this man whom she loved until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>With the donor blood coming into Blood-for-Less being tested around the clock, they had a hit on the tainted donor at three the following morning. Getting out of bed, Elena was dressed and at the blood caf\u00e9 within fifteen minutes, Raphael by her side. He hadn\u2019t slept, having escorted a fuming but compliant Michaela out of the territory, then returned to speak to Galen and Venom via a visual link to the Refuge.</p><p>Landing at the back of Blood-for-Less so as not to alarm its customers, they met Marcia in the shadows. When the woman couldn\u2019t get a word out at the sight of Raphael, her fear so potent that Elena saw Raphael\u2019s expression alter in subtle anger, she took over the questioning.</p><p>She\u2019s probably never been near an archangel. Cut her a break.</p><p>It\u2019s not Ms. Blue who is the target of my anger. My angels are instructed to be brutal if necessary to keep their vampires under control, but this one\u2019s record is clean.</p><p>Elena hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d checked Marcia\u2019s file. You think she was abused? Given the violence and cruelty she\u2019d seen in the immortal world, she hadn\u2019t thought vamps doing their hundred had any rights. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damaging a useful tool until it\u2019s too fragile to function is a waste, was the coldly practical answer. It seems I may need to remind certain angels of that fact.</p><p>Sensing that Marcia was failing in her attempt to force words out through her terror, Elena motioned for Raphael to disappear farther back into the shadows and caught his raised eyebrow before he complied. I\u2019ve got a theory\u2014if she can\u2019t see you, she can pretend you\u2019re not here.</p><p>It seemed to work.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had only two other donors in the time since the tainted donor, and the Tower is testing their blood now,\u201d Marcia said in response to her question, the vampire\u2019s eyes turned scrupulously away from the shadows that swathed Raphael.</p><p>\u201cSurveillance images?\u201d</p><p>Proving her intelligence and preparedness, Marcia held out a photograph of a thin young woman with stringy brown hair. \u201cShe has the blood that\u2019s been marked as bad by Tower personnel.\u201d The image shook as her fingers began to tremble.</p><p>Elena took it before it dropped to the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>Immediately hiding her hands behind her back, Marcia nodded. \u201cI marked the time of each donation and printed out a still from the surveillance footage as soon as the donor left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything else we need to know?\u201d</p><p>Marcia swallowed, but got the words out. \u201cI take sick donors all the time\u2014they often need the money, and blood\u2019s blood. Usually.\u201d Sweat beading on her brow. \u201cBut she looked half-dead\u2014much sicker than the last time I remember seeing her.\u201d</p><p>It was possible the carrier wasn\u2019t a true carrier, simply someone who could withstand the effects of the infection for longer. \u201cCan you pinpoint the time of her previous donation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am truly sorry, Consort.\u201d Marcia\u2019s teeth began to chatter. \u201cWe a-allow anonymous donations so all I can say is that it was with-with-within the l-l-last week.\u201d</p><p>Elena sent the vampire back into her caf\u00e9 before she had a fear-induced heart attack, then turned to Raphael. \u201cI hope you terrify the fucker who did this to her, or I\u2019ll find him and personally cut off his balls after I beat him bloody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent punishment. Be assured it\u2019ll be carried out.\u201d</p> <p>Passing the stills to Raphael without any feelings of remorse at the sentence she\u2019d just passed, she set aside her simmering anger and, after checking to make sure the area was clear, went over to the donor doorway. It was a carnival of scents, not unexpected given the number of vamps who no doubt moved in and around the building\u2014the real problem was that the tainted donor was human and Elena was a bloodhound attuned to vampires.</p><p>On the other hand, she\u2019d sensed the presence of the disease in the drawn blood, so perhaps the carrier\u2019s blood chemistry had altered enough to highlight her to Elena\u2019s nose.</p><p>This Marcia is indeed a valuable tool, came Raphael\u2019s voice into her mind. She e-mailed the photo to the Tower as soon as the alarm was sounded and Aodhan is following up on it. Ransom Winterwolf, however, may have the better contacts when it comes to the humans and vampires who frequent this area.</p><p>Elena stopped what she was doing to meet the painful blue of his eyes, extraordinarily pure, extraordinarily lethal. If I bring Ransom into this, she said, keeping the conversation on the mental level to avoid it being caught by the surveillance equipment, and he ends up with information you can\u2019t permit a mortal to have, you\u2019ll wipe his mind.</p><p>You know our laws, Elena.</p><p>Exactly. She thought of Illium\u2019s punishment and knew she couldn\u2019t ask special favors for Ransom. Raphael had already gone far beyond what could be expected of him when he\u2019d permitted Sara into the Refuge. If Elena wanted to protect her friends, she was the one who had to put up the boundary walls . . . even if it meant they\u2019d stop being a part of her life. Better that painful rupture than to watch them be treated as puppets by the immortals. Knowing those laws is why I won\u2019t bring Ransom into this.</p><p>You\u2019d let innocent vampires die?</p><p>That isn\u2019t fair. Stepping up until they were toe to toe, she stood her ground. Ransom\u2019s life is worth as much as that of any vampire\u2014and I won\u2019t be involved in stealing any part of it from him.</p> <p>Some of the vampires who may yet die will be friends of his. The wild wind, the dark sea, crashing into her mind. Do you believe he\u2019d protect his own life at the cost of theirs?</p><p>She knew Ransom, how loyal he was, how he\u2019d bleed for others, but she was cut from the same cloth. You wouldn\u2019t know about his connections if it wasn\u2019t for me, so this decision is mine. And I won\u2019t bring him in.</p><p>Elena, my city is under a stealthy attack. Raphael\u2019s tone was a blade, his face coolly expressionless in a way that made her want to push at him until he dropped the mask. I can\u2019t allow you to protect a friend at the cost of losing my territory.</p><p>Is that a threat you\u2019ll go over my head? Aware her temper had been hair-trigger of late, she tried to maintain her grip on it. You\u2019d make me an accomplice in the betrayal of a friend? It was a breach of trust she\u2019d never expected. What if it was one of your Seven?</p><p>He isn\u2019t. He\u2019s a mere mortal.</p><p>17</p><p>The cold response was an emotional slap, another reminder that when push came to shove, mortals remained disposable to Raphael.</p><p>Fine, she said, conscious that something precious was about to break between them, a fracture that could never be repaired. You do what you like, but you have to know I\u2019ll never again trust you the same way.</p><p>A faint glow, his wings white fire in the darkness. Emotional blackmail?</p><p>No. No anger now, simply a spiraling sense of incipient loss that made her chest hurt, her jaw clenched so hard that pain shot up her temples. I\u2019m fighting to retain my sense of honor, of loyalty. If I can\u2019t trust you not to abuse the information I give you about my friends, how can you ask me to tell you anything?</p><p>Our conversation isn\u2019t over. Hauling his consort bodily around when she turned back to the donor station, Raphael extended his glamour to cover her.</p><p>What else is there to say? A hardness in her eyes that he hadn\u2019t seen since the very beginning of their courtship. A mere mortal, isn\u2019t that your final judgment?</p><p>No one could push him to the edge faster than Elena, slamming right through centuries of unyielding control. I allowed Sara into the Refuge. It had been an act that went against their most deeply held laws, permitted only because he took full responsibility for Sara\u2019s silence. The others believe I erased her memories. Only for you did I leave her mind untouched.</p><p>That\u2019s supposed to make me grateful forever? A red flush high on her cheekbones, the ring of silver around her irises glittering against the paler gray. Love doesn\u2019t work like that.</p><p>Yet it allows you to turn your back after throwing such words at me? A memory of the question she\u2019d asked that had sent him hunting Jeffrey, a reminder of the poison that continued to act on her, years after it had been introduced into her life.</p><p>He realized he couldn\u2019t allow her to remain blind to that toxic influence. I\u2019m not your father, Elena.</p><p>Her breath coming fast and shallow, she shook her head. Jeffrey has nothing to do with this.</p><p>He has everything to do with it, Raphael countered, thrusting his hands into her unbound hair as she raised her own hands to grip at his arms, as if she would shove him away. We will not go through eternity with you expecting the worst from me.</p><p>A visible flinch, but his stubborn, furious consort refused to back down. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. Her body trembling from the force of her emotions, she said, I know you, and I know how you see humans: as fireflies that live and die in a heartbeat, not worth anything.</p><p>I fell in love with a mortal! Until she was his eternity. Do you question that, too?</p><p>Her eyes widened at the enraged question. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered aloud, before returning to mental speech. Your love is the one constant in my life, but I\u2019m so afraid of what immortality will demand from us, what it\u2019ll steal.</p><p>It can take nothing we do not give.</p><p>Then you need to listen to me. Stubbornness again, her expression that of the warrior she was, one who\u2019d fight to the death to protect those who had earned her loyalty. My friends, they\u2019re my family. I need to be able to protect them\u2014if you take that away from me, you may as well cut out my heart.</p><p>It had been an age since he\u2019d seen mortals as she did, since he\u2019d formed a friendship with a simple farmer who\u2019d come to be a man he trusted not only with his life, but with Elena\u2019s. I have forgotten, it seems, that I, too, once had a human friend I wished to protect. He\u2019d failed, Dmitri\u2019s life torn asunder\u2014and the failing had marked Raphael, too, changed him in ways that could never be undone.</p><p>Then you understand. Elena\u2019s hair shone white in the harsh light that lit up the donor doorway. It\u2019s not safe for my friends to be drawn deeper into the immortal world. Not unless you trust them to keep\u2014</p><p>No. Our laws exist for a reason. And it wasn\u2019t simply because angels thought humans beneath their notice. The games immortals play would break mortals in a heartbeat.</p><p>Silence from his consort, followed by a simple, resolute declaration. Then he can\u2019t be here.</p><p>He can\u2019t be here, Raphael agreed, his mind playing back the memory of the day he\u2019d found Dmitri gripping a blood-drenched knife, his chest a ruin, the other man having attempted to carve out his heart in an attempt to join his murdered family.</p><p>Raphael would never forget Dmitri\u2019s grief and the horror that had preceded it . . . and he would not have Elena carry such memories for all eternity. I will not force you to drag your friends into our world.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Emotionally shaken as a result of an argument she knew had drawn a bright line in the sand of the life she was building with her archangel, their relationship coming out of it stronger rather than fatally damaged, Elena returned to the task of untangling the complicated murk of scents around the donor door.</p><p>Even so focused, she couldn\u2019t forget what Raphael had said: We will not go through eternity with you expecting the worst from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d argued against his perception, but now found herself considering if it was true. Had her father scarred her so badly as a child? No, it was far more complicated than that. \u201cThe greatest breach of trust,\u201d she found herself saying softly, having moved away from the area under surveillance, \u201cwas my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>His eyes told her he knew her meaning. Understood the agony that had shredded her as she stood mute beside Marguerite\u2019s grave, Beth\u2019s tiny hand clasped in hers. Jeffrey had been behind them, his hands on their shoulders, his body their rock, strong and there.</p><p>\u201cI was so angry at him for not stopping her.\u201d Catching a suspicious concentration of scent, she went down into a crouch, her wings on the cold asphalt. \u201cAfter the funeral, I struck out at him, screaming that it was his fault when I knew it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Her mother hadn\u2019t survived Slater Patalis and what he\u2019d done to her two oldest babies, no matter if her body had made it out alive.</p> <p>\u201cYou were a child.\u201d</p><p>Elena shook her head at Raphael\u2019s response. \u201cI was old enough to know better, but you know what? Jeffrey never, not once, argued against my irrational accusations. Because he blamed himself, too.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought about those first days after her mother\u2019s suicide for years, only what came after, when Jeffrey\u2019s broken heart had translated into a cold rage that had him erasing Marguerite from the house and their lives. \u201cEvery time I think I understand what we are\u2014Jeffrey and I\u2014I discover another facet and suddenly it\u2019s not so sim\u2014\u201d</p><p>Putrid rot, the miasma of death, an undertone of burnt flesh.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something here.\u201d Her senses hummed. \u201cIt\u2019s faint, hard for me to sink my teeth into even though I can sense each of the notes.\u201d Ugly, fetid, unnatural. \u201cPossibly because it\u2019s from a human.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you follow it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep watch from above.\u201d Walking a short distance away so as not to disturb the scents, he took off and was lost behind a veil of glamour.</p><p>It took painstaking patience to tug on that one faint thread among the dozens that blanketed the area. Blood-for-Less might be on the fringe of the Vampire Quarter, but it apparently got plenty of business\u2014unlike on her previous visit, Elena had heard the heavy murmur of voices from within that indicated Marcia had a full house tonight.</p><p>The deeper she got into the Quarter, the more heavily trafficked it became, the central section a favorite among hip young vamps\u2014and suburbanites who wanted to walk on the wild side without going into the more dangerous parts of town. Leggy models, mortal and immortal, were as ubiquitous a part of the landscape as slickly dressed vampires on the prowl, everyone congregating around the clubs that opened their doors after nightfall.</p><p>No one dared get in her way.</p> <p>Keeping her wings folded tight to her back, she made sure her blades were in full view as she tracked. Not that she was afraid of being tackled by a fashionista vamp, she thought with an inward snort. Then again, stilettos were fucking lethal weapons as far as she was concerned.</p><p>Ten more minutes of meticulous tracking and she passed out of the central zone and into the Flesh Market. Most tourist guidebooks told visitors to \u201cexercise extreme caution\u201d in this part of the Quarter. Because while the vamps in this area were as stylishly dressed and as urbane, they were older, with darker appetites. Club Masque, up ahead, had a sign at the top of the mortal queue that said, Fresh Meat.</p><p>And still the young and nubile and stupid lined up.</p><p>Raphael, she said after another block, the stores here shut up for the night and empty of traffic except for a couple who crossed the street when they saw her and a drug dealer who suddenly had urgent business elsewhere. I need to go down this passageway. It wasn\u2019t quite an alley, but according to what she could see with her acute night vision, it was close enough for the homeless.</p><p>I have you in my sights.</p><p>Squeezing her wings as tight to her back as she could manage, she picked her way through the cardboard castles that housed the flotsam and jetsam of the city. They weren\u2019t exclusively human. Vampires could descend into this shadow life just like their mortal counterparts\u2014all it took was an addiction to something. Certain enterprising bloodsuckers had created recreational drugs that worked on those of their kind, though apparently the high didn\u2019t last long enough for most to bother.</p><p>More in vogue were \u201choney\u201d feeds, where a human donor would get high on certain drugs then allow the vamp to feed. Vampiric biology soon neutralized the drugs, but not fast enough to totally negate the pleasure\u2014and sex, of course, was also often on the same menu. All for a price. Then there was gambling, and the sadder cases where an individual, vamp or human, lost the struggle with personal demons no one else could see.</p><p>\u201cHunter.\u201d The rasping whisper came from a shriveled-up old man tucked up inside a cardboard box fashioned into a home, the \u201ccurtains\u201d open to reveal his reddened eyes and the brown-paper-bagged bottle in his hands.</p> <p>Startled that he\u2019d focused on what marked her as Guild, rather than the wings, Elena paused, a sick feeling in her stomach as her eyes adjusted enough to make out the knife scars on his hands. No hunter was ever left behind by his or her brethren . . . but some chose to walk out into the darkness and never return.</p><p>\u201cHunter,\u201d she replied, giving back the same respect he\u2019d offered her. \u201cThe Guild is always open to you.\u201d All hunters paid a percentage of their income to the Guild; one of the reasons why was so the Guild could provide care should a hunter be physically or mentally incapacitated. \u201cI can make the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it out here.\u201d</p><p>Elena had no way of knowing what he\u2019d survived, the reasons for his choices, so she made no judgment. \u201cAre you here always?\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask one of the Guild patrols to come by with some food.\u201d They\u2019d nudge him into better sleeping quarters, too, when the snow started to fall. \u201cI can ask them to bring along a strong, basic tent for you.\u201d Nothing that would make him a target for thieves. \u201cIs that all right?\u201d</p><p>A long pause, his eyes seeming to judge her before he said, \u201cLong as they bring enough for two.\u201d His gaze went to another cardboard enterprise a few feet over and across the narrow passageway. \u201cGot to watch each other\u2019s backs. It\u2019s what we do.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded. \u201cStay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunt well.\u201d</p><p>Continuing down into the pitch-blackness of the passage until it spit her out the other end, Elena found herself in an enclosed parking lot behind an Asian restaurant; she\u2019d hit the edge of Chinatown. A single yellow streetlamp doused the area in an anemic glow, creating pools of shadow as thick as liquid, the dark green Dumpsters a silent menace.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Following the suspicious scent to a broken part of the fence, she managed to get through the chain link without snagging her feathers. The scent was cleaner now, no longer overwhelmed by those of vampires, this area with its cheap and tasty restaurants a mortal haunt, though she knew a couple of angels who were regulars. The restaurants were closed up for the night, all except for a twenty-four-hour noodle place where a worker pushed a mop around while bopping to the music in his headphones.</p><p>A bedraggled mutt kept company with her for a block before being seduced by an overflowing Dumpster, though she saw the rotting carcass of more than one dead bird lying in the nooks and crannies. No one had bothered to clean them up here as they had in the restaurant area, and even the feral cats and dogs knew to steer clear of that festering meat.</p><p>When she looked around and saw the scaffolding, she realized the reason for the lack of care\u2014no one was currently residing or doing business on this street, and from the looks of things, no construction workers had been by for a few days, either. Permit or money problems, probably.</p><p>A sudden end to the scent, there one second, gone the next.</p><p>Backing up, she realized the individual she was tracking had gone up the steps of one of the scaffolded buildings. Looks like our carrier is squatting. No security, so it wouldn\u2019t be hard.</p><p>Is she present within?</p><p>Unless there\u2019s a back entrance.</p><p>Wait. A pause before Raphael said, The back entrance is inaccessible.</p><p>Then she\u2019s inside. I found one recent scent trail, with an older one beneath, so my take is, she went out to sell her blood and came straight back.</p><p>A sudden wind was the only sign that Raphael had landed on the street. Be careful on the steps, she said, having returned to the door. Looks like the target went through that window. Pushed up, the glass missing, it would\u2019ve been just within reach if someone climbed up onto part of the scaffolding. We\u2019ll need your manly muscles to get in. If that\u2019s not beneath Your Archangelness.</p><p>His kiss took her by surprise, her mind scrambling to understand the fact that she was being deliciously taken by a man she couldn\u2019t see. Releasing her before she\u2019d gotten her head around it, he began to pry off the boards that barred the front door, doing so with an ease that made it appear the boards were just sitting there.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, the door was open.</p><p>18</p><p>Narrow, but we can get in if we angle our bodies. I\u2019ll enter first.</p><p>I\u2019m the hunter, Elena reminded him. I should go first.</p><p>Of course you may go first. When I am dead.</p><p>Scowling at that statement delivered in an eminently reasonable tone that had fooled her into thinking he was going to agree, she pulled out her crossbow. Go. We\u2019ll argue about your autocratic tendencies later.</p><p>I look forward to it.</p><p>Since he\u2019d dropped the glamour upon entering, his wings filled her vision until they came out into a more open area of what looked like a private residence, though it might well have been a combined business/home, the lower-floor open plan enough to have functioned as a retail shop.</p><p>Upstairs, she said, the scent trail a pulsing beacon.</p><p>You do not wish to clear this floor?</p><p>It\u2019s only the dead down here. More than a few days, from the degradation of the disease smell. The bodies hadn\u2019t rotted, likely because the house was as cold as a fridge, but it was no doubt the same vampire pox. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her first victims?</p><p>Maybe her test subjects. Probably junkie vamps desperate for a honey feed\u2014wouldn\u2019t take much to seduce one if she looked strung out herself. Perfect meal.</p><p>Again, Raphael went ahead and, though they tried to be quiet, the stairs were old, creaked and groaned no matter what. However, there was no sign their target had heard anything, even when Elena almost fell through a weakened board and Raphael jerked her to safety. There was, in fact, no sign of life at all.</p> <p>You\u2019re certain she is here?</p><p>Yes. Her scent is rich and fresh. She met his eyes. I can\u2019t tell if she\u2019s dead or just sick, but the scent of the disease is very strong to my senses, especially considering her mortality.</p><p>Raphael stepped forward to look inside the doorway she indicated, while she swept quickly down to check the other room, make sure it was empty. His expression when she turned to face him told her all she needed to know.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Walking into the room, she halted beside an old bed that looked like it had been forgotten when the house was stripped. In it lay their prey, her eyes wide open and unseeing, the exposed parts of her pasty skin bubbled with small sores that echoed the more virulent ones on the bodies of the other victims.</p><p>\u201cA carrier who can only last a short time,\u201d Raphael said, taking in the scene with a clinical eye. \u201cInefficient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right and this is an attack against the city by one of the Cadre\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014then it could be he or she does not have the strength to immunize the carriers.\u201d Raphael nodded. \u201cAll the Cascade-born abilities appear to be limited in terms of strength as yet.\u201d</p><p>Elena eyeballed the body, but could find no signs that the woman had been a junkie who might herself have been somehow infected, perhaps by another individual who was the actual carrier. They\u2019d have to wait till the autopsy to get a definitive answer. Certain that Raphael had already contacted Keir, she took a good look around the room.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She restrained the urge to kick at a mildewed wall, the mildew an improvement on the giant floral wallpaper. \u201cThere is absolutely nothing here that tells us who she was or where she came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsurprising. Her archangel would not want her to give herself away.\u201d</p><p>Elena had to agree with Raphael\u2019s unspoken conclusion that the woman must\u2019ve volunteered for her task, because, while she looked pitiful now, a broken doll, she\u2019d carried and disseminated death, pumping poison from her body each time she sold her blood. The dead vampires Elena had sensed downstairs made it inarguable the woman had known exactly what it was she was selling.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Midday, and Keir confirmed the disease in the girl\u2019s body was identical to that found in the other victims. \u201cBut she had it far longer,\u201d the healer said, old eyes tired in that beautiful face that could\u2019ve been of a boy on the brink of manhood. \u201cAt least two weeks\u2014which makes her either the first victim or the carrier.\u201d</p><p>Elena kept her ear to the ground for any other reports of vampires dead of mysterious circumstances. Nothing. Not for the four days that followed their discovery of the girl it was becoming more and more certain had been the sole carrier. Finally, on the fifth day, they cleared Blood-for-Less for renewed use of donor blood, with continuing spot checks just to be certain.</p><p>\u201cIs there any way we can wriggle out of this ball?\u201d she said to Raphael on the eve of their journey to Amanat, the two of them in bed after an unexpectedly playful loving that had flowed on from a sparring session where they\u2019d worked out the tension that had had them in its clawlike grip for days, as they waited for the other shoe to drop . . . only for the ordinary rhythm of life to descend upon the city.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t peace\u2014it was New York\u2014but it certainly wasn\u2019t a war. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to leave the city.\u201d Neither did she, an itch on the back of her neck that said, this odd lull aside, the Falling and the disease had only been the beginning.</p><p>\u201cTo not attend,\u201d Raphael said, his wing warm and strong under her body, his voice exquisitely familiar in the moonless dark, \u201cwould be seen as a sign of distrust in Illium, Aodhan, and the squadrons that guard the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Comforted by the steady beat of his heart, she drew lazy designs on the muscled heat of his chest. \u201cWill that matter if the city is attacked by frothing-at-the-mouth reborn while we\u2019re eating bonbons in Amanat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have such a vivid way of putting things, hbeebti.\u201d His fingers stroking the sensitive inner edges of her wings, the act an absent one that made her deeply happy in a way she didn\u2019t consciously understand. \u201cBut no hordes will descend upon the city during the span of the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Stretching out her wings in a silent request, she sighed as he stroked outward. \u201cYou sound confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one behind these attacks is no doubt Cadre. No other angel could\u2019ve gained such abilities even in the Cascade.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded, having seen Jessamy\u2019s research on the results of the last Cascade. Any information was fragmented at best, but the historian had been able to tentatively confirm Caliane\u2019s recollection that it was only the archangels who\u2019d been fundamentally altered. \u201cI get your point,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever it is, is caught in the same trap.\u201d</p><p>Raphael moved her hair aside to massage her nape, his other hand folded behind his head. \u201cHe or she must attend the ball or it\u2019ll not only be an insult to the sole Ancient awake in the world, but a sign the archangel in question does not trust those he would\u2019ve otherwise left in charge. Then there is the other factor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d Bones having melted as a result of the way he was touching her, she revved up her brain and struggled up onto her elbow so she could see his expression as she tested her understanding of how archangels saw the world. \u201cIt would be considered extremely bad manners,\u201d she said in the frigid tones of some of the stiffer old angels, \u201cto attack a city while its archangel was at a ball thrown by an Ancient. Why, really, you might as well have been brought up by mortals, if you\u2019re going to act that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsurd, is it not?\u201d Laugher in the intoxicating blue, his hand a possessive weight on her lower back. \u201cYet those rules of Guesthood are part of what keeps the world stable. Any archangel so ill-mannered as to step outside them in such an unspeakable fashion would find themselves ostracized. Eternity is a long time to be friendless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that way,\u201d Elena said, leaning down to steal a kiss just because she could, \u201cit\u2019s not absurd but totally rational. How else would anyone ever have a party, with the way certain archangels are always trying to backstab others.\u201d</p><p>A smile curving his mouth, her archangel nodded. \u201cEven Lijuan couldn\u2019t bear such a shunning. She might be able to compel obedience through brute force, but she\u2019d lose the respect that is as much her lifeblood as power.\u201d Fingers idly caressing the lower curves of her body. \u201cCan you guess the true irony of this particular situation?\u201d</p><p>Screwing up her face, she was about to say no when it hit. Laughing so hard she had to wait until she could catch her breath enough to shape words, she said, \u201cLijuan isn\u2019t invited\u201d\u2014not after trying to murder Caliane and her son\u2014\u201cbut she\u2019s such a stickler for the old ways, the others know they\u2019ll have her on their ass if they break the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s an Angelic Etiquette handbook some\u2014\u201d Breaking off, she touched her fingers to Raphael\u2019s right temple.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Incisive intelligence in his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She switched on the lamps that bathed the top half of the bed in a gentle light. Leaning back down, she went close to Raphael\u2019s face, rubbed her thumb over the spot, his hair brushing against her fingertips. \u201cThere\u2019s something on your skin.\u201d Unable to let it go, she got out of bed to grab a wet facecloth.</p><p>Raphael was in the bathroom doorway when she turned from the sink. Asking him to bend down so she could wipe at the tiny speck, she tried twice, the second time with a dab of soap on the cloth in case he\u2019d somehow been touched by the tip of a permanent black marker . . . except even as the thought crossed her mind, she knew she would\u2019ve noticed it earlier.</p><p>The speck hadn\u2019t been there before, and now\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s not coming off.\u201d Her voice sounded even, despite the horrible feeling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>Shifting into the bathroom, Raphael examined his face in the mirror. Elena came up beside him, wanting to believe it had been a trick of the light. It hadn\u2019t. So tiny, the speck would go unnoticed by most, but it shouldn\u2019t be there. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an insect bite,\u201d she began, trying not to think about dead vampires and disease.</p><p>\u201cNo, we heal too fast for a bite to have any impact.\u201d Expression grim, he turned to her. \u201cCan you see it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s gone.\u201d Crushing relief. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is still there,\u201d he said, and the relief curdled. \u201cI\u2019ve concealed it using the barest hint of glamour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Keir was still here.\u201d The healer had had to return to the Refuge to deal with other matters, would meet them again in Amanat. \u201cWhat if . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t say it, couldn\u2019t even imagine it, her horror too violent.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it is the harbinger of disease?\u201d Raphael said for her. \u201cIf it is, Keir would be unable to do anything, so telling him is a moot point. I am an archangel, Elena. We may go mad with age and time, or because of the toxin, but we do not get sick.\u201d</p><p>His blunt words forced her to face the cold, hard fact that an archangel sick was a tear in the fabric of the world.

I can\u2019t.\u201d As if she\u2019d turned a nightmare key, she heard the sound that had haunted her since the day Slater Patalis walked into her childhood home.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>There\u2019d been so much blood, her feet sliding in it to send her to the floor with bruising force.</p> <p>\u201cCome, Elena.\u201d Raphael\u2019s voice held a gentleness that told her he saw her terror, understood it. \u201cDo you think I am so weak? Such a belief is a blow to my ego indeed.\u201d</p><p>Elena tried to smile, to not permit the fear to consume her, but it raged within, born of a childhood where everyone she loved had been taken from her. Jeffrey and Beth might have survived the massacre, but they\u2019d been lost to Elena all the same. She couldn\u2019t lose Raphael, too. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The panicked thoughts ran in a loop inside her mind until it was all she was.</p><p>Then the rain-lashed sea was there, cutting through the dark clouds of memory. Reaching for Raphael with body and mind both, she drowned herself in the sheer powerful life force of the archangel who was the only man she would ever love.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Holding Elena when she finally fell into an exhausted sleep, his strong consort who had a ragged wound in her soul that had torn open with vicious force tonight, Raphael watched over her, standing sentinel against the darkness. And though he wasn\u2019t tired, he realized he slept when he began to dream.</p> <p>Of that forgotten field where his blood had been glistening rubies scattered on the grass, the red liquid crystallizing into faceted gemstones that fascinated the birds who were his constant companions as the sun moved across the sky and the seasons changed from spring to summer. Flowers grew around him, over him, the grass shading his face, and still he lay there, waiting to heal enough that he could make it to the Refuge.</p><p>Archangel. Archangel. Archangel.</p><p>The voices around him continued to repeat that single word until he said, \u201cSilence!\u201d in a tone no one except Elena had ever disobeyed.</p><p>The voices cut off.</p><p>Rising above the field once more, his body unbroken and of the adult he now was, that splintered, scared boy long gone, he gave a second order. \u201cShow yourselves.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>In answer came a sea of whispers, the actual words inaudible.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d</p> <p>It was unexpected, that feminine voice. And it was one so familiar, he\u2019d know it even in death, the wing that brushed over his own warrior black and vivid indigo kissed with midnight blue and the haunting shade of the sky just before dawn.</p><p>When he turned toward the sound of her voice, he saw that Elena\u2019s body was translucent beside his, the colors of her like running water. Death rubies ringed her neck, cherry-dark gemstones created of his hardened blood.</p><p>That was wrong. Elena would never wear such.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Reaching up, she tore off the necklace with a shudder, the blood gemstones falling soundlessly to the green, green grass. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe field where I fought my mother.\u201d He took her hand, and it was warm, alive, though she remained formed of glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Looking through her eyes as the dawn sun played over the verdant grass, bathing the trees in a golden glow and highlighting the flowers he\u2019d watched bud, then bloom, he saw the truth of her words, but for him it remained\u2014would always remain\u2014a place of pain and death and loss.</p><p>\u201cMy mother walked away, her feet crushing the flowers, as the insects licked at my blood.\u201d The tiny creatures had died, his blood too rich. Then had come the birds, curious about this winged being on the ground. \u201cThe birds sat with me for hours, brought me berries as if I were a fledgling fallen out of the nest.\u201d He\u2019d forgotten that under the weight of the horror. \u201cI couldn\u2019t eat for many days, my jaw and facial bones in splinters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a very sad place.\u201d A single tear rolling down his consort\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou should wake up now.\u201d</p><p>His lashes lifted to see the skylight above their bed, the moonless sky luminous with stars, but that wasn\u2019t what he wanted in his sight. Turning, he wiped away the tear that marked Elena\u2019s golden skin as she lay with her eyes open beside him, and he thought he should be surprised that so young an angel had managed to invade the dream of an archangel\u2014but this was his hunter, who had never done what she should.</p><p>\u201cYou were in my dream.\u201d</p><p>She spread her wing so it covered him, her hand on his shoulder. As if she would protect him. \u201cIt was sad and terrible and beautiful, what I saw in you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like that the day I fought my mother. Sad and terrible . . . and beautiful. She sang to me in the sky, did I tell you?\u201d</p><p>A shake of his consort\u2019s head, her hair wild silk under his hand.</p><p>\u201cHer voice is a gift and a weapon, a sound so pure it can break a heart or heal it.\u201d He\u2019d seen angels fall to their knees, overcome with the wonder of Caliane\u2019s song, their eyes shining wet. \u201cThat day, she sang a song she used to sing to me in childhood and I wanted to forget the reason I had tracked her.\u201d</p><p>For that haunting fragment of time, he\u2019d seen not the monster Caliane had become, but the mother who had kissed away his childhood hurts. \u201cThe sky fractured with wonder . . . then it fractured with power.\u201d It had been an uneven battle from the start, the child not yet full-grown against an Ancient.</p><p>Elena pressed her lips to his biceps, her body a warm kiss against his own. \u201cThe whispers in your dream, did you hear them as you fought your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was alone with Caliane.\u201d Then simply alone.</p><p>\u201cI wonder who they are?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t remind her it had been but a dream, for that would\u2019ve been a lie when he felt the strangeness of it in his blood. \u201cSleep, Elena. We have a long journey ahead.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak, but he knew she didn\u2019t sleep, either, not until dawn touched the horizon. And he understood she continued to fence with the bone-chilling fear he\u2019d seen in her eyes as she stood in the bathroom attempting to wipe away a spot of dirt that couldn\u2019t be erased. It was a fear sad and terrible in what it demanded from her . . . and beautiful in what it said of who he was to her.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The first thought in Elena\u2019s mind when she woke was of the speck on Raphael\u2019s temple, fear a dull gnawing in her heart. Shoving the ugly feeling into a tiny corner where it didn\u2019t threaten to paralyze her, she concentrated on making a mental list of Raphael\u2019s strengths. He\u2019d executed an archangel millennia older and Made an angel, for Christ\u2019s sake\u2014no disease would ever get the better of him.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight,\u201d she muttered to herself as she sat in the luxurious cabin of Raphael\u2019s private jet, using her silent conclusion as a shield against the helplessness that had regressed her back to the ten-year-old she\u2019d once been, scared and bloody and alone with a monster.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something, hbeebti?\u201d</p><p>It was a gentle question\u2014he\u2019d been careful with her all morning and, given the way she\u2019d freaked out the night before, she couldn\u2019t exactly complain, but it was time to let her archangel know she\u2019d patched up the wounds. \u201cEvery time I board this thing,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m reminded of how filthy rich you are.\u201d Raphael could\u2019ve completed the journey on the wing without problems, but her flight endurance was pitiful yet. \u201cIt\u2019s like a flying mini-Tower.\u201d</p><p>An amused look, no hint of the awful sadness she\u2019d sensed in him as they hovered over the field where he\u2019d lain broken and bloodied. \u201cWould you like me to go through that?\u201d He nodded at the folder in front of her that held Marcia Blue\u2019s financial statement and business plan.</p><p>Handing it over because she had no idea what half of it meant and wasn\u2019t too proud to admit it, she said, \u201cI, too, am on the path to becoming filthy rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith such a soft heart as yours\u201d\u2014he opened the file\u2014\u201cit\u2019ll be a challenge for me to ensure you do not end up penniless.\u201d</p><p>Elena squirmed in her deliciously comfortable seat. \u201cOkay, okay, so I felt sorry for her. At least I asked for the business info\u2014that should get me some credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>Leaving him to the documents, she hooked her phone into the jet\u2019s high-tech communications network and made a visual call to Sam, the sweet, funny little boy who\u2019d become her friend and guide while she\u2019d been in the Refuge. He told her about his recent adventures, made her promise to hold a position in her Guard for him until he was \u201cgrowed up,\u201d and showed her the present he was secretly making for his mother.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d she said toward the end, \u201cdoes Galen really teach you flights skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d A strong nod. \u201cHe\u2019s strict but not in a mean way. We like him.\u201d Smiling, he proceeded to regale her with the story of his last lesson with Raphael\u2019s weapons-master\u2014where Galen had actually ended up laughing at the antics of his baby squadron.</p><p>By the time the call ended, Elena was conscious that she\u2019d only ever glimpsed one narrow aspect of Galen\u2019s personality. \u201cYour weapons-master appears to have an actual, beating heart,\u201d she said to Raphael. \u201cWho knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI concede that point.\u201d Logging in to check her e-mails as Raphael continued to read over the file, she saw one from Sara asking her opinion on an antique weapon Sara was considering getting Deacon as an anniversary gift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d just finished shooting her best friend a reply when a new e-mail popped into her in-box. It was from Aodhan, the subject line making Elena\u2019s fingers clench convulsively around the phone and her mind hurtle two months into the past.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Elena swallowed, the paper crinkling in her hand the only sound as she stood in front of the elevator that would drop her down into the Cellars, the protected area under Guild HQ. She\u2019d taken advantage of the underground safe house when she\u2019d slit Dmitri\u2019s throat during the hunt that had forever altered the course of her life\u2014though, in her defense, he had provoked the action.</p> <p>It was Vivek, the hunter who ran the Cellars, who\u2019d given her a gun meant to injure an angel long enough to give a mortal a chance to run, to escape. That gun had done far more, Raphael\u2019s blood pooling on the broken sheet of glass that had been the outer wall of her apartment.</p><p>\u201cDo it, Ellie,\u201d she ordered, knowing the trip through memory lane was nothing but procrastination at its finest.</p><p>Reaching out, she stabbed the button to summon the elevator and, when the doors opened, input the special code on the hidden auxiliary touchpad so the cage would move downward, rather than up into Guild HQ. That code changed on a daily basis and since she\u2019d contacted Vivek directly to get it, he was expecting her.</p><p>\u201cI am so whupping your ass today,\u201d he\u2019d predicted, in reference to their continuing Scrabble battle.</p><p>They\u2019d always played a game or two anytime Elena was in town for more than twenty-four hours. Now that she was based in New York, she made it a point to come by at least once a week\u2014because Vivek wouldn\u2019t come to her. He was capable of it, his wheelchair state-of-the-art, but hunter-born like her, Vivek found it difficult to be outside when he couldn\u2019t exercise his hunting abilities. The constant bombardment of vampiric scents scraped his senses raw, left him bleeding on the inside.</p> <p>Exiting the elevator into the pitch-black area under the building, she navigated it without turning on the small flashlight she had in one of the pockets of her cargo pants. It had taken her some time to find a workable pathway after she\u2019d returned to the city with wings, but she now moved through the darkness with confidence, easily avoiding the heavy pillars that were the foundations of the building.</p><p>Reaching the scarred and graffitied metal door meant to discourage any intruder who got this far, she coded herself in using another concealed keypad, then put her eye to the retinal scanner. The door slid open seconds later, inviting her into a solid metal cubicle where she was scanned three ways to Sunday in a new layer of security, her weapons noted.</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d Vivek had told her, the first time she\u2019d visited after the upgrade, \u201cif you turn out to be a bad guy, I can gas you, and bye-bye, Evil Elena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she\u2019d said at the time, thinking about just how much trust they put in Vivek down here\u2014all of them dead certain that trust would never be broken. He might be occasionally petty, but Vivek was nothing if not loyal to the Guild.</p><p>When the doors opened to release her from the steel cubicle, she knew it hadn\u2019t been an automatic action; Vivek personally cleared all incoming and outgoing traffic.</p><p>\u201cOhayo\u02c9, Vivek,\u201d she said to the air.</p> <p>\u201cGozaimasu, Elena.\u201d A pause. \u201cSeriously? That one was so easy even Ransom would\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him you said that.\u201d She waited patiently as she was scanned a second time, wondering what other tricks he had up his sleeve; she wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have had automatic gun ports built into the walls.</p><p>\u201cHey, I think I might have to double-check your identity.\u201d Vivek\u2019s voice came out strong and resonant through the speakers. \u201cYou usually start bitching about how long the scan takes the second after you walk in.\u201d</p><p>Fingers tightening on the piece of paper she\u2019d crushed beyond any hope of repair, she rolled her eyes. \u201cNext time you complain about the bitching, I\u2019m going to remind you of this little conversation.\u201d</p><p>A chest-deep laugh, an unexpected sound when it came to the often moody hunter, before the final doors opened in front of her. She headed straight to the reinforced core from where Vivek held court, his steel hand controlling all aspects of the Cellars. That, however, was only a sideline\u2014his true job was keeping watch on anything and everything that might affect the Guild or its hunters.</p><p>Today, he buzzed her into his inner sanctum without making her jump through any further hoops. \u201cYou\u2019re in a good mood,\u201d she said, when she entered to see him grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cI just had dirty, dirty cybersex with a smoking-hot brunette from Italy. Let\u2019s hear it for intimate international relations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much information.\u201d Grabbing a chair, she swiveled it around to sit with her arms braced along the back. In front of her was the large wall-mounted screen where they most often played Scrabble, below it a sleek bank of computers, merely one set of the many that filled the core.</p> <p>\u201cI go to the trouble of getting a chair constructed to support wings,\u201d Vivek complained, \u201cand you always do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever get rid of that chair, I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Pretending to think about it, he brought up a game. \u201cI hope you have tissues\u2014because I plan to make you cry like a widdle baby.\u201d</p><p>He was in such a good mood, she thought again. Vivek was often sarcastic, sometimes sulky, more than a few times curt, but truly happy? It was an uncommon thing. She didn\u2019t want to change the tone of this conversation, wanted to leave him as happy as she\u2019d found him.</p><p>\u201cYou want the first move?\u201d he asked, after the computer allocated their letters.</p><p>Shaking her head and knowing a delay would only make this more difficult, she reached out to put her hand over the one on the arm of his wheelchair, though she was conscious he couldn\u2019t feel the contact. He saw it, though, curiosity alive in those dark brown eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a question to ask you.\u201d Shifting her hand from his, she used it to grip her chairback. \u201cIt\u2019s a question that might piss you off. If it does, I\u2019m sorry\u2014but know I\u2019m only asking because I love you.\u201d</p><p>Smile fading, he turned his wheelchair around to face her. When he didn\u2019t say anything, just waited, she thought about simply showing him the crushed paper in her other hand, but that would be a cowardly act, not worthy of their friendship. \u201cIf you were a viable Candidate,\u201d she said into a silence underwritten with the quiet hum of Vivek\u2019s computers, \u201cwould you want to become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>Blinking quickly, he swiveled back to the game. \u201cYour move.\u201d</p><p>Elena made that move on autopilot, somehow ending up with a triple word score. Where her luck would\u2019ve normally made Vivek scowl and promise retaliation, today, he made a three-letter word that wouldn\u2019t have challenged a seven-year-old. In return, she added four letters to the board to deliberately create a nonexistent word\u2014and waited for Vivek to challenge her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Five moves later, he said, \u201cYou\u2019d never have asked me that question unless you already knew I was a viable Candidate.\u201d</p><p>20</p><p>Elena gave a jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get my blood to do the test?\u201d Vivek supplied his own answer before she could. \u201cGuild physical, right?\u201d Glancing at her, he turned the chair around again. \u201cDo you think I need to be fixed?\u201d</p><p>She heard the bitterness, knew she had to face it head-on if they were to go forward as friends. \u201cI think you\u2019re unhappy deep inside.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the time to pull her punches. \u201cYou\u2019ve built an extraordinary life.\u201d She waved her hand to encompass the room and everything that resulted from his skills with the machines that inhabited it, said, \u201cHell, you\u2019re the reason half of us are alive. I think you\u2019re brilliant and gifted, and gorgeous, too, while we\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>Clenched jaw, the tendons stark. \u201cNo need to go overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie to my friends.\u201d Vivek was classically handsome, the bones of his face clean and sharp against brown skin that would be warm if it was touched by the sun more often. It was true he was far too thin, but his shoulders were broad, his legs long. \u201cPut on some muscle, some weight, and you\u2019ll have women eating out of your hand.\u201d She paused. \u201cIf you don\u2019t scare them off with your attitude.\u201d</p><p>A scowl, then narrowed eyes. \u201cYou trying to get me mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always more fun mad.\u201d Blowing out a breath, she locked her eyes with his. \u201cI asked for you to be tested because, amazing as you are, I know here\u201d\u2014she slammed her fist against her heart\u2014\u201cyou hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hunter-born. I know exactly what it\u2019s like to attempt to cage that instinct.\u201d She\u2019d tried so hard when she first realized how much her father hated anything to do with hunting. \u201cIt feels like being clawed to pieces from the inside out. The fact that you\u2019ve managed to stay sane? It makes you stronger than I could ever be.\u201d</p><p>Vivek snorted. \u201cYou slit a vampire\u2019s throat in broad daylight, shot an archangel, and lived to tell the tale. I don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\u201d His eyes dropped. \u201cWhat\u2019s that in your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfirmation of your Candidacy.\u201d Smoothing out the mangled piece of paper, she put it on a scanner. Two seconds later, it showed up on one of the screens. \u201cBecause of the amount of damage to your spinal column and how long you\u2019ve had the injury, it\u2019ll take years for you to get back full use of your body.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t lie to him, wouldn\u2019t pretend it would be in any way an effortless transition. \u201cThat tick on the right means you\u2019ve been cleared to proceed to the next stage. If you decide you do want to be Made, the process can begin within twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>Vivek released a shuddering breath. \u201cJesus, Ellie.\u201d Swallowing, he did something using the complex mouth controls on his chair to shift the form to the main screen, the Scrabble game minimized in a corner. \u201cIt took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I would never walk, never run, never fuck\u201d\u2014a wry smile\u2014\u201cnever hunt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elena said nothing, knowing he needed her to listen now.</p><p>\u201cOnce I did, I vowed not to look back, only forward.\u201d This time, his grin was self-mocking. \u201cI don\u2019t manage it all the time.

We\u2019re rare and every one of us is needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had no training\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have all the time in the world for training,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cVamps are near-immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to take care of all this?\u201d His glance took in the room. \u201cYou said it yourself. No one else can do what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elena admitted. \u201cBut you think anyone in the Guild is going to begrudge you for making the choice to take your life in another direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. That info I just passed on to Sara\u2014it means she knows the situation might be hostile and that it should be assigned to a team. If I\u2019m not here, that intel isn\u2019t picked up and people die.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, Elena admitted the truth. \u201cI got confirmation you could be a Candidate a few weeks ago. The reason I\u2019m only telling you now is because Sara had to work out how to cover your absence if you decided to go for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d A dangerous glint in his eye.</p> <p>\u201cShe realized she\u2019d need six trained people to do what you do on your own.\u201d</p><p>The glint turned into a smug smile. \u201cI told you I was indispensable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Anyway, we were hoping that if you do decide to accept the Candidacy, you\u2019d train your replacements before you go.\u201d</p><p>Vivek was silent for a long time, his eyes on the form. \u201cA hundred years of slavery to have the use of my body.\u201d It was a whisper. \u201cA hundred years at the mercy of some random immortal who might decide to treat me like a pet dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe angels aren\u2019t stupid. You\u2019re highly gifted\u2014no one is going to want to put you in any kind of a menial position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to hunt straightaway, though, will I?\u201d A frown. \u201cWill I even be a hunter after I\u2019m Made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Elena wasn\u2019t going to lie to him about anything. \u201cSo far as anyone knows, none of the hunter-born have ever been Made\u2014except me, and, well, I\u2019m kind of a special case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I might gain the use of my limbs, but lose my hunting abilities and the Guild.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, the risk is a big one.\u201d Only Vivek could decide whether or not it was worth it. \u201cI can tell you one thing, though: you won\u2019t be under the command of some random angel\u2014you\u2019ll be attached to the Tower, directly under the command of whichever of the Seven is in charge at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulling strings for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think? I\u2019d leave my friends to hang?\u201d She glared at him until he had the grace to look sheepish. \u201cRaphael understands loyalty as well as any one of us. So do the Seven. The fact that I\u2019m taking care of my own isn\u2019t exactly a news flash.\u201d Stretching her wings, she resettled them. \u201cBut I\u2019m not being unselfish here, so don\u2019t give me a halo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends,\u201d Vivek said slowly, \u201care important. Especially to an immortal in a place of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the hot brunette had left you with a few brain cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I do go through with this and come out with my hunting skills intact, then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels love hunters,\u201d Elena said. \u201cYour skills will be used, though not necessarily always as they would be by the Guild.\u201d A blunt fact. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to keep secrets from the Guild, and your time will be the Tower\u2019s first, but I have a promise from Raphael that you can remain on the Guild rolls.\u201d</p><p>Vivek flicked off the screen. \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, V, I haven\u2019t. I can\u2019t. Only you can do that.\u201d He was the one who\u2019d be stepping into the unknown, into what could turn out to be a hundred years of hell regardless of her promises. \u201cI just wanted you to have every bit of information I could give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s finish this game,\u201d he said at last.</p><p>Elena pointed to the board. \u201cYou made \u2018cat\u2019 while I made \u2018zygote.\u2019 The game is so over it\u2019s prehistoric.\u201d</p><p>Vivek laughed, his cheeks creased with lean male dimples that were an unusual sight, his eyes brilliant. And she knew, whatever his choice, their friendship would survive.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael saw Elena glance at his temple as they took to the clouds minutes after landing in Japan, their intent to ride the winds for the final segment of the journey to the ancient city. \u201cThere\u2019s been no change,\u201d he said to her, flying close enough that they could speak.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She drew in long breaths of the cold winter air, the mountainous forests of this part of Kagoshima spread out below them. \u201cI always forget how untamed it is here,\u201d she said, her wings a dramatic splash of color against the dark green when she dropped beneath the cloud layer.</p><p>Flying nearer to the forest giants, she skimmed the treetops with a grace that would\u2019ve been unexpected in one so young in angelic terms had she not been a hunter, her body and mind used to tough physicality. Her flight startled a herd of wild horses, who went galloping off into the mists that hung over the forests from a recent rainstorm. Did you see?</p><p>Sweeping down to join her, he said, When I was a babe growing up in Amanat, my friends and I would race the horses kept in the city at that time.</p><p>Laughter in the air, her hair afire in the mountain sunlight. Did you always win?</p><p>No, that\u2019s why it was so much fun. It was the first time in an eon that he\u2019d recalled that memory, buried as it had been under centuries of power and politics.</p><p>Look at the treetops, he told Elena, glimpsing movement. Our curious friends are back.</p><p>Careful to maintain her height, Elena peered downward. He knew the instant she spotted the monkeys that always emerged somewhere along their flight path to Amanat\u2014her delight unhidden, she appeared the girl she\u2019d never had the chance to be, anointed in the blood of her sisters at an age when she should\u2019ve been making a pest of herself to those same sisters.</p><p>There\u2019re some more to the left, she said, her mental voice a whisper. They\u2019re pointing at us.</p><p>Staying at his current altitude as she dared go a little closer, her white-gold primaries catching the light, he kept an eye out for threats. A day before the ball, there were apt to be any number of very dangerous people already in and around the city. And they all knew Elena was Raphael\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The strange shield of energy that usually protected Amanat not in evidence today, they flew straight through to land at the edge of it. Settling her wings, Elena followed the wild blue of her archangel\u2019s eyes to a vampire running along the defensive wall that surrounded the ancient city.</p><p>Elena\u2019s credentials from the Guild had always borne the legend Licensed to Hunt Vampires &amp; Assorted Others. The historical licenses framed in the Guild library, yellowed and crumbling, all noted the same\u2014but the funny thing was, aside from Elena\u2019s blue-moon hunt of Uram, the men and women of the Guild didn\u2019t hunt anything except vampires.</p><p>She\u2019d always figured the \u201cAssorted Others\u201d tag was to cover them in case they had to go after a human in the course of a Guild case, had been satisfied with that understanding.</p><p>Today, however, as she watched Naasir loping atop the wall with a strange, liquid grace that made him appear boneless, she had the feeling she didn\u2019t know as much as she thought. \u201cWhat,\u201d she said to Raphael, \u201cis he?\u201d Regardless of having visited Amanat more than once by now, she\u2019d had very little direct contact with Naasir.</p><p>Raphael gave her a distinctly amused look. \u201cNaasir is one of my Seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tiger on the hunt, that\u2019s how I categorized his scent the first time I met him, and I haven\u2019t changed my mind,\u201d she said, as Naasir came down the wall with an ease that made it seem he walked on a flat surface. \u201cHis voice might be cultured, but there\u2019s something intensely feral about him. It\u2019s different from what I feel with Venom . . . or deeper, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Raphael said at her frustrated growl, \u201cI will leave Naasir a mystery for you to solve. I wouldn\u2019t want immortality to become boring for my consort.\u201d</p><p>Elena let out a snarl, but she was intrigued by the challenge.</p><p>The vampire reached them the next instant, inclining his head in a slight bow. \u201cSire.\u201d Eyes of pure metallic silver set against skin of a rich, strokable brown met Elena\u2019s. \u201cConsort.\u201d The greeting was by-the-book formal, but as always, she had the feeling that in any other situation, he\u2019d see her as prey.</p><p>Nodding in return and resisting the urge to go for a weapon, she realized the vampire had cut his hair. It had reached the bottom of his nape the last time she\u2019d seen him. It now just brushed it, the jagged waves around his face still as choppy and as vividly silver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was hard to describe that silver\u2014it wasn\u2019t anything like the gray of age. No, it was true silver, glittering and metallic, until she was certain that if you took strands of Naasir\u2019s hair and wove it into a bracelet, it would appear as if it was made of the precious metal. Yet when the wind lifted his hair away from the exotic lines of his face, she saw it was soft, each strand exquisitely fine. Then they settled back into place, and so did the metallic effect.</p><p>A tiger with silver eyes.</p><p>One she\u2019d seen with his head bent over the neck of an angel clearly in the throes of sexual bliss, his hand fisted in her hair and his fangs wet with her blood. Until that moment, she hadn\u2019t realized angels would allow vampires to feed from them, but then, Naasir was no ordinary vampire . . . if he was a vampire at all.</p> <p>21</p><p>\u201cNo, Naasir,\u201d Raphael said, as if the other male had spoken. \u201cYou cannot make a meal of Elena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d came the expressionless answer. \u201cI\u2019ve never eaten the flesh of such a young angel.\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowed, Elena looked from one to the other. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>Naasir\u2019s gaze lingered on her. \u201cI did not realize there was a joke involved.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, that raised the hairs on the back of her neck. It was a joke, right? He doesn\u2019t actually eat angels?</p><p>Raphael stretched out his wings. Not usually, no. He prefers wilder game.</p><p>Deciding she would definitely pay her far-too-amused consort back for this, she walked on ahead of the two of them, Raphael\u2019s presence beside Naasir the only reason she could accept the silver-eyed menace at her back.</p><p>As she walked, Elena took in the changes since their last visit. Amanat had been awakening in slow degrees, but was now literally in full bloom despite the cold. Recalling the temperate feeling in the city last time, she decided the shield must help maintain a constant pleasant temperature within.</p><p>Flowers tumbled from planters and window boxes, bright reds and lush pinks alongside unexpected blues and stunning yellows, the petals soft and the blooms ranging from tiny blossoms to roses the size of dinner plates. Their perfume was a rich tapestry that delighted her senses, lingered in the air, the colors vibrant against the stone gray of the buildings.</p><p>A passing woman dressed in a gauzy gown in a sweet shade of peach\u2014pretty but no doubt chilly with the shield down\u2014lowered her eyes the instant she glimpsed Elena.</p> <p>Why is it every time we come here, she said, uncomfortable with the response, everyone treats me like . . .</p><p>Royalty? Because you are.</p><p>Her shoulders tightened. It was one thing to know she was consort to an archangel, another to be treated like a power when she knew full well that many of those who bowed their heads to her had far more power in their little fingers than she had in her whole \u201cbaby angel\u201d body. Caliane doesn\u2019t like me. It made the formal respectfulness even more unsettling.</p><p>In fact, Elena added, turning right to follow an otherwise deserted pathway when Naasir indicated the Ancient waited in that direction, she\u2019d probably be delighted if Naasir indulged his carnivorous instincts.</p><p>My mother is an archangel of old. Whatever her opinions of our relationship, she would never air the family\u2019s dirty laundry in public.</p><p>Have I told you how much I hate all these stupid polite rules? Scowling, she reached the end of the path . . . and the breath rushed out of her: In front of her was a small pond fed by a waterfall so elegant its sound was delicate music. Flowers grew riotously around the water, the area a carpet of bluebells that reminded her of Illium.</p><p>Only a single stone bench disturbed the blue-green of the natural carpet, and on it sat an archangel of breathtaking beauty, her hair as black as night and her wings a sweep of pure white. The crushed sapphires of her eyes seemed full of an aching sadness when she turned to see who disturbed her peace, but the dazzling joy that lit up her face at seeing Raphael soon eclipsed what had gone before.</p><p>\u201cMy son.\u201d Rising, she walked to him through the bluebells, her wings trailing along the grass . . . and though she stepped on the flowers, they sprang back unscathed. It was a potent display of power, all the more so because Elena was certain Caliane was unaware of it, all her attention on Raphael.</p> <p>When he bent to kiss her cheek, Elena saw Caliane\u2019s eyes sheen wet. \u201cCome.\u201d She took his arm. \u201cLet me show you how my city has grown since last we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d Quiet steel. \u201cYou do not greet my consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>Elena felt the urge to check the air for frost, the greeting was so icy. I thought you said she was never rude, she muttered on the mental plane, even as she made a graceful bow courtesy of Illium\u2019s tutoring skills.</p><p>It appears you are a special case.</p><p>Stifling a laugh at the cool response, Elena fell into step beside Naasir as Caliane drew Raphael ahead. She\u2019d have to tell Sara about this\u2014her best friend found her \u201cmother-in-law problems\u201d beyond hysterical. As a woman who\u2019d never imagined she\u2019d trust any male enough to tie her life to his, much less meet and deal with his mother, Elena found it cathartic to share the weirdness of this part of her life with Sara.</p><p>\u201cConsort,\u201d Naasir said, in that smooth voice she had the sense could become a lethal growl without warning, \u201cthere\u2019s something the Sire has asked me to show you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t read him. At all. It truly was like talking to a big, predatory beast that hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to eat her. Palm itching, she gave in and drew a knife, playing it desultorily through her fingers like a damn security blanket. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d He waved to a narrower pathway to the left.</p><p>Raphael, I\u2019m going off to parts unknown with this vampire who isn\u2019t a vampire.</p><p>He has promised not to bite without warning.</p><p>Imagining the fiendish revenge she was going to take on Raphael for teasing her so mercilessly, she followed the silver-eyed male who continued to make her senses itch and her primal hindbrain crouch in readiness for flight. \u201cCan I ask a question?\u201d</p><p>No response, no reaction.</p><p>Deciding that didn\u2019t mean no, she plowed on ahead. \u201cWho Made you?\u201d Venom, with his reptilian speed and the eyes of a viper, had been Made by the Queen of Snakes and Poisons; it could be that Naasir, too, carried the mark of the one who\u2019d Made him . . . if he had been Made and wasn\u2019t a wholly unknown creature.</p><p>\u201cA long-dead angel who thought to own me,\u201d was his enigmatic answer, the silver in his eyes almost liquid. \u201cI tore out his throat. After that, I ate his liver and his heart. The remaining internal organs weren\u2019t as tasty so I gave them to his other creatures.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s hand tightened on the handle of the knife, conscious Naasir carried gleaming blades of his own in the sheaths strapped to his arms. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think a vampire who killed an angel would be permitted to live.\u201d</p><p>A slow, feral smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I killed him.\u201d</p><p>Every single hair in her body stood up, the same instinct that had probably saved her ancestors from saber-toothed tigers telling her to run the fuck away! Fast!</p><p>Except they\u2019d reached an old temple that hadn\u2019t yet been repaired, parts of it tumbled and covered with creeping vines sprinkled with tiny star-shaped flowers of blue and white. The eerie vampire-maybe-not-vampire led her up the steps. His next words were pragmatic and so civilized, she could barely believe it was the same man who\u2019d spoken about eating an angel\u2019s liver and heart.</p><p>\u201cI made this discovery several hours ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it\u2019s on the edge of the city, easy to police, I decided to wait to act until the Sire\u2019s arrival.\u201d</p><p>An angel whispered out of the shadows on the heels of his words, her wings white with a kiss of delicate green at the primaries, from what Elena could see, and her clothing similar to Elena\u2019s own\u2014except this woman\u2019s pants were of some kind of strong brown fabric instead of leather, and her white top a flowing thing rather than the more fitted styles Elena preferred. She wasn\u2019t yet expert enough at fighting with wings to risk tangling herself or her weapons up in froufrou clothes.</p><p>\u201cConsort,\u201d the other woman said. \u201cI am Isabel.\u201d</p><p>Naasir\u2019s partner, Elena realized, situated here to give the vampire winged backup. \u201cElena,\u201d she said and held out her hand, the other woman having been away from Amanat during Elena\u2019s previous visits.</p><p>Isabel shook it with a smile, her eyes an extraordinary dark brown, her black hair pulled back in an elegant knot at the nape of her neck, and her skin a tawny gold that reminded Elena of paintings she\u2019d seen of Egyptian goddesses. \u201cI\u2019ve made certain nothing was disturbed,\u201d Isabel told her. \u201cThose who ventured this way took little persuading to seek other pleasures.\u201d</p><p>A slight shift in the winds that traveled through the temple, Isabel\u2019s blouse shaped to her body for a fleeting second as Elena\u2019s senses jacked into high gear. The scent of decay, putrefaction . . . and below it, of disease.</p><p>Not needing Isabel or Naasir to show her the way, Elena walked into the damaged building, the roof a filigree that created delicate patterns of light and shadow beneath her feet. At any other time, she would\u2019ve lingered, taken photographs of the effect to share with Eve, her youngest half sister utterly fascinated by the lost city come to life in a land far from its original homeland.</p><p>Today, however, she followed the scent trail in a near-straight line to halfway across the temple. The woman was sitting with her back against one of the intricately carved columns, one hand cradled in a basket of dead flowers, the basket positioned in a way that made Elena think the victim had set it down herself, her body too tired to go any farther. She wore a dress of deep red silk that flattered her femininity without being sexual, the fabric vibrant against the rich cream of her ravaged skin.</p><p>There smell was distinctive but faint, the current cold in the city having preserved the victim as she\u2019d died.</p><p>Girding her stomach against the rush of pity and anger, Elena crouched down, her wings spreading on the icy smoothness of the stone floor. A single glance was enough to confirm that the unusually small number of sores that marked the woman were visually identical to those on the bodies of the New York victims. No other obvious injuries, but that could be deceptive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadness overwhelmed her as she rose to her feet, the victim appearing a broken doll discarded by a careless child. Elena hoped she was now at peace, this lovely woman who\u2019d spent a thousand years in Sleep, only to die before she\u2019d ever explored the new world into which she\u2019d awakened.</p><p>Leaving her sleeping against the stone, Elena walked out into the sunshine where Isabel awaited with Naasir. \u201cHow long was she missing?\u201d she asked, walking down a few steps so she could spread her wings, needing to soak in the sunlight after the cold sadness within a temple clearly built to be a place of beautiful serenity.</p><p>\u201cEight hours at most.\u201d Isabel\u2019s tone was direct but it held the same heavy sadness that had seeped into Elena\u2019s bones. \u201cAmanat is a small, tight-knit city,\u201d the angel continued, \u201cand she shared a home with two cousins. They raised the alarm when she didn\u2019t arrive home for their nightly meal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas she healthy before this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was taking her body longer to adjust to being out of Sleep than most.\u201d Isabel walked down to join Elena in the sunlight. \u201cAs a result, though she was mortal and not averse to sharing her life force with the blood kin, she hadn\u2019t fed anyone in many days.\u201d</p><p>The latter comment made it clear Isabel and Naasir had stayed up-to-date with the discoveries they\u2019d made about the disease. \u201cSince you\u2019ve had no other infected\u201d\u2014a quick glance at Isabel to confirm\u2014\u201cit likely means the enemy intended to use her as a carrier. Except that she was too weak to handle the virus.\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s jaw firmed, eyes flint-hard. \u201cHad she been stronger, she may not have understood she was sick until it was too late, thus infecting those she fed in good faith.\u201d</p><p>Sad as the situation was, it did seem to confirm their theory that the disease could only be passed via a transfer of blood, and as Keir had stated, a certain amount of it. Otherwise, the archangel behind it wouldn\u2019t bother with such a slow method of infection\u2014one that meant he or she had to make contact with the human chosen as the carrier.</p> <p>Of course, an archangel could wipe a mind, so it wasn\u2019t that big a risk in the grand scheme of things, more an inconvenience. \u201cDo Amanat\u2019s people go outside the city walls at any time?\u201d</p><p>Isabel\u2019s nod was immediate. \u201cCaliane has encouraged them to explore their new world, but they almost always go in groups and return together. Kahla, despite her relative weakness, was more intrepid\u2014I can well imagine her going for a walk on her own.\u201d</p><p>Kahla. Having a name, a glimpse into her spirit, made it worse.</p><p>\u201cThe timing,\u201d Naasir said, speaking for the first time since Elena walked out of the temple, \u201ccannot be a coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Turning, she met both their gazes. \u201cNo one can know of this.\u201d The archangel behind it had to believe he or she had failed in the attempt to infiltrate the city. \u201cWe also need to keep Caliane\u2019s people within the walls for the time being.\u201d From the sly cowardice of the attacks, Elena didn\u2019t think the individual behind it would have the nerve to abduct and infect one of Caliane\u2019s people in so public a setting.</p><p>\u201cNo one will leave.\u201d</p> <p>Elena didn\u2019t push the vampire for an explanation as to how he intended to achieve that\u2014Naasir might make her instincts bristle in self-protective warning, but he was one of the Seven for a reason. If there was one thing Elena knew about Raphael\u2019s most trusted men, it was that they got the job done.</p><p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d Isabel said, \u201cwill quietly examine anyone who has been outside the walls within the last three days, in case our enemy touched more than one.\u201d A glance back at the temple. \u201cThere is a volcano not far on the wing. I can carry Kahla to her final rest when night falls.\u201d</p><p>Touched by the gentleness in Isabel\u2019s tone, Elena nonetheless shook her head. \u201cKeir will need to examine the body.\u201d Frowning, she considered the logistics of it. \u201cHe\u2019ll need to wait till after the ball to avoid arousing suspicion, but I\u2019m guessing the shield\u2019s going to go up soon as the overnighting guests are all in\u201d\u2014Isabel nodded at her questioning look\u2014\u201cwhich means the temperature will rise.\u201d And Kahla would begin to rot.</p><p>\u201cAmanat has no suitable refrigeration facility,\u201d Isabel told her, \u201cbut there is a fishing village two hours to the east. I\u2019ll have a local drive one of their refrigerated trucks into the forest where it\u2019ll be concealed from sight and out of earshot.\u201d</p><p>There in the cold, Elena thought, Kahla would sit alone while the city danced.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cI am sorry, Mother,\u201d Raphael said, as Caliane walked with him through her city, her people offering him shy smiles, their eyes drenched with love when they landed on Caliane. \u201cNaasir told me of the loss of one of your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKahla was a sweet girl\u2014lively as a small bird, inquisitive as one, too.\u201d Sorrow deep and true, followed by a whiplash of fury. \u201cIt is cowardice to take an innocent life in such a way, with no claim to the honor of open combat.\u201d</p> <p>His mother, Raphael thought, would never believe she\u2019d just echoed the words of the hunter who was Raphael\u2019s consort. \u201cWe will unearth the perpetrator and make his cowardice known.\u201d It was one thing to infect a volunteer from his or her own lands, another to attempt to use a maid who knew nothing of battle.</p><p>Caliane\u2019s expression softened as she tilted her head back to meet his gaze. \u201cYes, you will, my beautiful boy.\u201d</p><p>Again, they walked in silence for many minutes.</p><p>\u201cIn the last Cascade,\u201d he said, knowing she was the one living being old enough to know the answer, and someone who\u2019d never betray him to another, \u201cdo you know of any archangel who heard whispers in his dreams?\u201d</p><p>It was a strange thing to ask, but his mother simply looked thoughtful and he could feel her turning the pages of her eons-long existence. \u201cNo,\u201d she said at last, stopping beside a wall entirely covered with hot pink blooms, her expression searching when she turned it on him. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>He heard the concern she couldn\u2019t hide . . . and he knew. \u201cFather heard whispers, did he not?\u201d</p><p>Sorrow darker and older than that caused by the loss of Kahla, a sadness that made his bones ache. \u201cMy beloved Nadiel would\u2019ve been so proud to see who you\u2019ve become. He always said you were the best of both of us.\u201d</p><p>In evading his question, she\u2019d given him his answer. His father had heard voices in his madness and now Raphael heard them, too.</p><p>22</p><p>Twenty-four hours after she\u2019d left the temple, Elena found herself in the surreal position of getting ready to dress for a formal ball while a refrigerated truck sat not far from the city, hidden from the sight of the angels who\u2019d soon be flying into Amanat. A number were already here, the city in a flurry of excitement, the majority of the residents unaware of Kahla\u2019s death.</p><p>Caliane had made the decision to delay the announcement till after the ball\u2014\u201cfor my people have worked so hard for this night\u201d\u2014the death to be explained as a tragic fall that broke Kahla\u2019s neck. The young woman would still be sent into the heart of a volcano, but as part of a full funeral service that gave her friends and family an opportunity to say good-bye.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t people question the volcano?\u201d Elena asked now, Raphael having just received the update about the funeral from Naasir.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, Amanat\u2019s people have never buried their dead, so it\u2019ll be seen as a fitting farewell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliane,\u201d she said, tightening the belt on her robe, \u201cis she okay?\u201d Raphael had spent time with his mother that morning, while Elena explored Amanat in Isabel\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cShe mourns.\u201d His upper half shirtless, he stood at the open balcony doors of their third-level suite, looking out over the bustle of the city below. \u201cMy mother has ever treasured the people of Amanat.\u201d</p><p>Elena couldn\u2019t argue with that, not when she knew Caliane had taken her people into Sleep with her, she valued them so deeply. Those people, in turn, adored her with an openness and an affection so heartfelt, it gave them a rare sense of innocence and the city an unexpected warmth of heart.</p><p>\u201cKahla is the first she has lost since the Awakening.\u201d His hands closed over hers when she wrapped her arms around him from the back, her cheek on the living silk of one of his wings and her palms on the rippled muscle of his abdomen. \u201cIf she could call off this ball, she would, but it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the haunting sorrow she\u2019d glimpsed on Caliane\u2019s face. \u201cHow does she not see anyone lesser as disposable, given how long she\u2019s lived?\u201d Of all the archangels Elena knew, including Raphael, it was Caliane who appeared the most attached to her people, mortal and immortal.</p><p>\u201cI asked her the same question once as a boy,\u201d Raphael answered. \u201cIt was after we\u2019d been to the territories of two other archangels within a short period of time, neither of whom treated their people as I\u2019d always seen my mother do.</p><p>\u201cShe told me there was a time when she, too, was utterly remote from the world. It was her love for my father that began the change . . . and my birth that completed it.\u201d Echoes of time, of memories from the dawn of his life. \u201cIn becoming a mother, she found an ability to love that transcended the change engendered by time and power.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the life Caliane had lived, tried to imagine the weight of so many years: To see an eon pass, then to fall in love and bear a child, only to watch your mate be consumed by a madness that forced you to execute him. And later, to be consumed by insanity yourself, cause harm to the child who was the last cherished reminder of your mate, to Sleep for over a thousand years and wake to find your son a man of incredible power . . . one who\u2019d given wings to a mortal.</p><p>\u201cIf that happens to us,\u201d she whispered, unable to wrap her mind around the idea of a life so long and so full of tragedy, \u201cif we feel ourselves, who we are together, becoming lost in time, I don\u2019t want to Sleep. I want to say good-bye when I\u2019m still me and you\u2019re still you.\u201d A clean, sharp ending rather than a gradual unraveling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Turning, Raphael cupped her face, his eyes incandescent. \u201cCaliane and Nadiel never lost one another, Elena. My parents loved even in the madness.\u201d And so, Raphael thought, would he.</p><p>Elena\u2019s hands fell to his waistband, finger hooking slightly inside. \u201cTogether,\u201d she said, and he knew she was recalling what he\u2019d told her about Caliane\u2019s inadvertent admission when it came to the whispers that plagued his dreams, his hunter\u2019s words a reminder of the promise they\u2019d made to one another.</p><p>\u201cWe fall, we fall together.\u201d</p> <p>Eyes going to his right temple now, she shook her head, jaw set. \u201cIf you dare go before me, I will haunt you in the afterlife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be haunted by my heart is no threat.\u201d Tugging back her head, he claimed her lips. He\u2019d meant only to initiate a kiss, needing to taste the fiery life of her, but they were by the bed seconds later, her robe falling to the carpet to leave her golden-skinned body open to his caresses. Passion a crash of sensation in his blood, he took her to the sheets, their limbs entangled and skin hot as they forged another memory that would hold through eternity.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Her body feeling deliciously used, Elena fixed the final straps of the gorgeous ankle-length gown that had magically appeared in the luggage one of Raphael\u2019s staff had driven to Amanat from the jet. She\u2019d given up trying to figure out when or how formal clothes like these poofed into her wardrobe\u2014or into her suitcase, for that matter\u2014all she knew was that a tailor came by every couple of months, took her measurements, and things turned up when she needed them. She was good with that.</p><p>Today\u2019s gown was sea froth around her ankles, the color an evocative azure blue, the tiny buttons that anchored the straps designed to hug her body faceted diamonds, and the azure lace accent along one side unexpectedly striking. She didn\u2019t wear her workmanlike forearm sheaths but strapped on the jeweled upper-arm sheath and blade set Raphael had given her prior to the last ball they\u2019d attended.</p> <p>It had survived the ensuing carnage, and the blade, sweet and deadly, looked prettily decorative on her biceps. She slid a second blade into a thigh sheath, her dress created with a discreet slit that gave her quick access\u2014the tailor knew who he was dressing, that was clear. Into the hair she\u2019d put in a fancy twist, she slipped the blade pins given to her as a gift by Jason\u2019s princess, the spymaster currently on the other end of the call Raphael had received as he was buttoning up his severely formal black shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d she asked when he ended the call.</p><p>Taking in the sight of his consort in her finery, Raphael walked across to run his finger along the curve of her bodice, the way she arched her neck in a responsive shiver enticing him to bend, press his lips to her throat. \u201cYou appear a pampered courtesan.\u201d The jeweled blade on her arm only added to that effect.</p><p>She smoothed her hands over the crisp fabric of his shirt. \u201cGood\u201d\u2014her fingers slotting in the remaining buttons\u2014\u201cthe better to fool people.\u201d</p><p>It would be a stupid individual indeed who\u2019d miss the acute perceptiveness of Elena\u2019s eyes, the fluid hunting grace of her walk. \u201cJason,\u201d he said, in answer to her earlier question, \u201chas heard not even a whisper of other vampiric deaths such as the ones in New York, and no incidents with mortals as in Amanat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Slipping her hand into his, she led him to their balcony, which overlooked the cobblestoned square that was to be the center of the ball, the area lit with old-fashioned standing lamps of delicate iron, and accented with the natural blooms of the city. \u201cAre all immortal balls outdoors?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the most part\u2014a ballroom big enough to comfortably handle so many wings would be an impersonal structure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a stadium.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI get why angels would prefer an outdoor setting. It\u2019s much prettier this way. The carpet over the cobblestones\u2014it must\u2019ve taken the weavers a human lifetime to complete.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded, making a mental note to take her to visit the master weavers in the Refuge on their next visit. Elena would appreciate both their skill and their artistry. \u201cDo you see how the buildings are built in a staggered pattern around the square?\u201d Sliding one arm around her waist, he pointed out the design with his other. \u201cIt\u2019s so each rooftop has an uninterrupted view of the festivities.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s face glowed as she took in the informal seating areas that had appeared on those rooftops, each warm with candlelight. \u201cIt was built this way on purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Should we ever have a ball in Manhattan,\u201d he said, laughing when she pretended to stab herself in the eye, \u201cit will require us to get creative. I was not thinking of angelic balls when I built my city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God or I\u2019d have had to divorce you.\u201d Leaning against him, their wings sliding intimately against one another, she returned to the darkness beneath the sparkle and the gilt. \u201cIf Jason\u2019s right and Amanat was the only other target aside from New York, then it reduces the short list of possible enemies down to one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lijuan seems the perfect candidate, yet Jason is dead certain Lijuan has not left her stronghold for the past month.\u201d</p><p>Elena frowned. \u201cNot that I doubt him, but she has that whole other noncorporeal form.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had the same question, but your favorite archangel has apparently been highly visible attending celebrations thrown in her honor in her territory.\u201d He watched a tiny bird come to sip at one of the large blooms that climbed up the side of the house, its wings a splash of red and green. \u201cLijuan was at a winter festival during the entire span Kahla was missing from the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, that takes us back to square one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite, for we now know Lijuan is not the diseasemonger.\u201d Yet his instincts said she had a hand in this nonetheless. \u201cThe others, bar Neha\u201d\u2014who had a legitimate reason for excusing herself from the gathering\u2014\u201cwill be here tonight.\u201d</p><p>His consort smiled as the jewel-toned bird hopped onto a small table to one side of the balcony. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get close enough to pick up a scent,\u201d she said, her eyes on the tiny creature. \u201cMaybe since this is a bloodborne disease, the angel will carry some hint of it in his own blood and it\u2019ll speak to my hunter senses.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had no disagreement with her idea, but, gripping her chin gently, he held the silver-gray of her gaze. \u201cDo not permit yourself to be separated from me this night.\u201d The situation was too volatile, the risks deadly. \u201cI would declare war should anyone do you harm, and the entire immortal world knows that fact.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Two hours into it and the ball was extremely . . . civilized. Elena, her senses hyperalert, was almost disappointed that everyone proved to be on their best behavior\u2014even Michaela. The archangel had chosen a dress in dazzling crimson, the cut caressing her every curve, her curls glossy and lush down her back, her eyes made up with sweeps of bronze and gold; it was impossible to deny her sheer, painful beauty.</p><p>Of course, that beauty didn\u2019t make her any less of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she said with a sensual smile. \u201cWe parted badly and I was at fault. You must not be angry with me\u201d\u2014a pout\u2014\u201cwe have always been meant to be intimate friends.\u201d</p><p>Pointedly ignored by the female archangel and happy about that fact, Elena focused on drawing in Michaela\u2019s scent. All she picked up was the complex notes of a lush perfume . . . then there it was, that bright splash of acid hidden deep.</p><p>I can definitely sense Uram in her.</p><p>Can you judge the depth of the infection?</p><p>No. Her angel-sense was nascent at best; the fact that she could pick up anything at all from Michaela was likely due to the fact that Uram had been a bloodborn angel. Bloated with the toxin that turned humans into vampires and was meant to be purged at regular intervals through the Making process, he\u2019d gone truly insane, becoming a monster more vicious than any vampire, his thirst for blood and death unquenchable.</p><p>After Michaela, they ran into Elijah and Hannah, followed by Titus, then Favashi. Neither Elena nor Raphael had any suspicions about Elijah, but she took a scent reading nonetheless. Nothing. The other two archangels didn\u2019t register on Elena\u2019s senses, either, but that might not mean anything. When Astaad, with his dark eyes and neatly trimmed goatee, lifted her hand to his mouth, her mind flashed to what his own hands must\u2019ve done mere months ago, when he\u2019d beaten one of his concubines to a pulp.</p><p>That brutal act would\u2019ve made Elena want to cut off the hands in question, but according to Raphael\u2019s own experience in Astaad\u2019s territory, while the other male was a harsh and often cruel ruler, he adored his women, spoiling them to outrageous levels. No one had ever before seen him raise so much as his voice to any one of them, and the general belief was the aberration had been connected either to the Cascade or to the disruption caused by Caliane\u2019s Awakening. So while it wasn\u2019t easy, Elena tried to keep an open mind when it came to the male archangel.</p><p>As soon as the formalities were complete, she turned her attention to the vampire by his side. The woman\u2019s eyes were a haunting darkness, her rich brown skin and striking features placing her ancestry in the Pacific Islands that were Astaad\u2019s domain, her beauty so refined as to be unearthly. An old vampire, her exquisiteness the result of centuries of subtle change.</p><p>Smiling, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Elena.\u201d</p><p>The other woman\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI am Mele,\u201d she responded after a quick glance at Astaad that put Elena\u2019s instincts on alert\u2014except that Mele didn\u2019t look again in the archangel\u2019s direction.</p><p>They ended up speaking for over a half hour, discovering common ground between Mele\u2019s long-term study of vampiric soldiers and Elena\u2019s experience as a hunter. At one point, Elena confessed, \u201cI feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I have said a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elena shook her head. \u201cI had this mental image of a \u2018concubine\u2019\u201d\u2014she\u2019d asked Raphael if it was polite to use that term, been told yes\u2014\u201cand you just smashed it to smithereens.\u201d The other woman was a scholar who spoke languages Elena hadn\u2019t even known existed until Mele mentioned them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d An open smile that made her more stunning than Michaela would ever be. \u201cYou\u2019ll no doubt meet others who are the ornamental pieces you expected, but my archangel has always valued intelligence and spirit. All his women are thus.\u201d</p><p>Comfortable with the other woman, Elena whispered, \u201cDo you ever get jealous of one another?\u201d</p><p>A laugh. \u201cThey are my sisters of the heart. I cannot be jealous of myself.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael, in case you\u2019re getting ideas\u2014I won\u2019t be this civilized if you decide you need a concubine. In fact, it\u2019s a good bet I\u2019ll turn homicidal.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up from his conversation with Astaad as he said, A pity, in that cool \u201cArchangel\u201d tone of his. I will now have to ask the pilot to empty the hold of my chosen females.</p><p>We\u2019re going to have to talk about this new sense of humor of yours. Smiling in spite of her private warning, she continued chatting to Mele, while Raphael and Astaad subtly tried to extract each other\u2019s secrets while giving away none of their own.</p><p>After they parted ways, Raphael placed his hand possessively on her lower back, her wing below his arm. \u201cI think you have made a friend of Astaad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstaad? I spent the whole time talking to Mele.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are consort to an archangel, and yet you treated his most favored concubine with true respect. Even many mere angels consider concubines beneath their notice.\u201d</p><p>So many layers to angelic society, she thought, so much that made no sense to her. \u201cAstaad and Mele are obviously attached to one another.\u201d Love existed there, perhaps not love as she and Raphael understood it, but love nonetheless. \u201cI\u2019m guessing they have a healthier relationship than Neha had with her consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d His eyes focusing on someone up ahead, his lips curving in a way that went well beyond simple politeness. \u201cTasha.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d The angel in front of them had slanted eyes of vivid green and wings of silken copper against hair of darkest scarlet, her nearly translucent skin showcasing her otherwise vivid coloring to dramatic effect. Reaching up as Raphael bent down, the act appearing familiar to them both, the stranger pressed her lips to Raphael\u2019s cheek in a soft caress.</p><p>\u201cAnd this,\u201d she said, turning to Elena with a deep smile, \u201cmust be your consort. I am honored to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTasha is a friend from long ago,\u201d Raphael explained, a warmth to him she hadn\u2019t seen with any other female angel. \u201cWe played in Amanat as children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when we decided to raid every fig tree in the city?\u201d Musical laughter, sparkling eyes. \u201cYour mother was so cross, she made us plant ten fig trees each. I can still see you with the shovel, your face streaked with dirt and leaves stuck in your hair.\u201d</p><p>The gorgeous image of Raphael as a mischievous boy made Elena smile, even as her instincts cautioned her to be wary. Unlike Michaela, who made no effort to hide her desire for Raphael and contempt for Elena, Tasha was all warmth and laughter . . . while subtly reminding Raphael they had a history together that Elena couldn\u2019t match.</p><p>The depth of her sudden dislike made Elena pause, wonder if she was being fair . . . but then Tasha put her fingers on Raphael\u2019s forearm as she brought up another shared memory. Elena didn\u2019t play games like this, and in any other situation, she would\u2019ve called the woman on it, but there were far more important things in play tonight. Still, she wasn\u2019t sorry to see the back of Tasha when the other angel was called away by a friend.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s head jerked up without warning a second later. \u201cLijuan is here.\u201d</p><p>Looking up, Elena saw nothing but starlight. \u201cYou can sense her?\u201d</p><p>It appears my ability has another aspect.</p><p>An instant later, the sky kind of . . . rolled overhead, akin to a heat wave in a desert. Then an angel with wings of flawless dove gray and hair of pure white, her dress an ethereal black, was landing in the center of the courtyard in a graceful descent. The crowd gasped, tension crawling across the large space like the blood Lijuan so often brought with her.</p> <p>Stay with me, Elena. Raphael cut through the frozen mass of guests, his target not Lijuan but Caliane.</p><p>The blade from her thigh sheath already discreetly in hand, Elena made sure to keep Lijuan in her line of sight as they moved through the gathering. Will your mother take this as a hostile act? Elena wouldn\u2019t blame her if she did.</p><p>It\u2019s a possibility. She may, however, decide upon chill politeness.</p><p>Here\u2019s hoping for a win for angelic etiquette. Two seconds later and they were there.</p><p>Caliane\u2019s face a mask of icy fury, she acknowledged Raphael with a glance before stepping out into the now empty\u2014but for the single uninvited guest\u2014center of the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cYou do not observe the rules of Guesthood.\u201d Caliane\u2019s words were coated in frost and when Elena\u2019s breath misted in front of her, she realized the drop in temperature wasn\u2019t only metaphorical.</p><p>Lijuan smiled, her hair flying back from her face in a wind that affected nothing else. \u201cOn the contrary.\u201d She raised a hand. \u201cI bring you a gift.\u201d</p><p>Ten winged warriors landed behind her with military precision, all dressed in dark gray with Lijuan\u2019s red symbol on their chests.</p><p>Raphael stepped toward his mother. Elena.</p><p>Understanding the message, she came to a stop slightly behind and to the left of Caliane, while Raphael flanked the Ancient on her right. As if they\u2019d been waiting for exactly that, a squadron of fighters in the midnight blue of Caliane\u2019s forces landed behind them.</p><p>\u201cThe gift,\u201d Caliane said, actual frost beginning to coat the hem of Elena\u2019s dress and the tips of her wings, \u201cis unsuitable and must be declined.\u201d It sounded like a rote response, except that Caliane\u2019s razored voice had come a hairsbreadth from slicing flesh.</p><p>\u201cA pity. They are a well-trained unit.\u201d Smile deepening against skin so thin Elena could see her skull beneath, Lijuan didn\u2019t break eye contact with Caliane.</p><p>Elena wondered if Raphael\u2019s mother heard the screams she always did when looking into those pearlescent eyes, as if Lijuan held within her a thousand trapped souls.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Lijuan continued, \u201calso bring reparation for the damage I did your city on my previous visit.\u201d</p><p>Two of her men carried forward a chest, opening it to reveal a pirate\u2019s ransom in gold and gemstones. \u201cA sign of my goodwill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe damage done cannot be so easily repaired,\u201d was Caliane\u2019s frigid response. \u201cThe breach is final.\u201d</p><p>Audible gasps, the guests closest to the confrontation flinching as if in anticipation of violence.</p><p>Elena tightened her grip on her blade, her fingers chilled but functional. Raphael?</p><p>My mother has just told Lijuan that no matter how long they live, there can never be anything but enmity between them.</p><p>Not a surprise, and nothing that explained the panic she could see on the faces of those who stood nearby. It\u2019s not done to say it so bluntly?</p><p>Not unless one side is anticipating another betrayal.</p><p>Oh. Caliane, she realized, had just called Lijuan a liar in front of a crowd of the most powerful angels and vampires in the world.</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s smile didn\u2019t fade, but Elena saw a slick of black begin to crawl across the eerie paleness of her irises. \u201cIt disappoints me to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt disappoints me to have to say it, but your welcome was also a steep disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Another round of flinches, but this time Elena had caught the insult buried in what seemed, at first, an incomprehensible statement. She\u2019s talking about the fact Lijuan attacked her right after she rose from her thousand-year Sleep.</p><p>The crashing sea of Raphael touching her mind, clean and strong and wild. It\u2019s a shadowy line, so not all may agree, but it was a questionable act at best.</p><p>You might want to warn your mother that Lijuan is batshit, won\u2019t play by the rules.</p><p>I did so this morning. Do you have other weapons aside from the blade on your arm?</p><p>Another knife, but I can easily take a sword from the vampires strutting around with them as fashion statements. Long swords weren\u2019t her weapon of choice, but Galen had drilled her until she could fight with them in a pinch. For future reference, I am never, ever going to a ball again without a crossbow and a flamethrower.</p><p>I do not think there will be any further such events until the Cascade is over.</p><p>Spreading her feet a fraction farther apart under the skirts of her dress, Elena positioned herself to spin out and grab the sword of the poppycock to her left at the first sign of trouble. But then Lijuan unfolded her wings in a whispering sweep. \u201cI welcome you to my territory. I am certain the breach can be mended.\u201d Her liftoff was silent, as was that of her squadron, the silence so thick, Elena knew it for another blatant display of power.</p><p>Raphael lifted off at the same instant, Caliane\u2019s squadron at his back as they tracked Lijuan out of the territory. Naasir is close to you, Elena. Do not stray too far from him.</p><p>Recalling his words from before the ball and recognizing the worry behind the autocratic order, she said, I won\u2019t. Be careful.</p><p>The air warmed around her, the frost melting away to nothing as Caliane turned, her eyes liquid blue flame. And although Elena knew she was beyond outclassed in the power stakes, she continued to flank Caliane when Raphael\u2019s mother moved through the crowd with elegant grace. Tasha fell in on Caliane\u2019s other side, and in her hand was a gleaming sword\u2014held in a grip that said she knew how to use it and use it well.</p><p>\u201cMy lovers have always been warrior women.\u201d</p><p>The realization slammed into her with the force of a hammer blow, just as Caliane met Elena\u2019s gaze for a fleeting second . . . and inclined her head in the slightest nod of acknowledgment.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael returned deep into the ball, having escorted Lijuan to the sea border.</p><p>The rest of the gathering was drama free, the revelry going on till the early hours of the morning. To Elena, the celebrating had the feel of desperation, as if the ordinary angels and the vampires knew war hovered on the horizon and were aware that in a fight between behemoths, it was the weaker who\u2019d become cannon fodder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caliane bid them good night sometime after three a.m. and retired to her bed, accepting the escort of a man with the same green eyes as Tasha. Elena and Raphael stayed an hour longer as she\u2019d asked them to act as hosts in her stead, the pain of Kahla\u2019s loss clearly weighing heavily on her once more.</p><p>\u201cKeir?\u201d Elena asked, once they\u2019d left the courtyard and the final revelers to their play.</p><p>\u201cHe has just reached the body. I have Naasir and Isabel standing watch while he examines Kahla.\u201d</p> <p>Around them, Amanat didn\u2019t slumber, but instead settled into a romantic quietness as couples and small groups strolled through its softly lit beauty, leaving one another alone for the most part. Running her fingers along the carvings that decorated the wall to her left, Elena thought of the body that lay so close to the city, the death that had almost engulfed Caliane\u2019s people, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve also advised my mother to reinitiate the energy shield for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan, Elena remembered, could get through that shield, but it was impermeable to an ordinary angel, which would leave Lijuan fighting alone against Caliane and her forces. Not something the Archangel of China would risk. \u201cHow does your mother do that? The shield, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander could also create such a thing, so perhaps it\u2019s a gift that comes with age. He, too, is an Ancient and now Sleeps.\u201d He spread his wing across hers in a silent signal that he wanted her closer.</p><p>The familiar intimacy unlocked the questions twisting her up. \u201cTell me about Tasha.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer parents were warriors who served my mother. They have once more returned to Amanat\u2014you saw her father offer Caliane his arm as she left tonight.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Elena met his eyes, the heartbreaking blue intense even in the soft shadows of night-not-yet-become-morning. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take them into Sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was their task to watch over me should my mother ever disappear or die.\u201d His wings glittered in the lamplight that fell from an open window. \u201cEven in her escalating madness, she thought to leave guardians I could trust. Avi and Jelena were\u2014are\u2014to her what my Seven are to me, and though it was the Hummingbird to whom I chose to give my trust, that does not say anything of my deep respect for Avi and Jelena.\u201d</p><p>The tie between Raphael and Tasha, Elena realized, went far deeper than a simple physical love affair. \u201cYou grew up with Tasha.\u201d Was connected to the other woman by thousands of fragments of time.</p><p>\u201cWe played through Amanat like wild creatures.\u201d Turning left, he led her to the field of bluebells beside the pond where they\u2019d first seen Caliane. \u201cShe remained my friend as we grew, but childhood\u2019s end took us on different paths.\u201d</p><p>The area in front of Elena had become a wonderland of shimmering night plants hidden by the bluebells during the day, a silver oasis undiscovered by the others who walked in the city, but she couldn\u2019t concentrate on the wonder of it. \u201cYou met again as adults, though, didn\u2019t you? You were lovers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHundreds of years ago.\u201d</p><p>Walking to the edge of the pond, she fought her habit of pretending things didn\u2019t matter when they did, and admitted the truth. \u201cI knew I\u2019d run into one of your lovers sooner or later. I just never expected the first one to be so impressive.\u201d</p><p>Raphael thought of the centuries he\u2019d lived growing increasingly remote from the world, the power at his command eating away at the boy he\u2019d once been, and knew Elena didn\u2019t understand the piercing depths of who and what she was to him. Tasha, scholar and warrior, was a friend, but she\u2019d seen the surface of him and been content with that.</p><p>In all his existence, Elena alone had torn at that surface, heedless of the risk, until she revealed the man beneath the archangel. And Elena alone had challenged his decisions and his views, forcing him to look at the world in a way he\u2019d never before considered. \u201cThere is no comparison,\u201d he said to the only woman he\u2019d ever claimed for his own. \u201cYou know me in ways no one else ever has or ever will again.\u201d</p><p>The ring of silver molten around her irises, the bones of her face strong and exquisitely unique, she parted her lips on his name just as another message touched his mind. So quickly, the moonlit night was no longer a place of beauty but a reminder of the putrid darkness that slithered on the outskirts, waiting to ravage and violate.</p><p>24</p><p>\u201cKeir has returned.\u201d</p><p>An immediate change in Elena\u2019s expression, his consort shelving their personal discussion for one that affected their people.</p> <p>Gathering her into his arms, he flew them directly to their suite, having made sure Keir was assigned the suite next door. When they walked through to Keir\u2019s living area, it was to find the healer staring into the cold fire, his eyes grim.</p><p>His report was deadly in its familiarity.</p><p>\u201cThe disease destroyed the victim\u2019s internal organs.\u201d Keir\u2019s jaw strained white with the force of his emotions. \u201cAs with the others, the sores were a secondary effect. It is categorically the same infection, and, given the lack of further victims and the fact of her humanity, I agree she was meant to be the carrier.\u201d</p><p>Keir rose to pace across the room, his anger vicious in a way Raphael had never before seen, his wings held so tight to his back it had to be painful. \u201cThe only good news is that while the infection was identical to that found in New York,\u201d the other man continued, \u201cit was appreciably weaker to the senses that make me a healer. Had Kahla not already been compromised, I believe she and any of those who fed from her may well have made a full recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Lijuan,\u201d Raphael said slowly, \u201ccannot create reborn after reborn with no rest in between. Doing so causes their infectiousness to decline.\u201d</p><p>Keir paused in his pacing. \u201cJason has been spending time in interesting places.\u201d</p><p>It was what his spymaster did best.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re right,\u201d Elena said, from the armchair into which she\u2019d curled, \u201cand the disease maker\u2019s run out of juice, that means New York and Amanat are both safe, at least for the short term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot predict how long it\u2019ll take for the architect of the disease to recharge,\u201d Keir murmured, \u201cbut I think it will not be soon. He or she has done too much too quickly.\u201d Pausing, he stared at the carpet before raising his head. \u201cI cannot say this without any doubt, but I believe the Falling was caused by an attempt to seed the sky with a disease targeted at angelkind, as this bloodborne disease is targeted at vampires.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had thought as much, the risk to his people one he had to find a way to negate. \u201cThe energy expended in that attempt would also explain why the disease maker is exhausted after creating only two carriers that we know of.\u201d Seeing the healer sway slightly on his feet, he said, \u201cRest now, Keir.\u201d Do not let the rage eat away at you.</p><p>Keir glanced up. Now you quote my own words back at me.</p><p>They were wise ones. Said to the angry, broken youth he\u2019d been. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave you in peace.\u201d</p><p>The healer\u2019s expression remained tense, but he was no longer pacing when they walked out the door. Leaving Elena getting changed in their suite, Isabel on watch outside, Raphael flew to his mother. He knew she wouldn\u2019t be asleep\u2014angels so old as Caliane slept but rarely and the two of them needed to talk; not only as mother and son, but as archangels who might soon be drawn into a global war.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready for war,\u201d she said, as they walked through the quiet corridors of her home, her arm tucked through his, her wing a warm weight against his own. \u201cMy power has returned, my people are strong again, but my spirit? It wants only peace.\u201d She smiled and it was a creation of sadness. \u201cI\u2019ve fought too many battles. Now I feel only the driving need to enshield Amanat and wait this out.\u201d</p><p>Raphael couldn\u2019t blame her for that choice. \u201cYou should protect your people. They are yet babes in this new world.\u201d</p><p>Eyes so similar to his own, yet with such age, such pain, such loss in them, met his. \u201cYou are the babe of my body, Raphael. I will not abandon you as I once did.\u201d Steel in the blue. \u201cMy resources are yours. I will not permit your city to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d He held her against him, continually surprised at how small she was, for she had always loomed larger than life in his memories. \u201cI\u2019m no child, and if you divert your resources to New York, you know Lijuan will attack and destroy Amanat.\u201d</p><p>Drawing back, she took his arm again and led him toward the wide stairs to the roof, her voice unyielding. \u201cWhat use is my city if my son is dead?\u201d</p><p>Realizing he wouldn\u2019t win this battle if he spoke as a son to his mother, he spoke as one archangel to another. \u201cVictory in New York will be meaningless if Lijuan gains a stronger foothold in this part of the world.\u201d Amanat\u2019s simple existence was a symbol that Lijuan was not as all-powerful as she would have the world believe.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you move your people to protect them,\u201d he added, \u201cthus abandoning your city, it\u2019ll be viewed as a capitulation.\u201d In wars between immortals, perception could often be everything. \u201cThose who might now be undecided on a side will begin to see her as the true power, once it becomes known she drove you from your city.\u201d</p><p>The elegant lines of her face exposed by the way she\u2019d pinned her hair into a loose knot, Caliane pulled away to walk to the edge of the roof. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a choice, not being driven anywhere by that repugnance who styles herself an archangel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the story she\u2019ll tell, nor the one people will believe.\u201d When there was only silence from Caliane, her feathers limned with power against the starlit night, he reminded her of the one fact against which she couldn\u2019t argue. \u201cWe cannot know how long the coming wars will last, and we cannot coexist in the same territory, Mother, not for anything beyond a short term.\u201d It was the reason the members of the Cadre were separated from one another by water and land, their powers too violent to permit long-term proximity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were two known exceptions to that rule. The first was pregnancy\u2014had Michaela truly been with child, he could\u2019ve offered her sanctuary, for the vulnerability that came with carrying a child would\u2019ve dampened the effect. The second was love of the kind shared by Caliane and Nadiel, their deep emotional bond somehow ameliorating the effect. Michaela and Uram, by contrast, had never lived together, their love affair conducted over short periods of intense intimacy, followed by weeks of distance.</p><p>An adult child fell into neither exception. \u201cI would end up viewing you as a threat, and you would feel the same about me, our instincts driving us mad as we fought the urge not to kill.\u201d It was a prediction borne out by angelic history. \u201cYou need to maintain and hold this territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could cross over and obliterate Lijuan\u2019s stronghold while she is gone, take her territory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer stronghold is deep in the heart of her territory and you went into Sleep with two squadrons alone.\u201d Strong and skilled men and women, but a tiny number nonetheless. \u201cWhile you fly into her territory, her commanders will send squadrons to destroy Amanat. You must think of all the permutations of any action you take.\u201d</p><p>Wings rustling, Caliane turned to face him, her expression softer . . . bleaker. \u201cWhen did you stop being a boy and become a man so used to the ways of politics and power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always going to end up here.\u201d The child of two archangels, one an Ancient, could have little choice in the matter, power fused into every cell of his body.</p><p>Poignant emotion in her eyes, she flared out her wings and, stepping off the edge of the roof, made a silent descent to the street below. \u201cWalk with me through my city,\u201d she said to him when he followed, \u201cand tell me of your foolish but brave consort.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d ever acknowledged Elena as his consort without his prompting. \u201cYou must first tell me your decision on matters of war.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are right in all you say, and I cannot permit my love for my son to blind me to that.\u201d Fingers brushing his cheek. \u201cDo not fail, Raphael. I have outlived my consort. I cannot outlive my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I fail,\u201d he said, instead of making a promise that might prove false, \u201cyou\u2019ll be the only one who remains who might defeat Lijuan. You cannot abrogate that responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I not?\u201d Cool arrogance. \u201cI see you believe you can make decisions for another archangel.\u201d</p><p>He laughed as the night winds played with the wintery white of his mother\u2019s simple gown. \u201cI learned how to be a ruler by watching you.\u201d</p><p>A scowling maternal look. \u201cAlways, you were able to get your own way by giving me that smile.\u201d Sighing, she led him to an enclosed private garden he knew she\u2019d created for her maidens, the air perfumed by the riot of flowers that fell from the temple balconies that surrounded the space. \u201cYour Elena, she has no sense of her own mortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a warrior.\u201d One with a human heart. \u201cAs with all warriors, fear is a tool she uses to her advantage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTasha is a scholar and a gifted warrior, yet Avi and Jelena tell me you didn\u2019t pursue one another beyond a single summer. She would\u2019ve made you a perfect consort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have your son in a polite political alliance?\u201d</p><p>Taking a seat on a stone bench overhung with yellow roses turned silver by the moonlight, Caliane shot him an exasperated look he well remembered from boyhood scrapes. \u201cStubborn child.\u201d Sighing again, she said, \u201cCome, then. Tell me why you love this once-mortal enough to defy the world. I would hear the story of your courtship.\u201d</p><p>Coming to sit with her below the roses, he braced his forearms on his thighs and said, \u201cIt began with a bloodborn angel and ended in ambrosia.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Too wired to sleep in spite of the late hour, Elena talked Isabel into a sparring session in the private courtyard of the house occupied by only Raphael, Elena, Keir, Naasir, and Isabel. The other angel was good, but Elena more than held her own.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve become soft in this position.\u201d Isabel wiped the sweat off her brow. \u201cGalen will have my head when I rotate back to the Refuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a tough bastard,\u201d Elena agreed. \u201cBut since I\u2019d be dead without the lessons he beat into me on a daily basis, I can\u2019t curse him too loudly.\u201d</p> <p>Isabel stifled a laugh, and the two of them separated to shower, with Naasir taking over the watch. Conscious Caliane would want to spend as much time with Raphael as possible, Elena didn\u2019t wait for him before going to bed, her body happily tired. She expected a total knockout . . . but it was as if the nightmare visions knew she was alone, vulnerable.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Elena\u2019s wings kept dragging through the congealed blood no matter how hard she tried to keep them raised off the slippery tile, the white-gold tips turning a muddy rust. \u201cBelle? Belle, where are you?\u201d</p><p>Her oldest sister crawled to her from behind the counter, her blood-soaked fingers leaving darker streaks on Elena\u2019s wings as she tried to grab on. \u201cEllie, my legs hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019ll help you get up.\u201d She slipped in the liquid that smelled so wet and metallic even as she spoke, landing hard on her back, her wings crushed between her body and the tile in a tangle that wrenched at her tendons.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she managed to get onto her hands and knees, but her body kept sliding backward, the kitchen floor suddenly a slope. \u201cI can\u2019t reach you.\u201d Her voice was that of the child she\u2019d been, the girl used to having two older sisters who told her what to do when she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cBelle! What should I do?\u201d</p><p>But Belle couldn\u2019t speak anymore, her head separated from her body, her beautiful long legs in pieces. Sobbing, Elena tried to find Ariel. Ari would know what to do; Ari always knew.</p><p>Heart pulsing in her mouth, she glimpsed her sister\u2019s slender fingertips behind the chair, began to claw her way forward. She knew it was Ari, because Ari had just painted her fingernails a shade she called \u201cnude\u201d\u2014the color wasn\u2019t her favorite, but it was one that didn\u2019t get her in trouble at school. \u201cAri?\u201d She reached out to touch Ari\u2019s hand. \u201cBelle\u2019s hurt. She\u2019s really hurt. We have to help her. Ari?\u201d</p><p>She was holding her sister\u2019s hand. It had been torn off at the wrist.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael walked into the suite at dawn to find his consort in bed, her body rigid and her hands fisted. Immediately putting his hands on her shoulders, he shook, knowing she needed to be wrenched out of the vicious grasp of nightmare. \u201cElena, wake!\u201d Elena!</p><p>A jerk of her head, but she didn\u2019t wake. Tugging her toward him with a grip in her hair, he kissed her, kept kissing her until he felt her nails dig into his arms, her body losing that ugly nightmare tension. The sob that tore from her when he broke the kiss had him crushing her close.</p><p>\u201cI hate this,\u201d she said, after the storm had passed and they sat on the edge of the bed staring out at the approaching dawn. Her voice was flat, near defeated, unlike the woman he knew.</p><p>Not closing the distance she\u2019d put between them because he sensed she wasn\u2019t ready, her hands white-knuckled on the edge of the bed, he kept his eyes on the clean line of her profile. \u201cYou\u2019re having far fewer nightmares than you did when we first met.\u201d</p><p>Jaw clenched, she stared down at the carpet. \u201cAnd I still wake up like that, terrified out of my skin.\u201d A throb of anger beneath the defeat, his Elena rising through the battered and bruised places in her soul. \u201cWhen does it stop? When do I get over it?\u201d</p><p>Judging she wasn\u2019t willing to listen to reason\u2014she might not even hear him in her current self-punishing mood\u2014he rose. \u201cWe\u2019re not scheduled to leave for two hours.\u201d He could not be seen to be racing back to New York. \u201cWe have time for a sparring session.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get up. \u201cI had one with Isabel last night.\u201d</p><p>This, Raphael realized, was even more serious than he\u2019d believed. Elena never turned down a chance to spar with him\u2014he was one of the few people who pushed her to her absolute limit, uncaring of the risk attendant in causing even unintentional harm to the consort of an archangel. To him, the inevitable bruises were acceptable if the lesson would help her stay alive.</p><p>Picking up her favorite blades, he threw them at her. Hands snapping up, she caught both. \u201cI said\u201d\u2014spoken through gritted teeth\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I say you\u2019ve sulked long enough.\u201d He stripped off his formal wear and pulled on a pair of pants suitable for sparring.</p><p>Eyes of silver-gray slitted in frigid outrage. \u201cI just dreamed I had my sister\u2019s severed hand in my own. Sorry if that inconveniences you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged and very deliberately used the one thing he knew would infuriate her enough to cut through the apathy. \u201cI\u2019ll see if Tasha is up for a session, then,\u201d he said and reached for the doorknob. \u201cBe ready to leave in two hours.\u201d</p><p>The knife quivered to a stop on the doorjamb an inch from his face.</p><p>25</p><p>Not saying a word, and aware of Elena swearing behind him as she rushed to pull on clothes, he walked out and down the steps into the courtyard. When she emerged a couple of minutes later, it was in khaki cargo pants and a specially designed black tank that took her wings into account. Like his, her feet were bare, but she had knives while he was unarmed.</p><p>A fair balance, given his extreme strength and speed.</p><p>When he made a \u201ccome on\u201d gesture with both hands, Elena narrowed her eyes and threw one of those blades at his face. He was distracted just enough by the unexpected act that she almost swiped him with the second blade as she came in low. Grinning, he avoided the strike with a twist that slapped her with his wing.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t meant to hurt, only to distract in turn, but Elena had learned from their past sessions, and turned with him, going for his wing with the blade in her grip. His consort had a tendency to make mistakes when angry, but not today\u2014he\u2019d succeeded in angering her to the point where she fought with icy fury. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Barely avoiding the sharp bite of metal, he used his wings to lift himself a foot off the ground in order to avoid a kick. \u201cA little slow, hbeebti.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the taunt . . . and threw the second blade directly at his wing. Positioned as he was, he couldn\u2019t avoid it in time and it pinned his wing to the wall of the house. But he was an archangel, had it out a split second after it went in, his body ready to handle her secondary attack.</p><p>\u201cYou now have no knives,\u201d he said, exhilaration in his blood as he parried her fists and kicks. Elena couldn\u2019t truly hurt him, not yet, but her fighting style was unique, one she\u2019d created as she reworked her hunter training and adapted Galen\u2019s teachings to take her personal strengths and vulnerabilities into account. And because she hadn\u2019t been an angel all her life, she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to be able to do certain things, so she just went ahead and did them.</p> <p>That element of surprise made each session as fun for him as it usually was for her.</p><p>Now she came in close . . . and suddenly had two more knives headed straight for his neck. Blocking them using a maneuver he\u2019d learned from Alexander before the other archangel started to view him as a threat, he bared his teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d A saccharine-sweet smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize we were playing fair.\u201d Another fury of blades, their bodies moving with a speed and a ferocity that had drawn an intrigued audience of three\u2014Keir, Isabel, and Naasir. All watched from the balconies that ringed the courtyard and someone clapped when Elena managed to swipe his forearm, drawing blood.</p><p>Ignoring the cut, he touched the tip of the knife he\u2019d pulled out of his wing to her cheek to register a hit. He made sure it didn\u2019t break skin, for his passionate, beautiful lover didn\u2019t heal as fast as he did, but she made no effort to hide her fury that he\u2019d gotten so close. Twisting out of reach before she could take advantage of his proximity, he moved to come at her from behind.</p><p>She threw the knives over her shoulders without turning.</p> <p>Startled by the unexpected tactic, he almost took one in the chest, only his agility saving him from a wound that would\u2019ve taken at least ten minutes to repair. Turning the instant the blades left her hands, Elena swept out with a kick to capitalize on his shaky balance, but she\u2019d forgotten her wings.</p><p>Grabbing one, he hauled her close, his blade at her throat. \u201cI win,\u201d he said, both their chests heaving.</p><p>A sharp prick against his heart. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he bent his head and kissed her, half expecting her to slide the blade in, she was so pissed. But she returned his kiss, hot, wild, and wet, her tongue rubbing against his own. \u201cYou ever taunt me with Tasha again,\u201d she said in a harsh whisper when they broke the kiss to gasp in air, \u201cand I will geld you.\u201d</p><p>Raphael winced. \u201cThat would take at least a day to repair. Are you sure you want to lose my . . . attributes for that long?\u201d</p><p>A twitch of her lips, eyes bright. He could see her struggling to hold in the laughter, but it was a losing battle and she was soon doubled over with her hands on her knees, her laugher wild color in the air.</p> <p>For the first time, I envy you, Raphael.</p><p>Glancing up, he caught Keir\u2019s gaze. It\u2019s not every man who has his lover out for his blood.</p><p>Keir\u2019s laugh was quiet, as, waving good-bye, he disappeared into his suite. It was Naasir who jumped down onto the courtyard with feral grace. Picking up the discarded knives, he held them out to an Elena who was now upright and wiping tears of laughter from her face.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she managed to say, before secreting away the knives with such speed, Raphael couldn\u2019t follow her movements or tell where exactly she\u2019d hidden the sleek weapons.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cheat?\u201d the vampire asked, head cocked. \u201cWith the knives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, I was fighting an archangel who can crush me like a bug. Of course I was going to cheat\u2014especially since we had a score to settle.\u201d</p><p>Naasir stared at her, then grinned. \u201cWe\u2019ll spar when I\u2019m in New York.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five minutes later, they\u2019d showered and dressed in preparation for the trip home, and Elena still wasn\u2019t sure quite what had happened. \u201cDoes he like me now?\u201d she asked, as they ate a light breakfast in readiness for heading out on the wing.</p> <p>\u201cNaasir likes very few people, but I think he finds you interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She bit into her honey toast. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to be found \u2018interesting\u2019 by a tiger creature. He probably finds other fresh meat interesting, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTiger creature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop laughing.\u201d Scowling, she poured him a glass of orange juice and pushed it across. \u201cSorry about the funk when I woke up.\u201d</p><p>He took the juice, the humor fading from eyes the breathtaking hue of a high mountain lake. \u201cWhy today?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been so defeated by the nightmare memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t.\u201d It had simply felt as if she\u2019d been beaten to a bloody pulp, every one of her achievements erased by the crushing ugliness of horror. \u201cI just\u201d\u2014she blew out a breath\u2014\u201cI wish I could be fixed, so I could remember my sisters, my mother, without the pain.\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t offer her platitudes, just grim pragmatism. \u201cYou\u2019re young. The memories will never disappear, but they\u2019ll lose their power to cause such harm over time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but I don\u2019t want to be screaming myself awake for the next hundred years.\u201d The immortal concept of \u201ctime,\u201d she\u2019d learned, was far different from a mortal\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re far too stubborn for such a possibility to come into being.\u201d Reaching across, he rubbed his thumb over her cheek. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason the nightmares are getting worse, and you know why.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she frowned. \u201cWhat reason? It\u2019s not close to the anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, hbeebti, you surprise me.\u201d Dropping his hand, he said a single word\u2014\u201cEve\u201d\u2014and all the pieces fell into place.</p><p>Her half sister, only a little older than Elena had been when Slater Patalis destroyed her world, was just coming into her power as a hunter. As Elena had been that fateful year. \u201cWow,\u201d she whispered, her fingers motionless on the white tablecloth. \u201cHow did I not see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is too close a hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Picking up her juice, she finished the glass before speaking again. \u201cI guess some part of my subconscious is terrified it\u2019ll happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014especially as you\u2019ve now formed a true bond with Eve.\u201d</p><p>Where before, they\u2019d been strangers with half the same blood. \u201cDo you think Jeffrey\u2019s scared, too?\u201d she asked, thinking of the vicious wounds it must score on a man\u2019s soul to bury first his children, then his wife.</p><p>\u201cHis emotional state is irrelevant.\u201d Raphael\u2019s face was brutal in its repudiation. \u201cIt\u2019s because of him that you didn\u2019t have what you needed to heal as a child.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was right, but it was strange, how now that she\u2019d finally begun to look at Jeffrey through the eyes of an adult and not a child, it was so much harder to despise him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can ever forgive him for what he did to me, but I might not hate him if he gets it right with Eve.\u201d Except she was terribly afraid that was a futile hope.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A half hour later and they were on their way out of the city when who should flag them down onto a rooftop but Tasha. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I caught you,\u201d she said, her hair tied back to showcase the blade she wore diagonally across her back. \u201cI did so wish to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to gag at the oh-so-sincere comments that came her way in the next few minutes, Elena smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t stay longer, but it looks like rain.\u201d She put on her best frown as she tilted back her head to stare at the clouds.</p><p>\u201cElena is right,\u201d Raphael said to Tasha. \u201cWe cannot risk a delay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Tasha was all elegance and charm when they said their good-byes. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll meet again soon.\u201d</p><p>That was very bad of you, Elena, Raphael said once they were in the air. You know the coming sun shower will pass in but a moment.</p><p>I also know Tasha McHotpants is regretting she didn\u2019t scoop you up when you were young and single. Altering her mental tone, she said, Oh, Raphael, what luck I caught you. And me dressed up like a warrior with a sword and everything. She snorted. Luck my ass.</p><p>McHotpants?</p><p>Shut up. I\u2019m mad. Especially after that stunt you pulled this morning.</p><p>Then you know I\u2019m more partial to knives than swords anyway.</p><p>Teasing me right now could be bad for your health.</p><p>To her surprise, he did go silent. It wasn\u2019t until he pointed out the volcano some distance to their left that she understood why, her own blood heavy with turbulent emotion. Later that day, a young woman who\u2019d done nothing but go for a walk in the woods would be laid to rest in the heart of that volcano.</p><p>As soon as the rites were completed, Amanat would once again become a closed city, according to what Raphael had told her as they showered. Caliane had agreed to stand sentinel against the darkness on this side of the world, while they fought it on the other. Much as Elena wanted all their preparation to be for nothing, she knew that was a wasted hope.</p><p>The drums of war pounded closer with every heartbeat.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Winging into Manhattan after the jet landed on a private airfield nearby, Elena breathed deep of the biting cold air of home. It had promised snow for a couple of weeks without delivering, but she felt sure that\u2019d change very soon. \u201cAnything from Aodhan?\u201d she said, when Raphael came alongside.</p><p>\u201cNo, the city has been quiet since we\u2014\u201d He paused, his eyes locked on the Hudson.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d It appeared as it always did to her, but she knew he had the piercing eyesight of a bird of prey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWatch.\u201d</p><p>The water began to crash and froth even as he spoke. Managing to hover beside Raphael as he halted at the river\u2019s edge, Elena glanced to the right . . . and that was when she saw it, the wave of red. Rich and dark, it rolled down the river in an eerie tide that made the hairs rise on the back of her neck, the scent of living iron pungent in the air. \u201cIs that blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way to find out.\u201d He swept down to the water, hovering lower than she could manage with her current wing strength, until his fingertips skimmed the red stain.</p> <p>Bringing his fingers to his nose, he shook off the wet and rose to her side. \u201cBlood,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cBut it\u2019s weakening.\u201d</p><p>As they watched, the water turned rose red, then pink, then blush, until it was the murky brown of a churned-up Hudson again, the unmistakable scent gone as if it had never existed. That was when the snow began to fall, airy flakes that whispered over her wings and face to settle on the city, a caress of whiteness to erase the blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat we just saw\u201d\u2014she stared at the water\u2014\u201cshould\u2019ve been impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Jessamy not say something about blood raining from the skies during the Cascade? This would seem to fall along the same continuum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the archangels were not who they should be, and bodies rotted in the streets and blood rained from the skies as empires burned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Raphael,\u201d Elena said, as the historian\u2019s words rang in her mind, \u201cthis is really happening.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just going to be a war. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an event that changes the face of our world.\u201d Her brain could barely comprehend the scale of what was coming.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes met hers, the snow continuing to drift from a crystalline sky. \u201cIn the hours I spent with Caliane, she told me more of the last Cascade.\u201d Shadows of terrible darkness in the intense, impossible blue of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI almost don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she whispered, all the while aware this was a truth that couldn\u2019t be avoided.</p><p>Her archangel angled his wings toward the Tower, and she did a wider sweep to follow. \u201cYou are consort to an archangel. You no longer have a choice.\u201d</p><p>26</p><p>Aodhan was waiting for them on the Tower balcony outside Raphael\u2019s office. \u201cSire, I\u2019ve sent out people to keep watch for any signs of unrest caused by the event.\u201d</p> <p>The event.</p><p>Elena guessed there really was no other way to describe a river turning to blood.</p><p>\u201cPanic has been stifled before it could take root.\u201d Aodhan\u2019s eyes reflected splinters of Manhattan as he looked toward the water. \u201cHowever, members of the public no doubt captured live footage of the event and the Tower will need to issue an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Raphael\u2019s tone was autocratic, his face stripped of all traces of \u201chumanity.\u201d \u201cThere are to be no explanations. Say only that it is Cadre business and if anyone insists on further information, tell them to contact me directly.\u201d</p><p>Anyone stupid enough to take him up on that offer, Elena thought, deserved what they got. Most mortals never came near an archangel for a reason\u2014the power differential was so vast it created a gulf that couldn\u2019t be crossed from either side except in the most extraordinary of circumstances. The longer she spent in the immortal world, the more she understood that that gulf was a safety net; anything else would lead only to death for countless humans.</p><p>Still\u2014\u201cPeople will be scared.\u201d She had to speak for the humans and the ordinary vampires, because Raphael simply didn\u2019t understand that kind of helplessness. He\u2019d never been weak, not even as a child. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something to reduce their fear, the morale of the city could dip to dangerous levels, and it\u2019s already shaky after the Falling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIllium is of the same opinion,\u201d Raphael said, his skin glowing with a fine undertone of power she\u2019d never before seen. It defined his bones even more sharply, his eyes such violent flames it was difficult to look at them. \u201cHe requests your assistance in creating a diversion.\u201d</p><p>Elena hesitated. Raphael, you\u2019re doing the scary archangel thing. The really scary one.</p> <p>Resettling his wings to shrug off the snow, he touched his fingers to her jaw as Aodhan disappeared into the Tower. The touch made her skin tingle, her heart thud against her ribs, because the power of him was a pulse in her blood. \u201cYou\u2019ve become stronger,\u201d she whispered, her relief intermingled with worry, because while this was good news, she didn\u2019t like the sudden cold remoteness of him.</p><p>This man, she thought, would never taunt her in a fight or take her dancing through the skyscrapers. He was too distant, too inhuman. He was also hers and she wouldn\u2019t surrender him to anything or anyone. Raising her own hand on that fierce vow, she placed her palm against his cheek, the power seeping into her potent enough to steal her breath. \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a storm inside my skin.\u201d His voice echoed with the same whispers she\u2019d heard in their shared dream.</p><p>Her mind shuddered, reminded of the screams she\u2019d heard in Lijuan\u2019s voice . . . but this, it was different. It made her skin chill in a way that had nothing to do with the falling snow, yet there was no instinctive revulsion, no horror, no sense of evil. No, all she sensed was power, of a kind she\u2019d never touched, even after coming in contact with the Cadre. \u201cThe storm came with the blood river?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I felt it form as the tide rolled in, grow stronger when my fingers touched the water.\u201d The whispers still there, he kissed her and she felt the ice of his newfound power seep into her bones, the cold bitterly painful. But she held on, her hands spread on his chest and her love for him a passionate fire.</p><p>\u201cSuch fear I feel in you, Elena,\u201d he murmured, his eyes on her mouth before he kissed her again, the cold blade of him searing her flesh. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll cause you harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Breath harsh from the bands of ice that crushed her rib cage, she wrapped her arms around his neck and spoke against his lips. \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense,\u201d she said with a scowl, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to accept that when your skin is glowing and I\u2019m about to turn into a freaking icicle!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the breeze playing through his hair and the snow caught on his eyelashes. \u201cI\u2019m digesting the power, for lack of a better word.\u201d Another kiss, this one rawly sexual. \u201cIs that better, hbeebti?\u201d It was a private whisper, his hand on her breast in the cocoon created by his wings.</p><p>She shuddered, her breast seeming to swell to fill his palm. \u201cOne way to heat a woman up.\u201d The ice of his new strength remained, but she could feel his cock against her abdomen, sense her Raphael beneath the power-laced skin of the archangel. \u201cI want to take you home and lock us in our bedroom until you\u2019re no longer so cold.\u201d</p><p>A squeeze of her breast, another demanding kiss before he dropped his hand and folded back his wings. \u201cLater. For now you must go and help Illium calm the populace.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to leave him when he was still not quite right, but conscious they had to get the mood of the city under control, she kissed him again before flying off. If you get the sudden urge to raise flesh-eating dead, she said from the air, let me know so I can come snap you out of it.</p><p>You have my promise.</p><p>Still not sure she was happy about the whole river-of-blood/strange-influx-of-power situation, she landed on a rooftop not far from the river\u2019s edge just as the snow stopped falling, the sun\u2019s rays refracted off a city covered in a fine, featherlight blanket of white. The rooftop had a direct line of sight to the river, and she could see swarms of people on the piers, gesticulating wildly as they gathered around camera phones that had no doubt caught the weirdness.</p><p>Blue feathers with glittering silver filaments filled her vision a second later, followed by the wings of an angel with eyes of gold abundant in their mischief. \u201cCome on, Ellie.\u201d He threw her a baseball mitt, his own left hand already gloved, a ball in his right. \u201cLet\u2019s go play catch above the Hudson.\u201d</p><p>Elena stared. \u201cThat\u2019s your grand plan for managing people\u2019s fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever seen angels playing catch?\u201d A raised eyebrow. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Figuring what the hell, she followed him to the river, where they were joined by three other angels from the Tower, all of whom grinned and saluted her before calling out to Illium to stop delaying and prepare to get his ass kicked. Illium shot back a colorful insult . . . and then they played catch, angel-style.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell!\u201d She dived and rose as the ball went in every possible direction, the players attempting to beat one another to it and/or stop it from hitting the water. Elena wasn\u2019t anywhere near as fast as Illium or the others, but she held her own by using her brain to calculate angles, even making a couple of surprise intercepts that put her on the points table.</p><p>Less than two minutes after they began, the people on the bank stopped staring at the Hudson and started cheering for their favorite player. Factions formed, an enterprising group finding a blue scarf to wave for Illium. The idea quickly picked up steam, and soon there were five different scarves for the five players, Elena\u2019s a distinctive hunter gold.</p><p>Had to be someone from the Guild down there, she thought with a grin.</p><p>Elena wasn\u2019t the least surprised when a media chopper appeared in the sky, a harness-bound cameraman hanging out the side, though the crew stayed at a respectful distance. Funny how they\u2019d been doing that since Illium made it clear that in a chopper-versus-angel fight, the chopper would come out worse. Much worse.</p><p>\u201cGot it!\u201d Managing to catch a throw that would\u2019ve otherwise hit the center of the cheering crowd, she fired it high and to the left . . . where it was intercepted by an angel with eyes of splintered green and wings of icy sunlight. When he rocketed the ball toward Illium using his left hand, the blue-winged angel tumbled head over feet from the force of the powerful missile before thrusting up his hand with a grin, ball firmly in his grasp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elena and the other three players exchanged looks and silently retired from the game, their chests heaving as they took a seat on the edge of the nearest roof, happy to watch Aodhan and Illium showcase their extraordinary skills in the air. \u201cHave you seen them do anything like this before?\u201d she said to the angel beside her, an older squadron commander she\u2019d never seen laugh before today.</p><p>\u201cNot for two centuries.\u201d The solemnity of his response was erased by his roar of approval when Aodhan scooped up the ball as it actually hit the water and fired it back over his shoulder without looking, his body and wings turning him into a living diamond under the piercing winter sunlight.</p><p>Stunning, Elena thought, just as her phone vibrated with an incoming message from Sara. Illium caught the ball before it would\u2019ve hit the roof of a car crossing a nearby bridge, but his body appeared to be on a collision course with a bus. Someone screamed, but the blue-winged angel executed a perfect turn through the girders of the bridge to launch a throw that sent Aodhan flying backward with the might of it.</p> <p>Ransom is taking bets on which of the two \u201cpretty boys\u201d loses the ball first.</p><p>Elena grinned and messaged back: Put me down as backing Illium to win. Aodhan\u2019s too well behaved to expect Bluebell\u2019s more sneaky moves.</p><p>Turned out she was wrong. Aodhan seemed to know Illium\u2019s tricks inside out and vice versa. By the time it ended in a draw caused by the recall of both players to the Tower, the city had well and truly awakened to the fact that there was an extraordinary new angel in their midst. The horrifying news of a bloodred Hudson had been relegated to a secondary news item, the entire city\u2014heck, the entire country\u2014in fascinated discussion about Aodhan and, of course, the game.</p><p>Every single channel had roped in a baseball commentator to discuss the angels\u2019 technique, and speculation was rife about a possible rematch, with the Manhattan-based reporters smug as cats in the cream as they said, \u201cWatch this space for further news about our angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say Illium\u2019s ploy was a success,\u201d she said to Raphael later that night, in the privacy of the large bath in their Tower suite. \u201cAodhan\u2019s appearance topped it off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe surprised all of us.\u201d Raphael no longer looked as \u201cother\u201d as he had after the river ran red, but every so often she\u2019d hear a hint of those strange whispers in his voice. \u201cWhy are you sitting so far?\u201d he asked now, his arms spread along the tiled edge of the tub the size of a small pool. \u201cI assure you, I haven\u2019t been overcome by the urge to make the dead walk.\u201d</p><p>Floating across to him, she rested her hands on his thighs below the waterline. \u201cThe power, it\u2019s holding?\u201d No matter if it freaked her out, he needed to grow stronger if he was to stand against the others.</p><p>A darkness in the cerulean blue, shadows shifting under the sea. \u201cNo. It filled me to overflowing, but it has drained away ever since. I will return to myself by dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYes, quite. If I need to wait for another extraordinary event to taste such strength, we may, as you put it, be screwed. Especially given the other factor.\u201d</p><p>Eyes going to his right temple, she said, \u201cShow me,\u201d having kept her silence in Amanat for fear his enemies would get wind of what might be a sign of fatal weakness.</p> <p>Raphael removed the mask of glamour to reveal the speck, except it was no longer a speck. It had spread in a fine line over the bone, become about an inch long. And\u2014\u201cRaphael.\u201d Heart stuttering, she touched her finger to his skin. \u201cIt\u2019s turned a deep, deep red.\u201d</p><p>Terror sought to squeeze the breath out of her chest. Fighting it, she found her voice again. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look swollen or infected, though, more like ink beneath your skin.\u201d Except, unlike his spymaster, Raphael didn\u2019t have a facial tattoo. \u201cDo you feel anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no weakness, no sense of sickness.\u201d He ran the back of his hand over her breast, his knuckle touching her nipple. \u201cIt\u2019s done no harm thus far.\u201d Both hands sliding down her rib cage to her waist, he brought her over his thighs, his erection rubbing against her, the blunt steel making her nails dig into his shoulders.</p><p>Molten heat in her navel. \u201cGod, how can I be so ready for you so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re mine.\u201d With those stark words of possession, he lifted her, then brought her down so the head of his cock pushed at the slick heat of her opening. \u201cFuck me, Elena.\u201d</p><p>Even as she took him with a moan of exquisite pleasure, part of her scrabbled to fight the rising passion, to think. That was near impossible when Raphael hauled her lips to his, one hand fisted in her hair, the other molding her breast in a caress both bold and possessive as his tongue thrust deep into her mouth.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the roughness that had her brain scrambling. Raphael was often raw, and she loved it, loved that he didn\u2019t hold back, but this, today . . . That was when she felt it, the \u201ccold\u201d in his kiss, the ice that penetrated her own blood through their intimate physical link. Even at his most sexually demanding, Raphael always made her feel unbearably cherished. Tonight his touch felt remote, for lack of a better word, and when she opened her eyes, she saw he watched her even as he played her body.</p><p>No way in hell.</p> <p>She bit down hard on his lower lip, and when his hands dug into her flesh, his wings beginning to glow, she licked her tongue over the hurt and ran her lips down his throat, squeezing him with her internal muscles at the same time. His body went taut, his cock pulsing inside her.</p><p>Oh yeah, she knew exactly which buttons to press, too.</p><p>The instant she felt his hand fisting in her hair again in preparation for taking back the reins, she gripped the tendons along his neck between her teeth. A growl, the glow off his wings intensifying, but he let her control their next kiss, his tongue dueling with hers as she pressed her breasts to his chest, well aware he loved the feel of her aroused nipples rubbing against his flesh.</p><p>Flexing his hips, he urged her to go faster, harder. When she resisted, he tipped her back over his arm without warning and sucked one of her nipples into his mouth, rolling the taut little nub over his tongue like a succulent berry. The stab of sensation went straight to her womb. Pulling at his hair, she tried to stop the erotic torment, take back control.</p><p>The touch of teeth on her sensitive flesh.</p><p>She tightened around the thickness of him and was rewarded by a lavish lick, his mouth releasing her nipple only to brand the other with the scalding heat of his kiss. It was near impossible to think now, but she needed to know this was her Raphael. Clamping down hard on his cock, she held him possessively as he released her nipple to throw back his head, his jaw a brutal line.</p><p>Dangerous man. Gorgeous man. Her man.</p><p>Easing her sexual hold on him, she used her internal muscles to caress him again as she leaned in to kiss his throat, one hand on his chest, the fingers of the other rubbing at the highly sensitive inner edge of his wing. It was the final straw. Raphael gripped her jaw, bringing her in for a kiss that might as well have been sex, it was so untamed, so deep, so fucking hot.</p><p>Then there was no more strategy, no more battling for the reins, only a passionate engagement that had her screaming soundlessly as she orgasmed around the heated steel of his possession, her eyes locked with those of heartbreaking, unshadowed blue.</p><p>27</p><p>Raphael patted Elena\u2019s wings dry, his consort having wrapped her body in a fluffy blue towel as she stood in the bathroom glaring at him via the mirror. \u201cYou were weird,\u201d she said, succinct and to the point. \u201cLike that time when you went Quiet.\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t like who he became in the Quiet, that state of being where he acted with a cruelty driven by cold reason untempered by emotion. In the last and what he\u2019d decided would be his final period of Quiet, he, who had once watched over angelic nurseries, had threatened a babe in pursuit of his goal. \u201cDid I cause you harm?\u201d he asked, dropping the towel to clasp his hand around her nape.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d An irritated scowl that to him was a kiss. \u201cYou did fuck my brains out, but since I did the same to you, I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>Her temper the ultimate reassurance, he released her. As she walked out into the bedroom and found a robe, he followed to pull on a pair of black pants. He wouldn\u2019t sleep this night; there was too much to do\u2014the reason they were at the Tower, not the house\u2014but he\u2019d work from the bedroom until she was past the first problematic hours of sleep.</p><p>\u201cI go into the Quiet when I expend a certain level and kind of power,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this felt like something outside myself.\u201d As if he stood in the deepest ocean, insulated from the world.</p><p>\u201cAn assault?\u201d Curling tendrils of near white around her face where the strands had escaped the knot at the back of her head, Elena closed the short distance between them.</p><p>\u201cOne that drenched me with power? No.\u201d He had a feeling it had been something far more dangerous. \u201cIf I am coming into my power, it appears it has the potential to fundamentally change me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever going to happen.\u201d A stubborn glint in his hunter\u2019s eye. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lose my man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Even in the strange cold, he\u2019d tasted her fury, her passion, the searing depth of her love, and it had wrenched him back into her arms, all distance erased. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for my woman to go to bed.\u201d She had circles under her eyes from the string of tension-filled days and interrupted sleep. \u201cIf you do not argue, I shall send you into slumber with bedtime tales of blood and death and annihilation from the last Cascade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYippee.\u201d Slipping off the robe to reveal a body lithe and golden, she snuggled under the blankets.</p><p>He lay on his side atop those same blankets, tugging her hair from its knot to play with the wild silk of it. \u201cHave you heard of the lost city of Atlantis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her eyes widened, soft wonder in the silver-gray. \u201cIt was real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother says the legend springs from a water city that existed millennia upon millennia ago\u2014a city of remarkable artistry created by an archangel who had abilities such as those we now believe Astaad to have, except this archangel\u2019s powers were at their height at the time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bleak realization stole the wonder. \u201cIt was destroyed, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliane is uncertain if some part of it does in truth lie below the ocean, protected by its archangel, but it fell victim to the last Cascade wars, as did many other great civilizations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch wonders lost forever, Raphael. Things that eclipse the creations of this modern world, until the boastfulness of today is that of children who have never seen true grace.\u201d</p> <p>Repeating Caliane\u2019s judgment for Elena, he told her the rest, how the wars had circled the globe, soaking the earth in mortal and immortal blood both. \u201cBy the time they came to an end, a century after they began, half the world was gone and civilization had regressed by millennia.\u201d</p><p>Elena shook her head, as if the knowledge was too terrible to bear. \u201cThese Cascades, there\u2019s no way of telling how many have come and gone, how many times civilization has been all but erased only to start again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shifting so his body covered her own, his hand in her hair, he told her the prelude to the final brutal fact. \u201cCaliane has survived more than one Cascade.\u201d That, he was certain, no one knew. \u201cShe says not all are equal, and that from the changes apparent in the Cadre so soon into the Cascade, this may be the strongest in all her eons of existence.\u201d</p><p>Unhidden horror, his hunter\u2019s arms holding him close. \u201cIf the last Cascade ended in the destruction of half the world . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Given Raphael\u2019s ominous bedtime story, it was a miracle Elena slept as soundly as she did. When she woke, however, to a haunting quiet that told her more snow had fallen overnight, it was with a blinding need to escape the madness of the immortal world for a fragment of time.</p><p>Sara had the morning off\u2014as much as a Guild Director could ever have time off\u2014so Elena hooked up with her best friend and Zoe at a small neighborhood eatery for brunch. The owner and most of the regulars knew Elena from before her transformation and, while there were a few people who snuck photos, no one bothered them.</p><p>An hour and a half later, they stood in Central Park, watching a giggling Zoe try to catch the pigeons. Bundled up like a little polar bear in an orange snowsuit, the tiny girl would sit down in the snow every so often to rest, then be off again after the birds. Elena\u2019s breath frosted the air as she laughed in delight at Zoe\u2019s antics, the temperature freezing enough that Elena, too, was dressed for the weather, wearing a long-sleeved top underneath her black hunting leathers. Her immortal body might be tougher than a mortal\u2019s, but it had become clear she was too young to shrug off this kind of cold\u2014especially in flight, where she had to deal with wind chill as well.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Vivek?\u201d Sara said, after sending Deacon a photo of Zoe sitting in the snow.</p><p>\u201cAodhan is supervising his transformation.\u201d Elena had made certain Vivek was in hands she trusted. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to visit him\u2014he asked me not to. I don\u2019t think he wants any of us to see him while he\u2019s so vulnerable.\u201d Paralyzed he might\u2019ve been, but Vivek had never been helpless as long as Elena had known him. \u201cYou know how much he likes to be in control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get it, but he\u2019s still a proud idiot,\u201d Sara said, her tone deeply affectionate.</p><p>\u201cKeir\u2019s personally monitoring his progress.\u201d Sara had met the healer during her visit to the Refuge, knew the deep respect with which he was held in the immortal world. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the Making of a mortal with such a significant long-term injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMommy!\u201d Zoe ran back to them in that wild, almost-falling-over-at-any-instant way. \u201cIsses!\u201d</p><p>Crouching down to snuggle her little girl in her arms, Sara smothered her adorable face in the requested kisses. The two looked so gorgeous together that Elena snapped a photo with her own phone, Sara\u2019s deep purple coat vibrant against Zoe\u2019s orange outfit, their faces creased in identical smiles. Zoe giggled when Sara pretended to tickle her, then gave her mom a smacking kiss on the cheek before holding up her arms to Elena, dark eyes bright. \u201cNantie Ellie!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, \u201cNantie\u201d Ellie lifted Zoe into her arms and, after sneaking a cuddle, threw her into the air, catching her in a firm grip on the downward flight. Zoe squealed happily, her hood falling off to reveal gorgeous curls of bronze threaded black tied in two neat pigtails. \u201cZoe fly, Nantie Ellie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, utterly besotted with Sara\u2019s baby. \u201cYou\u2019re flying, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>Five goes later, the little girl was seduced by the sight of an angelic feather drifting to the snow from a passing squadron and raced off to snag it for her collection.</p><p>\u201cI swear,\u201d Sara muttered, \u201cI have a heart attack every time you and Deacon decide to treat my tiny, tiny baby like she\u2019s a damn basketball.\u201d</p> <p>Elena grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s your kid\u2014you\u2019re the one who jumped off a building in pursuit of a vampire.\u201d Leaving Elena swearing a blue streak as she stared down at the alley, fully expecting to see her friend\u2019s broken body. \u201cAnd you caught him, too.\u201d Sara had calculated her jump to take her into a Dumpster full of food waste. Nasty, but safe.</p><p>Now, her best friend pointed a finger at her. \u201cYou do not tell stories like that within earshot of Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Mama Bear. She has the ex-Slayer for a father and the kick-ass Guild Director for a mother, plus a totally awesome hunter-born for an aunt.\u201d Patting Sara\u2019s shoulder, she said, \u201cKid\u2019s never going to be satisfied sitting at home doing jigsaw puzzles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeacon made her a miniature crossbow.\u201d The look on Sara\u2019s face was an odd mix between horrified and proud as she said, \u201cZoe\u2019s a crack shot already. Thank God her \u2018bolts\u2019 have sponge heads or we\u2019d all be dead several times over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019ll have every hunter in the Guild, and if I have my way, every angel and vampire in the Tower, looking out for her.\u201d</p><p>Sara brightened. \u201cThere is that . . . though it\u2019ll probably drive her to rebellion. We must fine-tune our cunning plans to insulate her from danger.\u201d</p><p>The subject of their machinations raced back right then, breathless with excitement. In her little fist was a feather of deep brown edged with black. \u201cAngel,\u201d the little girl said, stroking her finger gently over the filaments she\u2019d taken care not to crush.</p><p>\u201cWell done, baby.\u201d Beaming, Sara crouched down again. \u201cDo you want me to keep it safe for you?\u201d</p><p>Sara didn\u2019t speak again until Zoe had returned to her play, and when she did, her words were heavy with concern, her face solemn. \u201cVivek\u2019s going to need us after he wakes up. I can\u2019t bear to think he might have to keep his distance.\u201d</p><p>Neither could Elena. \u201cI\u2019ve got an idea on how we can make sure he has that support without him violating his oath to Raphael and the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, she tracked Aodhan to the top of one of the massive towers of the George Washington Bridge, his legs hanging over the side as he sat atop the metal frame, and his eyes on the traffic below. He\u2019d have been a hazardous distraction had it been a sunny day, but the overcast sky kept the sunlight from refracting off him, the drivers unaware they were being watched.</p><p>She thought about how to bring herself down safely on the relatively narrow surface, and managed it on her second attempt. \u201cNot bad.\u201d Grinning, she didn\u2019t draw attention to the fact that Aodhan\u2019s hand had shot out to grab her when it appeared she might slip and fall. Automatic though it had no doubt been, it was a sign the angel\u2019s dislike for touch wasn\u2019t so deeply rooted as to trump his instinct to protect.</p><p>\u201cYour balance is excellent,\u201d Aodhan said, his expression thoughtful, \u201cbut you need to strengthen the muscles used to hold a low hover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny specific exercises?\u201d she asked, happy to learn anything that would make her more efficient in the air.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Attention returning to the passing traffic, he added, \u201cI can teach you.\u201d</p><p>Curious as to what had him so captivated, she took a seat beside him, careful to ensure their wings didn\u2019t brush. \u201cAre you looking for someone?\u201d</p><p>A shake of his head. \u201cI find myself fascinated by the fact that even though the river was full of blood less than a day past, it appears to be business as usual for those who call this land home.\u201d</p><p>Elena laughed. \u201cNew Yorkers are a tough breed, Aodhan.\u201d Reaching back, she tightened her ponytail. \u201cKick us and we might go down, but we\u2019ll come back up with fury in our eye and grit in our souls.\u201d She loved the bloody-minded strength of her city. \u201cNo outsider will ever see us cry.\u201d</p><p>Eyes of shattered glass met her own, her face reflected back at her in startlingly beautiful splinters. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten our talk of fear and aloneness,\u201d he said, before shifting his gaze toward Manhattan. \u201cYou and this city teach me much about coming back after pain and fear. You\u2019re right\u2014I\u2019ve licked my wounds long enough.\u201d</p><p>Stunned at the openness with which he\u2019d referred to his emotional scars, she went with her gut. \u201cWe\u2019re all allowed time to curl up and recover from shock or hurt. But if it goes on too long, it begins to eat away at you.\u201d Elena knew that from experience, her angry pain where Jeffrey was concerned having left her with indelible scars of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s better to face the pain, neutralize the acid of the memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that fails? If I fall again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d she said, because the truth was a far better weapon against the darkness than any false hope. \u201cOver and over. Sometimes, it\u2019ll get so brutal that curling up and hiding again will seem the better choice.\u201d She thought of the way she\u2019d wanted to shut down in the aftermath of the nightmare in Amanat, of the exhilarating, hot-blooded knife fight that had followed. \u201cDon\u2019t give in, Aodhan, because you can\u2019t imagine the glory that waits on the other side. Fight to see it; fight to own it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His responding words held an undertone of heart-piercing joy she\u2019d never before heard from him. \u201cIt was worth the risk to play a game with my friend again,\u201d he said, the diamond-coated strands of his hair brushing against his cheekbone in the gentle wind. \u201cUntil I threw that ball at Illium over the river, I didn\u2019t understand I hadn\u2019t felt alive for over two hundred years.\u201d</p><p>A companionable silence fell between them for the next few minutes, until Aodhan said, \u201cYou searched me out on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I wanted to ask you something.\u201d Her eyes on his profile, his skin\u2014alabaster lovingly caressed with fine gold\u2014flawless. \u201cDoes Vivek belong to you? Since you Made him?\u201d</p> <p>Shaking his head, he said, \u201cAll vampires belong to the archangel in the territory where the vampire is Made. Supervisors are chosen from among the senior angels.\u201d</p><p>Damn. \u201cSo I\u2019m too young to supervise a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ordinary circumstances, yes; a new-Made vampire can sometimes be violent, difficult to control, and you are weak in angelic terms. Vivek Kapur, however,\u201d he said, making it clear he understood why they were having this discussion, \u201cwon\u2019t come into his full physical strength for some time and you have Raphael\u2019s resources at your command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s doable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is done.\u201d He held her gaze. \u201cYou understand you\u2019ll be responsible for the hundred years he has Contracted to serve\u2014and that service must be completed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. It\u2019ll breed resentment otherwise.\u201d As far as Elena knew, Dmitri\u2019s wife, Honor, was the sole exception to the Contract rule in Raphael\u2019s territory, and it was an exception not a single immortal would ever question. Dmitri had, after all, been Raphael\u2019s loyal second for a thousand years and counting, had spilled his own blood countless times in defense of his archangel.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for the term of his Contract?\u201d Aodhan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be with Tower communications as discussed, but as soon as he regains use of his limbs, I plan to put him in training at Guild Academy.\u201d It was what Vivek had decided on when they\u2019d discussed things prior to his Making; a man didn\u2019t need to be physically strong to become a lethal shot. Vivek planned to practice his shooting skills while building up muscle. \u201cIn the meantime, he\u2019ll be attending intensive lessons at the Academy to bone up on areas of practical knowledge he didn\u2019t need in his previous position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be enough,\u201d Aodhan said, just as she glimpsed wings of distinctive silver-blue changing course to head toward them. \u201cHe must be seen to be in your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe training will be to ready him for a position in my Guard.\u201d That wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d known to offer Vivek before, but it seemed the perfect solution. Still, Elena had no intention of forcing the decision on her fellow hunter; Vivek had already had too many choices taken from him. \u201cI trust him down to the bone and he\u2019s already saved my life more times than I can count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Aodhan said slowly. \u201cOnce your intent becomes known, it\u2019ll be assumed he was Made to serve in your Guard, explaining the extraordinary effort expended on his behalf.\u201d</p> <p>Illium arrived before she could respond, landing to grab a seat beside Aodhan. \u201cWhy are we sitting on a bridge presenting postcard shots to the tourists on that boat?\u201d he asked, waving at said tourists, who jumped up and down, their squeals carrying on the winds.</p><p>\u201cNo one noticed us until you deliberately did a low flyby over that same boat,\u201d Aodhan pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWave to the nice tourists, Sparkle. I promise it won\u2019t cause pestilence and firestorms.\u201d</p><p>Elena bit the inside of her cheek at Aodhan\u2019s glare\u2014she\u2019d never seen anyone crack his reserved shell. \u201cSparkle and Bluebell, nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Aodhan said, hands stubbornly on the girder, \u201cever repeat that. Illium seems to have forgotten I promised to separate his tongue from his mouth should he utter it again in his immortal lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch me first,\u201d Illium taunted . . . and fell backward over the edge of the bridge tower.</p><p>\u201cIllium!\u201d Elena cried out as he tumbled toward the heavy traffic, his wings tangled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s playing a trick,\u201d Aodhan said calmly. \u201cHe used to do that to his mother all the time, until one day, she did it back to him. I do not think I have ever seen Illium so chastised and white.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Aodhan, he\u2019s falling too fast.\u201d Heart in her throat, Elena twisted in desperate readiness to take off, try to help . . . except it was too late: Illium was about to be crushed between two trucks. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Silver-blue wings snapping out at unbelievable speed, his nimbleness on astonishing display. \u201cEllie\u201d\u2014wicked laughter in the gold when he flew back up\u2014\u201cyou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not talking to you.\u201d Breathless from the fright, she spoke to Aodhan instead. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell the Hummingbird he\u2019s been up to his old tricks.\u201d</p><p>Aodhan\u2019s lips kicked up in the slightest, slightest smile.</p><p>\u201cHey! Wait!\u201d Illium tried to get into her line of sight. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mother. I promise I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s phone rang right in the middle of Illium\u2019s plea for mercy. \u201cSara, I\u2014\u201d she began, wanting to share the good news about Vivek.</p><p>Her best friend cut in, tone stark. \u201cAshwini spotted a sick vampire in the Port Jersey container terminal. She thinks she can corral him, but she\u2019ll need the Tower to take him off her hands.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s blood turned to ice. \u201cWe\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>28</p><p>Ashwini was bleeding badly from cuts on her arms and scratches on her face when Elena arrived with Aodhan and Illium. \u201cSick vamp didn\u2019t touch me,\u201d she said, before Elena could ask. \u201cCuts are from before\u2014the retrieval I have immobilized in the car. Idiot male had nails like fucking knives and I was stupid enough to get too close.\u201d She nodded down the row of shipping containers. \u201cYour vamp is in there. I managed to herd him into a dead end.\u201d</p><p>Elena went in with Illium and Aodhan, while Ash watched their backs, in case there was more than a single infected vampire in the area.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch him,\u201d she said to the others when they spotted the vamp, who was indeed mobile. \u201cOne thing to believe we can\u2019t be infected, another to know.\u201d</p><p>The vamp had seen them, too, was trying to shuffle-run across the wide space, his fingers in a rigid clawed position and his eyes red. The pustules on his face had burst, the ones on his arms infected.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d she called out.</p><p>No response, the vampire continuing to close the distance between them.</p><p>Taking her lightweight crossbow from where she\u2019d strapped it to her thigh, she took aim at the vampire\u2019s left leg. He didn\u2019t even hesitate, leaving her no choice but to fire.</p><p>The shot was clean, the vampire going down with a high-pitched scream that just sounded wrong. Her gut roiled at his agony, though she knew the wound would heal within hours. \u201cKeir said a live victim might help him better understand the disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll arrange a retrieval team in suitable biohazard gear, then contact the healer.\u201d Aodhan lifted off in a whisper of sound.</p><p>The vampire continued to scream as if hot pokers were being driven into his flesh. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d The fact that his suffering might help save the lives of others didn\u2019t make it seem any less like torture. And that was a line she would never cross. \u201cWe have to end\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Illium retrieved his sword, Lightning, from the sheath on his back. \u201cHe is not in such pain. The location of the injury means it hurts going in, but it\u2019s only a dull pulse once the bolt is embedded.\u201d Striding forward, he put the tip of his sword on the vampire\u2019s chest while staying out of reach of the creature\u2019s torn, bloodied fingernails. \u201cQuiet.\u201d</p><p>The vampire froze.</p><p>Crossbow raised to cover Illium, Elena walked close enough to look into the vampire\u2019s face, and what she saw made pity rain in her veins. \u201cYou want to die.\u201d Those bloody eyes held a glimmer of true consciousness, enough that this vampire understood what was happening to him even though he couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t kill,\u201d the vampire said, a tear rolling down his face, the liquid pinky red. \u201cCan\u2019t kill.\u201d</p><p>Can\u2019t kill?</p><p>\u201cDid you try to kill yourself?\u201d she asked, but he was gone, febrile madness crawling over his eyes to leave him clawing out chunks of his own face.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t watch this.\u201d Not wanting to end the vampire\u2019s life when Keir might be able to help him, she took a gun and flipped it, intending to knock him out with a tap to the head.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Illium stared at the vampire, his eyes burning true gold . . . and the sick male stopped writhing, his hands falling to the sides and absolute peace in his expression as his lashes closed.</p><p>Elena looked at Illium with new eyes. He was, she realized, not just powerful. He was becoming a power.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that, Ellie?\u201d Sliding away his sword, darkness in the gold. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot of you. I just realized you might one day leave the Seven.\u201d No one as powerful as she suspected Illium would eventually become would want to be in service to another\u2014if that was even a choice. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you not being a part of this city, of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon.\u201d A dazzling smile that erased the shadows, his wings spreading to brush her own before he folded them back in. \u201cForget the coming war, the Tower would fall down without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo modest.\u201d Her smile faded as her eyes landed on the vampire, who slept so peacefully and who she knew would probably never wake, though she hoped Keir could save him. \u201cWhat does it say about the archangel behind this, that he has the ability to create disease?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>Yes, unfortunately, she did. Power corrupted, and often the corruption was absolute and ugly.</p><p>Glancing at the angel, beautiful and gifted, who crouched down to more closely examine the victim, his wings a carpet of exquisite blue and silver on the concrete, she hoped that when the time came, when his power matured to its full strength, he\u2019d have someone who\u2019d act as his anchor, as she and Raphael did for one another. She couldn\u2019t bear to think of Illium corrupted. Not Illium.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The vampire died twelve hours later, having never wakened from his sleep. \u201cIt was a blessing,\u201d Keir said, before he left the city\u2014the healer had arrived in time to examine the victim while he lived. \u201cThe disease had eaten its way into his internal organs, would\u2019ve caused him excruciating pain had he been conscious.\u201d</p><p>Keir\u2019s tests had also shown the male had had a genetic abnormality that made him less susceptible to the virus, though, as they\u2019d seen, not immune. As to how he\u2019d been infected, that was unknown. However, interestingly, he\u2019d just returned to the country after a business trip to China.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re wrong and it is Lijuan,\u201d Raphael said to Illium as they flew back after escorting Keir to the jet, \u201cthen she\u2019s gaining strength at a pace far beyond that of anyone else in the Cadre.\u201d It could well make her invincible.</p><p>Illium held position, wing to wing. \u201cIt\u2019s possible she could simply have facilitated the infection by offering safe passage through her lands to her coconspirator.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a great scenario, death and disease acting in concert, but better than Lijuan being the sole holder of such vicious \u2018gifts.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Snow started to fall again around them, the world below dusted in innocence and peace, but the illusion didn\u2019t last. Early the next day, a plane bound for New York, its point of origin Shanghai, made an emergency medical landing in San Francisco, the human pilot sending a request for Tower assistance through air traffic control.</p><p>To the mortal pilot\u2019s credit, he refused to permit anyone else aboard the plane until the arrival of the Tower team, his actions containing the disease within the steel belly of the aircraft. All seventeen vampires on board proved to be sick, their bodies grotesquely contorted, sores on their faces.</p><p>The humans were placed in isolation for forty-eight hours, then released after a thorough check showed no signs of infection, while the vampires went into strict medical quarantine.</p><p>Five days later, they began to recover\u2014and according to Keir, all now had an immunity to the disease. It was the first good news they\u2019d had. \u201cOur enemy became impatient and overreached,\u201d Raphael said to Elena that morning, the two of them going through different martial arts routines on the lawn of the Enclave house. \u201cKeir now believes we may have the ability to create a vaccine, though it\u2019ll take considerable time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some good news, at least.\u201d Elena completed her kata and picked up a small towel to wipe the sweat off her face, the sun shining this morning, though the snow hadn\u2019t melted. \u201cWhat about vampiric travel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHighly restricted.\u201d Raphael\u2019s expression was that of the archangel he was\u2014cold and resolute. \u201cNews has begun to spread of the disease and most vampires are voluntarily restricting themselves. Anyone who attempts to defy the order will be dealt with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She knew it had to frustrate those vampires who needed to travel for business or other professional commitments, but it wasn\u2019t only their lives at stake. \u201cIf that vamp pilot hadn\u2019t been hit by a car and replaced an hour before takeoff, this could\u2019ve been a far bigger disaster.\u201d Going to stand in front of her archangel as he finished his own exercises, she placed her hands on the warmth of his skin, his upper body bare.</p><p>\u201cAt any other time,\u201d Raphael said, eyes furious, \u201cI would launch a preemptive strike to halt any further sneak assaults, but with my forces decimated, the only option is to intensify our defensive position. We simply do not have enough people to protect the city and launch an attack at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her arms around him, Elena leaned into his body, the heat of his fury far more welcome to her than the strange cold after the river ran with blood. \u201cI\u2019m going to see the injured angels after breakfast.\u201d She held on tighter. \u201cBeing around you and the Seven, I\u2019d begun to get a distorted idea of how quickly angels healed\u2014and I didn\u2019t understand just how bad the side effects of that drug could be.\u201d The men and women in the infirmary were growing back their torn-off limbs and ravaged organs a literal inch at a time, their pain so excruciating, it drove many to tears.</p><p>Her own eyes burned as she said, \u201cIzak was sobbing when I arrived yesterday, and he was so ashamed I\u2019d seen him like that.\u201d A knot in her throat she had to swallow repeatedly to speak around. \u201cI told him there\u2019s no shame in acknowledging pain, that I\u2019ve cried when I\u2019ve been hurt and been no less strong for it, but I don\u2019t know if he believed me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael ran his hand over her hair. \u201cHe\u2019s a young boy at heart still and he adores you.\u201d A kiss against her temple. \u201cSpeak to him about what he\u2019ll have to do to prepare to be in your Guard. It\u2019ll give him the reassurance he needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell him he\u2019s about to be thrown into training with Dmitri and Illium? It might scare him.\u201d Izak was a baby in comparison to the lethal men in the Seven.</p><p>\u201cHe may feel fear, but if my judgment of him is correct, it\u2019ll also give him the impetus to fight through the agony to come so he can prove his claim to the position.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael\u2019s prediction turned out to be right on the money. Izak went sheet white when she told him exactly how tough he\u2019d have to become now that he was part of her Guard . . . then he took a deep breath and gave her an unexpectedly solemn, adult look. \u201cThank you. I thought perhaps you\u2019d only agreed to offer me the position because you felt sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving up the pity for when Galen arrives to take over your training.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI was hoping he\u2019d remain at the Refuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he does, you\u2019ll be shipped there.\u201d Forcing herself not to look at the raw red of his wounds, she kissed him on the forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sure he won\u2019t beat you black-and-blue every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEllie, I didn\u2019t know you were so mean.\u201d</p><p>Leaving him with a scowl on his face and a smile in his eyes, she visited with the others, all of whom she\u2019d begun to know on a personal basis. It was hard, seeing so much hurt done to people who now belonged to her, but if they could bear the unfathomable pain, she could bear to stand with them through the journey.</p><p>When she finished speaking to the final conscious angel, she had an informal visit with an active squadron, then checked to see if her sister, Beth, had canceled their appointment. No. Taking a deep breath and aware there were no more excuses, she swept off the Tower to fly to a storage locker in Brooklyn. She hadn\u2019t been there in weeks, not given everything that had been happening in the city . . . No, that had nothing to do with it; the truth was, she\u2019d been avoiding it even before the Falling.</p><p>As she landed, she didn\u2019t understand the reason for her resistance when she\u2019d been so painfully happy to find Jeffrey hadn\u2019t thrown out her mother\u2019s belongings after all. She didn\u2019t even know why she continued to keep everything in storage when there was plenty of space at the house for it. She hadn\u2019t even taken the precious quilt her mother had stitched by hand.</p><p>\u201cEllie?\u201d It was a wobbly sound.</p><p>Turning, Elena saw a sweetly curved strawberry blonde with eyes of translucent turquoise, her body covered in a flirty cherry-pink dress coat belted at the waist. She\u2019d paired the flared coat with knee-high black boots that matched the jaunty beret on her unbound hair, the whole outfit topped off with a gorgeous handmade fabric rose pinned to the top left of her coat.</p><p>Her baby sister had always liked to dress up, even when they\u2019d been kids. Belle had often treated her like a living doll, to Beth\u2019s great delight, adorning her in necklaces and lace as they put on a fashion show for the rest of the family. \u201cCalling me Ellie now?\u201d she teased with a smile, those memories untainted by blood and death. \u201cDon\u2019t let Jeffrey catch you. It\u2019s Elieanora.\u201d</p><p>Beth stuck out her tongue, but the moment was fleeting, her face falling as she looked at the door of the storage space. \u201cMama\u2019s stuff is really in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jeffrey had signed over everything to Elena.</p><p>Beth had been so young when Marguerite died that Elena didn\u2019t blame her father for his decision\u2014the items would have little meaning to Beth. But Elena knew the stories attached to each treasured piece and those stories were part of Beth\u2019s legacy, too.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, cupping her sister\u2019s wet-eyed face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Bethie, not if it makes you too sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d Hot tears running over Elena\u2019s hands. \u201cI want to remember . . . s-so I can tell the baby.\u201d</p><p>Elena froze for several seconds. \u201cHarrison?\u201d she got out at last.</p><p>A shamefaced nod. \u201cI know I threw him out and I meant it, too, but I love him, Ellie.\u201d The tears kept coming. \u201cEven though he didn\u2019t wait for me to be accepted, too, before being Made, I still love him.\u201d She swallowed, twisting her hands together. \u201cI think he\u2019s sorry for what he did now that he understands he\u2019ll have to bury me one day, bury our baby, too.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t like Harrison because, no matter his love for Beth, he\u2019d demonstrably wanted immortality more. He hadn\u2019t waited until Beth\u2019s tests were completed, tests that had shown her sister wasn\u2019t a viable Candidate; Beth would die horribly if she attempted to become a vampire. Elena wished she could alter that, but she couldn\u2019t. It was a biological fact written in stone. As it appeared Harrison was now beginning to comprehend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still, Elena admitted begrudgingly, he wasn\u2019t a total asshole; he had always treated Beth like a princess, including after she asked for a separation. Elena could almost believe he truly was sorry now that the consequences of his selfishness had begun to dawn.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>Drawing Beth into her arms at that trembling question, Elena kissed the top of her baby sister\u2019s head\u2014because Beth would always be that to her, Elena\u2019s relationship with Eve independent of the one she had with the sister who\u2019d toddled after her as a baby. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not mad, sweetheart.\u201d She squeezed her tight, Beth tucking her head against Elena\u2019s chest as she\u2019d done since childhood. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s shaky smile was as sweet as her heart when she drew back. \u201cI\u2019ll love this baby so much, Ellie. No one will ever hurt my kid\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>In that instant, Elena knew Beth had been far more sensitive to the tensions in the Big House than she\u2019d ever realized. \u201cCome on.\u201d Heart aching, she took her sister\u2019s hand and unlocked the storage space.</p><p>Once inside, they shut the door, the temperature-controlled room lit up by a cool white bulb, and began to go through the boxes. \u201cThis was yours.\u201d Laughing, Elena passed Beth a battered fire engine. \u201cYou wanted to be a fireman when you were little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Squeaking with laughter, Beth ran her fingers over the wooden toy. \u201cCan I keep it? For the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything here belongs to both of us, Bethie.\u201d She touched her sister gently on the cheek, unable to believe the family\u2019s baby was going to have a baby of her own. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d</p><p>They spent over two hours in the room and it wasn\u2019t until the end that Elena took out the quilt her mother had given her on her fifth birthday. Seated on one of the crates, she tried to breathe past the sorrow in her heart as she smoothed her hands over the pretty, printed cotton. \u201cMama used to sit in her sewing room working on her quilts while we played in the corner, designing clothes for your dolls.\u201d</p><p>Beth squeezed onto the same crate, cuddling close as she\u2019d always done. \u201cSuzy and Janey.\u201d Soft words, her fingers reverent on the flowered panels. \u201cThose were the names of my dolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It surprised her that Beth remembered\u2014her sister had locked her dolls permanently away in an act of childish grief and rage the day after Ari and Belle\u2019s funeral. When Elena asked why, she\u2019d said Suzy and Janey had been \u201cmean,\u201d that they\u2019d said Ari and Belle wouldn\u2019t ever come back.</p><p>\u201cMama used to sing to us as she cut out the pieces,\u201d Beth said, pulling the quilt across both their knees. \u201cFr\u00e8re Jacques, fr\u00e8re Jacques, Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?\u201d Her voice was soft, husky as she sang the nursery rhyme. \u201cSonnez . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSonnez les matines,\u201d Elena continued when her sister faltered. \u201cSonnez les\u2014\u201d</p><p>Then they were both crying, Beth curled up in Elena\u2019s arms, her body shaking, Elena\u2019s own eyes blinded as their teardrops fell to the quilt in a silent symphony. She\u2019d held Beth the day of Marguerite\u2019s funeral, too, her sister\u2019s body shivering in her arms, her eyes glazed with shock.</p><p>\u201cI want Mama,\u201d she\u2019d kept saying. \u201cWhy did Papa put her in the ground, Ellie? She doesn\u2019t like the cold. You have to tell him to bring her back. I want Mama. Please, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Today, Beth said nothing, but her heartbroken sobs told Elena her wish hadn\u2019t changed. About to become a mother herself, Beth wanted her own by her side.</p><p>29</p><p>Raphael watched Elena sleep, not the least surprised when she began to twist restlessly, a thin sheen of perspiration on her skin. She\u2019d come to him with pain in her eyes, what little she\u2019d told him of her time with Beth enough that he hadn\u2019t left her even after she fell asleep.</p><p>Wake up, Guild Hunter. He used what she called his \u201cArchangel\u201d tone, the words a command. It hadn\u2019t worked when she lay silent for a year after they fell together the day Manhattan went dark, but today, her eyes opened in a flicker of silver-gray.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d A whisper, her fingers weaving into his hair. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here.\u201d Covering her body with his own, her skin clammy, he cupped the side of her face as he initiated a tender kiss that told her what she was to him. When she shivered and wrapped her arms around him, he moved his hand down to caress her breast and the line of her hip.</p><p>It was only skin he touched on her top half, his consort having come to bed without her sleep T-shirt after discovering one of the wing-slit buttons had fallen off, but she wore panties from her lusciously impractical collection. Soft peach satin edged in white lace, this pair cupped her with exquisite perfection. Breaking the kiss to run his lips along her throat, he continued to stroke her breast to hip until her skin warmed, her breath no longer unsteady.</p><p>When he raised his head from her throat, it was to find her sensual eyed and lazy limbed, but she pushed at his chest, nudging him onto his back. He went, his hands on her hips as she straddled him, her wings draped behind her and her breasts lush temptation. \u201cWould you lead the dance this night, Guild Hunter?\u201d</p> <p>Shadows yet in her eyes, she leaned forward and, bracing her arms on either side of his head, dipped her head for a wetly sexual kiss, all tongue and teeth. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered in the aftermath. \u201cSo lie back and take it.\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed, the masculine sound a rough caress over Elena\u2019s skin. Shivering, she said, \u201cStop that,\u201d knowing full well he\u2019d pitched his voice to arouse.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d It was a purr, a thousand strands of exquisite fur.</p><p>Moaning, she kissed her way down his throat and chest, her panties having gone from damp to wet in the space of a heartbeat. \u201cSo not fair, but\u201d\u2014she licked her way along the fine line of hair on his navel\u2014\u201cthis should even the stakes.\u201d</p><p>No warning, no buildup, she took his cock into her mouth.</p><p>He jerked, his hand fisting in her hair as a groan left his chest. Whimpering at the way that sound rubbed across her intimate flesh, she swallowed deeper, pressing her tongue along the underside as she laved him with affection, the pleasure as much hers as his. Her scalp smarted when he tugged . . . so she grazed him with her teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou are playing dangerous games with your consort,\u201d came the rough warning from the magnificent man who was her own.</p><p>Sucking hard, she drew her mouth oh-so-slowly off the long, thick length of him. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t like it?\u201d she asked as innocently as she could.</p><p>He flipped her off him and onto her front so fast, she had no idea how he\u2019d managed it without tangling their wings. \u201cNow\u201d\u2014a dark warning\u2014\u201cit is your turn to be good and take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Hands fisted in the pillows, she bit her lower lip in anticipation of his touch and shivered when he slipped his fingers under the sides of her panties.</p><p>Hot breath, his mouth on the dip at her spine, his tongue flicking out to taste her skin before he drew her panties down over her butt and lower. Halting with them tangled around her thighs, he turned his attention to kissing her inner thighs, the panties trapping her when she tried to widen her stance.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>Nipping at her thigh in retaliation for that sensual complaint, he tugged off the panties and rose up over her again, his cock rigid against her back and his weight delicious as he leaned down to murmur in her ear. As he spoke, describing the erotic pleasures to which he\u2019d like to introduce her, his hand slipped under her body to squeeze her breast, tug at her nipple. When he asked her to let him into her mind, she didn\u2019t hesitate, the trust between them such that she knew he\u2019d never take advantage.</p><p>Pleasure flooded her body in slow waves, ripple after ripple, as if he\u2019d turned a switch in her mind. \u201cI can,\u201d he said against her throat, \u201cdo this to you at any time.\u201d His body shifting, the blunt head of his cock nudging at her hypersensitive entrance, her flesh creamy with welcome. \u201cSo long as I can touch your mind, I can bring you pleasure . . . even in the midst of a crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. You. Dare,\u201d she managed to get out between gasps as he thrust in with exquisite slowness, the hard steel of his cock relentless against her swollen flesh.</p><p>Masculine laughter, his hand continuing to squeeze and pet her breasts; his mouth shifting to the inner curve of her wings. The instant he licked directly along the edge where her wings emerged from her back, she went off like dynamite, clenching around him until he gripped her hip, pinned her down, and began to ride her, hard and deep.</p><p>Bucking up against him, her body out of control, she cried out his name as the orgasm peaked with a fury and felt him fall with her in a final, powerful thrust.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Later, as they lay tangled in bed, the near white of Elena\u2019s hair tumbling across his skin and her head on his shoulder, he gently squeezed her nape. \u201cWhat did you dream?\u201d</p><p>She went motionless, her hand folding into a fist against his chest. \u201cYou woke me up before anything really happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting into a bad habit, Elena.\u201d His voice was hard, the echoes of pleasure fading rapidly under a wave of anger.</p><p>Rising off his chest, his consort shoved her hair out of the way. \u201cDon\u2019t use that tone on me.\u201d It was a furious command, her eyes angry and alive and beautiful. \u201cWe\u2019re more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re more than that,\u201d he said, his own anger honed to a deadly edge, \u201cthen why do you keep lying to me?\u201d</p><p>White lines around her mouth, she swung away without replying. When she got out and began to dress, he did the same. His consort, he\u2019d begun to realize, did not do well in contained areas when driven by anger and nightmare, so he\u2019d give her the sky. The one thing he would not give her was distance.</p><p>They flew out three minutes later, heading seaward. The waves were high tonight, the sky dark once they left the lights of Manhattan behind. Elena flew and flew and he knew that, once again, she was pushing herself well beyond her limits when it came to the physical strength needed for endurance flights. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had nothing to do with determination and everything to do with physiological fact.</p><p>Elena\u2019s body simply hadn\u2019t developed the necessary musculature, immortality yet growing into her cells, but he didn\u2019t stop her headlong flight. Words would mean nothing, not when she was like this; no, she had to come face-to-face with the perilous risk she took without thought to the consequences.</p><p>And worse, this was the second time she\u2019d done the same thing. A third could well be lethal.</p> <p>If she fell from this height? It was doubtful she\u2019d survive. Even if her luck held, she\u2019d break every bone in her body, her organs collapsing from the impact. Young as she was, that would kill her\u2014either the actual injuries or the inevitable drowning. Unlike him, she couldn\u2019t yet survive without air.</p><p>Flying above her, high enough that she wouldn\u2019t feel hunted, he knew the exact instant she realized the danger. Immediately sweeping left and around, she headed homeward, but her wings had begun to falter, her body dipping lower to the water in erratic drops before she stabilized herself. Only for the pattern to repeat, her body dropping faster and longer each time.</p><p>Still she didn\u2019t ask for help.</p><p>Teeth gritted, he dropped close enough to assist, unable to allow her to cause herself harm, even to teach her a lesson. Are you planning to let your pride drag you to the bottom of the ocean?</p><p>Silence, her right wing so strained, he knew it could collapse at any instant. Winging his way in front of her in a burst of speed only another archangel could match, he turned and flew directly at her, grabbing her in his hold. He was careful to ensure his arms slid under her wings to avoid any further damage. \u201cClose your wings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, let me go.\u201d Jaw set, she shoved at his shoulders, her open wings causing significant drag. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tendons on your right wing are about to go. Just like last time. Do you wish to cripple yourself?\u201d He wanted to shake her. \u201cInjure the same area over and over, and you\u2019ll be grounded for years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Slamming fisted hands against his chest, she twisted, almost freeing herself because he hadn\u2019t expected such an irrational move.</p><p>\u201cLet me go or I swear to God I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse one of your blades on me?\u201d he asked, his arms steel around her. \u201cWould you draw my blood in earnest, Guild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>Fisted hands going still, she looked away, but folded in her wings at last. Her silence rasping against his senses, he gripped her chin with one hand, intending to tug her face toward him, force her to acknowledge his presence. She resisted . . . and then he felt a single hot droplet splash onto his hand.</p> <p>\u201cElena.\u201d</p><p>Her tears shocked him; he\u2019d seen his consort cry, but never during a fight between them. Such emotional manipulation was beyond her, and even now she dashed the wetness away, as if to refute their existence. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d he asked, concerned she\u2019d snapped a tendon before he caught her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Her answer infuriated him anew. \u201cYou\u2019re clearly not fine.\u201d His tone ice, he jerked up her chin. \u201cTell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time, it was Elena who interrupted. \u201cOr what? You\u2019ll take it from my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou question my honor now? Is this the trust you have in me?\u201d</p><p>Instead of looking shamefaced, she responded with unmasked fury. \u201cI trust you more than anyone else in the universe! That\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find it a burden to give me your trust?\u201d Fingers tightening on her chin, he spoke through white-hot anger. \u201cYou are mine, Elena. Your trust is my right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething is happening to you!\u201d It was a scream, her fisted hands raining blows onto his shoulders and her eyes locked on the spreading line of darkest red along his temple.</p><p>\u201cI am going nowhere,\u201d he said, realizing the shape of the fear that had stalked her dreams.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that! We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d Her fingers on his temple. \u201cEvery time you drop the glamour, I see how much further it\u2019s spread, how much more of your skin it\u2019s begun to cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dying.\u201d It took conscious control to keep his rage at those who\u2019d done this to her, seeded such a grave fear into her heart, out of his voice. Marguerite Deveraux, after all, was forever out of his reach. \u201cI am an archangel.\u201d</p><p>Chest heaving and cheeks red, she gritted out her reply. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to placate me with arrogance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not arrogance. It\u2019s reality,\u201d he said, holding her gaze so she\u2019d hear him through the roar of her anger. \u201cThere are very, very few things on this earth that can kill an archangel, and disease is not one of them. Never in our history has an archangel succumbed to illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires aren\u2019t meant to die of disease, either,\u201d she snapped back, but her fingers were gentle as she touched the blemish on his face again. \u201cEvery time I look at this, I get so scared. I thought I had a handle on it, but it\u2019s like this constant icy fist around my heart. I can\u2019t breathe, I can\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>A thought and the mark was gone, erased with the illusion of glamour.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t hide things from me!\u201d Elena realized what she\u2019d said as soon as the words left her mouth, her eyes locking with those of a hue so pure, it had no true parallel on this earth.</p><p>He was still angry at her, that much was clear, that heartbreaking blue kissed by an icily metallic edge. Yet even in his anger he held her safe, when she\u2019d done her best to break every bone in her body with her reckless flight.</p><p>Not once. Twice.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, and when he raised an imperious eyebrow, said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her Guild trainers would\u2019ve kicked her ass if she\u2019d dared do something this lamebrained as a cadet. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I almost fucked things up so badly a second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill there be a third?\u201d The question snapped like a whip.</p><p>\u201cNo. Even a hardheaded hunter like me learns her lessons after two near-lethal mistakes.\u201d If she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d have been long dead by now. \u201cThank you for the assist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to know I have some use.\u201d A voice so cold, it was a wonder she didn\u2019t have hypothermia.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d She might\u2019ve been an idiot with the flight, but that didn\u2019t mean he could walk all over her. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more intertwined with anyone my entire adult life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it makes you afraid.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught, and she wanted to say no, to remind him she was a blooded hunter, fear nothing but a tool. But what she said was, \u201cYes,\u201d because this fear threatened to strangle the life out of her. \u201cI haven\u2019t been this afraid since I realized the monster was in our house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t understand?\u201d Every muscle in his body went taut, his voice so rigidly controlled, she knew he battled brutal emotion. \u201cHave you forgotten what I said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know fear until you, Elena. Use the power wisely.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she wrapped her arms tight around his neck. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d Lips against his, she reminded him of something, too. \u201cI cut you some slack when you went all caveman. Cut me some here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t almost kill myself when I went \u2018caveman,\u2019\u201d he said, his kiss hard and hot and possessive, all of it spiced with molten anger. \u201cI didn\u2019t make you watch as I did my best to cause myself mortal harm.\u201d</p><p>30</p><p>Her seriously pissed-off consort flew Elena almost the entire way home.</p><p>Now that the madness of the fear-laced anger had passed, she was damn well embarrassed. Not only that, but her wings felt like jelly where they weren\u2019t threatening to (painfully) detach from her flesh. Still\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t have you carrying me into Manhattan. If Ransom spots me on his high-powered telescope, he won\u2019t stop teasing me until I\u2019m at least eighty-seven.\u201d The truth was, her returning home in Raphael\u2019s arms might be seen as a sign of possible weakness by their enemies, should any be watching.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s responding glance told her he knew the real reason for her request. \u201cNo lies, no half-truths. Can you deal with any flight?\u201d</p><p>Elena took her time assessing her body. \u201cYes, as long as we keep it lazy, like we\u2019re out for a stroll.\u201d It would hurt like a bitch later if her archangel decided she should suffer for her sins and refuse to heal her\u2014and she\u2019d deserve it if he did\u2014but a few extra minutes of gentle flight wouldn\u2019t alter that for the worse.</p><p>\u201cBe ready to open your wings.\u201d Releasing her with care, Raphael positioned himself above her.</p><p>She knew it was so he could grab her if her wing snapped. Archangel?</p><p>Yes, Consort?</p><p>Yup, he was definitely still supremely pissed. I just wanted to tell you something I probably don\u2019t say enough, she said, as they flew over the George Washington Bridge, her altitude low enough that she could see the late-night commuters. I love you.</p><p>That has never been in question.</p><p>His icy answer made her grin. Yes, the love had never been in question\u2014on either side. I wonder if Montgomery has cake in the kitchen. Back when she\u2019d been mortal, she\u2019d sometimes wondered why no one ever saw an overweight angel. Now she knew exactly how much muscle strength it took to fly, energy burning off with each wingbeat. She was eating five times what she\u2019d done as a hunter, and just barely managing to keep her weight at a healthy level. Do immortal bodies run at a higher metabolic rate?</p><p>No one has ever tested that to my knowledge, but yours is undoubtedly doing so as immortality grows deeper into your cells.</p><p>That made sense, she thought, just as the sky in the distance began to boil black and thunderous. \u201cRaphael.\u201d</p><p>Land on the closest surface. Now!</p><p>Looking down, she saw a passing barge and was down three seconds later, Raphael landing beside her. The crew stared slack jawed, but didn\u2019t approach. \u201cI have my cell phone,\u201d she said, having stuffed it into a pocket from force of habit. \u201cI can call Aodhan\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Raphael\u2019s eyes remained on the roiling blackness as he spoke. \u201cAll of the angels in the air have received the instruction to land.\u201d</p><p>Skin crawling at the phenomenon, Elena made a different call. \u201cThere might be another incident,\u201d she told Sara, knowing that as Guild Director, her best friend had access to an automated warning system that could send out a text message to every hunter in the vicinity. \u201cTell everyone to watch for\u2014shit, tell them to watch for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p> <p>Hanging up, Elena stood with her body aligned to Raphael\u2019s, their eyes skyward as the barge continued to move along the river. The crew had their heads tilted back now, voices pitched high and words tumbling one over the other as they spoke rapidly in an unfamiliar language.</p><p>Elena\u2019s faint hope that the unnatural clouds would just disperse or float out to sea died a quick death when the boiling patch settled right over the barge, following it as the watercraft traversed the river. Then the cloud began to fall at high speed, causing the crew to scream, duck, but Elena and Raphael kept their eyes on the sky.</p><p>So they saw the \u201ccloud\u201d wasn\u2019t a cloud at all.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not falling.\u201d That alone distinguished this phenomenon from the one that had begun the strange events.</p><p>As they watched, hundreds\u2014thousands\u2014of birds landed all around them, until the tiny winged beings completely covered the barge, their combined weight making it sink deeper into the water. The truly eerie thing was their absolute silence. No chirping, no fighting even where they sat on top of one another, nothing . . . but for the fact that every single set of tiny bird eyes was locked on them.</p> <p>No, not on them. On Raphael.</p><p>Okay, creepy. They\u2019re staring at you.</p><p>Or something is.</p><p>The birds rose into the air in a mass of wings the next instant, dispersing so fast it was difficult to imagine they\u2019d been there as a cohesive force\u2014until she looked at Raphael. His skin burned with cold power, as if a cool blue light glowed beneath the surface of his skin.</p><p>Come, Consort.</p><p>Heart thumping against her ribs at the piercing ice of his mental tone, she ignored the cringing crew to turn into his arms for the liftoff. He released her as soon as they\u2019d gained the correct altitude, both of them angling toward the Tower in silence. Aodhan was waiting on the balcony outside Raphael\u2019s office, his eyes reflecting the glittering night of Manhattan in jagged shards.</p> <p>\u201cNo casualties or injuries,\u201d the angel said, \u201cno reports of anything except for garbled messages originating from a barge on the Hudson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Aodhan.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until the angel left, she walked to stand beside Raphael on the very edge of the railingless balcony that looked out over the nightscape of their city. \u201cArchangel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He turned, and on his face, the red blemish pulsed.</p><p>Again, he was distant. But this time, she didn\u2019t wait. Shifting to stand toe to toe with him, she drew him into a kiss that tasted of the sea and of darkness, cold, silence. Heavy and old, so old, as if the silence had grown for thousands upon thousands of years, until it was an entity that lived and breathed.</p><p>Shivering, she pressed closer, her breasts crushed against his chest, his hand fisted in her hair. It wasn\u2019t until she broke the passionate ice of the kiss, her chest spiderwebbed with frost, that she saw. \u201cYour irises\u201d\u2014that incredible, unearthly blue\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA temporary effect.\u201d Raphael could feel the darkness as it crawled through him, chill and drenched with a strange, potent power. It sank into his cells, an intruder the angelfire inside him attempted to eliminate.</p><p>He fought his instincts, knowing he needed to own this power, hold it\u2014except it threatened to own him. Even now, his blood felt as if it crystallized into frost, his view of the world filtered through a layer of chilling remoteness, until only Elena was drenched in color. Vibrant and alive and with the wings of a warrior, she burned against a backdrop of gray, the rest of the world meaning nothing to him.</p> <p>If he needed to obliterate this city to win the war, it would be an inconvenience that could later be remedied. Millions would die, but he was an immortal, knew others would replace them given enough time. All that mattered was the power, holding on to it, shaping it, becoming it.</p><p>Fingers on his cheeks, the silver ring around Elena\u2019s irises liquid fire in the night. \u201cNo.\u201d It was a deadly quiet word. \u201cIt can\u2019t have you. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>And he knew. Shoving Elena behind him so she wouldn\u2019t unbalance and fall, he rose into the sky, high above the clouds, past where even Illium or Aodhan could fly. Land! It was an order blasted out to every single angel in the vicinity.</p><p>Then, and with only the slightest hesitation at the loss of the profound violence of power, he released the dark matter of it in a lightning storm that cracked the sky.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Elena fought the screaming urge to go to Raphael, the need a raw compulsion in her chest as she tried to use the sense of reason she hadn\u2019t used earlier. Not only were her wings in bad shape, she\u2019d be struck down by a lightning strike within seconds of takeoff. There was too much of it in the air to avoid.</p><p>She could see angels landing wherever they could all over the city, many who\u2019d been up high simply folding their wings so they\u2019d plummet closer to the ground in an attempt to outrace the lightning, before snapping out their wings at the last minute. She witnessed a few close calls but no injuries, Raphael\u2019s warning having come in just enough time, but her archangel, he burned in the center of a cold white storm.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d Illium\u2019s hand on her nape, Aodhan on her other side. \u201cThe Sire has gained another ability.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought, he\u2019d just rejected one, but kept her silence.</p><p>An hour, an eon later, there was no more lightning in the sky and Raphael winged down to hold out a hand toward her. Taking it, she stepped off the edge, their hands parting as she swept around to fly side by side with him, heading homeward\u2014though she was dead certain he had her in his sights the entire time, ready to catch her if her injured wing threatened to collapse. But she made it home, where Raphael used his healing ability to ameliorate the damage.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if the reminder of her injury, and how it had come about, reignited his temper, but he sent his power into her in silence, the warmth of it an embrace. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine now, Guild Hunter.\u201d A kiss on the back of her neck.</p><p>Skin heating in response, she turned in his arms, the glow from the library fireplace gilding them both in gold. \u201cTalk to me, Archangel.\u201d If she had a tendency to shut down, pretend things didn\u2019t matter, then Raphael had the habit of handling everything himself. Not surprising, given his status as an archangel, but he had her now.</p><p>Walking to the square crystal decanter on a side table, he poured a splash of amber liquid into a tumbler and threw the liquor back in a single hit. Alcohol didn\u2019t affect angels as it did humans, and it had no effect on Raphael, but he\u2019d told her he liked the kick of heat, the taste. \u201cIf this is the emergence of a new power,\u201d he said, the fire reflecting off the faceted tumbler, \u201cthen it\u2019s one I cannot control.\u201d</p><p>Taking the tumbler from him when his fingers tightened, threatening to turn the crystal to dust, she put it down. \u201cYou\u2019ve only had two chances to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt changes me,\u201d he said, cutting through her words. \u201cYou sensed it attempting to take control. You were right.\u201d His fingers clenched on the mantelpiece, his wings arcing to the floor in a display of white fire. \u201cI could murder millions in the grip of it and not blink.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach lurched, her eyes rising from the stunning beauty of his wings to his face. \u201cDrop the glamour.\u201d The instant he did, she swore.</p><p>Striding over, she traced the dark red with a fingertip. \u201cIt\u2019s grown.\u201d Not only that but it had curved with a jagged edge, the line thicker, darker. \u201cThis can\u2019t be coincidence\u2014it\u2019s linked to the power fluctuations in some way.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shoved away from the mantel. \u201cIt matters nothing, not when to utilize the power, I must allow it to erase my personality. I may as well give the city to Lijuan if the Raphael who rules it is one forever in the Quiet.\u201d</p><p>Elena tried to think past her instinctive repudiation of the idea of him permanently in that place of malevolent calm where he was no longer the man she loved, the man who loved her. \u201cThe birds,\u201d she said suddenly, something niggling at her. \u201cThe first time they fell, is it possible it wasn\u2019t one event but two?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s eyes, no trace of that cold liquid black in their depths, locked with hers. \u201cYou believe it was mischance they got caught up in the wave of disease that took down the angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sky boiled just like tonight,\u201d she said, trying to put her instinctive realization into words. \u201cCould be they were coming to you and were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time\u2014remember, they were moving from Manhattan to the Enclave.\u201d</p><p>Wings continuing to flicker with that illusion of luminous white fire until he moved out of range of the firelight, he pushed open the doors to the lawn. \u201cYou may be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t give us any answers, does it?\u201d</p><p>Standing in the doorway, his eyes on the pristine snow beyond, he said, \u201cThe power, it seduced, whispering to me to weave it into my own cells.\u201d A glance over his shoulder. \u201cBefore you, I would\u2019ve no doubt accepted it and it would\u2019ve destroyed me from the inside out.\u201d</p><p>She followed him when he stepped out onto the stretch of unbroken white, a snowflake falling to dust her cheek, her wings kissed by the soft, whimsical rain. It wasn\u2019t heavy, just enough to be pretty, covering up their tracks from the house in a glittering veil, the unexpected stars above making the ice crystals sparkle.</p><p>It seemed wrong to talk about the horrors of war and power in such a magical moment, but they had no choice. \u201cBefore you,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI was shut up inside my heart, protecting it from harm, and never knowing the glory I missed.\u201d She linked her hand to his. \u201cYou and I, we\u2019re a unit. I dare any evil on this earth to tear us apart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Spreading his wings, Raphael drew his warrior into his arms, and as he closed those wings around them both, he knew that while war was inevitable, the loss of his soul was not. The chill price of immortality was one Elena would never allow him to pay.</p><p>\u201cI would rather die as Elena than live as a shadow.\u201d</p><p>His consort\u2019s words from their courtship\u2014though perhaps she would not call it that\u2014whispered into his mind. Raphael had no intention of dying or of surrendering his territory to anyone, but should he ever be forced to make that choice, he would rather go into the last goodnight as Raphael, the archangel who fell in love with a mortal, than Raphael the archangel so bloated with power that he no longer understood such an emotion.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing good came out of tonight, though,\u201d Elena said, leaning back so their eyes met, her hair wildfire against the backdrop of white. \u201cThe lightning storm will give anyone getting ready to attack second thoughts about exactly what you\u2019ve gained in the Cascade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly, but what troubles me is why they haven\u2019t already launched a direct assault.\u201d Even with everything he and his people had done to hide the extent of the harm done to the city\u2019s defensive force, their enemy had to suspect he or she had struck a vicious blow. \u201cIt makes me believe they wait for something, something with enough chance of so fundamentally changing the balance of power in any war that they willingly risk giving New York extra time to prepare, rather than capitalizing on the damage already done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need that cake now.\u201d</p><p>Startled laughter in his blood, unexpected light in the shadows, the taste of snow in her kiss. And he knew that come what may, they\u2019d stand together. In the light and in the terrible darkness.</p><p>31</p> <p>Jason\u2019s report at noon the next day made it deadly clear what they would face when the hostilities did begin. \u201cLijuan is openly consolidating her troops,\u201d Raphael told Elena after scanning the report.</p><p>\u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer numbers have always been greater than mine\u2014a consequence of her age.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t need Raphael to spell it out to realize that Lijuan had been kept in check previously only because every member of the Cadre was more or less equal in power, thus Lijuan risked death in a fight. That clearly no longer applied. \u201cIs there any chance New York isn\u2019t the target?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He showed her a piece of heavy paper, the texture rough silk, as if it had been handmade. \u201cA courier brought this in just before you came up from the infirmary.\u201d</p><p>Elena couldn\u2019t read the message, but recognized the language as an ancient angelic one she\u2019d seen in one of Jessamy\u2019s history books. \u201cIt\u2019s a declaration of war,\u201d she guessed.</p> <p>\u201cLijuan is \u2018civilized\u2019 to the end.\u201d Expression harsh, he glanced back down at his spymaster\u2019s report. \u201cJason also confirms there is no indication whatsoever that she has gained the ability to cause disease, and the fact she wasn\u2019t in the vicinity of Amanat at the time of Kahla\u2019s infection bears out the theory she has a conspirator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we might be about to face not one but two enemy archangels.\u201d Meanwhile, the Tower infirmary remained full, only three of the injured fighters having recovered enough to rejoin their squadrons. The good news, however, was that with the transfers from outside the main city, they weren\u2019t as badly disadvantaged as Lijuan might believe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll also have the benefit of fighting on home soil,\u201d Raphael pointed out when she shared her thoughts, \u201cwhile her fighters must arrive on the wing. I\u2019ll speak to Elijah, test the strength of our alliance\u2014the odds change dramatically if we and our people stand together.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Raphael to speak to the other archangel, she flew out with the intention of sneaking a visit with Eve during her break at school. Her sister\u2019s recent e-mails had held an undertone of anxiousness she didn\u2019t like and she planned to get to the bottom of it\u2014just because the world was going to hell didn\u2019t mean Elena was about to abandon the little girl who needed her.</p><p>However, she\u2019d barely flown a block when the dull throbbing at her temples suddenly increased in volume and duration. \u201cDamn it.\u201d The pulsing headache was her own fault; she hadn\u2019t gone back to bed the night before and, regardless of Raphael\u2019s healing, she\u2019d given her body a shock with her unforgiving flight over the sea. It was now telling her she either rested or exhaustion would kick her in the ass without warning.</p><p>The throbbing turned into stabbing.</p><p>Wincing, she realized she\u2019d be of no use to Eve if she was distracted by a migraine. And, if she timed it right, she could catch her sister after school and before Jeffrey returned home\u2014Eve\u2019s mother, Gwendolyn, knew Eve needed the guidance of a fellow hunter, wouldn\u2019t block Elena from talking to her daughter.</p><p>Decision made, Elena detoured to the Enclave house and, waving off Montgomery\u2019s offer of lunch, went upstairs. \u201cSoon as I get up,\u201d she reassured him, when the butler frowned and reminded her Keir had ordered she eat regular, high-protein meals to fuel her growing immortality.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, stripped of her weapons and boots, but still in her combat leathers, she lay down on top of the comforter for a power nap that\u2019d keep her going for the rest of the day.</p><p>She dreamed again, but this dream, it was different from the one that had nearly broken her in Amanat. There was no blood. No death. No screams.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d Marguerite looked up from the cake she mixed at the counter, streaks of flour on her cheeks from where she\u2019d no doubt pushed back recalcitrant tendrils of hair as pale as Elena\u2019s.</p><p>Her father called it \u201ccaptured sunlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit, ch\u00e9rie. Talk to your mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama?\u201d Hope incandescent in her blood, she crossed the gleaming kitchen floor to take a seat on the counter across from the beautiful butterfly who was her mother. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy silly Elena.\u201d Marguerite laughed, the long dangles at her ears tinkling with the faint, familiar music that was a part of so many of Elena\u2019s memories of her mother. \u201cYou know it\u2019s your sister\u2019s birthday tomorrow. This cake must set overnight. Why don\u2019t you chop the black cherries?\u201d</p><p>Picking up the small knife that was the only one with which Marguerite would trust her, Elena began to cut up the cherries into smaller pieces, looking every so often to her mother for encouragement. She\u2019d been here, in this instant before, her fingers smaller, her legs hanging off the stool on which she perched, and her sister Belle at the kitchen table behind her.</p><p>\u201cShush, short stuff,\u201d Belle had said when Elena tried to talk to her about a television show. \u201cI have to write a tome about Romeo and Juliet for English homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I dance with you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you sneak me some cherries.\u201d</p><p>Today, Marguerite and Elena were alone in the kitchen, though Belle\u2019s writing pad and pen sat on the table, as if she\u2019d stepped out for a second. \u201cMama, can I ask you a question?\u201d she said, continuing to use the little knife, though she had longer, sharper blades in her arm sheaths.</p><p>\u201cMy pretty baby, you can ask your mama anything.\u201d Her eyes sparkling, her smile radiant. \u201cNot so big, Elena. Little pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mama.\u201d Concentrating, she cut some more and showed her mother. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d A caress of loving fingertips on her cheek before Marguerite returned to her mixing. \u201cWhat was your question?\u201d</p><p>Elena kept her head down, unable to look at her mother as she asked the question that had haunted her for more than a decade. \u201cWhy?\u201d It was a whisper. \u201cWhy did you leave me and Beth?\u201d Her lower lip quivered, her eyes burned. \u201cPapa was broken. You know he was broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me those cherries.\u201d Accepting the glass bowl when Elena handed it over, her vision blurred, Marguerite tipped them into the mix. \u201cYou and your sister are living pieces of my heart, Elena, cut out of my chest at the moment of birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you left.\u201d Jerking up her head, she yelled the accusation. \u201cYou left us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved your elder sisters, too, b\u00e9b\u00e9. I couldn\u2019t bear to think of my Ariel and my Mirabelle alone in the dark.\u201d</p><p>Sobbing, Elena wiped the backs of her hands over her eyes, her chest hurting with the force of her childish sobs. \u201cI miss Ari and Belle so much. I miss you. You left Beth and me all alone, too, and now there\u2019s no one to teach Beth how to be a mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, oh, I know.\u201d Walking around the counter, Marguerite took Elena\u2019s tearstained face in her soft, flour-dusted hands. \u201cBut I have told you, Elena, you were always the strongest of my babies. Even my wild Belle, she had a heart that carried bruises always, but my Elena, my Elena is strong. Like my mama. Did you know her name was Elena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>A smile that lit up her face to such beauty, she was the prettiest woman Elena had ever seen. \u201cYes, it was her, how you say?\u201d One of those unexpected but familiar pauses in her otherwise fluent English. \u201cHer home name. Only her best friends used it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. I told you stories about her during the time my little Beth used my womb as a football pitch.\u201d Laughter that was melted honey against Elena\u2019s skin, sweet and a little wild. \u201cTales of my strong mama to my strong baby.\u201d</p><p>Elena jutted out her chin, her anger intermingled with a bleak happiness at being able to feel her mother\u2019s touch again. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t remember much about Grandmama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember enough.\u201d The scent of gardenias lush and fragrant in the air, her dark gold skin silken, her hands fine boned when Elena lifted her own to hold her mother\u2019s to her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI left you the day that beast came into our house,\u201d Marguerite whispered. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Elena thought of the bloody streaks on the carpet that told of her mother\u2019s brutal fight to get to her daughters, the broken look in her eyes when she understood her two firstborn would be forever silent, and knew Marguerite told no lies. She\u2019d died that day along with Ari and Belle, leaving behind an empty shell. \u201cI still needed you,\u201d Elena insisted, ignoring the truth because it hurt too much. \u201cYou would\u2019ve been okay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish that was so, azeeztee.\u201d A word of gentle affection from a sun-drenched desert land Marguerite had never known. \u201cI wasn\u2019t strong, not like you, not like my mama.\u201d Kissing Elena on both cheeks as she\u2019d always done, her mother looked into her eyes. \u201cLook after Beth. And look after my husband. A part of him died with me.\u201d</p><p>Elena shook her head, gripping her mother\u2019s wrists in a futile effort to hold her to the world. \u201cHe hates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Elena. He loves you too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Elena woke with the echo of her mother\u2019s words in her mind and the delicate notes of Marguerite\u2019s favorite perfume in the air. Unwilling to lose the fragile link to the woman who had borne her, she lay prone on the bed, her wings painted by the early afternoon sunlight slanting in from the balcony and the idea of her father loving her as strange a thing as the Hudson turning to blood.</p><p>Oh, Jeffrey had once loved her as he\u2019d loved all his daughters. She remembered the way he\u2019d held her hand in the warm strength of his as he took her to see the bodies of her dead sisters, fighting against other family members in order to give Elena what she needed, the peace of knowing Ari and Belle were safe, that the monster hadn\u2019t made them like him.</p><p>Jeffrey\u2019s eyes had been wet when she looked up from saying good-bye, his strong face struggling against what she now knew must\u2019ve been unbearable grief. It couldn\u2019t have been easy for him to face the broken bodies of his two eldest girls, but he\u2019d done it for a daughter who lived, paying the painful price and never making Elena feel wrong for her need.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Elena had said, wiping away his tears when he bent down. \u201cThey\u2019re not hurting anymore.\u201d</p> <p>That \u201cPapa,\u201d strong and loving and kind, had been lost to her long ago.</p><p>Touching her hands to her face, she imagined she could feel the imprint of her mother\u2019s gentle kisses, a bittersweet ache inside. \u201cI love you, Mama,\u201d she whispered, and it was as true as her anger at the choice Marguerite had ultimately made.</p><p>It was hard to leave the moment and the final vestiges of memory, but a glance at the clock told her it was already past two. Staring into the mirror in the bathroom, she tried to see the shadow of her mother\u2019s fingers, but the imprint was gone, faded into time. It hurt. Breath jagged, she washed off the tears she\u2019d cried in sleep, dried off, then forced herself to keep her word to Montgomery.</p><p>The food choked down, she was strapping on her crossbow when her phone rang with a boy band ringtone her younger half sister had programmed in for herself. \u201cEve? I was just coming to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Amy,\u201d was the surprising answer.</p><p>Elena\u2019s fingers froze on the strap she\u2019d been about to tug into place. Gwendolyn\u2019s older daughter didn\u2019t speak to Elena, likely out of loyalty to her mother\u2014unlike Eve, Amy was old enough to understand that there was something wrong in her parents\u2019 relationship, that her father didn\u2019t love her mother as he should.</p> <p>And yet, Amy loved her father, which left her with no one to blame. Elena didn\u2019t mind giving the teenager a focus for her anger, not when she understood what it was to be that girl, confused and angry and sad at the same time. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d She knew it had to be bad for Amy to break her silence. \u201cHas something happened to Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a half day at school so we came home at lunch. After we ate, Father locked Eve in her room.\u201d A rush of words, as if Amy had been holding them inside too long. \u201cHe says he\u2019s shipping her off to boarding school in Europe in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mother?\u201d Gwendolyn had fought for Eve\u2019s right to stay in Manhattan and attend Guild Academy.</p><p>\u201cVisiting Grandma.\u201d Amy\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cI can\u2019t get through\u2014I\u2019ve been trying and trying. Sometimes reception isn\u2019t good where Grandma lives and it\u2019s been raining there.\u201d</p><p>Elena knew exactly what it was like to feel helpless to protect a sibling, and it enraged her that Jeffrey had put Amy in the same position. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d She was already at the balcony doors, the snow below glinting under sunlight. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy windows aren\u2019t big enough for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Elena wasn\u2019t planning to skulk into the Deveraux home; she was planning to slam headfirst through Jeffrey.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>She shoved open the French doors to her father\u2019s study less than ten minutes later, the glass vibrating as the doors slammed into the stops on either side. \u201cYou\u2019re imprisoning children now?\u201d</p><p>Jeffrey\u2019s head jerked up from the papers on his desk. Pushing back his black leather executive chair, he rose to his feet, the sunlight glinting off his wire-framed spectacles. \u201cElieanora!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You want to lock me up, too?\u201d So angry she could barely see straight, she braced herself with her hand on the right doorjamb. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Fury and a plea combined. \u201cDo you really want her to hate you like I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her to live!\u201d he yelled, his voice stripped bare of the urbane sophistication he used so effectively as a weapon. \u201cShe came home with a black eye yesterday. Combat training. Combat training! For a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs that training!\u201d Elena screamed back. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation! She\u2019ll go mad without an outlet for her hunting abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lost two daughters already! I won\u2019t lose another!\u201d</p><p>Stunned by the raw declaration, her mother\u2019s words still fresh in her mind, she squeezed the doorjamb in an effort to find her lost sense of reason. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this to protect her?\u201d</p><p>Ripping off his glasses, Jeffrey dropped them on the desk, meeting her gaze with unshielded eyes of the same distinctive gray that marked her and Eve as blood. \u201cDo you know what happened when you were sixteen?\u201d he asked, his hands fisted to bloodlessness. \u201cYou went to the Academy in the holidays and returned to your boarding school with broken ribs. Three months later, it was a dislocated collarbone, six months after that a black eye and a fractured jaw.\u201d</p><p>Elena hadn\u2019t realized the boarding school had reported the injuries, much less that her father had kept track of them, he\u2019d done such a good job of freezing out anything to do with the fact his daughter was hunter-born. \u201cIt was necessary,\u201d she said through her shock.</p><p>The only reason she\u2019d even been able to attend those intensive holiday classes was that the Guild had gone to bat for her, getting a judge to sign an order that did away with the need for Jeffrey\u2019s consent. Like Eve, Elena would\u2019ve gone mad without the outlet of those practice sessions where she could give her ability free rein; a hunter-born had to hunt, the need a compulsion.</p><p>But when she\u2019d communicated with her father, it had been with her hunter skin locked away; a child hungry for his approval, she\u2019d pretended to be the nice, normal, obedient daughter he wanted her to be. The fraught peace created by her silence, and his, had lasted until she turned eighteen and enrolled at the Academy full-time over his objections. Their bitter fight that night had left her emotionally bloodied, the resulting estrangement lasting a decade. \u201cI had to become more skilled than the va\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because the monsters are so strong, they could tear off your head with their bare hands!\u201d Stalking around the desk, he grabbed her by the upper arms and shook so hard that her teeth clattered. \u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to watch a woman get her head torn off? The blood spurts hot and dark and it gets in your mouth, in your eyes, in your nose, until it\u2019s the only thing you can see, all you can smell!\u201d</p><p>32</p><p>Elena couldn\u2019t move, even to break the bruising tightness of Jeffrey\u2019s hold. She didn\u2019t understand what he was saying, the words making no sense in the context of who he was: Jeffrey Parker Deveraux, his blood so blue, it was created from the foundations of the city. History, family, tradition, that was the Deveraux way. The blood and the death had come with Elena, Jeffrey\u2019s \u201cabomination\u201d of a daughter.</p><p>\u201cI was four,\u201d he said, his breath hot on her face. \u201cPlaying under the covered bench where she cleaned her tools. She was agreeing how I\u2019d make a great policeman, while I played with my trucks and she sharpened her blades\u201d\u2014eyes falling to the blades on her forearms, his fingers digging deeper into her flesh\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s when they came for her. Three vampires who wanted vengeance for having been returned to their masters to face punishment.\u201d</p><p>Elena started to tremble, her heart stuttering in her chest. As far as she knew, Jeffrey\u2019s mother was alive and well and active on the boards of several major charitable organizations. Cecilia Deveraux was also not, and had never been, a hunter.</p><p>\u201cWhen I tried to help her,\u201d Jeffrey said, \u201cthey laughed and tossed me aside as if I weighed nothing.\u201d Jagged words. \u201cThe fall broke my legs, one of my arms. I tried but couldn\u2019t get to her. Instead I had to watch while they kicked my mother, beat her, breaking every bone in her body before they ripped off her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa.\u201d It was the first time she\u2019d called him that in an eon. \u201cPapa, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sliding her arms around his chest, she held him, his body an icy rock. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s arms came around her, crushing her so tightly, she could barely draw breath. One hand cupping her head, the other around her upper back over her wings, he held her close to his heart, his breath choppy. When his body shuddered against her own, she thought he might be crying, but it was a thought her mind couldn\u2019t accept.</p><p>Her father didn\u2019t cry. The child in her confused and shaky, she just held on until his breathing evened out, his hand stroking over her hair with a gentleness she\u2019d never again expected to experience from her father.</p><p>\u201cI will always be your father . . . and I wish to God I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The hateful words no longer hurt, not when she heard the fear she\u2019d been too angry to hear the first time. Her father, this man who held her with such fierce tenderness, was afraid to watch his daughter die the same horrific death as his mother. It altered the bedrock of their relationship, left her without a mooring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dead certain the brittle moment would end the instant she stepped back, the wall of pain and loss that divided them once more in place, she held on for just a little while longer. So did he. In silence, their words locked down where they couldn\u2019t hurt and cut and make the other bleed.</p><p>The world, however, continued to spin, the sound of a chopper passing overhead breaking the fragment out of time in two. They drew apart without a word, her father turning to walk to his desk, pick up his spectacles, while Elena backed out of the doorway. Heading around the side of the house, she gritted her teeth and made a vertical takeoff into the cold air, bringing herself to a hover in front of Eve\u2019s window.</p><p>Her sister, the skin around her left eye purplish black, was waiting for her, came into her arms without hesitation. Elena saw Amy\u2019s forlorn face in the window next door as they left, her hand pressed to the glass. It\u2019s all right, Elena wanted to say. I\u2019ll bring her back. Gwendolyn would accept nothing else. All Elena had to do was keep Eve away from Jeffrey until Gwendolyn returned. Her father, she\u2019d realized at last, would never be rational when it came to hunters and hunting, the brutal wounds inflicted too young, the scars too aged.</p> <p>Chest aching, she concentrated only on flying slow and steady toward the Enclave, the flash of blue that appeared in her vision an unexpected brilliance. \u201cEllie? Which beautiful maiden do you have there?\u201d A wink directed at her youngest sister. \u201cHello, Evenstar.\u201d</p><p>Eve poked out her tongue at Illium, having met the other angel on visits to the Tower to see Elena, but shifted into his hold when he offered. \u201cI\u2019m heavy,\u201d she said, before Elena could protest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a feather.\u201d Illium held Eve\u2019s sturdy little body as if it weighed nothing. \u201cBut Elena isn\u2019t yet strong enough to carry another more than a short distance. I, on the other hand, can do this.\u201d With that, he shot up into the sky, Eve\u2019s delighted scream rippling through the air.</p><p>Hearing it, Elena shut the door on the questions roiling in her mind, because her first priority had to be the emotional health of her sister, and continued on toward the Enclave. Illium would make sure Eve got home safe, and the excitement of the blue-winged angel\u2019s daredevil tricks would help ameliorate the stress of Eve\u2019s last few hours.</p><p>Landing at the house, she tracked Montgomery to the kitchens, where he was discussing the dinner menu with Sivya. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt,\u201d she said, rubbing a hand over her face. \u201cBut Eve will be staying with us tonight, possibly tomorrow, too. Could you have a room made up for her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, Guild Hunter.\u201d The vampire\u2019s eyes searched hers. \u201cIs she well?\u201d</p><p>Elena knew the question was meant for her, too, but she wasn\u2019t ready to go there yet, wasn\u2019t ready to think about how she felt. \u201cCookies or some cake wouldn\u2019t go amiss,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make certain Miss Evelyn has everything she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Leaving the butler to organize things, she made an important call and returned outside just in time to see Illium land. The sunlight at his back made the blue of his wings glow, his hair wind-wild and his grin as open as the gold of his gaze.</p><p>It was a sight gorgeous and infrequent.</p><p>As she\u2019d seen so clearly that night at the blood caf\u00e9, behind Illium\u2019s playful personality lay a terrible sadness that cast shadows on his soul. As behind her father\u2019s anger lay a horrific loss.</p> <p>Had Marguerite known?</p><p>Yes. She\u2019d been Jeffrey\u2019s heartbeat, his lover in every way, the trust between them absolute. For Marguerite to then do what she had, to leave him when he had to have been grappling with the nightmare repeat of his childhood . . .</p><p>Elena rubbed a fisted hand over her heart, forcing another smile as Eve ran over, cheeks flushed and hair as wild as Illium\u2019s. At eleven years of age, her sister had a child\u2019s spirit, but her face could turn as solemn as an adult\u2019s without warning. As it did now.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming.\u201d Big gray eyes holding her own. \u201cI knew you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to thank Amy when you see her,\u201d Elena said, bending to hug her close. \u201cShe called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy always takes care of me.\u201d Stepping back from the hug after squeezing her tight, Eve said, \u201cThis is going to make Mom and Father fight, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Elena wanted to lie, tell Eve it would be all right, but her sister was too smart and oddly wise for that. \u201cYes. I think this is going to cause a very big fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you get Amy?\u201d Eve looked at Illium, not Elena. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be hard for you to carry her. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Elena touched Eve\u2019s shoulder to get her attention. \u201cI rang her. Amy wants to stay at home.\u201d</p><p>Unhidden distress. \u201cBut Father will punish her for calling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he will.\u201d Jeffrey\u2019s mind was on the distant blood-soaked past, not the petty infringements of today. \u201cHere.\u201d She handed Eve her phone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to Amy yourself?\u201d</p><p>Walking a small distance away, Eve made the call. When Illium went as if to speak, Elena shook her head. She couldn\u2019t talk about what was wrong. Not now. But when he raised an arm, she allowed herself to lean against him, to accept the undemanding warmth of his friendship, his wing heavy against her own.</p><p>\u201cAmy\u2019s being dumb,\u201d was Eve\u2019s blunt appraisal when she walked back to them, her face set in pugnacious lines. \u201cShe says Father shouldn\u2019t be alone, even after he was so mean to me. I hate him.\u201d Arms folded, jaw set, she glared at the grass.</p><p>\u201cI hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Elena crouched down in front of her sister even as her skull rang with the words she\u2019d spoken the day she walked out of the Big House, never to return. \u201cHe might have crossed a line today, but whatever Jeffrey\u2019s done, he\u2019s done it out of love for you.\u201d It was a love twisted by tragedy until it threatened to become a stifling cage, but it was love nonetheless. \u201cI think it\u2019s too late for me and him, but not for you.\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s glare didn\u2019t fade, but her response held an uncertainty that made her youth and innocence clear. \u201cI thought you hated him, too. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I feel for Jeffrey. I do know that you love him.\u201d</p><p>Scuffing at the ground, Eve bit down on her lower lip. \u201cHe\u2019s a good father except about the Guild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has blind spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>A half hour later, Elena left Eve in Montgomery\u2019s capable hands, knowing the elegant vampire was lethal, would protect her with his life, as would the rest of the staff. She wouldn\u2019t have made the same decision had Eve appeared the least scared or intimidated, but her youngest sister had settled in without a hitch. Having borrowed Elena\u2019s laptop, she\u2019d set herself up at the kitchen table and logged into her school account to do homework, was chatting to Sivya about her science problems when Elena left after receiving a hunt order from the Guild.</p><p>She could\u2019ve asked to be replaced, but she needed some way to release the tension coiled up inside her, get her brain clear again. Checking the hunt details on her phone one more time, she took off at a run over the snow-dusted cliffs, the water glittering under the afternoon sunlight, as if a dip wouldn\u2019t give you hypothermia within seconds. The hunt order was relatively simple: she was to retrieve a thirty-year-old vamp who thought he was too good to bow and scrape to the angel who was his master.</p><p>Nothing unusual about that. Seduced by the idea of immortality and the beauty it so often bestowed, people lined up to be Made, but found the reality of a hundred years of service to the angels hard to swallow. What made Sidney Geisman different was that he\u2019d written a booklet denouncing the \u201cslavery\u201d into which he\u2019d been \u201ctricked,\u201d a booklet that had gone viral among other young vampires.</p><p>Needless to say, his angel was beyond pissed. Elena knew Sidney\u2019s punishment would be harsh, an example to others who might seek to follow his seditious path, but while she pitied him, it wouldn\u2019t keep her from doing her job as a hunter. Because Sidney hadn\u2019t been tricked, not in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>The angels made zero attempt to hide the consequences of being Made, of what was required of those who served them. Even forgetting general public knowledge, all Candidates who passed the first part of the selection process were given the euphemistically termed \u201cIntake and Orientation\u201d file and told they were free to walk out the door should the contents of the file not be to their liking.</p><p>As consort, Elena had seen a copy of that file firsthand: it went into extreme detail and included graphic images of the punishments that might be meted out to a vampire should he or she fail to please the angel who held his or her service. Smack bang in the center of the file was a four-page article detailing the vicious public sentence handed to one vampire, whom Raphael had left in Times Square after breaking every bone in his body.</p><p>Below the article were the words: Betrayal will not be tolerated.</p><p>Sidney Geisman, Elena thought as she landed on the roof of a skyscraper to the south of the Tower, appeared to be suffering from a case of buyer\u2019s remorse. Too bad. You couldn\u2019t return the gift of near-immortality, so you were stuck paying the price for it. Not that she thought Sidney would be rushing to return that particular gift, even if it was possible. Cynical, perhaps, but she bet every hunter in the Guild would say the same. Too many people wanted to do the whole \u201chave your cake and eat it, too\u201d thing.</p><p>A single knock on the glass door to the roof atrium and it slid aside to leave her face-to-face with a slim vampire dressed in a brown tunic with a mandarin collar and gold detailing, his pants the same brown shade. \u201cGuild Hunter,\u201d he said, then hesitated. \u201cMy humble apologies. I should\u2019ve used \u2018Consort.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, \u2018Guild Hunter\u2019 is fine.\u201d All this polite deference made her skin itch, but it was part and parcel of being with Raphael and since she had no plans of ever changing that, she\u2019d have to learn to deal. \u201cDo you have what I need?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Walking to the table just inside the atrium, he opened a flat black box to retrieve a neatly folded shirt. \u201cWill this do?\u201d</p><p>Elena took the item of clothing and tried to hone in on the scents trapped within the fabric.</p><p>Raspberry and ginger, with a hint of mint.</p> <p>A pretty, refreshing scent but it wasn\u2019t from the shirt. \u201cIf you\u2019d step back past the doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until the wind swept away the raspberry and ginger, she took another deep breath.</p><p>An astringent chemical . . . disinfectant, softened by a delicate caress of lilies.</p><p>\u201cI need the secondary sample,\u201d she said. \u201cYou made sure to take it from a different location?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, the shirt was from his washing basket, and this T-shirt is from his gym bag.\u201d</p><p>The second test returned the same reading, the disinfectant not a taint but part of Sidney\u2019s scent, as interpreted by her hunting abilities.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Returning the T-shirt, she walked off the edge of the roof, snapping out her wings before she could even begin to fall. Her next destination was the home of Sidney\u2019s mortal family, the address part of the background report attached to the hunt order. All vampires with living relatives eventually went home, the smart for a clandestine visit, the stupid to stay.</p><p>Sidney, it turned out, fell into neither group.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since he took up that filthy habit.\u201d Words spit out by the elderly woman who answered the door, her hazel eyes watery with age but her cheeks hot spots of color. \u201cDrinking blood is the devil\u2019s work.\u201d She slammed the door in Elena\u2019s face.</p><p>Not taking the woman at her word, Elena circled the small, neat house without picking up even a sliver of Sidney\u2019s scent. \u201cI guess home isn\u2019t sweet for you, Sid,\u201d she muttered, hauling herself up the fire escape ladder to the second floor. She\u2019d become expert at low-height takeoffs in an effort to balance out her inability to do regular and easy vertical takeoffs; and having done the latter once today already, she wasn\u2019t going to risk another unless it was a life-or-death situation.</p> <p>Now, she gritted her teeth and got herself airborne before she kissed pavement. Once in the air, she ignored the other addresses in the prehunt report and headed instead to a particular section of Central Park: the Blood Theater.</p><p>33</p><p>Sidney was a man proud enough of his opus that he\u2019d put his name on it\u2014someone like that wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with disappearing into the mist, bereft of an audience. No, every instinct she had told her he\u2019d have hit the Theater as soon as he could.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to watch a woman get her head torn off?\u201d</p><p>Shutting down the resurgence of memory before it could incapacitate, she winged her way across the green space at the core of Manhattan. About to land in the correct section, her brain suddenly poked at her to consider the situation . . . and maybe part of that poke came from the echo of her father\u2019s words, though she couldn\u2019t think about that now.</p><p>As soon as she landed, she would become vulnerable in a way that\u2014ironically\u2014she\u2019d never been as a human. Her wings would make it hard for her to run at speed, dodging between the trees near impossible. A vertical takeoff would also not be a viable option if the hunt went bad, since she couldn\u2019t get aloft fast enough. Added to that, the Theater was in an isolated section of the park and, while night hadn\u2019t yet fallen, winter darkness was starting to edge the light in the sky.</p><p>It\u2019d be nice to think no vampire or angel in the territory would dare lay a hand on her, but there were always the outliers\u2014and the mortals. If a group of hopped-up junkies took out her heart or injured her internal organs badly enough, she\u2019d die, her immortality tenuous yet. Then there was the risk Raphael\u2019s enemies had agents in the city just waiting for Elena to make herself a target.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cLanding right now would not be the most intelligent thing you\u2019ve ever done, Elieanora P. Deveraux.\u201d</p> <p>Holding a hover\u2014she was definitely getting better at that, thanks to the exercises Aodhan had taught her\u2014she considered her options. It\u2019d have to be the Guild, the Tower already stretched. \u201cYou have anyone who can back me up?\u201d she asked Sara. \u201cI\u2019m at Central Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a sec.\u201d A rustling, the phone going silent, then, \u201cDeacon\u2019s in the area with Slayer, and he has a crossbow. Why take a crossbow on the dog\u2019s walk, I hear you ask? Because my beloved does not know how to leave home without being armed to the teeth.\u201d</p><p>Elena laughed, Sara\u2019s affectionate words giving her the respite she needed from the horrific images Jeffrey\u2019s revelation had burned into her brain. \u201cYou know I\u2019d never turn down Deacon.\u201d Sara\u2019s husband might no longer be an official member of the Guild, but they all knew he was one of them. \u201cWait, what about Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my parents\u2014they\u2019re in town and spoiling her like only they can.\u201d Elena could hear Sara\u2019s smile. \u201cDeacon\u2019s yours long as you need him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll call him to arrange a meeting spot.\u201d</p><p>Less than two minutes later, she landed beside Deacon\u2019s tall, heavily muscled form a short walk from her target location. \u201cI appreciate this,\u201d she said, after lavishing affection on Slayer, the huge black dog who was Zoe\u2019s adored best friend.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Quiet green eyes that Elena was certain missed nothing, even though his stance was relaxed, Slayer leaning against his leg. \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood Theater.\u201d Nothing special during daylight hours, that particular part of Central Park transformed into a decadent, sex-laced vampire haven at night, one mortals were advised to avoid unless they intended to become well-fucked dinner.</p><p>Deacon retrieved the crossbow he\u2019d slung over his back. \u201cHardware has a good deterrent effect.\u201d The instant the crossbow was in Deacon\u2019s hands, Slayer turned from playful, tail-wagging pet to a silent menace.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Retrieving the longer blades from her thigh sheaths, she made certain the gleaming edges showed beneath her fists. \u201cI don\u2019t want to draw blood, but some of the younger ones are morons.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile on Deacon\u2019s lips as they set out along the narrow path to the Theater, the snow packed down as far as Elena could see. Given, however, that it hadn\u2019t snowed since close to dawn, the crushed snow was probably evidence of the previous night\u2019s debauchery, not a more recent event. The Theater was apt to be empty at this time of day and if she was right, and Sidney had made an appearance there, she might be able to pick up a trail.</p><p>Despite the high possibility she and Deacon were alone in this part of the park, she didn\u2019t drop her guard, aware of every rustle, every tiny sound, then the distinct lack of it. \u201cNo birds,\u201d she murmured sotto voce.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Deacon went back-to-back with her without any further discussion, her wings pressed against the dark green of his trench coat, while Slayer padded silent and dangerous in front of them.</p><p>Weapons held with open aggression, they turned right off the main access path and onto another that spilled them into the small clearing with a natural dip that turned it into a miniature amphitheater. Elena\u2019s nape itched with the certainty of the eyes on them, instinct verified by the fresh lines of scent in the air, but no one appeared out of the deep pools of shadow between the trees.</p><p>Watery blood. A lot of it.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell it.\u201d If someone was dead inside the Theater, he or she hadn\u2019t been dead long enough for the carrion birds to have become aware of the feast, the area devoid of the sounds of their feeding. Either that, or the birds had been held off on purpose, because beneath the snow-diluted blood, she caught the scent of disinfectant softened by lilies.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cDeacon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have you covered.\u201d</p><p>Shifting position, she made her way into the dip and to the gruesome sight that awaited. Sidney Geisman had lost his head. Literally. It was currently spitted on a crude wooden spear carved from a hacked-off branch, the vampire\u2019s eyes orbs of bulging red and his tongue a grotesquely swollen black where it hung out of his mouth.</p><p>It was too cold for flies, the bloody snow below the head pounded into ice. The rest of the vampire\u2019s body lay discarded a short distance away. She could see indications of arterial spray on the nearby trees, the blood having turned a putrid brown that nonetheless stood out to her enhanced vision. What interested her more were the multiple gaps in the pattern, as if this execution had had an audience that would\u2019ve been sprayed with Sidney\u2019s blood.</p><p>Breathing through clenched teeth, the cold paradoxically intensifying the miasma of scents for her, she stepped close enough to the head to read the note stabbed into Sidney\u2019s forehead with what appeared to be a metal nail file. Inventive. The note consisted of a single word written in blood: DISEASED.</p><p>Oh, fuck. Fuckety fuck fuck!</p><p>Continuing to breathe through her mouth, she crossed to the body and began to check Sidney for any visual signs of disease. It didn\u2019t take long to find the sores on his hands. They were small, barely formed, so the infection had only just dug into his cells when he\u2019d been killed. Which meant either there was now another carrier in the city or\u2014best-case scenario\u2014Sidney had been hoarding bottled blood in anticipation of his escape.</p><p>Raphael?</p><p>When she heard only silence in response, she remembered he\u2019d mentioned he might be leaving the city to meet one of his senior angels. Digging out her phone from the pocket where she\u2019d stuffed it, she called Tower operations, using the direct line that meant she\u2019d get either Aodhan or Illium.</p><p>It was Aodhan who answered. Not wanting to say too much over an unsecure line, she simply told him she needed him in the Blood Theater. He didn\u2019t ask any questions, saying that he\u2019d be there within minutes.</p><p>That done, she began to walk the scene to see how many useful scents she could identify.</p><p>Aodhan arrived with the encroaching darkness, his wings glittering brighter than the snow. She saw immediate comprehension on his face when she pointed out the note. The vampires in the city were turning on one another\u2014if this continued, it could spiral out into indiscriminate paranoia, painting the city bloodred. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the most immediate problem.</p><p>\u201cCould the infection have passed in the arterial spray?\u201dAodhan said, softly enough that his words wouldn\u2019t travel to the vampires who continued to watch from the shadows; those vamps would soon find themselves with nowhere to go, Aodhan having instructed a squadron to surround the area.</p><p>Elena looked again at the rusty brown that marked the trees. \u201cDepends if enough of it got into the mouth, as well as through the mucus membranes of the eye. Low risk, since a drop won\u2019t do it, but a risk nonetheless\u2014the spectators and the executioners were standing damn close.\u201d More than one had likely had an open mouth as they no doubt screamed at Sidney and cheered one another on. \u201cI can track at least some of the people here in the last few hours, but given the way he was beaten\u201d\u2014she pointed out the vicious marks on the body\u2014\u201cit looks like it might\u2019ve been a mob attack.\u201d</p> <p>A hardness to Aodhan\u2019s expression she\u2019d never before seen, splintered irises hauntingly white with reflected snow. \u201cFind as many as you can as fast as you can.\u201d</p><p>Having already isolated the strongest scent trail, Elena started the track, Deacon at her back. The intensity of the scent told her the vampire in question had run from the Theater probably at daybreak, his body and face covered with Sidney\u2019s blood, a strange m\u00e9lange of disinfectant and lilies entangled with the vampire\u2019s own natural scent.</p><p>The odd thing was, he hadn\u2019t run out onto the street, but scrambled deeper into Central Park. Where she found him ten minutes later. Covered in patches of dried, flaking blood the color of dirt, he sat rocking to and fro under the shade of an oak devoid of its leaves, its arms skeletal against the incongruously stunning starlit night.</p><p>\u201cThey killed him. They killed him. They killed him.\u201d</p><p>Crouching beside the male, far enough away that he couldn\u2019t lunge for her throat, Elena said, \u201cWho killed him?\u201d her tone nonconfrontational.</p> <p>\u201cThey killed him. They killed him. They killed him.\u201d</p><p>Elena tried again, even chancing a touch, but the vampire was trapped in some personal mental hellhole he couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>She and Deacon stayed with him only until he was picked up for transport to the Tower. Returning to the main site, now busy with Tower staff, Elena chose the next most promising trail. Thirty minutes later, she received a message from Illium stating a friend of Sidney\u2019s had confessed to supplying him with food blood out of her own frozen supply. He drank a bottle from Blood-for-Less. Bottle dated within the period of the original donor-carrier.</p><p>Five hours after that, she\u2019d tracked down three other vampires who\u2019d watched and/or participated in Sidney\u2019s bloody execution, but who hadn\u2019t stuck around to experience the aftermath. One was terrified, one defiant, but it was the third who was the most problematic: he\u2019d started to show advanced signs of the disease.</p><p>Stepping outside the bedroom where the vampire shivered so hard his teeth clattered, his mind lost in a febrile haze, she met Deacon\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou should get back home. Sara will be waiting.\u201d She would not risk his mind, his memories.</p><p>A piercing look. \u201cI already know what Sara knows.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to leave before you know more,\u201d she said, then brought up the one thing she knew would get him to back off. \u201cZoe needs you. Don\u2019t get involved in immortal bullshit that could bleed onto your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou change your mind, Ellie,\u201d he said after a long minute of silence, \u201cjust call.\u201d</p><p>That done, she contacted Illium. \u201cNone of the idiots I\u2019ve found are talking and we need the names of the others who were there and might be infected. Can you do your mental voodoo?\u201d Raphael was on his way back, but still at least an hour out.</p><p>\u201cMy mental voodoo is nowhere as well developed as the Sire\u2019s, but I have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>Arriving at the guarded warehouse where Elena had quarantined the two apparently uninfected vampires, the infected one in another warehouse, Illium asked the vampires for the names and, when there was no answer, withdrew his sword and sliced off the left leg of the brown-haired male.</p><p>The gleam of red on steel was not what she\u2019d been expecting, her heart slamming into her throat, but the brutal tactic delivered: the uninjured vampire broke down even as her friend clamped his hand over his stump in an attempt to stanch the pumping blood. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! We made a pact not to nark!\u201d Sobbing, she began to give them names, the maimed vampire joining in when she faltered in her recollection.</p><p>It took less than an hour to track down the nine other vampires who\u2019d scattered, including\u2014ironically\u2014a number who\u2019d been fans of Sidney\u2019s work. One more was discovered curled up in bed, the disease ravaging her cells, the other eight terrified out of their minds.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find out where each one, but especially the two infected, went after the murder,\u201d Elena said, furious at the stupidity that might\u2019ve done more damage than the other attacks combined. \u201cThe only bright point in this situation is that the disease needs a blood transfer to infect.\u201d</p> <p>The interviews went fast\u2014courtesy of the amputated leg sitting in the middle of the warehouse; none of these vampires was old enough to heal such an injury in anything less than twelve excruciating months.</p><p>Most of the murderous idiots had run home, but two had gone to a club. Where they\u2019d fed on and been fed by fellow vampires. One of those two was the sick woman. Beautiful, sexy, and an unmistakable magnet for male vamps who wanted to sink their fangs into sweet, hot flesh.</p><p>\u201cGod damn it!\u201d</p><p>Had the club been a high-class place like Erotique, where blood sharing was considered a seduction, a pair often spending hours together, there was a good chance they could\u2019ve quickly halted any further spread. Unfortunately, Bezel was on the opposite end of the spectrum, catering to young vampires who were all about sex, blood, and more sex, multiple partners the norm in both categories.</p><p>The first indication Elena had of how bad this was going to be was when she landed in the club parking lot just as a tall, skinny vampire staggered out on four-inch heels, only to collapse to the concrete screaming that it hurt, it hurt!</p><p>34</p><p>Nine grueling hours later, Raphael looked down at the report Aodhan had just pushed across his desk and said, \u201cHow bad?\u201d The disease had finally been contained, but not until it cut a swath through a particular segment of the city\u2019s vampiric population.</p><p>\u201cThree hundred and eight dead or sick,\u201d Aodhan told him. \u201cTwo hundred under observation for the next day.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the total disaster it had been shaping up to be, especially as none of Raphael\u2019s vampire soldiers patronized Bezel, but given the already downed angels, added to the fear that now permeated the city\u2019s vampire population, it was a brutal blow to the beating heart of his territory. \u201cContinue to monitor the situation and alert me if there are any signs the disease has escaped containment.\u201d</p><p>Montgomery, he said after Aodhan left, is Elena home? She\u2019d been working side by side with him until an hour before, when he\u2019d ordered her home, able to see her exhaustion after two tumultuous nights.</p><p>Yes, Sire.</p><p>Make sure she rests.</p><p>The slightest pause. I do not believe I could make the Guild Hunter do anything.</p><p>Despite knowing New York was on the brink of a catastrophic final assault, he almost felt the urge to laugh at the tentative response from the centuries-old vampire. True enough, he said, and touched his mind to Elena\u2019s in a quiet question. When he heard only peaceful silence in response, he knew she slept.</p><p>Her sister? In all the chaos, he and Elena had had little time to speak, but she\u2019d told him about her biological grandmother right before she left the Tower, the continuing shock of the revelation a strain in her expression. But trumping that had been her concern for what this might all mean for Eve.</p><p>Miss Evelyn is sleeping peacefully.</p><p>Thank you, Montgomery. With that, Raphael turned to input a number into the large communications screen on one wall of his office.</p><p>Titus\u2019s face appeared on it a minute later. \u201cRaphael, my second tells me you wish to speak to me,\u201d the warrior archangel said, the mahogany of his skin gleaming in the light in the room from where he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re encountering the same vampire disease in your territory that almost brought down an aircraft in mine.\u201d There\u2019d been no way to suppress that information, their enemies no doubt aware the strike had found a target. Yet still they waited.</p><p>\u201cI will trust you with this information, Raphael.\u201d Titus\u2019s eyes bored into his. \u201cDo not betray me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael inclined his head. \u201cYou are one archangel whose word I know is his bond. We are united in battling this scourge, and I\u2019ll share all I know of it if you\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p><p>Apparently mollified, Titus nodded. \u201cThe disease has at times threatened to decimate my ground forces. We tracked down and eliminated the carriers, but Charisemnon keeps sending more of the infected over our border, their only aim to disseminate their blood in the hours before the disease begins to show.\u201d</p><p>Since the instant he\u2019d received Jason\u2019s message about the problems in Titus\u2019s territory the day before, Raphael had had his suspicions about the archangel who was neighbor to Titus. \u201cSo. It is Charisemnon who is the architect of the disease? Is there any indication of Lijuan\u2019s hand in its creation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Titus said. \u201cThe men I have in his court confirm this. Charisemnon\u2019s power is now apparently much faded from overuse, but he has a stable of infected from whom he takes blood to infect more, continuing the cycle\u2014he has somehow convinced his ground troops they die in the cause of protecting their territory.\u201d Titus rubbed his face in a rare gesture of fatigue. \u201cI ask you now if he initiated the Falling, for if so, we are even more vulnerable than I believed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have no proof, but believe the indications are there.\u201d</p><p>A deep groove formed on either side of Titus\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat he strikes so viciously at you, while only harassing me, means he must\u2019ve thrown his lot in with Lijuan. I would stand with you in the war against her, Raphael, were Charisemnon not sitting on my border waiting for me to blink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe information you\u2019ve shared is worth as much.\u201d It gave him the name of his secondary enemy, Lijuan still the most dangerous. \u201cI tell you now that we\u2019ve begun to develop a vaccine\u2014it\u2019ll take time, but my healers say it can be done. Do you wish me to send the information to your own healers so they can join in the work?\u201d</p><p>Titus nodded. \u201cYour honor is strong that you share such. I\u2019ll instruct my healers to work with yours in every way.\u201d</p><p>Not wasting time, Raphael sent a mental command to the team in the Tower that was working on the vaccine under Keir\u2019s remote guidance, the healer unable to abandon his duties at the Refuge.</p> <p>\u201cWe must stop Charisemnon and the deathmonger, Lijuan.\u201d Scowling, Titus slammed his ceremonial spear to the ground, the lethally sharp tip painted with pure gold. \u201cWe are archangels, protectors of the world, and they seek to defile it in their delusion of godhood.\u201d A roar that no doubt shook the walls of his stronghold before he pinned Raphael with his eyes. \u201cI hope you do not fall prey to the same pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to rule the world\u2014but neither will I allow anyone to threaten my territory.\u201d Warrior to warrior, he held the other man\u2019s gaze. \u201cI would call you ally, Titus, and accept your word and any information you pass my way as truth, if you\u2019ll do the same.\u201d To no other angel, even Elijah, would he speak so bluntly, but Titus had no time for double-talk and political subtlety. He would, Raphael thought suddenly, be someone Elena would like, and he had a feeling the admiration would be returned.</p><p>Now, Titus made his decision with his customary lack of delay. \u201cThe alliance is forged.\u201d</p><p>As he ended the call, he thought of a time when Titus had called him a \u201cstripling\u201d and slapped him on the back in congratulations for a bout well played. Now they were allies standing firm against the same deadly threat. Another change, another sign that the world would be forever altered before this was over.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Eve was lying flat on her back in the middle of the central core of the house when Elena came downstairs at nine in the morning, having caught approximately four hours of deep, uninterrupted sleep. Body and mind both felt refreshed, the emotional stress of the previous day no longer threatening to scrape her raw.</p><p>Good morning, Archangel, she said, connecting with Raphael\u2019s mind across the water, the link effortless.</p><p>The cool kiss of the rain, the turbulent sea in her mind. Good morning, hbeebti.</p><p>Heart warm and a smile tugging at her lips, she walked across the silk carpet to look down at her sister\u2019s sprawled body. \u201cEve?\u201d she said, noting that the bruise around Eve\u2019s left eye had faded to a sickly yellow-black that denoted healing.</p><p>\u201cHi, Ellie.\u201d The greeting was breathy. \u201cSorry, ate too many cakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you scam Montgomery?\u201d She didn\u2019t think the vampire had much experience with children, especially smart children\u2014and Eve was very, very smart.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually give me cake for breakfast if I said I was feeling sad.\u201d Astonishment on her face. \u201cOr that he\u2019d give me more when I said I was still hungry. I couldn\u2019t not eat it after that. It wouldn\u2019t have been polite after I asked for it.\u201d</p><p>Elena\u2019s shoulders shook as she tried to contain her laughter. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re lying on the floor? Because you can\u2019t breathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Eve patted her stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice view.\u201d</p><p>No doubt she should return to the Tower, find out if the disease situation had deteriorated in the past few hours, but Elena went down to the carpet and said, \u201cRise up just a little.\u201d</p><p>When Eve did so\u2014with a groan\u2014Elena slid her wing beneath her sister\u2019s body, her arm under Eve\u2019s head, and they lay side by side. The skylight above was beautiful, a sparkling shatter of light.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt if I lie on your wing? I\u2019m kinda heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, and you\u2019re not heavy.\u201d Eve had her mother\u2019s petite bone structure paired with a gutsy strength, would no doubt grow up to be a sleek little dynamo.</p><p>\u201cI have a layer of puppy fat\u2014that\u2019s what I heard one of my friend\u2019s moms say.\u201d Stated with equanimity. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to become a swan like Amy or Mom or you.\u201d A ferocious scowl. \u201cI just want to be a bit less fat, but I really like cake.\u201d</p> <p>Elena felt an overwhelming wave of affection. \u201cWould you like to hear a story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth and I, we had two older sisters, did you know that?\u201d She was unsurprised at the shake of Eve\u2019s head, but it hurt to be reminded how thoroughly her father had buried the long-legged dancer he\u2019d once waltzed across the kitchen floor, as thoroughly as the serious second-born with whom he\u2019d discussed stocks and bonds at the breakfast table. \u201cTheir names were Mirabelle and Ariel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they die?\u201d A quiet question, Eve weaving her fingers with Elena\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYes. They died.\u201d The words were still so hard to say. \u201cAri wanted to take care of everyone, and she was kind of bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmy is bossy, too. But I know it\u2019s because she loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Elena felt the scars of loss stretch painfully as she thought of the time Ari had told her off for running down the stairs, only to cuddle her when her lower lip quivered. \u201cBelle had more of a temper, but she wouldn\u2019t let anyone be mean to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like a good sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d Elena concentrated on the happy memories, fighting against the blood-splattered shadows that threatened to taint the joy. \u201cAnd she was a dancer. The way Belle could move, it was like watching the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet she studied a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Hours and hours, determined to grow up to be part of a prestigious ballet company. \u201cBut you know the best part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelle used to look just like you when she was younger.\u201d That same appearance of sturdiness created by stubborn baby fat. \u201cI saw the photos. But her dancing soon created lean muscle\u2014just like your hunt training will do for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like going to the Academy, even if I get bruises sometimes.\u201d Patting her free hand gently over the inner surface of Elena\u2019s wing, she said, \u201cEllie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Elena drew her sister into her arms. \u201cI know, baby. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Having settled Eve in the kitchen with the laptop after her sister told her she\u2019d e-mailed her teacher the previous night and received the day\u2019s lessons to do at home, Elena had just taken off when Montgomery caught her attention from the clifftop. \u201cMiss Evelyn\u2019s mother is at the gates,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOpen them.\u201d Elena folded back her wings, thinking Gwendolyn must\u2019ve driven through the night after receiving the message Elena had used the hunter network in the area to personally deliver.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d the other woman asked the instant she stepped out of the mud-splattered black SUV, deep shadows under the dark blue of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoing her lessons inside,\u201d Elena said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to send her back to school until you\u2019d returned.\u201d</p><p>Gwendolyn ran a trembling hand through her raven black hair. \u201cI\u2019ve just come from the house. Jeffrey\u2014\u201d A sudden break, walls of polite reserve slamming down, as if the other woman had remembered she was talking about her husband to his estranged daughter.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of coffee?\u201d Elena asked, stifling her impatience to get to the Tower\u2014Eve\u2019s future welfare could depend on what Gwendolyn chose to do next.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve already had too much caffeine.\u201d Gwendolyn\u2019s confession was a fracture in the reserve. \u201cI appreciate you helping Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious, Gwendolyn,\u201d Elena said, struggling with the ethics of whether or not she had the right to share the truth about her biological grandmother. \u201cJeffrey really scared her. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to come to terms with the fact she\u2019s hunter-born.\u201d</p><p>The other woman\u2019s cheekbones pushed white against her skin. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he doesn\u2019t pull anything like this ever again.\u201d</p><p>Elena had total faith in Gwendolyn\u2019s love for her daughters, but she understood her father far better today than she\u2019d ever before done. \u201cYou can\u2019t watch her all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but even though Jeffrey and I might not have the relationship he had with your mother\u201d\u2014a bleak reference to a painful earlier conversation where Gwendolyn had admitted she\u2019d known of Jeffrey\u2019s former mistress, and that the woman bore a faded resemblance to Marguerite\u2014\u201cyour father needs me in a way I doubt you\u2019d understand.\u201d A sad smile. \u201cHe\u2019ll keep his end of our bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Eve tumbled out the front door at that instant, racing to Gwendolyn.</p><p>As the other woman\u2019s slender arms hugged her daughter tight, Elena hoped Gwendolyn was right in her judgment of Jeffrey. Because Elena would not stand by and watch him hurt Eve as he\u2019d hurt her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I have to, to protect her,\u201d she said to Raphael later that day, outside the warehouse being used as an observation facility.</p><p>Raphael had expected nothing less from his consort. \u201cI\u2019ve ordered our communications team to monitor Eve\u2019s name, as well as the flight plans of the Deveraux family jet. You\u2019ll know within minutes should there be anything that throws up a red flag.\u201d</p><p>The chain-link fence at Elena\u2019s back was a harsh reminder of the grim reason why they stood here, but her radiant smile threw that into the shade. \u201cThank you, Archangel.\u201d A distinct and very Elena glint in her eye. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely awesome to be consort to a man who is lord of all he surveys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, Consort,\u201d he said, having already told her of his discussion with Titus, \u201cis a fact Charisemnon and Lijuan would like to change.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, that Charisemnon guy always wigged me out.

It was time for his second to return to New York.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael spent the rest of the day finalizing the transfer of his senior vampires and angels into the city, while Aodhan handled daily Tower operations and Dmitri\u2014linking in from the jet Raphael had sent for him and Honor\u2014worked with his trusted people to ensure their permitted weapons reserves were at maximum. The next step would be to place anti-wing guns on a number of rooftops.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it in the short lull after the late revelers head home and the early risers are yet asleep,\u201d Illium told him, the lights of a night-cloaked Manhattan glittering at his back as the two of them stood at the apex of the Tower. \u201cBetter the guns appear overnight than to have the curious watching and broadcasting our efforts in the daytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Raphael\u2019s city never truly slept, but it was quietest in those twilight hours. \u201cDo you have enough people to get it done within that time frame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Aodhan can also assist now that Dmitri has returned to take over Tower operations.\u201d A steady glance from golden eyes shadowed by thick black lashes dipped in blue. \u201cSire, you can\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>When Raphael raised an eyebrow, Illium stood his ground. \u201cForget the enemy, the morale of our own troops will take a severe hit if you\u2019re seen to be assisting in such a \u2018mundane\u2019 task.\u201d</p><p>Raphael knew the angel was right. \u201cThe task is yours,\u201d he said, and spent the next hour drilling a specialized night-maneuvers squadron before heading home.</p><p>His consort was in her solar, cleaning her weapons with a single-minded focus that told him she wasn\u2019t seeing the lethal items at all. Taking a seat across from her, he picked up a cut-glass tumbler and poured himself a drink from the decanter she kept for him, a silent invitation into her inner sanctum. \u201cIllium tells me you charmed the vampire leaders.\u201d Whatever she\u2019d done, the effect had been immediate, the city calmer, vampires on their best behavior.</p> <p>She snorted. \u201cIllium did the charming. I talked business\u2014vamp leaders are all about that\u2014and rampaging vampires are bad for it. We came to an understanding.\u201d Lashes flicking up, humor in the gray. \u201cI may have channeled you at your politest and scariest, to drive home the point that you\u2019d be very, very disappointed should they fail in their task.\u201d</p><p>Lips curving, he took another sip. \u201cYou are proving to be a most efficient consort, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d A dagger pointed at him to underscore her command, before she went back to her cleaning.</p><p>\u201cIs it your father\u2019s revelation that occupies your mind?\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cI had a bit of time before you got home, so I logged into the Tower\u2019s information network from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014the facts weren\u2019t hidden. I just didn\u2019t know to look for them before.\u201d Fingers clenching on the dagger, Elena met eyes of pitiless blue that watched her with an intense patience that told her she mattered. \u201cHer name was Elizabeth Parker.\u201d Her heart pounded in sympathetic memory of the stunned shock she\u2019d felt at the discovery. \u201cBelle and Ari were his firstborn, but he didn\u2019t give them her names, just me and Beth.\u201d</p><p>Elieanora Parker Deveraux and Elizabeth Marguerite Deveraux.</p><p>Releasing and setting the dagger aside when her fingers began going numb, she dropped her head in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if it took him that long to trust in the happiness he\u2019d found, have enough faith to open the door a fraction to his past.\u201d Only for the horror to be repeated. \u201cGod, Raphael, no wonder he\u2019s so damn fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly the question she needed to hear. Somehow, she had to find a way to come to terms with a fundamental change in the fabric of her history, her vision of her father altered in a way she was having difficulty comprehending. And even though she knew Raphael had no sympathy for Jeffrey after what her father had done to her, he listened as she released the torrent of words and questions and confusion.</p><p>Hours later, when she\u2019d emptied it all from inside her head and could think again, he took her to bed and held her safe from the nightmares, his wing spread over her body in a heaviness of silken warmth that made her feel safer than any weapon.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Raphael decided to rest in truth this night, his hunter\u2019s skin warm against his own. She\u2019d talked herself out and, in so doing, come to a kind of peace with the ghost of a woman she\u2019d never met, but who\u2019d thrown a shadow across her entire existence.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth Parker,\u201d she\u2019d said quietly at the end. \u201cShe\u2019s a part of me and I\u2019m glad I know that.\u201d</p><p>Now, she lay tucked trustingly against him, her wings tangled around his body in the way of angelic lovers, his own acting as her blanket. Only when he was certain she\u2019d fallen into a deep, nightmare-free sleep did he press a kiss to the warm curve of her neck and close his eyes.</p><p>He dreamed again of that forgotten field, and of a woman\u2019s bare feet as light as air on the ruby-flecked grass, his mother walking away from him after he fell to the earth, his body bloodied and bones broken.</p><p>Except . . .</p><p>He stood able-bodied on that field\u2014and it was the same field, on the same day. He\u2019d never forget the breathtaking clarity of the sky; the way the dew sparkled as if a careless hand had spilled a thousand translucent gemstones on the lush green blades; the distinctive patterns of light and shadow formed by the blossoming tree to the right; the tiny insect that crawled painstakingly across the grass, food held in its pincers.</p><p>He\u2019d watched that insect for what felt like hours as it made its way across the field. When the food slipped out of its pincers, it would stop, pick it up again, and restart its journey. Lying broken on the grass Raphael had thought of himself as an insect, too, an insignificant, discarded piece of angelic flotsam beneath an endless sky.</p><p>Today, he could step on that insect without thought, ending its existence and struggle, but he took care to walk around it, the clear morning sunlight a cool brightness on his face, the slight wind adding to the sense that dawn had just broken. Tilting back his head, he saw nothing in the sheet of blue above . . . no, there was his mother. Though he stood in the wrong place, his view was the same as on that fateful day\u2014when he\u2019d watched her from a hidden vantage point, needing to see her free and beautiful just once more before he sought to bring her down, end her life.</p><p>She\u2019d caused the death of every adult in two thriving cities, creating a silence painful and eternal. The survivors had all been children, little ones so bruised in the heart that they\u2019d curled up and died of terrible sorrow, hundreds upon hundreds of tiny lives snuffed out without ever being given the chance to truly burn.</p><p>He\u2019d known all that, understood she needed to be stopped, but she\u2019d still been the mother who\u2019d once sung him such lullabies that the Refuge stood silent to hear her. So he\u2019d taken that single moment to watch her, to remember who she\u2019d been before the madness sucked her under.</p><p>Graceful and strong, her wings backlit by the sun, she flew above him . . . but now there was a cloud across the sun. That wasn\u2019t right. There had been no clouds that day, the sun a burning orb that baked his spilled blood to crystalline hardness and threatened to boil him alive from the inside out.</p><p>The clouds grew darker and darker, until they blotted out the sun. And his mother, she was gone. All he could see was a thick blanket of featureless gray. Beneath his feet, the verdant grass had turned brown, the insect a carcass. And the wind, it blew cool across his face, but it wasn\u2019t fresh.</p><p>It tasted old.</p><p>There was no scent of putrefaction or of death, simply a sense of unfathomable age, of dark, hidden places full of secrets and whispers. Breathing it in, he continued to walk across the field, for someone was waiting for him. He was halfway across the dried-up landscape\u2014so old, this place\u2014when he saw that dawn had come . . . no, that was Elena\u2019s wing arcing over him as she folded it away to reveal the skylight above their bed, the world outside the hazy formless gray of the time just before true daybreak.</p><p>The rim of silver around her irises glowed in the muted darkness as she leaned closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was time.\u201d He knew he\u2019d never have reached the end of that field without . . . something, something he was meant to have in order to complete the journey. \u201cWhy do you watch me in such a way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally I wake,\u201d she whispered, as if it were a secret, \u201cand I have this instant where I don\u2019t believe the happiness inside me, can\u2019t imagine you could ever belong to me, but you do.\u201d A smile that pierced the lingering grayness. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had another dream,\u201d he told his hunter, for she belonged to him as much as he belonged to her.</p> <p>Elena cocked her head, listening as he described the forgotten field and the weight of age, the scent of old, old things. \u201cThere was no sense of threat,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I felt I\u2019d lose something indefinable if I did not do an act of which I had no knowledge.\u201d</p><p>A thoughtful silence. \u201cIt might simply be your subconscious\u2019s way of working out everything that\u2019s been going on, but after that shared dream, I have my doubts.\u201d</p><p>As did he. \u201cAnd you, Elena,\u201d he said, deciding to let matters lie for now, for the intrigues of the dream world had to take second place to the harshness of reality, \u201cwhat did you dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a damn thing.\u201d Her beaming relief segued into concern all too soon. \u201cDid Jason send through another report last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reborn component of Lijuan\u2019s gathering forces appears to be suspiciously small, especially given how many villagers have disappeared from the areas closest to her stronghold.\u201d</p> <p>Elena sucked in a breath. \u201cYou think they might already be on the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr have arrived, been stashed away until needed.\u201d It wasn\u2019t impossible that they could\u2019ve been smuggled in on shipping containers. A container would provide a perfect cage, and, once released, the starving and infectious creatures would decimate the population. \u201cJason also has information that Lijuan has \u2018improved\u2019 on her design so these reborn are not sentient in any way, simply creatures designed to kill and feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfectious, mobile weapons.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, agreeing with her assessment. \u201cCharisemnon\u2019s forces are also strong, but Titus has stepped up the aggression on their border to ensure Charisemnon cannot risk seconding any squadrons to Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Elena said. \u201cI know Lijuan has more fighters, but she can\u2019t move all her forces against us or she risks leaving her territory vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has also been an archangel for millennia, and as such, has many, many more older angels and vampires at her command.\u201d Harder to kill or disable, the senior fighters could endure far longer than younger ones.</p> <p>\u201cHell, I didn\u2019t even think about that.\u201d Elena spread her hand over his heart, the look in her eyes telling him she was calculating every angle. \u201cHome field advantage remains our best weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we must utilize it in every way possible.\u201d</p><p>When they flew into the city a half hour later, it was to see its rooftops bristling with weaponry inimical to winged fighters.</p><p>\u201cEven the old angels,\u201d Elena said, satisfaction in her tone, \u201cwill take time to heal if we blow the bastards to smithereens.\u201d</p><p>So bloodthirsty, hbeebti.</p><p>A grin. \u201cYou know you love me that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I wish you to join the squadron practicing with crossbows in the air.\u201d He knew his consort would never sit in safety while her city burned, so he\u2019d make certain she was prepared.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m not fast in flight, but I\u2019m a crack shot.\u201d A tender kiss, a fleeting memory of the short, passionate minutes they\u2019d taken for themselves earlier in the morning. \u201cYou\u2019re meeting with Dmitri?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>That discussion took over two hours. Leaving the other man to organize an extended sentry line, Raphael was about to take off from the Tower to meet Nazarach\u2014the senior angel having relocated to the city overnight\u2014when he felt the wind turn violent, whipping his hair off his face. Along with its fury came a scent of age and old, old things. Buried things.</p><p>The sky turned as red as the Hudson had done in a pulsing wave, the birds swirling a constellation above the Tower. Fighting the wind, Raphael lifted off, heading directly to those birds, called by an ancient power that licked over his skin. The tiny winged creatures parted to let him in, and so he became the center of the constellation as the bloodred sky pushed down on him and the warm rain was drops of blood on his skin, his face, his hair.</p><p>36</p><p>Elena looked up from the roof of the building where she\u2019d landed when the wind turned murderous, her crossbow gripped in one hand and her heart kicking against her ribs. Raphael! she cried out with her mind, able to see him in the center of the fury of birds that circled black against a crimson sky.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, and the rain, it was blood that tasted of the sea and the wind and of Raphael, but below that was a chill old and inhuman. No, no, no! The cold power can\u2019t have him! Jaw clenched, she strapped on the crossbow and ran over the edge of the roof, intending to ride the wind up to Raphael, but the force of it threatened to throw her against a building, smashing her to pieces.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she fought against the violence, but her wings had begun to crumple when a flash of blue appeared under her, holding position with a strength that made his growing power clear. Realizing what Illium was trying to do, she allowed herself to drop. He twisted at the last second to catch her, spiraling down to another rooftop in a controlled descent.</p><p>As soon as they landed, Elena looked up again and saw that Raphael remained in the center of the bloodstorm, his mind distant from hers. \u201cCan you reach him?\u201d she said, screaming to be heard over the rising wind.</p><p>His own hair whipping off his face, arms tight around her, and eyes glowing gold, Illium shook his head. \u201cSomething is blocking me, blocking all of us!\u201d</p><p>No, she thought again, this time not in panic but in resolute fury. No one was ever going to separate her from Raphael. He was hers. Focusing through the bloody rain that slashed at her face and turned the world crimson, she looked only for the archangel who was her own, her mind reaching for his, powered by a connection that was the sum of both of them.</p><p>It was as if a great wall stood between them, but Elena wasn\u2019t about to give in. Hacking at it until it felt as if her mind was as bloody as the rain, she smashed a hole big enough to thrust her hand through. Raphael!</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>He heard Elena\u2019s voice in his mind, cutting through the whispers that surrounded him, whispers that weren\u2019t words but that he understood all the same. This was a test, the voices said, as had been the others. But who would dare test an archangel? That was a question to which he had no answer, but he knew one thing: no power in the universe could separate him from his hunter.</p><p>Smashing through the gray wall of whispers, he grabbed hold of her hand. I am here, Elena, he said, the connection between them pure and unhindered. Fly to me.</p><p>The wind\u2014</p><p>It won\u2019t stop you. Nothing had the right to touch his consort without his permission. Illium, he said to the member of his Seven who held her safe, release her.</p><p>Parting the wind with a blade of agonizing power, he watched her take off, her wings a spread of midnight and dawn streaked with indigo and twilight blue, resplendent against the bloody rain that soaked the city. That rain parted for her as the wind had done\u2014as the birds now did. Until her body aligned with his, her hands on his shoulders, her wings folding in silent trust, his arm around her waist.</p><p>Bright eyes of silver-gray searching his own. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The power, cold and beautiful and dangerous, had threatened to swallow him, but in his refusal to be cut off from Elena, he\u2019d found the clarity to understand once more that he couldn\u2019t hope to control the vicious strength of it . . . but even a mere taste had been potent. If he could just find a way to hold a fraction of it, no other immortal would dare turn his or her eyes to his territory.</p><p>Elena\u2019s fingers digging into his shoulders. \u201cHey, hey, your eyes are going black again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much power, Elena,\u201d he said, burying his face against her hair as the cold fingers of it snaked through his veins. The whispers urged him to accept what he was given, as the scent of age, of time, filled his senses, as if this power had slept an eon and woke only for him. \u201cI would be the most powerful archangel in the world.\u201d</p><p>Shivering at the ice in that whisper, in her awareness that his heart no longer beat, his breath frigid, Elena tugged back his head to look into those inhuman eyes. \u201cYou would be a monster,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI\u2019d be nothing to you, my life one you\u2019d snuff out without thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are everything.\u201d His kiss was so cold it threatened to shock her own heart into halting its beat. Unlike him, she wouldn\u2019t survive.</p><p>Raphael, my . . . she managed to get out through the searing cold, her breath frozen in her chest when he broke their kiss. I\u2019m dying, Archangel. It took all her strength to force that out past the ice in her brain.</p><p>A blink, incandescent blue flaring outward from his irises as one of his hands flattened over her breastbone. \u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>A punch of violent white-hot power that made her scream, her back bowing and her heart stuttering back to life. Somehow finding the will to think, to get her frozen hands to his cheeks to cup his face, she said, \u201cLet it go,\u201d through chattering teeth. \u201cThe power isn\u2019t worth the price.\u201d</p><p>Both arms crushing her close, his breath still frigid but his eyes that incredible, astonishing blue, he said, \u201cHold on, hbeebti.\u201d</p><p>The sky exploded in an ear-piercing lightning storm of blue electric with piercing white fire that sheared away the ruby red to expose patches of the sky as it should be. With the blood went the abnormal cold and Elena found herself gulping in air that didn\u2019t feel as if it was frozen crystals in her throat, in her lungs, her heart kicking into a normal rhythm.</p><p>She jerked when the first icy droplet hit her cheek . . . but this was only water, the air scented with the clean, fresh ozone of the rain that crashed down from a storm-darkened sky, washing away the stain of blood. Leaning back as much as she could given the tightness of Raphael\u2019s hold, she tugged down his head with a hand on his nape and kissed him again\u2014this time, the raw heat of him made her body burn, her breasts swelling against the heavy wetness of her combat gear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGlad to have you back, Archangel.\u201d Another soft, suckling kiss of his lips, warm and alive, the rain turning to steam where they touched.</p><p>His forehead dropped to her own, his breath harsh and chest heaving. \u201cI want no power that makes me cause you harm.\u201d One hand rising between them, he rubbed it over her bruised heart, the curls of heat telling her he was fixing the damage.</p><p>\u201cAll good,\u201d she murmured when he dropped his hand, her skin prickling with the need to reinitiate their bond in a more primal way.</p> <p>\u201cI also,\u201d he said, his body pushing hard and ready against her abdomen, \u201cdo not want any power that turns my cock to ice.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, he was back, she thought with a grin. \u201cYou have no idea how fervently I second that.\u201d And though they hung in the midst of icy winter rain, she took the time to press her mouth to his, to indulge in a kiss so sexual, he might as well have been inside her body. No ice, no distance, only a molten heat between male and female, between an archangel and his consort.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Landing at the Tower, Raphael discovered from Aodhan that people were scared, believing he\u2019d made the sky rain blood.</p><p>That, Raphael thought, could work to their advantage.</p> <p>When he said as much to Elena while they dried themselves off in their Tower suite, she paused with the towel over her breasts, a gleam in her eye. \u201cYou should make sure Charisemnon and Lijuan hear about your new \u2018power.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain they\u2019ve already heard.\u201d Dry, he took the towel and bade her turn so he could pat the last of the moisture off her wings, her feathers designed to sleek off wet. \u201cDmitri says recordings of the event are already trending on media sites worldwide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, what was I thinking?\u201d Elena threw up her hands. \u201cThat New Yorkers would actually, I don\u2019t know, hide or something else sane when the sky was raining freaking blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur people are not so timid.\u201d Dropping the towel, he drew her close and touched his lips to the side of her throat.</p><p>She shivered, leaned back into him, and they simply stood skin to skin for a stolen moment.</p><p>The memory of her warmth was still with him when he met with Nazarach minutes later. The dangerous midlevel angel with wings of burnished amber and skin of gleaming black had bad news. \u201cI\u2019ve had a confirmed report that reborn have been spotted on the outskirts of Atlanta. It\u2019s believed the initial group was brought in on a long-haul truck, possibly after being smuggled in through shipping containers.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael hadn\u2019t expected such sneak tactics from Lijuan on the eve of true battle. He\u2019d believed she\u2019d unleash her reborn during the actual battle, to go up against his ground soldiers. No doubt this was Charisemnon\u2019s influence. \u201cTake your squadron and go stamp out the menace before it spreads.\u201d He couldn\u2019t leave the task to younger, weaker angels, not given the danger.</p><p>\u201cIf New York falls\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford for the reborn to infect any part of the territory. They\u2019re too virulent.\u201d Holding the Tower remained critical, but that didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d permit the rest of his territory to fall into ruin.</p><p>Nazarach left with a promise to return as soon as possible. When Nimra came to Raphael with the same reports about her territory a few minutes later, followed by Andreas, Raphael had had enough. Anger simmering under his skin, he put through a call to Lijuan\u2019s second. The old archangel eschewed modern conveniences, but her people had recently convinced her to upgrade.</p><p>Xi, with his black eyes and striking wings of red-streaked gray, answered within moments. \u201cArchangel.\u201d A polite incline of his head. \u201cHow may I be of service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a message for your mistress,\u201d Raphael said, too furious to temper his words. \u201cTell her I did not expect such cowardice from her.\u201d He ended the call as anger flushed red across Xi\u2019s sharp cheekbones, and was unsurprised when Lijuan\u2019s face appeared in the glass wall of his office moments later, in a show of her power.</p><p>\u201cYou dare call me a coward?\u201d Unhidden rage, her face skeletal as her physical form faded in and out.</p><p>Raphael held her gaze, his own rage as potent. \u201cWhat is it if not cowardice to release your reborn on the edges of my territory, forcing me to scatter my forces?\u201d He gave away nothing by admitting that, since news of the fighting against the reborn would soon spread across the world. \u201cYou must believe your forces weak indeed that you use such contemptible tactics.\u201d</p> <p>Curling black in her irises. \u201cYou should take care in making such accusations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk Xi to turn on a television set. I\u2019m sure the pictures will be available within minutes.\u201d Continuing to face that inhuman visage with its gaping eye sockets and mouth full of silent screams, he said, \u201cPerhaps you should choose your allies more wisely,\u201d certain Lijuan had put Charisemnon in charge of her reborn forces.</p><p>No response, her face disappearing from view . . . but there were no more reports of new infestations in the hours that followed. That still left them dealing with the creatures already loose in the territory\u2014and that proved no easy task for his people, even though Jason\u2019s warning meant they were prepared for Lijuan\u2019s \u201cimproved\u201d design.</p><p>These new reborn didn\u2019t shuffle; they ran in a fast crablike walk. And they weren\u2019t sad or broken at being trapped in their dead bodies; they were mindless creatures that wanted only to feed on living flesh.</p><p>Then they discovered Charisemnon hadn\u2019t forgotten the port city of New York.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Elena said, watching the reborn scrambling down the sides of the cruise ship that had apparently berthed early evening, soon after the steady rain had tapered off at last. Under guard because it had stopped in Charisemnon\u2019s territory some weeks earlier, before the start of hostilities, it had been scheduled to be searched and processed in the next half hour.</p><p>Then one of the dockside workers noticed the blood-soaked \u201cguests\u201d on deck.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did people not know they had those creatures on board?\u201d She shot a crossbow bolt at one particularly fast one that had made it onto the pier, taking out its heart and immobilizing it for the moment.</p><p>At least the pier blazed with floodlights, making the task easier.</p><p>Beside her, Illium unsheathed Lightning, the sword a gleaming piece of death. \u201cNo one to ask, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say Charisemnon\u2019s staff booked out an entire deck for their party and either bribed or threatened someone into permitting them to board at night, before the other passengers. These reborn don\u2019t look human enough to pass otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He used Lightning to point out another snarling creature about to hit the pier, so she could shoot it. \u201cThe initial group of reborn was most probably a small, manageable number, kept alive and sated with the flesh of living victims brought on board at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the plan to unleash them on the other passengers once they\u2019d docked in New York,\u201d Elena completed, seeing the gruesome logic of what he was saying. \u201cEach person they feed off, but leave relatively whole, then rises to become another weapon.\u201d</p><p>Illium nodded. \u201cI assume their handler was alive until an hour ago, since he kept them from rampaging till the ship docked, but either he\u2019s dead now or he didn\u2019t get the order not to attack.\u201d</p><p>Down!</p><p>Dropping at Raphael\u2019s order, Elena covered her ears as he blasted the cruise ship with a bolt of power from above. The massive piece of machinery simply disintegrated, taking the majority of those inside with it\u2014Elena knew the friends and relatives who\u2019d come to meet the ship were distraught, believing their loved ones might somehow have survived the monsters, but Elena knew that was a false hope.</p><p>The reborn scrambling off the ship had had mouths rimmed with blood.</p><p>No way would they seek to abandon a buffet of trapped humans unless that buffet was now empty. Especially given the report that had come in from Nimra\u2019s territory stating the creatures could scent living prey from meters away and would gang up to break through any impediment to that prey, their focus so absolute, it could be utilized to set up an ambush.</p><p>Today, however, it wasn\u2019t about drawing the creatures to a certain point but making sure none left the pier alive.</p><p>\u201cGo! Go! Go!\u201d she yelled to the ground fighters around her as the dust cleared to show some of the reborn had managed to jump free of the ship before it blew and were now swimming to shore.</p><p>Raphael dropped down to join her, unsheathing dual swords rather than expending more power on creatures that could be killed by being beheaded. And so began the grim task of cleaning up the mess Charisemnon had dumped on their doorstep. The absolute worst moment of the entire operation came when Elena found herself face-to-face with a twelve-year-old girl in a drenched sundress, her exposed skin bearing vicious scratches . . . and her teeth stained with blood.</p><p>Claws out, the girl screamed and ran at Elena, feral hunger in her face.</p><p>37</p><p>Hot blood splashing against Elena\u2019s combat gear, that small, blonde head rolling off into the water, Raphael\u2019s hand cupping the side of her jaw. \u201cElena.\u201d It was a snapped command.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d She\u2019d just frozen there for a second, unable to raise her hand against a child. \u201cI forgot there must\u2019ve been kids on board.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later and the mobile reborn were all dead. \u201cHow many in the water?\u201d she asked Illium, who\u2019d been talking to the teams of vampires in watercraft on the river, their spotlights sweeping the water.</p><p>\u201cTwo or three dozen at most. The Sire\u2019s strike incinerated the majority, but we need to make certain none of the drowned are given the chance to rise.\u201d Wiping the back of his hand over his mouth, he walked over to the drowned bodies laid out on the pier and began to behead them one after the other.</p><p>He hesitated at the tiny body of another child, this one a boy of barely four or five.</p><p>\u201cIllium?\u201d she asked when he went down on one knee beside the body, not knowing what answer would be worse\u2014evidence that the child had been alive when Raphael blew up the ship or that he\u2019d joined the monsters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The blue-winged angel\u2019s eyes were bleak as he rose and brought down his sword across that fragile neck. \u201cThere was flesh caught between his teeth, under his fingernails.\u201d</p><p>Rage and sadness burning in her gut, she got a lift from Raphael into the sky and began to sweep the river to make certain none of the bodies had washed downstream. All it would take to spark a deadly infestation was for one reborn to come back to the mockery of \u201clife\u201d that was Lijuan\u2019s gift to her people.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>After the unrelenting horror of the past few hours, Elena was in no mood to see stunning wings of silken copper in Raphael\u2019s office. Needing to deal with an urgent situation in another part of the territory, he\u2019d returned to the Tower thirty minutes earlier, while she\u2019d remained behind with the team doing the final checks to make absolutely certain the reborn threat had been neutralized.</p><p>Tired and dirty, she wanted a shower, the arms of her consort, food, then sleep, in that order. Instead, she saw Tasha of the warrior\u2019s blade and faux friendliness put her hand on Raphael\u2019s arm as she leaned in close to Elena\u2019s man, who was still in his bloodied combat leathers. Face uptilted and that glorious scarlet hair tumbling down her back, the other woman hung on Raphael\u2019s every word.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t realize she had a throwing knife in her hand until the scent of the sea and the rain crashed into her mind. Getting blood out of white carpet is extremely difficult, hbeebti.</p><p>Fuck the carpet. Why are you allowing another woman to touch you?</p><p>I was attempting to be polite to an old friend, but clearly, that approach has failed. Lifting Tasha\u2019s hand off his arm, he placed it by her side. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to accommodate you at the Enclave. There are, however, guest quarters in a skyscraper nearby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? I am disappointed, Raphael.\u201d Tasha\u2019s voice was musical even in her regret. \u201cI truly believe I can offer assistance with what is happening in your territory.\u201d A smile Elena could hear in her tone. \u201cA sounding board as well as my sword.\u201d</p><p>It was the last sentence that threw the switch on Elena\u2019s temper from hot to cold. Bitch knows I\u2019m here and she\u2019s trying to provoke me. Why? So she can show herself to be the more cultured, civilized one? Does she think you\u2019ll love me less if I lose my temper and act like an idiot? The absurdity of such an idea astounded her. Or that I\u2019d turn tail and run, even if she humiliated me? Pride mattered nothing when it came to her love for Raphael\u2014she\u2019d crawl naked and bloodied over hot coals to get to him.</p><p>She has no comprehension of what we are to one another. A single, searing instant of eye contact that made her heart ache. Tasha thinks as many immortals do\u2014in terms of political alliances.</p><p>\u201cTasha.\u201d She waited for the other woman to turn, ersatz surprise in those slanted eyes of emerald green. \u201cThe old days might have been \u2018saturated with joy,\u2019\u201d she said, quoting something Tasha had just been saying, \u201cbut time has moved on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are young, Elena.\u201d If Tasha\u2019s smile had had any more sugar in it, it\u2019d need to come with a warning label from the dentist. \u201cYou cannot understand the bonds that tie together those of us who\u2019ve known one another for a millennium and more.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I\u2019m soooo terribly, terribly wounded by that velvet arrow.</p> <p>Laughter in her mind, the kiss of the sea. Velvet arrow? Your use of language is getting more creative by the day.</p><p>I can\u2019t take credit for that one. It\u2019s all Bluebell. Now be quiet so I can concentrate on not stabbing Ms. McHotpants through the heart to put her out of her misery.</p><p>\u201cI may not understand the bonds of such a long shared past\u201d\u2014Elena relaxed against the doorjamb\u2014\u201cbut I understand the present. And in the present, you\u2019re attempting to seduce my consort. It cheapens you, Tasha.\u201d</p><p>No smile now, tension in that flawless jawline. \u201cYou have no right to make judgments of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me that right when you flew into my city and attempted to fly into the arms of my consort.\u201d She folded her own arms, having secreted away her knife before first speaking to Tasha. \u201cYou should know the latter is an impossibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very certain of yourself for a mortal.\u201d</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t correct her on the whole mortal issue. As far as she was concerned, it wasn\u2019t an insult. \u201cIf I\u2019m certain of one thing, it\u2019s that I love Raphael and he loves me,\u201d she said simply, that truth the very foundation of her life.</p><p>\u201cYes, there is that, isn\u2019t there.\u201d A dazzling smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve caused any discomfort. I\u2019ll remain in the city to assist in any way I can in the coming battle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of my people will escort you to the guest quarters,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Stepping out with those quiet words, the other woman made a flawless takeoff into the midnight sky, a younger angel falling into flight with her.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks I\u2019m ridiculous,\u201d Elena said, eyes narrowed, \u201cand that you\u2019ll fall for her soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe the same, Guild Hunter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe if Tasha continues sniffing around, I may get annoyed enough to slice off her wings\u2014while smiling sweetly, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He opened his arms, and she walked into them without hesitation. \u201cMy beautiful, fierce, bloodthirsty Elena,\u201d he murmured into her hair, a smile in his voice. \u201cTell me about these velvet arrows. I am quite fascinated.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbling out of her, she rose on tiptoe to kiss that smiling mouth and knew that, as with the bloodstorm, Tasha and her ilk had no weapons that could ever sever the connection between her and her archangel.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The world was swathed in the heavy dark of early morning when Raphael went up to the Tower suite he shared with Elena, not tired, but wanting the touch of his consort, their kiss earlier the only contact they\u2019d had. He needed more, needed to drench himself in the life and warmth of Elena, parts of him yet raw from the icy power that had sought to infiltrate his body.</p><p>He\u2019d have fought the urge had his senior angels not all reported in to say they believed they\u2019d contained the reborn threat in their regions, though they\u2019d do further sweeps to make certain. Manhattan, too, was calm, and with three of his Seven at the Tower, he could be assured nothing would slip through the cracks should he step away for an hour or two. Right now, it was Aodhan who stood lead in the operations center\u2013turned\u2013war room, with Illium as backup.</p><p>Elena was asleep facing the center of the bed when he arrived. Stripping, he slid in and tucked her close. She sighed, threw her leg over him in an unconscious possessiveness that made his tension melt away, and didn\u2019t stir again. Stroking the fluid muscle of her thigh, he was considering how most pleasurably to rouse her when there was a knock on the doorway of his mind.</p><p>Sire.</p><p>Sliding out without disturbing his hunter, he pulled on a pair of black pants before walking out onto the balcony off the bedroom. His spymaster whispered out of the shadows, midnight wings folded tight to his back.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you until tomorrow.\u201d He slid the mirrored door quietly shut behind him to block the cold from getting in, Elena\u2019s body yet sensitive to the bitter temperatures.</p><p>\u201cI find I am eager to return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMahiya is now at the Tower.\u201d Part of Raphael\u2019s power came from his Seven, and Charisemnon was underhanded enough to attack that which each male held most dear in order to break them down. In Jason\u2019s case, that position was occupied by the princess he\u2019d brought home from Neha\u2019s land. \u201cI did it for her protection, but it\u2019ll be more dangerous here very soon,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cI give you leave should you wish to move her to a safer location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur place is here,\u201d Jason said without hesitation. \u201cMy Mahiya wouldn\u2019t wish to be stowed out of harm\u2019s way while her friends and family fought.\u201d</p><p>Elena, Raphael remembered, had said exactly the same about Jason\u2019s princess, his consort and the other woman having formed a budding friendship. \u201cWhat news do you bring?\u201d he asked, accepting his spymaster\u2019s decision without question, for his Seven knew their own minds\u2014and he was dead sure Jason spoke Mahiya\u2019s true opinion. His spymaster and the princess had quickly become an impregnable unit.</p><p>\u201cWhile Lijuan has always been treated as a demigoddess by her people,\u201d Jason said, the swirls and curves of his facial tattoo barely visible in the dim light, \u201cshe now truly believes herself a god. Furthermore, she has begun to regard the others in the Cadre as lesser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaliane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer position on the Ancient remains unknown, but my instinct is that she plans to ignore your mother until she believes her power has developed to the point where she can kill Caliane in a single engagement. Though,\u201d Jason added, \u201cI have no doubt that you are right in your request of your mother\u2014should Caliane leave Amanat vulnerable, Lijuan would strike at once and with vicious fury.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cMy ability to harm Lijuan threatens her delusion of godhood.\u201d That understanding eliminated any hope of a peaceful resolution. \u201cHer offensive forces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the verge of leaving her territory. If she uses both modern means and winged flight to get them here, she\u2019ll be ready to strike within the next four to five days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to recall Naasir.\u201d His mother wouldn\u2019t need the vampire while Amanat was safe under her shield, and Naasir was a berserker fighter on the ground. Then there were his more subtle talents, every one of which would be needed with so many of their winged fighters out of commission. \u201cThe question is, do I recall Galen and the Refuge squadron?\u201d His weapons-master would be a lethal asset in combat, but it would leave Venom alone to protect Raphael\u2019s Refuge stronghold.</p><p>\u201cWith her delusions of being a deity,\u201d Jason pointed out, \u201cLijuan may not feel she needs to obey the rule that places the Refuge out of bounds of war. We can\u2019t risk her viewing your stronghold as a weak target.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Especially since Lijuan and Charisemnon might not be the only threats. Every archangel had forces in the Refuge\u2014pulling Galen and the squadron could well make Raphael\u2019s stronghold too tempting a target for one of the others. Not only that, but the people who looked to him in the Refuge would see any such move as an abandonment, while still others would interpret it as a sign of weakness. And the fall of the stronghold would demoralize his Tower troops, for many had family within those walls.</p><p>No, Galen, Venom, and the squadron must remain to guard against a possible Refuge strike. Raphael would have access to Galen\u2019s warrior mind, and Venom\u2019s slyly inventive one, through the constant communications link between the Tower and the Refuge stronghold.</p><p>Jason, Naasir, Illium, Dmitri, and Aodhan, they were a formidable force. He knew each would fight with the fury of a thousand ordinary fighters. But as he\u2019d pointed out to Elena, Lijuan, too, had men and women of power by her side. Even with the assistance Elijah had pledged, Raphael\u2019s troops would have to fight with cunning and intelligence to balance the enemy\u2019s greater numbers and strength.</p> <p>That, however, was a conversation that didn\u2019t have to take place right this instant.</p><p>\u201cGo to your princess, Jason,\u201d he told his spymaster. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk of the rest come dawn.\u201d</p><p>He felt the door open at his back even as Jason took off in silence, a winged piece of the night, and turned to hold out his arm. A sleepy-eyed Elena came into his embrace, the satin of her robe cool against his skin. \u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>Enclosing her in his wings to protect her from the cold, he said, \u201cHe brought the news we expected.\u201d</p><p>The sleep faded from her expression as he told her what Jason had shared. \u201cI know this is a fight between immortals,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think you\u2019d be remiss not to accept those from the Guild who want to join in the defense. This is a Guild city, too, home of our HQ.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael had, in truth, not thought of the hunters, dismissing the mortals from the field of battle as too weak, too easily broken. As Elena had once been broken . . . but before that, she\u2019d fought with such heart as even an archangel couldn\u2019t fault.</p><p>\u201cAsk Sara to join us in the war room tomorrow morning\u2014she can disseminate the news to her hunters.\u201d He paused. \u201cAsk Deacon, too.\u201d The mortal male was a genius with weaponry, could well come up with innovative strategies on how they could best utilize the weapons at their disposal.</p><p>\u201cCan we go out, meet Lijuan\u2019s forces midway?\u201d Elena asked, thinking like the warrior she was. \u201cRather than letting them hit the city, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDmitri, Galen, and I gave the option serious consideration, but with our forces weakened, we\u2019re already in a compromised position. Should our people fall in battle over the sea, we may not be able to retrieve them in time.\u201d Meaning loss after loss. \u201cInside Manhattan, in comparison, we can set up a defensive perimeter, giving us a secure base from which to launch our attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rest of the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is about sacking New York or causing carnage. Lijuan wishes to display her power\u2014to do that, she needs to take the Tower and either kill or subjugate me to her will.\u201d Soft, heavy snowflakes hitting his wings. \u201cInside.\u201d</p> <p>Not arguing, Elena walked in and, dropping the robe, jumped under the comforter.</p><p>He kicked off his pants and slid in beside her, running his knuckles from her breastbone to her navel. \u201cTo reduce the number of possible casualties, I\u2019ll be ordering the evacuation of all humans except Guild personnel who wish to stay.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAll of Manhattan? How can that be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIllium has taken the lead in the planning and tells me he foresees no problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome people won\u2019t want to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t have a choice.\u201d Cupping her between the legs without warning, he caught her gasp with his kiss. \u201cEnough talk of battle. Right now, I need my consort.\u201d</p><p>The stark statement melted Elena\u2019s bones. Closing her fingers over his nape as her flesh grew warm and damp against his fingers, she tugged him down for a slow, sipping kiss, as if they were two people on a first date . . . but for the fact that he had his hand between her legs, and his thumb was brushing across her clit in a slow, erotic tease.</p><p>Wrapping her leg over his hip, she played her fingers through his hair and continued to kiss him soft and sweet. \u201cCome inside me,\u201d she whispered, needing the intoxicating physical connection.</p> <p>He removed his hand to shift over her, his wings spread in magnificent display. \u201cYou are wet for me, hbeebti.\u201d It was an intimate murmur in the dark, the blunt head of his cock pressing against her sensitive entrance.</p><p>\u201cSo wet for you.\u201d She shivered as he began to push inside her, thick and hard and insistent, her hands splaying on the tensile muscle of his back.</p><p>One arm braced beside her head, the hand of his other possessive on her breast, he molded her flesh with erotic confidence and continued to push inside. The intense slide of heated steel across her delicate tissues made her moan, her back arching.</p><p>He paused the inexorable pressure to claim a kiss, his tongue tasting her deep, before holding her gaze and thrusting the final thick inch into the tight clasp of her body. They both shuddered, locked together as close as two bodies could get\u2014then his mouth touched her throat and her lips his shoulder, as his hand slid off her breast to caress her thigh.</p><p>It was a slow, tender dance, their bodies rocking together as they kissed and touched and murmured to one another in the dark. \u201cKnhebek, Archangel,\u201d she said at the end, pleasure a languorous ripple in her blood and her lover\u2019s skin rough heat over her own.</p><p>\u201cElena.\u201d The masculine groan made her clench around his cock, the hot pulse of his seed marking her in a primal claim.</p><p>Wanting to watch his pleasure, she lifted her lashes . . . and felt her breath leave her lungs in a rush, Raphael\u2019s wings edged by an intensely beautiful flicker of haunting white fire.</p><p>38</p><p>The next day, after a three-hour warning to permit people to gather what they needed, angels hovered over every major route out of Manhattan as an army of cops made sure residents left in an orderly fashion. Normally, the Tower didn\u2019t mess with the civilian force made up of mortals and vampires, but, as with everything else in this territory, the organization fell ultimately under Raphael\u2019s authority, and he\u2019d exercised his power.</p><p>Not that the police officers were averse to what they were being asked to do. One of Elena\u2019s cop friends had put it best: \u201cAfter our briefing this morning about the hurt Lijuan\u2019s planning to bring down on the Tower, and seeing those fucking nasty reborn things scuttling on the pier, I wouldn\u2019t want my family in Manhattan.\u201d</p><p>The cops\u2019 next task would be to maintain order in the surrounding boroughs and make certain no one crossed back into Manhattan.</p><p>Fear lingered an acrid taint in the air during the evacuation, but the sight of grim-faced angels overhead and equally lethal vampires on watch in the evacuated parts of the city meant no one stepped out of line\u2014especially after Illium picked up a pair who had thought to burglarize an empty building and dumped them into the freezing waters of the Hudson. He left them there for the maximum survivable time, their eyes panicked and lips blue.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d the message went out, \u201cwe will not retrieve those consigned to the water.\u201d</p><p>There were no further incidents.</p><p>Jeffrey, Elena was glad to see, moved his family\u2014including Beth\u2014out by helicopter the first day. Beth, by contrast, was hysterical when she called Elena that afternoon. \u201cWhat if Harrison dies?\u201d her sister sobbed.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t lie; she didn\u2019t say any one of them would make it out of this alive. Instead, she reassured Beth that the city\u2019s defenses were strong, the evacuation a precaution. After hanging up, her sister marginally calmer, she returned to the young angelic squadron to which she\u2019d been attached, their task to assist in the evacuation of the city\u2019s most vulnerable.</p><p>Not strong enough to carry sick adults or older children across to hospitals outside Manhattan, she carried bundled-up babies and toddlers. The latter, despite their illnesses, grinned throughout each flight, not a lick of fear in their expressions. \u201cCan we do that again?\u201d a four-year-old asked when they landed, his cheeks bright red because he\u2019d wanted to face the wind the entire time, despite her attempts to shelter him.</p><p>Bending down to hug his thin body, the IV port on his left hand appearing far too harsh for his delicate skin, she said, \u201cYes,\u201d and hoped it was a promise she\u2019d be alive to keep. \u201cAfter we fight the bad people, I\u2019ll come back and see you again.\u201d</p><p>Then she passed him to the care of the nurse who waited, and she returned to carry across another child, the ambulances\u2014road and air\u2014reserved for those who needed the support of medical machinery. Tower, Guild, police, and corporate choppers were all pooled into the effort, while hunters drove the elderly, and those others who required special assistance, from point to point.</p><p>Most evacuees had friends and family with whom they could stay, and still others were invited in by kind neighbors in surrounding areas. However, for those who found themselves homeless, emergency services\u2014acting in concert with the Tower\u2014had set up temporary but snug housing facilities on Tower-owned land in nearby areas. The latter had been done well before the evacuation was announced, which spoke to the precision planning behind the entire operation.</p><p>Elena had never seen any evacuation proceed with such speed and lack of trouble\u2014but then again, this was the evacuation of a healthy city into equally healthy areas. No natural disaster had blocked supply lines, damaged roads, or hit the workforce.</p><p>Forty-eight hours after it began, Manhattan was a ghost city.</p><p>Flying above the empty streets, the odd bit of paper fluttering on the pavement and a lone dog looking up at her, Elena felt a shiver crawl down her spine. The heart of her city was meant to be loud and noisy and full of people. Not that she believed they\u2019d evacuated every single mortal\u2014it was a sure bet some enterprising souls had managed to avoid the mass departure, but they were hidden ghosts, the landscape desolate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unable to bear passing over the deserted silence of Times Square, she angled to land at one of the air defense stations, the anti-wing guns primed and ready. Not far from her stood Dmitri, his attention on whatever was being said by a pair of vampires who were experts in using the weapon.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s second looked no different from before he\u2019d left the city, his presence darkly sexual with an undertone of deadly violence. But he\u2019d come back with a hunter wife now at work as part of the combined Guild-Tower operations team\u2014Honor wasn\u2019t yet at full strength, but neither was she an ordinary new-Made vampire, her skin brushed with a shimmer of gold, her eyes a luminous jewel green, her mortal beauty honed as sharp as a blade.</p><p>The other hunter had laughed at Elena\u2019s flabbergasted expression when they first came face-to-face. \u201cI know, I know. It was a bit of a shock to me, too.\u201d A deep smile, Honor still Honor. \u201cBut hey, I was Made by an archangel and feed solely from a dangerously sexy thousand-year-old vampire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it weird?\u201d The question was one Elena had only felt comfortable asking because Honor was a friend. \u201cThe blood drinking?\u201d</p><p>Honor\u2019s honey gold skin had turned a fascinating shade of pink. \u201cOh, um, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, no?\u201d Elena had teased, delighted to see Honor so happy after the horror the other woman had survived. \u201cDmitri clearly gives good . . . blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband,\u201d a still pink but laughing Honor had said, her words holding an adorable possessiveness, \u201cgives phenomenal . . . blood.\u201d</p><p>Now, the husband in question finished his conversation with the two gunners and strode over. Even dressed in scuffed black boots, jeans of the same black, and a black T-shirt, his attention totally focused on the city\u2019s defenses, no time for the insidious scent games he usually liked to play, there was something about Dmitri that whispered of sex\u2014the bloody, painful kind.</p> <p>\u201cAre you free?\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the curt question, having just finished her duties with the team assigned to make absolutely sure all the hospitals had been evacuated. \u201cYou have a job for me?\u201d Dmitri would never be her friend, and she\u2019d never see in him whatever it was that Honor saw, but when it came to protecting their city, they had no arguments.</p><p>\u201cThe Guild teams need a winged consult.\u201d He pointed out another high-rise. \u201cThe two team leaders are up there.\u201d</p><p>Demarco and Ransom looked up at the wash of wind generated by her wings. \u201cI hear you guys asked for a consult,\u201d she said, meeting Demarco\u2019s light brown eyes first, because she didn\u2019t want to see the coolness in Ransom\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cEllie.\u201d The rangy hunter grinned, streaky blond hair ruffled by the wind and long legs folded in a crouch in front of what appeared to be a chalk outline of the defensive perimeter. \u201cOur own personal hunter angel.\u201d Shifting, he showed her the front of his oatmeal-colored T-shirt. \u201cDidjya know they\u2019re selling these in Times Square?\u201d</p><p>Groaning at the solid black silhouette of a gun and crossbow-toting female with wings, the name Elena emblazoned above the figure, and the words Hunter Angel below, she rubbed at her eyes. \u201cGod damn it, get rid of that monstrosity before I go blind.\u201d</p> <p>Demarco just grinned as she dropped her hands from her face to walk over and crouch between the two men. Then, when she couldn\u2019t avoid it any longer, she dared look up at Ransom.</p><p>His expression as tentative as she felt, he gave her a lopsided smile. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, painfully relieved he wasn\u2019t holding a grudge.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you two acting like moobs on a first date?\u201d Demarco asked in open confusion. \u201cDid you dump the librarian and the archangel and rub your naughty bits together? Man, it must\u2019ve really sucked eggs if you\u2019re avoiding eye contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemarco,\u201d Elena and Ransom growled together.</p><p>\u201cAnd awkward moment over.\u201d Demarco winked, his usual laid-back grin on his face. \u201cLet\u2019s talk angels, crossbows, and bullets.\u201d</p><p>They spent the next ten minutes in a discussion of optimal positioning, after which the focus shifted on how the shooters\u2014crossbow wielders and those with specialized anti-angel guns\u2014could do the most damage with the least effort.</p><p>Elena\u2019s advice was simple. \u201cAim for the wings.\u201d It was highly unlikely either weapon could kill immortals of the age and strength as those in Lijuan\u2019s army, but if the Guild team could keep wounding the enemy fighters long enough, the immortals on their side might be able to finish the task.</p> <p>\u201cWe have crossbow users like you who have precision aim,\u201d Demarco countered, his careless charm discarded to reveal hard-eyed intensity. \u201cYou can get bolts through the neck. It\u2019ll disable the enemy fighters for longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take longer to get off a shot.\u201d Elena thought of the intricate timing that\u2019d be required and shook her head. \u201cWe can take out more with the wing hits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but the ones with injured wings will rise faster, too.\u201d</p><p>They both looked to Ransom. Frowning, the other hunter said, \u201cWe have approximately twenty-five precision bowmen. We can embed them with the ones aiming for the wings, so the enemy doesn\u2019t know who to take out and the shooters have time to aim under the cover provided by the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d Demarco glanced at Elena, and when she nodded in agreement, said, \u201cOkay, positions.\u201d</p><p>They spent the next few hours making sure all the shooters knew where they were supposed to be once the shit hit the fan. When Ransom and Demarco were satisfied with that aspect of things, Elena rounded up a crew of junior angels and did flyovers so the hunters could practice aiming at a moving, winged target. The gunmen used blanks, the crossbow users blunted bolts.</p><p>When they called the exercise to a halt, Elena spent a quarter of an hour discussing possible refinements with Demarco and Ransom, before taking off again, her intent to head to Raphael. He was at a higher elevation, working out something with Illium and Jason that periodically cracked black lightning across the sky.</p><p>She\u2019d just swept around to begin the climb when it happened.</p><p>The Hudson altered color in a rolling wave. This time it wasn\u2019t the shade of blood, but a deep, vibrant blue electric with a luminous white fire. Angels who\u2019d been nearby hovered above the water, but Elena saw the gulls dive in and out with no ill effects, the shimmering blue glittering on their feathers until it drained off.</p><p>\u201cAn interesting development,\u201d Raphael said, having dropped down to hover beside her. \u201cAstaad is rumored to have a certain control over the sea\u2014but it may well extend to domination over water in general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but those are your colors.\u201d That heartbreaking blue, more pure than any gemstone on this earth, existed only in the eyes of her archangel and the woman who\u2019d given birth to him; never had she seen it in any other circumstance. Until now.</p><p>\u201cThe day I ascended to the Cadre,\u201d Raphael murmured, \u201cthe skies rained such a hue and the waters of the world became my eyes. I did not have you in my heart then; there was no dawnlight.\u201d</p><p>Elena glanced at the purity of his profile, the deep red mark on his temple hidden behind glamour. \u201cCould it be a sign? Of further evolution?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but remember the astonishing beauty of the white fire on his wings that he\u2019d said must\u2019ve been an illusion created by a pulse of power that ignited a glow.</p><p>It sounded right . . . except her gut insisted that what she\u2019d seen had been real, that if she\u2019d reached up and touched his primaries at that instant, she\u2019d have caught a flame on her fingertip.</p><p>\u201cIf this is a sign of evolution,\u201d Raphael said, \u201cit\u2019s not one I can sense, as I sensed my ascension from angel to archangel.\u201d Angling his wings, he swept down to the water.</p><p>Elena followed as close as she could get, close enough to see him run his fingers through it. The water, he said, tastes of the same power that attempted to push its way into me.</p><p>Get away from it, she ordered, her heart stuttering at the sensory memory of the terrible cold that had come with the bloody rain.</p><p>There is no chill beyond that of a winter river today, he said, but flicked off the water and rose to her side.</p><p>The color began to retreat at almost the same instant.</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what this portends,\u201d he said, expression brutally pragmatic, \u201cwe can\u2019t permit it to distract us, not when Lijuan\u2019s winged fleet has been spotted less than two days\u2019 flight from making landfall.\u201d His hand closed over hers. \u201cOmens and signs are worthless when we\u2019re about to go into battle against a flesh-and-blood army.\u201d</p><p>Some mysteries, Elena thought, as the masculine heat of him reassured her the water had had no ill effects, would have to remain unsolved. The lives of millions were at stake. Because if Lijuan defeated Raphael in battle, it\u2019d mean the death of the only being in the world with a proven ability to cause the Archangel of China any significant harm. Left unchecked, Elena had no doubt Lijuan would soon turn the planet into a festering graveyard peopled by her reborn.</p><p>A court of rotting corpses to worship at the feet of the Goddess of Death.</p><p>39</p><p>The Tower\u2019s satellites got clear eyes on Lijuan\u2019s forces the next day, the heavy clouds that had been blocking their view dissipating under piercing sunlight.</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Jason said at the sight of the incredible mass. \u201cThat army is at least three times the size of the one that left her region. Even if she brought all her winged fighters, leaving only her vampire troops to defend her territory, she has too many squadrons.\u201d</p><p>Raphael had always known they were going into this war at a disadvantage, but if all those men and women were experienced fighters, the scales had tipped so severely in Lijuan\u2019s favor that every one of their plans would have to be reevaluated. \u201cWe need to know exactly what we face.\u201d He turned to the fastest flyer in his squadrons, some said the fastest flyer in all of angelkind. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Illium left at once, taking a small recording device with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a bare hour after that that their battle plans suffered another blow.</p><p>\u201cWe are overrun with reborn,\u201d Elijah told him, his cheekbones cutting sharply against his skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know how Lijuan got them in, or even if she did it with more than a single creature\u2014we both know it would\u2019ve taken only one to start the process.\u201d An indictment of the creatures\u2019 sheer infectiousness. \u201cIt appears to have been a plan put in place over months, the infected seeded throughout my territory and kept chained up behind locked gates. Evidently, she predicted we\u2019d ally and stand against her, for those gates have now been opened.\u201d</p><p>The Archangel of South America shoved a hand through the gold of his hair, his eyes backlit by a furious amber glow. \u201cI\u2019m shamed to break my promise of aid,\u201d he said, the words clearly hard for him to shape, \u201cbut I need to use every weapon at my command to hit hard and fast before the reborn riddle every part of my territory. Already, they\u2019ve killed or infected thousands, savaging entire villages and townships.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe risk is ours,\u201d Raphael said, reminding Elijah they shared a land border. \u201cNo shame comes of your decision. Should you contain them, you more than uphold your part of our pact.\u201d He considered who he had near that border, if they could provide any assistance.</p><p>\u201cMy strongest people are here, others on watch in areas where we had small reborn infestations of our own, but I\u2019ll order every able individual near the border, mortal and immortal, to mobilize with flamethrowers and fuel to set up fire lines. They can at least clean up any reborn that attempt to escape your forces.\u201d The reborn couldn\u2019t survive fire as they couldn\u2019t survive beheadings. \u201cI wish you luck, Eli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, you, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>When Illium returned in the twilight hours beyond midnight, Lijuan\u2019s forces still at least twelve hours away, for they had to move at the speed of their slowest member, he brought worse news than anyone could\u2019ve imagined.</p><p>\u201cYour people didn\u2019t fail,\u201d Raphael said to a quietly infuriated Jason, pointing out a commander to Lijuan\u2019s left. \u201cShe was part of Uram\u2019s troops.\u201d</p> <p>Dmitri pinpointed three more of the dead archangel\u2019s people, all commander level, just in the first row. \u201cUram\u2019s territory was parceled out after his execution,\u201d the vampire said, \u201chis troops divided. If all the extra fighters prove to be Uram\u2019s, she has over half his squadrons. She shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Aodhan was the one who answered, voice quiet but words potent. \u201cIf Raphael were to perish, the Seven divided, would we not come together should we have a chance to avenge his death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think the guy inspired that kind of loyalty,\u201d Elena said, staring at the photographs of the massive force that would soon hit Manhattan. \u201cI mean, he murdered hundreds of his own people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a good archangel once.\u201d An archangel Raphael had called friend an eon past. \u201cThat is who his loyal soldiers remember, who they seek to avenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Galen said from the screen on the wall, where he and Venom had joined in the discussion, \u201cthe enemy outnumbers us five to one. We need to pull our forces inward and compel the enemy to mount a siege. So long as the Tower does not fall, Lijuan doesn\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>Raphael knew what it must\u2019ve cost his weapons-master to make that recommendation, for Galen was a warrior who lived by the blade. And though he knew the other man\u2019s counsel was sound, the idea of abandoning any part of his city made his blood rage.</p> <p>It was Elena who gave him perspective. \u201cWith the entire area evacuated,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019d only be protecting buildings anyway. Buildings can be rebuilt.\u201d Bleak acceptance in the silver-gray, his hunter who loved every tiny pocket and corner of her city.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said to Dmitri. \u201cDo what needs to be done, commandeer the people you need.\u201d All the anti-wing guns would have to be moved, for a start. \u201cI\u2019ll rework the troop placements.\u201d</p><p>Dmitri left with a curt nod, taking Jason with him and ordering Illium to rest after his long flight. Aodhan went in a separate direction, having assumed the task of ensuring there\u2019d be enough food stock inside the Tower for the hunters and the wounded, should the siege continue beyond a few days. Water, at least, was no problem, the Tower having a secret independent line that had been put in place at the time of its construction.</p><p>Raphael turned to the last member of his Seven who remained, Galen and Venom having signed off to return to their task of holding the Refuge stronghold secure. \u201cHow many more do you need in your team?\u201d he asked Naasir. The vampire had arrived forty-eight hours before, fed well, and was at full strength.</p><p>\u201cThe team is complete,\u201d was the response, Naasir\u2019s silver eyes intelligent as only a predator\u2019s could be. \u201cJanvier and his hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call Ash that to her face,\u201d Elena pointed out, wondering what it was Naasir planned to do. If she had to guess, given the team members and their abilities, she\u2019d say it was about causing sabotage and disorder among the enemy camp.</p><p>A feral grin that said Naasir still found her interesting, and then he was gone.</p><p>Alone with Raphael for the first time in hours, Elena touched her fingers to his face and he lifted the glamour to expose the mark on his temple. It had grown at an accelerated rate since the river altered color . . . to the point where it was now clear it had nothing to do with disease\u2014no, it was a symbol both savage and dangerously elegant. Created of complex but jagged lines, it curved down his temple to the top of his cheekbone on one end, the other end curling in on itself.</p> <p>\u201cRaphael, it\u2019s not red anymore,\u201d she whispered, astonished at the primal beauty of a finished design that reminded her of a stylized dragon. \u201cIt\u2019s the color of us.\u201d An incredible violent blue lit with searing white fire, so drenched with light and color that it appeared alive.</p><p>Reinitiating the glamour until they were in the bathroom of their suite, Raphael dropped it to examine the mark in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this design before,\u201d he said, to her surprise. \u201cIn old places in the Refuge, from times so long gone, no one has any memory of when the carvings were created.\u201d</p><p>She hitched herself up on the counter so she could continue looking at the mark that no longer terrified, but compelled. \u201cAny hint as to its meaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I asked Jessamy once, and she said she\u2019d looked in the texts herself and found no mention of them. \u2018Perhaps they are an enigma left behind by our ancestors to inspire us to search for knowledge,\u2019 was what she said to me.\u201d Shifting into the space between Elena\u2019s legs, he was patient as she traced the vibrant, living mark with her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s truly beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Raphael raised an eyebrow. \u201cMany would say it\u2019s savage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavage can be beautiful.\u201d It suited him, her archangel whom she\u2019d seen fight the reborn with raw ferocity, his twin blades moving so fast, she\u2019d wanted only to watch him. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any longer any question that you\u2019re evolving.\u201d</p><p>That hard, pragmatic look back on his face. \u201cNot fast enough. The mark may be complete, but in power, I\u2019m no different than I was yesterday. We must focus on the factors we can control.\u201d He stepped back, the glamour going up. \u201cI need to reconfigure squadron placements. You should wake the leaders of the Guild and vampire shooting teams and do the same.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded. \u201cOne thing, Archangel.\u201d She drew him to a stop with a touch on his wing. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should hide the mark come morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFool the enemy into believing I\u2019ve gained more power than is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd give our own forces heart,\u201d Elena said, pushed by the same instinct that told her his wings were changing in more ways than in surface appearance. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Hours later, with the sky shifting from darkness to gray, Raphael left Aodhan on watch and walked up to the suite, having sensed a disturbance in Elena\u2019s sleep patterns. He\u2019d kept an eye on her since she\u2019d finally gone to bed two hours past, knowing her tiredness and the tension-filled day made for optimal conditions when it came to the horrors that stalked her dreams.</p><p>When he reached the bedroom, he found her restless but not yet in distress. Lying down beside her, he spread his wing over her body in a protective wave and murmured words of love from an archangel to his consort until she sighed and sank into a deep, peaceful sleep. \u201cSleep well, hbeebti,\u201d he said softly, brushing a kiss to her temple.</p><p>Not needing to rest, he had every intention of leaving the bed in the next few moments . . . but then he was dreaming, with no awareness of having closed his eyes. This time, he wasn\u2019t on that lonely, forgotten field, but in a place so dark, it was beyond the rich black of night. He could hear nothing, see nothing, feel nothing, the blackness pressing down until it felt as if it would suffocate the life out of him.</p><p>More games.</p><p>His anger ignited, his wings glowing to fill the dark with light. The blackness swallowed the glow, pushing down harder on his body. Furious, he struck out with his power, and it parted the black, only to reveal more blackness, a world of nothingness. About to strike again, he thought suddenly that he needed Elena, needed the passionate life of her, born of the brilliant firefly existence that was a mortal\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d A touch, fingers rough from weapons-work sliding into his to curl around his hand.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>The rim of silver around her irises luminous in the blackness, she said, \u201cI heard you call my name.\u201d Screwing up her nose, she glanced around. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I like this new dreaming habit of yours.\u201d</p><p>Sliding his wing over hers, he said, \u201cI have to agree with you,\u201d as around them, what had been impenetrable black became a soft gray. \u201cYour heart drives away the dark.\u201d She\u2019d seen terrible things, been bathed in blood, yet in her lived an innocence of soul of which she seemed unaware. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured, her hair flying backward in a gentle breeze. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s me. It\u2019s us.\u201d Wing shifting under his in a soft susurration of sound, she said, \u201cThe white fire, Archangel. Ignite the white fire.\u201d</p><p>He reached within him for that wild, near-uncontrollable flame, coaxing it onto his hand. Where it had once manifested a radiant white-gold with iridescent edges of midnight and dawn, today the white-gold bore swirls of violent blue, the flame just as volatile, as passionately alive. \u201cUs,\u201d he whispered and threw the wildfire up into the gray.</p><p>\u201cWildfire,\u201d Elena whispered, as if he\u2019d spoken aloud. \u201cYes, that describes it so much better.\u201d</p> <p>The wildfire arced out into the gray in every direction, eliminating the fog to leave them encased in sun-shot water of a pale, haunting green.</p><p>Elena ran her fingers through the water, the ripples disturbing the flawless serenity of the place, but there was no sense that the disturbance was unwelcome. \u201cOh, I like it here.\u201d She danced her hand gracefully in the water, her delight without affectation.</p><p>It made his lips curve, his heart remember what it was to be a child. \u201cWe\u2019re deep inside the ocean,\u201d he said, understanding the sunlight wasn\u2019t sunlight at all but the lingering burn of the wildfire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been anywhere so beautiful.\u201d Wonder in her eyes, their handclasp unbroken, Elena pointed out a tiny jellyfish-like creature that floated by, its body a translucent coral . . . but the wildfire, it was fading, the water caressed by gray, then enclosed by darkness.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said, as his consort came into his arms, her hands on his shoulders and her kiss one that branded, drawing him out of the dream and into the warmth of their bed. She was strong and lithe underneath him, his warrior with her mortal heart, eyes of silver-gray open in the murky light that told him he hadn\u2019t slept long.</p> <p>\u201cThe risk,\u201d he said, when their lips parted, \u201cis being consumed by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe darkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you, I might one day have become another Lijuan.\u201d Scowling, she would\u2019ve shaken her head, but he stopped her with a grip on her jaw. \u201cNo, Elena. This truth I must confront\u2014in me lives more power than any other angel my age has ever had. That much power changes a man, and it changed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s a fair point, but what\u2019s also true is that you\u2019re not the archangel I first met.\u201d Elena\u2019s expression stubborn, the hands she\u2019d thrust into his hair fisting tight. \u201cYou\u2019re still becoming\u2014and, unlike Lijuan, you\u2019re not afraid to take risks. She\u2019s a coward who killed the mortal who made her feel; you claimed me as yours.\u201d Tugging him down, she nipped hard at his lower lip in sensual rebuke. \u201cDon\u2019t ever think to compare yourself to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs my consort decrees,\u201d he said, speaking with his lips on hers, his body cradled in the silken prison of her legs. \u201cI know you\u2019d never permit me to turn into a megalomaniacal tyrant with delusions of godhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad we got that straightened out.\u201d Rubbing her nose against his in an open affection he knew he\u2019d never tire of, should he live to be a hundred thousand years old, she said, \u201cWhere we were, it was a place of power, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d That power had saturated the water, the darkness, the living creatures that swam in those deep waters. \u201cNot malevolent, and attuned to me, but out of my reach.\u201d The final bitter seal on the revelation he\u2019d had in the bloodstorm.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>His lips kicked up at the succinct description of his own angry frustration. \u201cIt does.\u201d Kissing her one more time, he rose to sit on the edge of the bed, his hand cupping the side of her face. \u201cSleep. It is early yet and you must rest\u2014I will need my hunter more than ever in the days to come.\u201d</p><p>Elena closed her fingers over his wrist to stop him from leaving. \u201cHow bad is it, Archangel?\u201d It was the question of a consort, and the answer he gave her was one Elena knew he\u2019d give no one else in the Tower, not even his Seven.</p><p>\u201cMy men and women are loyal and will fight to the bloody end,\u201d he said, his broad shoulders holding the weight of a staggering number of lives, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid I am about to lead them into certain death.\u201d</p><p>Getting up onto her knees, she wrapped her arms around him from behind, their faces side by side. \u201cNot one of those men and women would ever want to serve Lijuan, you know that.\u201d She pressed her lips to his marked temple, her understanding born of the hours she\u2019d spent in the infirmary with the injured, and with the able-bodied soldiers who came to visit their fallen comrades. \u201cOur people would rather go honorably in a fight against evil than cower under its hand.\u201d</p><p>Raphael took a long, deep breath, his shoulders straightening and his head rising. \u201cNo one,\u201d he vowed, \u201cwill ever subjugate those who are our own. Never will we surrender.\u201d</p><p>40</p> <p>Five hours into the new day, Raphael\u2019s spymaster flew back to tell him Lijuan\u2019s troops had crossed the early-warning border. A single command and Raphael\u2019s offensive squadrons formed around him, the defensive perimeter tight and in place as he led the squadrons out across the city and over the water.</p><p>\u201cHold this position,\u201d he told his commanders when they reached a location where his people could see the approaching army but remained within a hard, fast flight distance to their perimeter.</p><p>Leaving them hovering in precision formation, he flew out to meet Lijuan midway between the two armies. His move was a risk, given her increasing madness, but he believed part of her remained an archangel of old as yet, and seconds after he began his flight, his belief proved true. Cleaving to the rules of battle laid down at the dawn of angelkind, the Archangel of China flew alone to meet him in neutral space.</p><p>\u201cRaphael.\u201d Her pale, pale gaze turned to flint as she took in the mark on his temple. \u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears we\u2019ve all been doing that of late,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must\u2019ve worked long and quiet indeed to gain the trust of Uram\u2019s scattered forces.\u201d Until the ordinarily loyal men and women had abandoned their assigned posts and territories to swell her ranks.</p><p>\u201cA goddess,\u201d she said, her physical form fading to turn her skin translucent, \u201cthinks not only for today, but for many tomorrows.\u201d The eerie shift revealed the skeletal structure of her face, the sight merging with the crawling sense of screams beneath the surface of her voice, the trapped souls of those Lijuan had murdered.</p><p>\u201cYour men wear only swords and crossbows.\u201d Guns, at least, were a familiar weapon to most angelic fighters and wouldn\u2019t have weighed down a winged fleet. \u201cDo you foresee an easy victory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been gathering my forces for ten thousand years, while you are a boy. We outnumber you until it will be no battle but an annihilation.\u201d</p><p>Her arrogance, Raphael thought, might just be the Achilles\u2019 heel that\u2019d give his people victory in this unbalanced war. \u201cSuch is your belief, Lijuan. That doesn\u2019t make it the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt soon will be, but before the inevitable, I give you one more chance and invite you to surrender,\u201d she said in that voice full of horror. \u201cI cannot leave you or your consort alive, of course\u201d\u2014utmost civility as she spoke of his and Elena\u2019s executions\u2014\u201cbut I will treat your people as I would my own. Your Seven are extraordinary and will serve me well.\u201d</p><p>His Seven, Raphael thought, would spend their existence attempting to erase Lijuan from the planet rather than lift a finger in her service. \u201cThere is a better way,\u201d he said, extending the talk to give Naasir a final few minutes to put his plans in place. \u201cYou do not have to start a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not starting a war. I am stopping one before it begins.\u201d She smiled at him, her eyes pale orbs with fetid shadows hidden within\u2014as if to look too deep would be to fall into an inescapable hell. \u201cYou have never respected me as you should. I cannot allow that to continue. You understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d That Lijuan was a being of perfect madness, so mad she believed herself sane. Raphael recognized the signs; he\u2019d seen them first in his father. But the powerful man who\u2019d once played tag with him above the Refuge had never become the ugliness that was Lijuan. She was something new, a nightmare born of the rot at the core of her soul. \u201cIn turn,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must understand that I cannot allow you to take my Tower and my city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m afraid we are at an impasse.\u201d Her smile never faltered, her teeth and jaw visible through skin turned to smoke. \u201cWe will be civilized about this. I will not attack you until you are with your troops, and you will not attempt the same.\u201d</p><p>Accepting the stipulation, he said, \u201cIf you wish to cease hostilities at any stage, you need only remove your forces from my territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd should you wish to surrender, your fighters need only lay down their arms. Mine will not attack once your people are no longer a threat\u2014unlike Charisemnon, I have no wish to degrade. My aim is only to conquer.\u201d A pause. \u201cIt was not well done of him to so dishonorably use the reborn I gave him as a gift. I have told him I will not tolerate any further acts that bring disgrace upon my name.\u201d</p><p>Raphael inclined his head. \u201cI will see you in battle, Lijuan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Raphael. You would\u2019ve made a great Ancient one day, if only you had learned to respect your betters.\u201d</p><p>Flying back to his troops at high speed, Raphael reached out to Elena. He needed her touch to erase the ugliness that permeated his bones, Lijuan\u2019s presence a seeping wrongness in the fabric of the world. Elena, battle is imminent.</p><p>We\u2019re ready. A kiss of untamed wildness that could be no one but his consort. I\u2019m watching for you.</p><p>Ordering his troops to retreat inside the siege zone, Illium leading them in, he took the rear with Jason and Aodhan at his flanks. It was a wise move, Lijuan sending a blast in his direction the instant he hit the edge of Manhattan. Her power manifested as a hail of black daggers, gleaming and deadly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other archangel, however, was too far away to do much damage, her aim no doubt to send his troops into disarray. Brushing the daggers aside with a minimal use of power, he turned to see that none of his people had dropped even an inch out of formation. There was no second attempt, Lijuan obviously realizing she couldn\u2019t do any real harm from that distance, and a few minutes later, his squadrons crossed the line of their defensive perimeter.</p><p>Wings filled the sky in every direction, each and every fighter dressed in a distinctive black uniform to distinguish them from the dark gray and red of Lijuan\u2019s forces. To further avoid confusion, every single pair of wings\u2014including Raphael\u2019s\u2014was marked above and below with streaks of a shimmering blue paint developed exactly for this purpose. Designed not to clog or otherwise harm their feathers, it meant the shooters could see if an angel was friend or foe at a glance.</p><p>Those shooters lay concealed in protective hides on the rooftops and in the now windowless top floors of several high-rises, as well as on the perimeter line alongside vampires expert in anti-wing weaponry, the guns pointed skyward. More vampires stood on the ground armed with flamethrowers and swords, their task to attempt to eliminate or so disable downed enemy fighters that they couldn\u2019t heal and rise again. A third group of vampires prowled the city, on alert for any reborn threat.</p> <p>Rising above the squadrons, so he was visible to all, he raised his arm and his sword. \u201cThis is our land,\u201d he said, augmenting his voice so it\u2019d reach every man and woman, mortal and immortal, who\u2019d fight this day. \u201cWe will not be intimidated, and we will not surrender. We did not begin this war, but we will end it!\u201d</p><p>A roar shook the world, arms and voices raised in solidarity.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Pride rocked Elena\u2019s heart where she lay on her front on a rooftop, crossbow notched and eyes alert. Protected by a hide that meant flying troops wouldn\u2019t immediately spot her, the shell also one that\u2019d protect her from shots from above, she had a perfect line of sight to the man who was her own.</p><p>You should be proud, Archangel. Your people fight not because of fear or arrogance, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p> <p>A caress of the sea and of the crashing storm of him. Be safe, Guild Hunter.</p><p>You, too. Heart a hard knot inside her chest, she took a deep breath and wiped her mind clear of all thought, the word having just gone out that Lijuan\u2019s troops were about to hit.</p><p>The enemy was heralded by a hail of black daggers and the staccato sound of gunfire as the anti-wing weapons went into action. But they\u2019d calculated correctly\u2014there were too many enemy fighters for the guns to catch and the first wave of unmarked wings came into view and into range within thirty seconds . . . as Raphael\u2019s troops dropped toward the earth in a sudden, planned plummet, leaving the sky full of the enemy.</p><p>Elena\u2019s first bolt hit the neck of an angel with wings of dappled brown; she was already slotting in a second bolt before the angel registered the hit and began to spiral down, one hand clasped over his bloody throat. At the same time, black and blue collided in the sky above as two archangels went head-to-head. Knowing she\u2019d be of no use to Raphael if she couldn\u2019t hold it together, Elena shook off her fear for him and focused on the enemy, trusting her consort and lover not to break her heart while she did her part.</p><p>Bolt after bolt she shot, until the sky was suddenly empty of wings unmarked by shimmering blue. Elena waited for a message through the communications devices everyone had tucked over their ears. It came within seconds, the voice Dmitri\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cLijuan\u2019s troops have retreated beyond our defensive perimeter, but we\u2019ve lost a quarter of the anti-wing guns. Stand down but do not leave your positions.\u201d</p> <p>Elena used the opportunity to check her supply of bolts. Seeing that she was nearly out, she switched channels to send a request to the senior Guild trainees running supplies, flicking back in time to catch an updated report from the Tower.</p><p>\u201cEnemy troops have settled on buildings outside the reach of our weapons. We injured a large number, but they\u2019re recovering and are likely to strike again within the hour. Alternate breaks authorized.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>With Lijuan falling back with her troops, Raphael had time to return to the Tower, get a report from Dmitri. His second was coordinating their entire force, making the split-second decisions so necessary in a fight, and which Raphael couldn\u2019t make so long as he was battling Lijuan. He knew Dmitri would rather be out in the field, fighting like the honed blade he\u2019d always been, but the other man was the best commander he had. Even Galen deferred to Dmitri when it came to matters of strategy.</p><p>\u201cNo fatalities,\u201d the vampire said, bearing out Raphael\u2019s judgment and faith. \u201cA number of serious injuries among the aerial defense gunners, but the angelic fighters nearby acted quickly to cover the injured, while other shooters dragged them to safety.\u201d He pointed out several black Xs on the map laid out on a large table in the war room. \u201cHere\u2019s where we lost the aerial defense weaponry, but that loss was expected and is already factored into our plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Lijuan suffer any fatalities?\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cSignificant in the first wave, when the shooters sent near to half a squadron to the ground for the vampires to clean up, but the enemy learned from that loss. When one fighter falls, two more land with him to fight off the ground teams and lift the injured to safety.\u201d</p><p>It was more or less what Raphael had expected of this first engagement. \u201cThe true test will come with the next clash, now that we no longer have the element of surprise.\u201d</p> <p>Jaw a harsh line, Dmitri nodded. \u201cElijah called not long ago, wished to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you two of my elite fighter squadrons,\u201d the other archangel said, when Raphael returned the call. \u201cThey\u2019re already halfway to your Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reborn?\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s smile held blood fury. \u201cMy animals have learned the hunt now, and their sense of sight and smell is beyond anything the reborn have the capacity to avoid. While I continue to need most of my forces to ensure we get each and every one of the creatures, the two elite units will be of far more use to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Dmitri send through a clear flight path,\u201d Raphael said, his trust in Elijah such as he\u2019d never expected to have in another one of the Cadre. \u201cLijuan\u2019s people haven\u2019t yet managed to surround us, so your squadrons can come in without encountering enemy fire.\u201d</p><p>The good news was rapidly followed by bad. Satellite images showed several aircraft flying low over the ocean perhaps an hour\u2019s flight from the city, then ejecting what appeared to be large pods from their holds that floated rather than sank.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a quarter of Lijuan\u2019s fleet is taking off toward the pods, likely to tug them in,\u201d Dmitri said, having eyes on the enemy through the city\u2019s network of surveillance cameras as well as the special spy cameras Naasir\u2019s team had put in place. \u201cThey have to contain ground troops.\u201d</p><p>Raphael agreed. Which meant Lijuan would soon have vampires to battle his own, leaving her angels free to remain in the sky rather than go to the aid of downed winged fighters. Even with the addition of Elijah\u2019s squadrons, Raphael\u2019s forces would\u2019ve remained badly outnumbered. This simply tipped the scale further in Lijuan\u2019s favor.</p><p>Three minutes later, one of Jason\u2019s people called in a report: cargo planes had just left Lijuan\u2019s territory, loaded with rocket launchers and guns, as well as further ground forces. It seemed the \u201cgoddess\u201d had changed her mind on certain points. Raphael\u2019s people had both types of weapons, but the rockets, they\u2019d decided, would only be used in a last-case scenario; no matter how well aimed, the resulting damage would leave not only Manhattan but the entire city a ruin.</p><p>And the fact was, they weren\u2019t particularly useful in a sky filled with friends and enemies locked together in such close combat. Not unless you didn\u2019t care about murdering your own people in order to destroy the enemy.</p><p>Lijuan annihilated her own city, he said to his consort, after he\u2019d assimilated the information, images of the smoking crater that was Beijing at the forefront of his mind. She won\u2019t worry about obliterating ours to win this war.</p><p>It was as well that no large-scale technological weapons of any kind were acceptable in an archangelic war, be they tanks on the ground or bombers in the air. It was the reason why the mortals who\u2019d come up with the ideas for such items of warfare had abandoned the research decades ago\u2014there was no market.</p><p>Even the rocket launchers and anti-wing guns were short-range, line-of-sight weapons. For a win to count in the immortal world, for an archangel to keep the respect of his or her own people, it had to be intimate, face-to-face. An odd stipulation perhaps, until you remembered that an archangel couldn\u2019t be killed by any weapon, no matter how destructive\u2014it was only the lesser angels, vampires, and mortals who\u2019d be among the maimed and the dead.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d Dmitri walked to where he stood in front of the glass wall that looked out over the field of battle. \u201cJason\u2019s man just sent another report confirming the number of cargo planes heading our way.\u201d</p><p>Raphael knew it was further bad news from the brutal lines of his second\u2019s face. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>The word reverberated between them. With that many ground fighters and short-range weapons, Lijuan\u2019s people would swarm his own, coming up from below while the angels kept the winged squadrons occupied. \u201cI must take the planes out before or directly after they land,\u201d he said, knowing he spoke of the death of hundreds. \u201cIt\u2019s the only option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get past her using glamour,\u201d Dmitri said with coolheaded strategy, \u201cbut the instant she hears of their destruction, she\u2019ll know you\u2019re not in Manhattan and unleash all her power on the Tower.\u201d</p><p>And if the Tower fell, the battle would be over in the eyes of the world, New York and the entire territory Lijuan\u2019s. Raphael would fight to take it back, of course, but he knew the loss of the Tower would crush the morale of his people, for it wasn\u2019t simply a place, it was the symbol of their strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seeing movement from the enemy side at the same instant as his second, he dropped the discussion for the moment and left to take to the skies, the second wave of attack far more vicious than the first. Blood splattered the snow everywhere he looked, innocence forever tainted.</p><p>41</p><p>A day of punishing fighting later, Elena lay in her hide again after a short break, protected from the light snow falling out of a sky patchy with cloud. It was a pretty night, peaceful with occasional starlight that glinted through the clouds and devoid of the sounds of battle, but her heart thundered in her ears because Raphael had left the city almost twenty-five minutes earlier.</p> <p>Lijuan had managed to wound him in their last skirmish, his chest raw and burned down one side, but he\u2019d shrugged off the injury\u2014one that made Elena want to stab out the eyes of the murderous bitch who\u2019d hurt him\u2014to focus on how to stop the cargo planes that carried such a deadly payload. His plan, if it succeeded, would provide a much-needed boost to the spirits of their battered people, but it could also go spectacularly wrong.</p><p>\u201cNaasir, you crazy bastard,\u201d she muttered under her breath, \u201cI hope to hell you come through.\u201d The cargo planes would be landing around about now, and somehow, their side had to keep Lijuan distracted long enough for Raphael to make it back after destroying the planes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take many lives this night,\u201d Raphael had said to her in the single private moment they\u2019d had in the midst of the fighting. \u201cHundreds of vampires who\u2019ve done nothing but be loyal to their archangel. I know it must be done to protect my own people, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that their blood will stain my soul.\u201d</p><p>The bleak acceptance in his eyes had broken her heart. And she\u2019d known that even two years past, he wouldn\u2019t have said the same thing, the remoteness of over a thousand years of violent power hardening him to the lives of others. \u201cThat their deaths matter to you,\u201d she\u2019d whispered, \u201cit\u2019s your salvation.\u201d Unlike Lijuan, he didn\u2019t see either his own or the enemy fighters as disposable.</p><p>Now, she waited for him to return, wanting only to hold him after the brutal ugliness of what he\u2019d been forced to do, all because an archangel believed herself a goddess. More like a fucking specter of pure evil, Elena thought, knowing that if there was any way on this earth she could kill Lijuan, she wouldn\u2019t even blink before raising the blade.</p> <p>\u201cBees, Ellie,\u201d came Sara\u2019s voice in her earpiece less than a minute after the scheduled arrival of the planes, her friend in the control room, tasked with handling the Guild teams. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing\u2014there are gazillions of bees around Lijuan\u2019s people and from what we can see they\u2019re mad and stinging like crazy.</p><p>\u201cAnd even weirder, the ones not squirming and slapping off bees are grinning like lunatics because they\u2019re coated in butterflies. I\u2019ve never seen so many in one place. I didn\u2019t even know butterflies flew around at night.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Elena pressed the reply button on the comm device. \u201cNaasir apparently has some tricks up his sleeve.\u201d Hell, if he kept this up, she might have to risk being eaten and kiss him on that gorgeous and freaky mouth the next time she saw him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d Sara logged off.</p><p>Two minutes later, Elena got a confirmation that Raphael had destroyed the planes. \u201cOn alert,\u201d came the order in her earpiece seven minutes after that, the ongoing distractions having apparently bought them that much time. \u201cEnemy forces preparing to launch major offensive.\u201d</p><p>Breathing calm and heart rate steady, Elena kept her eyes on the night sky . . . so she saw the flares that lit it up, dazzling the senses. An enraged scream sounded from Lijuan\u2019s side of the line with the second flare, bolts of archangelic power going completely wide of the Tower by several blocks. Glass smashed, bricks fell, but the Tower remained unscathed.</p> <p>Was the crazy old bitch sensitive to light?</p><p>It made sense, given the paleness of her eyes. But since she appeared fine in daylight, it wasn\u2019t a debilitating weakness, simply one that could be aggravated by the right conditions. Elena decided she really would have to kiss Naasir for figuring that out with his sly tiger-creature brain.</p><p>Flares continued to light up the sky over the next few minutes, exacerbating Lijuan\u2019s screams of fury and keeping her own forces down because her bolts were going so awry, she could as easily hit them. Then the fireworks started.</p><p>Elena couldn\u2019t help it; she began to giggle. They were fighting a battle for their lives and it was going to be fireworks that saved them?</p><p>Giggles passing when a glance at her watch showed Raphael would only be halfway home at this point, she kept her eyes on the brilliant display\u2014and suddenly became aware of midnight blades slicing through the storm of color to hit the Tower and surrounding buildings. \u201cShit. Lijuan\u2019s figured out a way to adapt to the light.\u201d Trying to spot Lijuan\u2019s people among their own as wings filled the air, she found herself blinded by the fireworks. \u201cDmitri! Get Naasir to shut it off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree seconds.\u201d</p><p>The last firework went out as Lijuan\u2019s second blow hit the Tower, leaving a significant dent and destroying an entire row of windows. Scanning the sky, she spotted the Archangel of China\u2019s distinctive white hair above the sea of wings. There was no way to hit her that far up. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Teeth gritted, she started aiming at the enemy angels as they swarmed, their objective clearly to land on the buildings that housed the aerial defense systems and the shooting teams. Precision aim was near impossible with the lack of light and the enemy\u2019s sheer numbers, so she switched approach to go for the wings.</p> <p>All they had to do was hold on until Raphael\u2019s return.</p><p>Angel after angel went down with torn and badly damaged wings, but there was a constant wave of reinforcements, giving the wounded angels time to heal and arise anew. Meanwhile, Elena knew their own forces were being worn down by the constant barrage, above and below, the vampires on the ground no doubt locked in violent combat against vampires and wounded angels both.</p><p>Black lightning splintered the sky the next instant, taking down a number of Lijuan\u2019s people. The lightning didn\u2019t stop Lijuan, but it irritated her enough that she tried to aim for the source, only to find her way blocked by a rain of glittering stone so sharp it threatened to shred her wings. On its heels came a pulse of golden power that smacked into the enemy fighters and Lijuan both, cutting the ordinary angels down like bowling pins and making Lijuan fight to hold her position in the sky.</p><p>Stabilizing, the Archangel of China raised her arm to unleash her power, and the black lightning struck a second time.</p><p>Jason, Illium, and Aodhan, Elena realized, were working together to keep Lijuan annoyed and distracted. It worked, at least for a while. Then Lijuan decided to leave them to her generals, while she flew above the fighting, her focus on the Tower. Her first blast blew out another row of windows to shower the streets in glass; a second one to the same spot would do serious structural damage.</p><p>\u201cArchangel,\u201d Elena whispered, taking aim at one of the enemy generals, \u201cif you\u2019re planning to do something, now would be the time.\u201d</p><p>Her bolt ripped through the red-winged angel\u2019s right wing, just as another hunter hit his left . . . and a spear of incandescent blue kissed with wildfire slammed straight into Lijuan\u2014or it would have, if one of her troops hadn\u2019t angled across her in a suicide intercept.</p><p>Screaming an eerie high-pitched scream, Lijuan retaliated with a hail of black knife blades. Raphael had told Elena the glamour was near impossible to hold at this level of combat, and now she saw him come into view, dodging Lijuan\u2019s power while attempting to find a hole in her defenses. That was all Elena had time to see, enemy fighters continuing to fill the air, Aodhan, Illium, and Jason locked in combat with Lijuan\u2019s generals.</p><p>Notching in bolt after bolt, she continued to shoot, her concentration absolute.</p><p>When blood splattered her face as an angel crash-landed in front of her, her eyes went immediately to his wings. \u201cHe\u2019s one of ours!\u201d she yelled to the trainees by the rooftop door, covering them in concert with another shooter as they dragged the angel to safety. Wiping the blood off using her sleeve, she returned to her task, but it was as if the enemy was multiplying.</p><p>An entire squadron flew right at Elena\u2019s roof, not flinching when five of their team went down with bolts through their wings and necks, every shooter on the roof switching focus as they understood this was a full-on assault designed to take them out. But there were too many of the enemy, the roof overrun in seconds.</p><p>Rising up out of her hide, Elena dodged the bolts of two enemy fighters and kept shooting, aiming for the vulnerable eyes and necks now that they were so close. Several headed right for her, swords drawn, while their brethren engaged the other defenders on the roof. Out of bolts, she dropped the crossbow and, with the same movement, reached for the machine guns she had strapped to her thighs. \u201cFire in the hole!\u201d</p><p>Her people dropped at the warning and she sprayed the rooftop with gunfire, the bodies of the enemy jerking, limbs twitching where they fell as the strong ones struggled immediately to heal from the assault. Blood and brain matter splattered the concrete, and still they kept coming, an endless wave. That was when she realized she was being driven to the edge of the building. They wanted her to fall, to fly off.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d It was a trap, one they were willing to sacrifice their people to set. \u201cRansom!\u201d</p><p>Gunfire erupted from her left, the other hunter careful not to hit her as he took over. Screaming a battle cry, she shot out a heavy spray of her own, then, instead of going over where they wanted her to go over, ran right through the enemy. \u201cKeep shooting!\u201d she said, her own guns pumping fire.</p><p>Her boots pounded over crushed and bloodied feathers as she shot her way past the startled angels still standing, the air full of bullets she couldn\u2019t totally avoid. One caught her a glancing blow on her arm, the other dug a fiery groove across her cheek, but she reached her target without any real injury, going over the opposite side of the building from where she\u2019d been herded. The enemy turned to follow her en masse, which hopefully meant the others on the roof would be all right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is my city, you bastards.\u201d Managing to get her guns strapped down in midair as a result of hours of practice doing the same, she swept down a wide avenue, the wind whipping off the blood trickling down her cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s play hide-and-seek.\u201d</p><p>As the battle raged overhead and buildings shuddered after being hit by stray bolts of power, the city as a whole began to go progressively darker. She\u2019d seen this before, during the fight with Uram, and knew it was because Raphael and Lijuan were both sucking power from the electricity grid, batteries, anything that could supply them with the energy they used to supercharge their strikes.</p><p>The darkness was her friend. Teeth bared, she led the enemy angels in and out of streets, through buildings she knew had accessways wide enough for flight, under the High Line and between certain widely spaced trees in Central Park. They were fast, the ones on her trail, but they didn\u2019t know Manhattan.</p> <p>Of course, she couldn\u2019t keep this up forever. Naasir, you fucking smart predator, she thought as her wings began to tire, it\u2019s showtime. She\u2019d managed to make a short cell phone call halfway through her darting flight, and, as instructed, now led her pursuers into a narrow gap between two high-rises.</p><p>It dead-ended at the back of another building.</p><p>Reaching the end, she spun around, wings spread. The leader of the pack, his left eye a pulpy mess where a bullet had hit him, grinned . . . and ran right into the steel net that snapped into place in front of the speeding squadron. The ones at the back tried to fly up to avoid the net, but it fell from above, too\u2014courtesy of a certain blue-winged angel\u2014before a net sprung up behind them.</p><p>Trapped, the enemy fighters tried to land, but their wings were too fouled up in the net and with each other. Falling hard to the asphalt, they dragged the nets down with them\u2014nets that, she saw with a wince, had cut lines into their flesh and wings, the edges razored. \u201cI love you right now, Naasir, but you have a scary, scary mind.\u201d</p><p>She flew up and out before the enemy figured out how to escape the trap. \u201cI need to get to the Tower!\u201d she yelled to Illium\u2014since it was obvious Lijuan had put a target on her back, she was now a liability to the shooting teams.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lijuan\u2019s generals?\u201d If he\u2019d broken off that engagement to help her, he had to get back to it\u2014those generals had serious firepower.</p><p>Illium\u2019s grin was satisfied. \u201cI and my brothers in arms earned our power! Lijuan trusts no one with real power! Her generals are puppets\u2014and right now, the Sire is holding all her attention!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as Lijuan lives, Xi will continue to gain power. Without her, his body wouldn\u2019t be able to hold what it does.\u201d</p><p>Illium had told her that at the Refuge, in reference to one of Lijuan\u2019s generals, but she hadn\u2019t realized the male was this closely linked to his archangel. But there was no more time to think about that\u2014the two of them had reached the battle zone.</p><p>They had to go in shooting, Illium faster with a crossbow than she\u2019d realized, given his preference for using a sword. Halfway through, Tasha appeared out of the mass of wings to flank her other side as Lijuan\u2019s men and women deliberately blocked Elena\u2019s path to the Tower. Much as Elena would\u2019ve liked to nurture her dislike for Tasha, the other woman had fought with brilliant fury in the battles, as she did now.</p> <p>Grabbing her guns, Elena took aim at the enemy. \u201cGet the fuck out of my way!\u201d</p><p>Their wings shredded, Lijuan\u2019s fighters crashed to the streets and buildings. Illium and Tasha rejoined the fight as soon as Elena landed safely on the Tower roof. Frustrated at having been grounded, she ran inside and to the Tower \u201caerie,\u201d a small nest directly above the war room and connected to it by an internal staircase. It had a three-hundred-sixty-degree view, as well as windows that could be shoved up.</p><p>Dmitri stood in the center of the aerie, running everything from his supreme vantage point.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t bother to exchange pleasantries with the vampire. Having grabbed ammunition from the stash just outside, she slammed herself into place in front of one of the windows, pushed it up, and started pulverizing any enemy fighter who came too close. There weren\u2019t too many, the defenders managing to hold them from the Tower, while Raphael kept Lijuan occupied above.</p><p>As Elena watched, Raphael\u2019s wildfire just scraped the side of Lijuan\u2019s face, ripping off a chunk of her cheek. Screaming that awful scream that made Elena grit her teeth, the older archangel retaliated with a fury of jagged black that Raphael couldn\u2019t completely avoid. Horrified, Elena watched as he took a bad hit on one wing, the ugliness of Lijuan\u2019s power an oily black that began to crawl over the white-gold as it had done during the battle in Amanat, the blackness infiltrating his very cells.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have affected him that badly\u2014not with the wildfire awake inside him, its ferocity an antidote to Lijuan\u2019s ugliness. But he was tired, had just fought nonstop with Lijuan for God knew how long after the trip to destroy the weapons carriers, and he\u2019d been using the wildfire against the other archangel since the fighting began. In Amanat, he\u2019d only been able to create it for a tiny period of time, the power new. It might have developed in the interim, but it was still new.</p><p>Skin chilling, she realized he had no more in him.</p><p>42</p> <p>Already moving, Elena didn\u2019t stop to question the instinct that drove her to put down her gun, leave the aerie, and run to take off from a nearby balcony as Raphael spiraled down from above, his wing mutilated by the black.</p><p>Archangel!</p><p>Get inside, Elena!</p><p>Hell, no. Having instinctively calculated the speed of his descent, she slammed into him, wrapping her arms around his torso. \u201cUse it!\u201d she said, her left arm beginning to pulse with stabbing pains, though nothing touched her skin. \u201cUse me!\u201d</p><p>One of Raphael\u2019s arms clamped around her, the other shooting a bolt of angelfire toward Lijuan. That arm, his left, she saw, was scored with wounds.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get back in the Tower!\u201d It was a furious order as they began to fall faster and faster, his \u201cinfected\u201d wing pitch-black and useless. \u201cI can\u2019t protect you and fight at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me! Don\u2019t you sense it, the connection?\u201d Her own wing felt as if it were being eaten alive by the black, the pain excruciating. \u201cUs, Raphael! Us!\u201d</p><p>The dream word hung between them as a laughing Lijuan created a rain of lethal black needles. \u201cFitting you should die with your mortal!\u201d</p><p>Slamming up a hand, Raphael deflected the black with his own power, but the shield began to buckle almost at once, his injuries having apparently depleted his ability to draw power from outside sources.</p><p>Elena grabbed his jaw, slamming a kiss on his lips. \u201cBatshit Lijuan will get us anyway so forget about protecting me and reach!\u201d</p><p>A hard glance out of eyes of wild blue yet free from the oily black, and then she felt a wrenching inside her that made her scream . . . as Raphael\u2019s shield turned electric with wildfire. Yes! Throat raw and chest aching, she looked at his wing to see the black eaten away to leave only luminous white-gold in its wake.</p><p>Another chilling scream, Raphael having deflected Lijuan\u2019s needles right back at her. Stay close.</p><p>Snapping out her wings when he released her, she grabbed the handguns at her hips, mourning her custom-built crossbow, as well as the absence of the machine guns. As it turned out, she only had to shoot a couple of enemy fighters. Clipped by one of Raphael\u2019s bolts, which destroyed the bottom half of her right wing, Lijuan called a retreat, and her entire force fell back behind the defensive perimeter.</p><p>Elena didn\u2019t fly to the Tower but to her shooting team, dreading what she\u2019d find. But somehow, the entire group had made it through, injured but alive. Walking over to her, a bloodied but whole Ransom said, \u201cYou owe me a big, wet kiss,\u201d the wound on his thigh bleeding through the field bandage.</p><p>When she scowled and told him to get himself to a medic, he rolled his eyes and withdrew his hand from behind his back. \u201cYour crossbow, Consort.\u201d</p><p>She did kiss him then, to the wolf whistles of the rest of the team.</p><p>That, however, was the sole point of light in the darkness. As night turned to dawn, the city drained of power, the Tower running on massive generators stored below ground and turned on only when Raphael and Lijuan weren\u2019t in the air, they cataloged their losses while watching for any movement from the opposing camp. The news was bad.</p><p>\u201cHalf of the injured,\u201d Dmitri said, after sharing the pitiless numbers, \u201cwill be able to fight again in a few hours, but the rest are either dead\u201d\u2014a grim look\u2014\u201cor so badly injured they\u2019ll be out for days at least.\u201d Black T-shirt wrinkled and bloodied from where he\u2019d fought a squadron that had landed on a Tower balcony, he shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cJason, did you manage to get any reliable numbers on Lijuan\u2019s casualties?\u201d</p><p>The spymaster nodded. \u201cDouble ours.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room understood that even with the impressive abilities of the Seven in the mix, that still left Lijuan at a huge advantage, and the remainder of the time was spent discussing what they could do to lessen the near-impossible odds. It was grueling, because there weren\u2019t many more rabbits they could pull out of hats. Especially given the fact that while Lijuan hadn\u2019t begun any hostilities in the Refuge, Galen reported that her stronghold was bristling with aggression.</p><p>\u201cThe instant they see any sign that we may head your way,\u201d Raphael\u2019s weapons-master had said, \u201cthere\u2019s no question they\u2019ll attack.\u201d A tic in his jaw, he\u2019d shaken his head. \u201cIf Lijuan survives this war, she\u2019ll do so with more enemies than she knows. Every man, woman, and child in the Refuge understands the threat originates from her.\u201d</p><p>An hour after Galen\u2019s message, Jason received another report\u2014more cargo planes were being stocked with weapons in Lijuan\u2019s territory, and this time, instead of vampires, there would be reborn in the holds.</p><p>\u201cIt appears,\u201d Raphael said, rage a cold burn in his blood, \u201cthe goddess has decided there is no dishonor in using her \u2018servants\u2019 to win this war.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Illium said with a smile that held no humor, \u201cit\u2019s a compliment. She\u2019s starting to worry you might actually hurt her and win.\u201d</p><p>Too bad the compliment could well lead to hell on earth.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Having forced herself to grab a couple of hours of down-time while she could, Elena was still grappling with the horrific possibility of a New York overrun with reborn when she walked into the refueling station to grab a cup of coffee just before dawn. \u201cSara.\u201d</p><p>Face drawn, her best friend shared a photo her parents had sent of Zoe peacefully sleeping somewhere in a commune in Nebraska. \u201cWe\u2019ll beat Lijuan, Ellie, whatever it takes.\u201d An unyielding vow. \u201cI will not have my baby growing up in a world ruled by a monster.\u201d</p><p>Deacon came in just as they finished their coffee, and Elena left to give them a few minutes\u2019 privacy, Deacon\u2019s wide shoulders blocking Sara from view as he drew her into his arms. Elena couldn\u2019t imagine how hard it must be for the two of them to be so far from Zoe. As far as she knew, their little girl had never before gone to bed without a kiss from Mommy or Daddy.</p><p>She hoped with everything in her heart that Sara\u2019s words would prove prophetic, that they\u2019d win this terrible fight so Zoe could play in the snow again, safe and happy and with wonder in her heart at the shadow of an angel\u2019s wings. Picking up a feather of dappled black and gray that looked like it came from a squadron commander she knew well, she put it carefully into a pocket to save for Zoe.</p><p>Her aim was to find Raphael, maybe steal a few seconds in his arms, but when she reached the war room, she saw that he was in intense discussion with Jason. Not wanting to interrupt and needing some fresh air, she went to the balcony doors. She\u2019d pushed the door to one side when she looked up and froze, her eye caught by the unexpected tableau outside.</p> <p>Aodhan and Illium stood near the edge, weapons in hand, both bearing wounds that said they\u2019d been in one of the ongoing light skirmishes along the perimeter. Aodhan had a cut on his cheek and what looked like a couple of shallow slices on his upper arms, while Illium\u2019s right wing was notched as if by a blade. Not a disabling injury, Elena judged, and one that was healing before her eyes.</p><p>That, however, wasn\u2019t what held her attention. It was the fact that they stood side by side, their wings overlapping the slightest fraction. Aodhan never made the mistake of putting himself in a situation where he could be touched, which meant this wasn\u2019t a mistake. Fingers clenching on the doorjamb, her heart full at this sign of healing amid the hurt and the horror, she was about to turn away, leave them in peace, when Illium turned toward Aodhan.</p><p>The two angels were both tall, but Aodhan was perhaps an inch taller, and now his eyes locked with Illium\u2019s for a long, quiet moment before he lowered his head very slightly. Illium raised his hand, the movement slow, hesitant . . . and then his fingers brushed Aodhan\u2019s cheek just below the cut that had almost sealed. The first ray of dawn kissed the tear that rolled down Illium\u2019s face, caressed the painful wonder on Aodhan\u2019s as he lifted his hand to clasp the wrist of his friend\u2019s hand.</p><p>That instant of contact, the power of it, stole her breath.</p><p>Then Illium smiled, said something that made Aodhan\u2019s lips curve\u2014Elena thought it might\u2019ve been \u201cWelcome back, Sparkle\u201d\u2014and they were separating to sweep off the Tower in a symphony of wild silver blue and heartbreaking light.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she whispered, having felt him come up behind her. \u201cDid you see?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His hand on her nape, his thumb brushing over her pulse. \u201cOf course it would be Illium who reached him,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThey\u2019ve been friends since Illium first talked Aodhan into flying to the bottom of the gorge\u2014he was younger than Sam is now, Aodhan even younger.\u201d</p><p>Elena hadn\u2019t realized Illium was older, Aodhan was always so solemn. \u201cDid they get in trouble?\u201d she asked, turning sideways to his body.</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a forbidden flight for such young babes\u2014the gorge floor is far from the city and, though coasting down is not so hard, young angels don\u2019t have the wing strength to get back up.</p><p>\u201cWhen they were found,\u201d he added, tucking her against him, \u201ceveryone knew it was Illium who must\u2019ve been the instigator, and he took the blame without pretending otherwise.\u201d A laugh. \u201cHe has never lied, your Bluebell, even as a child, and that\u2019s why no one could ever be angry with him. \u2018I did it\u2019 is apt to be the most frequent thing he said as a child.\u201d</p><p>Elena could just imagine. \u201cAnd Aodhan? What was he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways quiet, shy, gentle of heart. But that day, he was intractable, insisting Illium alone wasn\u2019t to blame, that they\u2019d come up with the plan together. He wouldn\u2019t listen when Illium told him to shush, and the next thing the Refuge knew, they were close as two birds of the same nest, each as often at the other\u2019s home as his own.\u201d</p><p>Pressing his lips to her hair, he said, \u201cTwo hundred years, Elena, that is how long we have waited for our Aodhan to return.\u201d</p><p>The solemn words made her eyes burn. Wrapping her arms around him, she stood in silence with her consort, their eyes on the squadrons that patrolled the uneasy border. Each time she glimpsed wings of silver blue, she looked for those of broken light.</p> <p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Heavy fighting began again with true sunrise.</p><p>The Tower forces, Elijah\u2019s two elite squadrons included, did considerable damage, but it wasn\u2019t enough, not with Lijuan\u2019s generals recharged by their mistress. Having learned from their previous skirmishes, they ganged up on the Tower\u2019s most powerful fighters while an overwhelming number of ordinary fighters engaged anyone who might come to assist. Their tactic worked, bringing down five of Raphael\u2019s experienced commanders one after the other.</p><p>Of the Seven, it was Aodhan who took the worst damage.</p><p>The angel, with his unearthly beauty, was almost decapitated when he left his flank unprotected in order to save the life of an injured commander. Aside from the gruesome neck wound, one of his wings had been hacked half off, his left arm gone. Crash-landing on a roof, he broke a number of bones and it was only the relentless fire of the shooters around him that kept the enemy angels from landing to finish the job.</p><p>Yet even close to death, he eschewed anyone\u2019s touch but Illium\u2019s.</p><p>Racing to the infirmary as soon as he forced Lijuan to retreat once more, Raphael saw that the other angel was conscious. \u201cI must touch you, Aodhan.\u201d</p><p>Throat destroyed, Aodhan spoke mind to mind. I will heal. Help the others.</p><p>Shaking his head, Raphael placed his hand very gently across the neck wound, and when Aodhan went white and stiff, knew he was throwing the angel back into the hell from where Raphael had carried him in his arms. I\u2019m sorry, he said, adding yet another reason to the list of why he needed to kill Lijuan. I cannot lose one of my Seven.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t certain Aodhan breathed until he lifted his hand, the neck wound sealed, though the other injuries would take weeks of painful healing. \u201cI would not have done this unless I needed you.\u201d</p><p>It is all right, Sire. Aodhan\u2019s splintered eyes held forgiveness for the unutterable pain caused. Get me in front of a window. I can use my offensive abilities as long as I have a line of sight.</p><p>After personally moving Aodhan\u2019s bed to a windowed area and smashing out the glass so the other man wouldn\u2019t do it himself the first time he used his abilities, Raphael returned to the field of battle. Every time he rose, Lijuan did, too, meaning he couldn\u2019t help his own forces, and sometime after midnight, she scored a hit almost directly to his heart.</p><p>The wildfire seared at the oily black of her power, but it was stuttering, almost overwhelmed. Knowing he couldn\u2019t fight Lijuan and heal at the same time, Raphael blasted out with angelfire and managed to wing Lijuan, just as Jason sent his black lightning slamming into the other archangel. Neither hit was serious and Lijuan could have kept coming after him, but for some reason, she retreated\u2014possibly, he realized, because her own power was starting to fade.</p><p>Her hair and eyes had both changed to oily black during the battles, but now he realized they were back to their usual shade. Lijuan, it seemed, wasn\u2019t as all-powerful as she liked to make people believe and that was something they could use. Landing on a Tower balcony, he kept his feet by sheer strength of will as the battle raged within his body, Lijuan\u2019s black poison attempting to shut him down, while the wildfire fought back.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fall, couldn\u2019t allow his troops to see how badly he was injured.</p><p>Managing to make it inside, he caught Dmitri\u2019s eye, saw his second understood what was happening, but Dmitri didn\u2019t betray it by so much as a flicker of an eyelash. \u201cLijuan\u2019s forces are pulling back,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect intermittent fighting throughout the night, but we should rest our troops in groups.\u201d</p><p>Raphael spoke through a haze of red. \u201cNumbers.\u201d</p><p>Walking over so their words wouldn\u2019t be overheard, his second said, \u201cMore than half our forces are dead or too severely injured to recover anytime soon. The others are exhausted, even our strongest. I predict Lijuan\u2019s forces will launch an all-out offensive with the dawn\u2014we have no other surprises to throw in their path and they know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuthorize the use of the rocket launchers come dawn,\u201d Raphael said, but they both knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough. \u201cThe cargo planes with the reborn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLifted off two hours ago,\u201d Dmitri said, then lowered his voice. \u201cGo. Heal. We\u2019ll finish this discussion later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch over my city, Dmitri.\u201d He left the war room with agony searing up his spine, making it to his and Elena\u2019s private Tower suite with teeth gritted. Collapsing on the living room floor on his front, he clenched his jaw to stifle the violent scream that wanted to erupt from his throat. A single sound and his entire fleet would realize how close they were to losing the city.</p><p>43</p><p>\u201cElena,\u201d came Dmitri\u2019s voice in her ear, \u201cthe fighting has lessened in intensity. You can stand down for now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frowning, she tapped the reply button. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dmitri. Pull some of the others.\u201d Her mortal friends were showing worse signs of exhaustion\u2014while she might be a baby immortal, she was still an immortal and it had an impact.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get back to the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Ice trickled down her spine. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p> <p>Flying directly to her and Raphael\u2019s Tower suite after timing her flight to avoid the sporadic bursts of continued fighting, she entered through the locked balcony doors by using her palm print. \u201cRaphael!\u201d</p><p>She shoved the door closed because she knew he wouldn\u2019t want anyone to see him like this and ran to go down on her knees by his side. For a second, she was afraid he was dead, but then she saw the rigid muscles of his arms, his hands fisted tight and his spine locked, and knew he fought a battle against Lijuan\u2019s poison.</p><p>Not knowing what to do, she just stroked her hand through his hair over and over. \u201cI\u2019m here, my love. If you can hear me, reach for what you need inside me.\u201d</p><p>She felt nothing, Raphael\u2019s body locked in combat against a vicious enemy. The feeling of helplessness was terrifying, but she refused to surrender. Instead, she kept stroking his hair, her other hand closing over one of his fists, and swallowed the tears of rage at the pain of her mate.</p><p>Time passed at the pace of a snail\u2019s crawl. Elena was barely aware of what was happening outside, but she felt the shudder as either Lijuan or one of her generals managed to hit the Tower. When it wasn\u2019t repeated, she guessed it had been a general and that either Jason or Illium had managed to head him off. A while later, who knew how long, she heard Dmitri\u2019s voice in her ear.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can speak to the Sire, tell him Naasir and his team just successfully decapitated one of Lijuan\u2019s strongest generals by stringing a wire across two buildings on their side of the line. He might not die, given his strength, but he\u2019s out of the fight.\u201d</p><p>Elena shared the news with Raphael, not knowing if he could hear her. \u201cThose three lunatics are in the heart of enemy territory and they\u2019re doing damage,\u201d she said. \u201cGod, I bet Ash will have some stories to tell after this is over.\u201d Leaning down, she pressed a kiss to his sweat-soaked temple, the dragon mark pulsing with a glow.</p><p>As if, she thought, it, too, fought the poison.</p><p>Another blow made the Tower shudder some time later. \u201cDmitri?\u201d she asked, touching the communications device.</p><p>\u201cA general we took down yesterday appears to have recovered. Aodhan has managed to shove him back and is keeping him busy for the time being.\u201d</p><p>Elena frowned, thinking of the casualty lists she\u2019d seen. \u201cThe general with the white wings, yellow primaries?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. He shouldn\u2019t have recovered after Illium\u2019s blade cut him almost in half, but he is whole.\u201d</p><p>Skin chilling at what that might mean, Elena decided to keep her silence on that piece of news until Raphael had fought this battle. \u201cCome on, Archangel. The bitch can\u2019t beat you\u2014you\u2019ve sent her scuttling off to lick her wounds time and time again.\u201d</p><p>His body shuddered under her touch, his muscles going lax.</p><p>\u201cRaphael?\u201d she said, scared by the sudden change. \u201cArchangel?\u201d</p><p>Fists opening, he pressed his palms down on the carpet and turned over onto his back. His face was sharper, the bones of his face more prominent. His body, she thought, had burned itself up in an effort to fight the poison. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said, chest rising and falling in harsh breaths, one of his hands reaching to intertwine with hers.</p><p>Bringing their clasped hands to her mouth, she pressed a kiss to the hot burn of his skin. \u201cIt\u2019s gone?\u201d she asked, seeing no obvious signs of the poison.</p><p>\u201cYes, but the wildfire is almost completely depleted.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cIn you, too, Elena. There are mere flickers in both of us now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your capacity to create angelfire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe sources from which I can draw are now farther and farther away\u2014I could take it from the generators but it would mean the Tower going dead for a relatively small boost. My ability to generate power within myself is being hobbled by the fact my energy is constantly being redirected to heal.\u201d His eyes held her own. \u201cLijuan retreats because she doesn\u2019t like to be hurt, but there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t be able to cause her any real harm in our next engagement if I fight as I have been doing.\u201d</p><p>A strange calm descended over Elena. They hadn\u2019t spoken about this, but she\u2019d always known it was on the table. \u201cYou have to get closer,\u201d she said, even as, below the calm, horror clawed its way across her soul.</p><p>A nod. \u201cIf I can get close enough to grip any part of her, I can release every last flicker of angelfire and wildfire inside me. If a single fragment reaches her heart, I don\u2019t think even Lijuan could survive it.\u201d</p><p>All those words, but he was talking about blowing himself up. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d She pressed her fingers to his lips. \u201cI have some wildfire left inside me, you said\u2014we have to give it our best shot.\u201d</p><p>His expression was gentle, the arms he held out to her strong. Going into them, her head on his shoulder, and his wing below her body, she lay in quiet with her archangel and she wasn\u2019t afraid of the darkness that awaited. Whatever death held for her, she\u2019d go into it with Raphael by her side.</p><p>Something slammed into the Tower moments later, blowing out the windows of their suite and covering them in a coat of splinters.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>An hour later, and with dawn at least another sixty min-utes away, Raphael knew they had to move. The Tower had taken heavy structural damage despite their deflective efforts. Lijuan hadn\u2019t risen, but her generals were all recovered and at full strength, while his strongest aerial fighters\u2014Illium, Aodhan, Jason\u2014were battling through crushing fatigue to repel the blasts.</p><p>Once more, Raphael had to fight his instincts to go out there, join in the effort. If he did, he\u2019d lose what little strength he\u2019d regained, and Lijuan would have no impediment to her next attack. As it was\u2014\u201cNaasir.\u201d He jerked up his head as the vampire ran into the war room, bleeding from a massive wound on his face.</p><p>Elena ripped open a sterile packet from the first aid supplies and pressed the heavy cotton dressing to the vampire\u2019s face to soak up the blood. Not pushing her away, which told Raphael how badly he was hurt, Naasir went to his knees, Elena beside him, but the vampire\u2019s silver eyes were locked on Raphael. \u201cLijuan is absorbing power,\u201d he said. \u201cAll her injuries are healed and she now works to bloat herself with energy. Come dawn, she\u2019ll be as powerful as when she began the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Raphael asked, as Elena pulled the dressing off to expose a raw gash, a flap of skin hanging down over Naasir\u2019s cheekbone, bone and muscle exposed.</p><p>As she grabbed the small butterfly bandages that would keep the flesh in place while Naasir healed, the vampire spoke of horror. \u201cShe has truly become an Archangel of Death. I saw her slit the throat of one of her fighters herself, to the point of near decapitation\u2014she then thrust her face into the bleeding gash and seemed to feed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she couldn\u2019t get any more creepy.\u201d Elena continued to pin Naasir\u2019s flesh together, and it was only when she nudged the vampire forward a little that Raphael realized Naasir\u2019s spine had almost been cleaved in two. The fact the vampire had been able to run, much less stand, spoke of his strength.</p><p>Now, he gave a feral grin, clearly amused by Elena\u2019s words. \u201cIt takes her twenty minutes at least to drain the life out of one of her people. The fighter I saw was a mummified husk when she was done; that was when she moved on to the next volunteer, her face a mask of blood.\u201d He growled without warning, eyes flashing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Elena continued to work at his back. \u201cI need to pull the flesh together or your spine will be exposed to the air and it\u2019ll take longer to heal.\u201d Not stopping in her task despite the constant low-level growl, Naasir\u2019s fingers claws, she said, \u201cThat\u2019s how she\u2019s been fixing her generals.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded, considering why Lijuan hadn\u2019t done this earlier. Likely because it, too, was a limited power, something she could only do once within a certain period. Not that it mattered\u2014because the fact was, he couldn\u2019t hope to defeat a full-strength Lijuan in ordinary combat, not after she\u2019d worn him down to a threadbare edge.</p><p>Rising to his feet, his back held together by larger bandages that worked the same as the butterfly ones on his face, Naasir turned to offer Elena a hand. She took it and he hauled her up. Then, grabbing her around the waist, he lifted her up and brought her startled face close to his own.</p><p>Raphael?</p><p>He won\u2019t hurt you.</p><p>Elena made a squeaking sound as Naasir nipped her sharply on the chin. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I won\u2019t eat you,\u201d he said, putting her down on her feet before turning to Raphael. \u201cLijuan\u2019s forces have harried ours over the night hours, but most have rested. They will launch a major offensive with the dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Naasir. Go and feed\u2014we\u2019ll move very soon against the enemy.\u201d He couldn\u2019t afford to give Lijuan any more time to glut herself with power.</p><p>The vampire left with a curt nod for him and a grinning and unexpected snap of his teeth for Elena. Seeing the expression on her face, Raphael almost smiled. Naasir would\u2019ve no doubt fascinated and confused her for some time to come, but his consort wouldn\u2019t see the end of this day if they were to stop a monster. \u201cIt\u2019s time, Elena.\u201d</p><p>Should they succeed in their final act, Lijuan\u2019s forces would still outnumber the Tower\u2019s, but Raphael\u2019s people were smart and they thought for themselves, while Lijuan\u2019s were tied to her. If Raphael and Elena took her out of the equation, not only would her generals lose their power, the enemy\u2019s entire command structure would collapse. He had every faith the members of his Seven would utilize that fracture to hold on and claim victory. \u201cWe can wait no longer.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t only New York at stake\u2014fighting had broken out in the Refuge an hour past, and Raphael knew whatever happened in his city would end the battle in the Refuge, one way or another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A frown, Elena\u2019s eyes going to his temple. \u201cYou\u2019re rubbing the mark.\u201d</p><p>Dropping his hand, Raphael stared at it. \u201cI did not realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d She brushed her fingers delicately over it.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but it pulses.\u201d Like a heartbeat. \u201cThat pulsing has increased in strength over the past hours.\u201d Shaking his head, he cupped Elena\u2019s face, a cut under her eye and across one cheek, her arms bearing countless nicks from the exploding windows and earlier skirmishes. Her body, too, was nearly at its limit, its ability to heal sluggish.</p><p>\u201cI do not like that your colors are hidden.\u201d She\u2019d found some brown dye, used it on her hair and wings in a bid to keep Lijuan from immediately realizing who it was that flew beside Raphael.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll wash off with a couple of soapings. I\u2019ll do it after we take care of Lijuan.\u201d Nothing less than total confidence in her tone, though they both knew they might soon share their final kiss. \u201cKnhebek, Raphael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my heart.\u201d The amber in the ring she\u2019d given him glowed pure and beautiful as he took her mouth, passionate and with as brilliant a heart as his warrior.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p> <p>Twenty minutes later, he stood on the cracked but still hold-ing balcony outside the war room and met Illium\u2019s and Jason\u2019s eyes, Elena by his side. The two angels would run interference in the hope Lijuan didn\u2019t realize Raphael\u2019s intent until it was too late\u2014both could well lose their lives.</p><p>\u201cWhatever price we pay this day,\u201d he said, \u201cwhatever the outcome, know that I am proud to have had your loyalty.\u201d On the mental plane, he made sure his message reached Aodhan and Dmitri, who even now watched their backs, and Naasir, who fought on the ground. The others would make sure his words were passed on to Galen and Venom, the two locked in battle as the peace of the Refuge was splintered with violence. \u201cIt is a point of great honor in my life.\u201d</p><p>Both bowed their heads, but it was Jason who spoke. \u201cThe honor is, and will always be, ours,\u201d he said, as Aodhan deflected another fury of blows aimed at the Tower. One got through, the balcony shuddering.</p><p>All four of them instinctively adjusted their stance to keep their feet.</p><p>\u201cDid you manage to see Mahiya?\u201d Elena asked his spymaster, and it was the question of a consort.</p><p>Jason\u2019s face betrayed none of his emotions as he inclined his head, whatever had been shared between him and his princess, who\u2019d worked in the infirmary throughout the fighting, a private matter. Raphael hoped it wouldn\u2019t be the final conversation the two would ever have, for Jason had earned his happiness. To have it stolen from him, a bare heartbeat after he\u2019d found it, would be a great unfairness\u2014but as they had all learned in the preceding days, sometimes good did not prevail, evil triumphant.</p> <p>Today, they\u2019d do one final thing to change that, turn the tide. The ordinary fighters were ready to start the attack the instant they took off, forcing Lijuan\u2019s forces to move before they were ready. Rocket launchers would be used to take out groups of enemy angels, his remaining winged fighters instructed to do everything in their power to create those groups by pushing the enemy together.</p><p>Those fighters understood that it was likely they, too, would die in the blasts. \u201cIf I take five of them with me,\u201d one of his commanders had said, \u201cit will be a sacrifice well made.\u201d</p><p>Turning to Elena, his pride in his people absolute and the mark on his temple pulsing so hard that it seemed impossible no one else could see the movement, he said, \u201cReady, hbeebti?\u201d</p><p>Elena notched a bolt into her crossbow. \u201cLet\u2019s go kill that murderous bitch.\u201d</p><p>Snapping out their wings on her vow, Raphael, Elena, and his men were about to fly out through the bombardment that continued to shake the Tower when a bloodied angel came to a crash landing in front of Raphael, his blood splattering on the thin layer of snow. A crossbow bolt was embedded in his stomach.</p><p>\u201cAzar.\u201d Raphael knelt beside the advance scout, Jason beside him, while Illium took off to assist Aodhan in deflecting the blows now aimed at the balcony on which they stood.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Jason asked the fallen angel. \u201cYou were stationed on the edge of the city.\u201d</p><p>Gripping Jason\u2019s hand as Elena called for the medics, Azar\u2019s mouth bubbled with blood, the fluid crimson against his gleaming black skin in the dull light of the time before dawn. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get through on the communication lines, Sire. And you had to know.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael connected with the scout\u2019s mind to make communication easier. While Raphael was always open to his Seven, Azar wouldn\u2019t have been able to initiate such contact, especially from a distance. What do you have to report?</p><p>Another assault force, the slim angel said, green eyes dark with pain, for while angels could heal many wounds, those wounds did not hurt any less. On the horizon, perhaps five minutes behind me. I left as soon as I spotted them, but they are so fast\u2014a dangerous assessment from a scout known for his extraordinary speed\u2014they gained on me with every wingbeat.</p><p>Raphael looked at the devastated city around them, the Tower\u2019s smashed walls and splintered windows, considered the number of fighters injured or dead, and knew his people simply could not survive against another fresh force, no matter how huge their hearts. Estimated numbers?</p><p>Hundreds, Sire. They flew in the most perfect fighting formation I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>44</p><p>Handing Azar over to the healers, Raphael shared the information the scout had flown through enemy fire to deliver. \u201cWe go now and we do as much damage as possible to give our people a chance,\u201d he said, as realization formed a layer of grim ice in Dmitri\u2019s expression, his second having stepped out onto the balcony.</p><p>Illium, back with them, swore under his breath, next to a quietly stoic Jason.</p><p>Elena\u2019s expression was a study in fury, and it made him want to smile even in this moment, for she was a woman any man would be proud to have by his side on the eve of the greatest battle of his life. \u201cWarn our people,\u201d he said to Dmitri, \u201cand tell them that if there comes a time when there is no hope of victory, they do not dishonor me by choosing to retreat or surrender. With Lijuan gone from the world, they will not have to serve under evil.\u201d</p><p>Dmitri\u2019s eyes held his. I\u2019ll make it known, but I\u2019ll never serve anyone except you.</p><p>I know, old friend. Were it my choice, I would leave my city and my territory to no other angel, but to my second.</p><p>Fly strong, Raphael.</p><p>Fight well, Dmitri.</p><p>Wings snapping out, he swept off the Tower with Elena, Illium, and Jason, the four of them winging their way directly to the heart of Lijuan\u2019s operation, hoping to take her unawares. Crossbow bolts filled the air as soon as they came within range. Jason and Illium were fast enough to avoid them; Elena wasn\u2019t, but she was very good at shooting her own bolts in flight, slamming two home between the eyes. The shooters quickly grew wary of giving her a target.</p><p>They\u2019d just crossed the border that divided their perimeter line from the enemy\u2019s attacking front, the mark pulsing hot and urgent under his skin, when Raphael saw the wave of dark gray on the lightening horizon, the line shifting to encircle the entire stage of battle.</p><p>Watch out!</p><p>Twisting sideways at Illium\u2019s warning, he barely avoided the hail of blades that was Lijuan\u2019s power, as Elena, Illium, and Jason engaged the enemy fighters that sought to disable Raphael\u2019s wings. Having materialized above him, the Archangel of China was attempting to shred him with her poisonous fire.</p><p>Coaxing the last of the wildfire inside him to the surface and drawing on the fire that lived in Elena, too, he blocked Lijuan\u2019s next barrage with ordinary angelfire and, ignoring the crossbow bolt that thudded into his shoulder, flew up, his aim to make physical contact.</p><p>Except she dematerialized without warning, her strength renewed. And when she rematerialized to the left, she managed to score him with a whip of black poison. Vicious pain stabbed through his flesh as the wildfire inside him sought to cauterize the wound and he blocked the healing\u2014he couldn\u2019t afford to lose the last of it, of the only thing that could hurt Lijuan.</p><p>Dropping down beside him with a gloating smile, eyes virulent red, Lijuan said, \u201cI give you one final chance to surrender, Raphael,\u201d her face a skeletal mask. \u201cI do not intend to kill you, not any longer.\u201d She made certain not to come within touching distance. \u201cYou will be much, much more useful to me in other ways.\u201d</p><p>Raphael thought of the desiccated corpses found in her territory, of the fighter Naasir had seen go to his death, and knew Lijuan sought to feed on an archangel. \u201cA very generous offer,\u201d he said aloud, while his mind reached for Dmitri\u2019s. You must make sure the remainder of the Cadre knows Lijuan seeks to feed off not only angels, but archangels.</p><p>I\u2019ll ensure the message gets through, came the immediate reply. Sire, the new assault force has arrived and will swarm the Tower in minutes if we don\u2019t do something to stop them. I\u2019ve authorized the use of any and all weapons at our disposal.</p><p>Raphael heard gunfire and rocket booms on the heels of that statement and knew his exhausted and wounded vampires, and the hunters, were shooting at the enemy, while his angels, some with broken limbs, all with injuries, filled the sky. But there were too few of them, and too many of the strange gray-winged angels who powered Lijuan\u2019s new assault. \u201cWhat have you become?\u201d he said to her, unable to imagine how she could\u2019ve created this new army, silent and lethal, without anyone in the Cadre knowing the truth.</p><p>A terrible smile. \u201cThe epitome of our evolution.\u201d</p><p>That level of power could not be held in the hands of a nightmare.</p><p>He blasted her with angelfire without warning, wanting her to believe his intent was another ordinary battle. Deflecting the blows with a rain of black razors that he held back through sheer will, she smiled again. \u201cI will chain you in my court, feed on you for years. You\u2019ll be the example that brings the others in the Cadre to their knees.\u201d His shield broke, the razors shredding his face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Raphael!</p><p>He reached for Elena not only with his mind but his hand, Jason and Illium clearing a path for her so she could get to his side. This will hurt, hbeebti, he said, as the mad archangel raised her hands again.</p><p>Nothing hurts when I\u2019m with you.</p> <p>Squeezing her hand, he sent an order to all his troops in the vicinity to get out of the blast zone. If Lijuan\u2019s forces thought them cowards in retreat and turned their attention to him, Elena, Illium, and Jason, all the better. He\u2019d take as many of them with him as he could.</p><p>He met Lijuan\u2019s gaze before she would\u2019ve struck again, and said, \u201cFeed.\u201d</p><p>She froze, her surprise unhidden.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fight if you give me your word you\u2019ll call off your troops till the sun sets on this day.\u201d All he needed was a single point of contact and he could ignite the tiny amount of combined angelfire and wildfire left inside him, hopefully sending Lijuan to the hell where she belonged.</p><p>See you on the other side, Archangel.</p> <p>Total calm descending on him with Elena\u2019s words, he said, \u201cMy consort also remains,\u201d knowing that was a lure Lijuan could not resist. She coveted Elena\u2019s wings for the macabre collection of angels pinned to the walls of the refrigerated space that was her museum of death. \u201cLook down.\u201d</p><p>Lijuan\u2019s teeth gleamed in a satisfied smile as she realized whose hand he held in his own. \u201cI will agree,\u201d she said, with a gleam in her eye, \u201cif you give me your consort first. I wish to snap her neck, make her a beautiful corpse.\u201d</p><p>His rage violent, he felt Elena\u2019s wing just brush his as she flew up. Contact, Raphael. That\u2019s all you need, right? Use me as a conduit.</p><p>No! he wanted to scream as Lijuan\u2019s hand clamped over Elena\u2019s wrist at the same time that his own closed around her ankle. Forgive me, Elena.</p><p>I\u2019ll be waiting for you.</p><p>Refusing to let Elena die at Lijuan\u2019s hand, he reached for the flickers of flame within himself and his consort, ready to ignite them both, when something dark gray slammed into Elena hard enough to break Lijuan\u2019s hold.</p> <p>At the same instant, a thousand crossbow bolts thudded into Lijuan\u2019s body.</p><p>His wings tangled with Elena\u2019s as she tumbled into him, it took Raphael several seconds to slow their momentum, and when he looked up, it was to see a badly bleeding Lijuan take bolt after bolt from the gray-winged angels, as others of the gray ones took on the enemy one-on-one.</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t waste time wondering which unexpected ally had sent this strange force. Attack! he ordered his own fighters, and made the decision to use a minute amount of wildfire to neutralize the poison Lijuan had thrown at him, for he was now of more use to his people alive. No mercy!</p><p>A wild grin on her face, Elena lifted the crossbow she\u2019d never dropped, one wrist ringed with bloody bruises from Lijuan\u2019s grip. We need to fucking deify whoever the hell sent those gray guys.</p><p>The sight of her hurt made the cold rage in him flare to icy brightness. First, he said, powering to Lijuan, I need to take out the garbage.</p><p>An archangel couldn\u2019t be killed by crossbows, but with the bolts thudding into Lijuan\u2019s body as fast as she pulled them out, she was distracted, her energies funneled toward healing herself. Her facial bones appeared and disappeared as her skin faded in and out, but when she didn\u2019t shift into her noncorporeal form, he realized that whatever power she gained from draining the lives of others, it wasn\u2019t enough to allow her to transition under this type of bloody attack.</p><p>Wrapping one hand around her ankle while she was distracted, he sent all his remaining power, power kissed with the life that was Elena, directly through his arm and into her bones. Her shriek splintered the sky, her lower body exploding in a blinding flash of light, her torso crumbling.</p><p>Is the wicked witch dead?</p> <p>I\u2019m not certain. He almost thought he\u2019d seen her transition into her other form at the absolute last instant. But even if she survived the blast, it\u2019ll have been with extreme injuries. Her body is gone. It would take her months to regrow it, and while Lijuan had tried to make them believe she didn\u2019t need the flesh, this battle had shown she very much did.</p><p>Even if she could feed on others to speed up her healing, the way she\u2019d opened her mouth when tugging Elena closer told Raphael she needed her physical form to feed. And he\u2019d seen her head burst like a pumpkin as bolt after bolt thudded into it in that split second while she screamed. The gray ones were merciless fighters, but right now they were on New York\u2019s side.</p><p>And it was time for him and his own to reclaim their city.</p><p>His body\u2019s ability to store power depleted to the point of nonexistence, he grabbed the sword Illium threw at him and entered the fray, his battle cry echoed by every one of his men and women.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how long they fought, but he was always aware of Elena and those of his Seven who fought with him. Dmitri, having held off a new attempt to storm the Tower, his view far better than those in the thick of battle, sent through continuous strategic updates that Raphael used to direct his men and women so they acted as a smooth unit. He didn\u2019t realize how far they\u2019d pushed Lijuan\u2019s forces until they hit the Atlantic, the fighting having moved from Manhattan and over wider New York as the sun rose higher and higher in the sky.</p><p>Ten seconds later, the instant after he sliced off the head of an enemy general in a fountaining spray of red that sent the body into the water from where his people would no doubt retrieve him, for he was too old to die by beheading, he felt Jason\u2019s mind touch his. Sire, they\u2019re lifting the flag of surrender.</p><p>Rising immediately above the rest of his force, Raphael confirmed Jason\u2019s sighting, then raised his sword above his head in a vertical line. The message took half a minute to get through the furious fighting, but one by one his people held their blows, allowing the enemy to retreat.</p><p>\u201cWe just let them go?\u201d Elena asked, having come up beside him. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t blame her for her angry disbelief, his own fury colder but no less deadly. \u201cIt is part of the rules of engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they would\u2019ve killed us.\u201d It was almost a growl, her blood-streaked and battered body taut with the need to hunt down those who had hurt the people who were her own.</p><p>\u201cIf my forces had surrendered, the enemy fighters wouldn\u2019t have touched them so long as they didn\u2019t raise arms against Lijuan.\u201d Whether Lijuan herself would then have used his people for her feeds was another question, but he wasn\u2019t Lijuan, to make such an ugly breach of the rules of his people.</p><p>Contacting Dmitri and Naasir, he said, Herd her surviving vampire troops to the pier and find them a ship. Make sure they have enough blood to survive the journey out of my waters. After that, they became the responsibility of their own commanders, and while Raphael didn\u2019t think Lijuan had much honor any longer, he thought perhaps her older commanders had enough not to abandon their own.</p><p>\u201cI still think it sucks.\u201d Elena pushed a strand of hair off her sweat-stained face, the brown color so wrong, Raphael knew he\u2019d have her wash it out at the first opportunity. \u201cI don\u2019t think that sick thing calling herself an archangel would\u2019ve obeyed the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is beyond honor and madness, a creature of true evil.\u201d</p><p>A sigh, his furious consort nonetheless lowering her crossbow. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not.\u201d Scowling, she continued to watch the enemy. \u201cFine, fine, we\u2019ll be civilized and let them retreat, but damn it, I don\u2019t like it. They\u2019ll be back as soon as Lijuan has recovered, because it would be just too much good luck if the Queen of the Zombies was truly dead.\u201d</p><p>Of that, Raphael had no doubt. \u201cThe rules of engagement were put in place long ago, after archangelic wars no one remembers,\u201d he said to Elena, and it was also a reminder to himself of why such rules were needed. \u201cWars, after all, are between the archangels\u2014yet it is the angels and vampires below us who die total deaths.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d expected, the general he\u2019d beheaded had been retrieved, while countless vampires and ordinary angelic fighters floated on the water or lay broken and bloodied across the city, their lives ended. \u201cIn those wars, it\u2019s said we decimated over eighty percent of our population. Only the archangels and the noncombatants survived and not one person ever forgot the blood that stained the hands of the Cadre at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Elena whispered, horror in her expression. \u201cOkay, I get it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s squadron will escort them out of our territorial waters,\u201d he said, brushing his wing over hers. \u201cNow we must deal with this other strange force, find out their price for this day\u2019s help.\u201d</p><p>They turned as a unit to face the city.</p><p>45</p><p>Having landed on roofs as far as the eye could see, the gray ones sat crouched like living gargoyles, their wings arched, fundamentally changing the landscape. Birds sat on the shoulders and bodies of many of them, silent and watchful.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen anything like this before?\u201d Elena asked Raphael, trying to make some sense of what she was seeing, and failing.</p><p>From what she\u2019d witnessed in the battle as the gray angels fought around her, there was no color to them\u2014gray eyes, pale smooth skin, hair of gray, gray wings. Yet they were humanoid, had faces with the clean lines and strong bones of the immortals. Their wings, however, had no feathers, instead formed of a leathery texture that reminded her of the wings of bats. The shape of those wings, too, was similar to the nocturnal creatures.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael said after a long moment, as heavy clouds passed across the sky to drop a curtain of snow on the city, the sun blotted out to cloak the world in darkness.</p><p>It created the perfect muted background for the strange angels who crouched all over New York.</p><p>\u201cThese gray ones are an enigma.\u201d Eyes of violent blue took in the eerie scene, everyone so silent it seemed impossible this was a city of countless souls. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>The gray angels didn\u2019t stop them as they flew back through the snow to the Tower, Illium by their side. Coming to a stop on the Tower balcony, Elena took her place beside Raphael, their eyes on Manhattan. Dmitri flanked him in silence, while Illium acted as a winged sentry. Naasir, she realized, had to be handling the enemy vampires still in the city. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Take one step forward with me, Elena.</p><p>Guessing it to be some kind of angelic protocol, she did so without argument . . . and one of the gray ones flew toward them from a nearby building. Tall, with broad shoulders, his wings silent in the snow and his hair brushing his nape, Elena couldn\u2019t have picked him out from any of the others. It was as if they\u2019d been minted from the same press, one after the other.</p><p>Landing right in front of them, he placed his sword horizontally in front of his body and went down on one knee, head bent.</p> <p>Elena bit down hard on her lower lip to stifle her gasp. The mark on his nape, she said, eyes on the primal black lines of it as the male\u2019s dusty gray hair slipped to either side, it\u2019s a mirror image of yours.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d the unknown fighter said at the same instant, \u201cwe come as called.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s answer was accompanied by a freezing wind that swept through the deathly silent city. \u201cNone who fought so bravely should kneel.\u201d</p><p>The gray angel rose to his feet on Raphael\u2019s words. This close, Elena saw his irises weren\u2019t truly gray; they were so pale as to be barely distinguishable from the whites, but for the black pinpricks of his pupils. It should\u2019ve reminded her of Lijuan, but it didn\u2019t, because where Lijuan carried death and a putrid evil in her eyes, the being that looked through those colorless eyes was near to a blank slate. As if he hadn\u2019t yet decided who he would be.</p><p>\u201cYou call me Sire.\u201d Raphael\u2019s wing was heavy against her own as they stood side by side, their bodies aligned under the falling snow that was a cold, welcome kiss on the wounds that scored her flesh. \u201cTell me why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe heard your voice in our Sleep.\u201d It was a flat, toneless statement. \u201cWe hear only the voice of the Sire or his consort.\u201d His eyes locked with Elena\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cElena,\u201d she said through a dry throat, forcing herself to remember this deadly creature was a friend, not foe. \u201cYou can call me Elena.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her as though she were speaking a foreign language. \u201cYou are the consort.\u201d</p><p>Okay, Archangel, I think this is more your speed than mine.</p><p>I\u2019m uncertain these gray ones are anyone\u2019s speed. \u201cWhat do you call yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u201d\u2014an absolute hush, the wind frozen\u2014\u201care the Legion.\u201d</p> <p>Elena felt her stomach drop, as if she\u2019d learned something terrible.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The Legion.</p><p>Raphael had heard those words before, a long, long time ago. They are, he said to Elena, the threat used to scare badly behaving angelic children.</p><p>Have a nap or the Legion will come get you? Like the bogeyman?</p><p>Precisely. Except it appears our bogeyman is real. \u201cYou have been gone from the world an eon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Raphael, look at his eyes. They\u2019re starting to gain color. And his hair . . .</p> <p>Doing as Elena bid, Raphael saw the gray one was indeed no longer so gray. His hair was darkening into black and his irises now boasted a fine rim of blue\u2014the same blue as Raphael\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou are now my Legion.\u201d Not a question, the mark on his face a quiet thrum that told him the truth, told him, too, that the Legion waited for his command. \u201cYour first task is to assist my troops in securing the city and fixing the damage to the Tower.\u201d</p><p>A quiet nod, his wings folded with military tightness. \u201cSire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are their leader. I need a name for you.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cI am not the first primary,\u201d he said at last, \u201cbut that is what I am. The Primary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Raphael said, accepting what appeared to be a rank rather than a name. It was becoming clear the Legion was not in any way an ordinary angelic\u2014if they were even angels\u2014squadron. \u201cTell the Legion they are to obey the orders of Dmitri and Illium as if they were mine or my consort\u2019s.\u201d He pointed out the two men. \u201cI will make the others of my Seven known to you when they return from their tasks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Legion has heard and understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI estimate five hundred in your squadron. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred woke to the Sire\u2019s call in urgency. Two hundred and seventy-seven need more time. They will arrive when their hearts begin to beat fast enough for flight.\u201d</p><p>Seven hundred and seventy-seven fighters who functioned as a single cohesive and apparently tireless unit, their skills lethal and their healing abilities unparalleled. He\u2019d seen a Legion fighter beheaded, only to rise again within minutes, his head growing a new body while the old disintegrated into dust.</p><p>It was an army no other archangel would easily wish to face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need quarters for the Legion,\u201d Raphael said to Dmitri.</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d It was a quiet interruption from the Primary, and when Raphael nodded at him to speak, the male said, \u201cWe do not sleep except when it is time for us to leave the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you eat?\u201d Dmitri asked. \u201cNeed water?\u201d</p><p>Another pause, akin to those of older angels who sought to mine their memories for a lost answer. \u201cYes\u201d\u2014a faint sense of surprise in his tone\u2014\u201cwhen we are awake, we do need fuel, but we can fight for many days without sustenance or rest.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll work out the logistics, Dmitri said mind to mind. \u201cThough you may not need a place to sleep,\u201d he said aloud, his words directed at the Primary, \u201cyou should have a place where you can be with your men and women\u2014\u201d A frown. \u201cI see no women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are the Legion,\u201d came the incomprehensible answer.</p><p>Eyebrow raised, Dmitri continued. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a place where your men can gather at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the Primary said after another pause, his mind seemingly not yet having shaken off the shackles of his long Sleep. \u201cWe do not . . . do well if cut off from the group so soon after waking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are two warehouses next to each other not too far from the Tower,\u201d Dmitri said. \u201cWe normally use them for storage, but they can be cleared for temporary accommodation if\u201d\u2014a glance at the Primary\u2014\u201cthat wouldn\u2019t be too basic an environment? They\u2019re nothing but large spaces with four walls and a roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, such will do well.\u201d</p><p>Raphael knew the warehouses could only be a short-term solution. Even with the members of the Legion rotating in and out, the combined space wasn\u2019t designed for over seven hundred winged beings. \u201cNow that you\u2019re awake,\u201d he said to the Primary, \u201chow long do you plan to stay this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil it is time to Sleep again.\u201d</p><p>Okay, he takes the win for most cryptic statements.</p><p>Biting back a smile at Elena\u2019s dry assertion, Raphael said, \u201cWe\u2019ll build you a living space suited to your requirements after the repairs to the city and the Tower.\u201d Raphael owned a massive chunk of Manhattan, far more than most people realized, and it made sense to have this force around the Tower. \u201cIn the interim, you are welcome at the Tower. You are my people now.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Sadness had been the pulse of the city for five days follow-ing the war, as they watched flower-covered bier after bier leave for the Refuge and buried hunters and vampires who\u2019d fallen. Elena hated funerals\u2014not hard to figure out why\u2014but she\u2019d attended every single one, as had every other fighter who\u2019d survived and wasn\u2019t confined to a sickbed. It had hurt.</p><p>The finest honor we can do the fallen is to bring our city back to life, until children play in the parks and lovers walk in the streets while angels soar among the skyscrapers and the blood kin share the kiss of life without fear. We must not forget what they died to protect.</p><p>Words a still badly hurt Aodhan had spoken, at the funeral of a vampire commander he\u2019d considered a friend, and words they\u2019d all taken to heart. In the past forty-eight hours, the rebuild of the city had kicked into high gear, and that was going a long way toward healing the wounds, though Elena knew it would take time for the emotional\u2014and physical\u2014injuries to heal.</p><p>She\u2019d been lucky, so damn lucky that all her close friends had made it out alive, here and in the Refuge\u2014the fighting there having ended the instant word filtered back of Lijuan\u2019s defeat. Of the injured, Ransom and Ashwini were the worst off, but they\u2019d both be okay. Ransom had taken a crossbow bolt in the leg in the final battle, his femur snapping, while Ashwini had been slashed pretty badly with a sword across her chest. The other woman now held the Guild record for most stitches in a single sitting and was trying to avoid answering the one question to which every hunter wanted to know the answer.</p><p>If she and Janvier weren\u2019t together, then what was he doing playing (wow-mama-sexay) nurse at her apartment, hmm?</p><p>The silliness of wondering about Ash and Janvier\u2019s relationship gave the tough, often stoic men and women of the Guild a much-needed emotional outlet, and if the jokes segued into more solemn conversations, that was good, too. Day by day, hour by hour, they were all finding a way to deal. For Elena part of that had meant a visit with Eve and Beth both, as well as a long squeeze-cuddle of a snuggly Zoe, a video call with Sam, and a visit to a hospital earlier that morning to fulfill her promise to a little boy who wanted to fly.</p><p>Today, she stood on a building across from the Tower with her archangel, the two of them having met there to get an overview of how the repairs were going\u2014they\u2019d both been working with their people until now. \u201cOftentimes,\u201d Raphael had said, \u201can archangel must stand above those he rules, but there are times when he must stand beside them.\u201d</p><p>Now, he turned to her, his leathers dusty from the work. \u201cAstaad contacted me earlier. Once we are in a position to welcome guests, he has indicated a willingness to visit.\u201d</p><p>Elena had no arguments with that, the other archangel having done the entire world a giant favor. It had been approximately fifteen minutes after they\u2019d returned to the Tower after the retreat of Lijuan\u2019s troops that Raphael had received a very polite call from the Archangel of the Pacific Isles. \u201cRaphael,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cI wished to let you know I destroyed the cargo planes heading in your direction. I cannot believe Lijuan would attempt to fly such unclean creatures over my territory.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As it turned out, the holds had been stuffed with the last of Lijuan\u2019s hideous reborn so far as anyone knew. \u201cTell him to bring Mele along,\u201d Elena said, thinking she might actually start to enjoy this whole hostess deal if she kept getting to pick guests she liked. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll probably get an official update from Elijah, but I was talking to Hannah and she says they\u2019ve dug out the final few stubborn reborn from their territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Our territory is also clean, and I think I\u2019ll speak to Eli about certain ongoing safeguards to make sure that doesn\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>Elena nodded and drew in the crisp, bright winter air as the sounds of horns drifted up from the cabs below. God, it felt good to have her city back again. It might be a little battered, but hell if anyone was going to keep it\u2014and the people who called it home\u2014down. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the Tower repairs were done so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The winter sun creating that illusion of white fire across his wings she wasn\u2019t sure was an illusion at all, Raphael walked to the edge of the building. \u201cIt\u2019s the symbol of my power.\u201d</p><p>As such, Elena thought, it could never appear weak.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Raphael added, \u201cthe Legion is an extraordinary workforce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His consort came to stand beside him, arms folded as she scowled at the sight of two Legion fighters landing on a Tower balcony. \u201cYou\u2019re sure they\u2019re not secretly planning to take over the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I feel it inside.\u201d Stroking his knuckles gently down the side of her face, the heavy bruise she\u2019d taken on her jaw during the final fighting yet healing, he said, \u201cYou feel it, too, my suspicious consort.\u201d</p> <p>She unfolded her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tiny but steady pulse at the back of my mind, this awareness the Legion belong to us.\u201d Eyes of silver-gray turning to him, face solemn. \u201cI know if I think a little too hard about the Primary, he\u2019ll appear in front of me, ready to do my bidding. And while I might be starting to get a handle on the consort thing, I\u2019m not ready to deal with that kind of power. It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s mine.\u201d Elena didn\u2019t have the experience to manage a force such as the Legion, and more, she shouldn\u2019t have to. Already, she was taking on far more of the responsibilities of a consort than anyone could\u2019ve expected of her so soon into her immortality. \u201cBut I hope you\u2019ll give me the benefit of your advice as I learn to deal with my new army.\u201d</p><p>A twitch of her lips, her wing sweeping across his in a silent caress. \u201cTry to shut me up.\u201d Leaning into him, she said, \u201cWhy you, why us? I keep trying to get my head around that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA question to which the Primary may even now give us an answer,\u201d Raphael said, as the leader of the Legion landed in front of them.</p><p>The male\u2019s eyes remained translucent but for that ring of blue, the effect oddly beautiful, according to Raphael\u2019s consort. His hair, though, had turned totally black. His skin, too, was no longer the shade of death, but glowed golden with health, and his leathery wings had become a beaten gold except for the part where they grew out of his back.</p><p>There they were a black that echoed Elena\u2019s wings, the color bleeding into midnight blue, which then flowed into the beaten gold. The metamorphosis of the rest of the Legion was slower but no less fascinating a process. Day by day, they were all becoming painted in color\u2014and the palette was the same.</p> <p>\u201cSire,\u201d the Primary now said, \u201cyou call us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you. The others may continue as they are.\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>\u201cMy consort has a question for you.\u201d</p><p>The Primary looked at Elena without blinking.</p><p>\u201cWhy Raphael and me?\u201d she asked, her passionate nature inherent in the intensity of the question. \u201cWhy not Elijah and Hannah? They\u2019re older, have been together longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are aeclari, and the Legion may only serve aeclari.\u201d</p><p>Archangel?</p> <p>I do not know this term, Elena. \u201cTell us about aeclari.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeclari is you,\u201d the Primary said, as if it made perfect sense.</p><p>Do you think if I shoot him, he\u2019ll actually answer a question?</p><p>Raphael fought his laughter. I think it\u2019s a case of asking the right questions. \u201cYou\u2019re connected to the power that tried to fill me,\u201d he said, his skin prickling with the awareness of it.</p><p>\u201cWe are the repository. We tried to pass it to the Sire, but the Sire is not yet ready.\u201d</p><p>It was as clear an answer as he could\u2019ve wished for, the whispers making sense now that he\u2019d seen the Legion, understood how deeply they were linked to one another\u2014as if they were one organism with many parts. \u201cWhat happens when I\u2019m ready? Do you vanish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We are then freed to stay in the world or return to our Sleep once more. If we stay, we become alone and separate.\u201d</p><p>Raphael considered the other man\u2019s words\u2014and the Primary was a man, if one who hadn\u2019t yet fully become\u2014and placed it against what he knew of the Cascade powers gained by the rest of the Cadre. Each had to do with an ability or proclivity inherent to the archangel in question.</p><p>\u201cYou can only serve a warrior,\u201d he said, and it was no question because he felt the rightness of it in his gut. Raphael had been a warrior in one guise or another throughout his existence, from a stripling in Titus\u2019s army long ago, to fighting side by side with his own forces in the war past.</p><p>The Primary paused. \u201cYes,\u201d he responded at last, in that totally flat tone devoid of emotion. \u201cA warrior who is attuned to the power of which we are formed\u2014of the earth, of life. But the warrior must also be aeclari.\u201d His eyes flicked to Elena, giving Raphael the first glimmer of what that term actually meant. \u201cAnd it must be the time.\u201d</p><p>The Cascade happens and Neha calls fire and ice, Elena said into his mind at the same instant. Titus moves the earth, Astaad the sea, while creepy Lijuan brings the dead back to life. Meanwhile, my gorgeous archangel, not satisfied with, I don\u2019t know, shooting lightning bolts or something, actually taps into the energy of the planet and calls an army of bogeymen from the bottom of the ocean. Of course you do.</p><p>The dry commentary made him wonder how he\u2019d ever walked through life without the wit and laughter of his hunter by his side. He could no longer imagine such a cold, remote existence, the idea of it spawning an immediate repudiation in his bloodstream. Wing to wing with her, he said to the Primary, \u201cHave others through time gained the ability to call you?\u201d</p><p>Another long pause, the Primary turning the pages of his memory. \u201cThere have been warriors who have become attuned to the power of the earth, of life, and gained strength, but they touched only the edge of what we carry within us. It was not time for us to wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me your history,\u201d he said, a sudden chill over his skin, as if the answer was part of the racial memory of his people, buried deep, deep within the most primitive part of his brain.</p><p>\u201cIt was in the war that unmade our civilization that the Legion came to be. We were formed during the Cascade of Terror and bound to the first aeclari, our purpose to fight against the death that stalked the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reborn?\u201d Elena whispered. \u201cYou\u2019re the antidote to their poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe death took a different form then, but it was no less virulent or vicious. By the time we gained victory, angelkind was nearly destroyed, and our home hollow and dead. The Legion, too, was near death, for we are of the earth, of life. Our people, infected with the deadly toxin created by the power of an archangel of madness, made the decision to Sleep eons in the hope the poison would fade.</p><p>\u201cWhen they woke, it was to find a new people had been born from the ashes of the old, and the toxin had bonded permanently to the blood of the survivors.\u201d His eyes lingered on Elena. \u201cMadness and death reigned, until the desperation of a single individual made angelkind understand the fragile new people were their salvation, a gift from their healed world.\u201d</p><p>Raphael. Unhidden shock in his consort\u2019s expression. I think he\u2019s talking about the birth of humanity.</p><p>And of vampires. It was a knowledge so huge, he knew he had no hope of comprehending it in a single instant. \u201cWhen,\u201d he asked, the chill he\u2019d felt ice in his bones, \u201cis the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCascades come and go, are not our business, for they are part of the cycle of the world. We listen and watch in our Sleep, but wake only when that cycle reaches a crescendo, the gifts spawned in the archangels that of life and death itself, ferocious enough to rip apart the fabric of the planet.\u201d His unblinking eyes met Raphael\u2019s. \u201cWe have not woken since the Cascade of Terror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d the Primary said on the heels of Elena\u2019s soft imprecation, \u201cif you would give me leave\u2014I would rejoin the Legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFly free.\u201d</p><p>As they watched him sweep off on those wings of silence, Raphael considered the putrid darkness that had almost taken the world only days past. Lijuan\u2019s reborn had been eliminated in all affected territories, but they\u2019d infected tens of thousands in the interim. Titus, meanwhile, continued to fight a constant trickle of disease bearers sent across by Charisemnon.</p><p>In comparison, Raphael\u2019s own strength continued to intensify day by day, until he knew that one day soon, he\u2019d be able to wield the power carried by the Legion. \u201cWe\u2019ve won this war, hbeebti, but it is only the first. I\u2019m afraid this means Lijuan has not been erased from existence, for she is the epitome of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Elena said, \u201cone of the other archangels holds the potential to go whackjob on us. But yeah, my money is on the Queen of the Dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLijuan won\u2019t repeat her mistakes.\u201d Raphael\u2014the world\u2014would have to be ready to handle a bloated monster ready to gorge herself on the life force of those she was meant to protect.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop her,\u201d Elena said, then shot him an unexpected smile. \u201cWe\u2019re aeclari, after all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be most intriguing to ascertain the exact meaning of that term.\u201d Though Raphael was in no doubt it had to do with the heartbond that tied him to his hunter.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d Wide eyes. \u201cThe Primary was crystal clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, how very unintelligent of your consort not to comprehend him.\u201d</p> <p>Convulsing with laughter at the way Raphael had said that without cracking a smile, Elena shook her head but couldn\u2019t get the words out. It made him smile, then throw back his head and laugh, the sight causing passing Legion fighters to pause, watch in what appeared to be shock, while the Tower troops grinned and continued on their way.</p><p>God, but he was beautiful. And he was hers.</p><p>Moving into his arms because she needed to be with him, unable to forget how close they\u2019d come to never again touching, never again laughing with one another, she smiled and tucked her wings close as he enclosed her in his.</p><p>Cupping the side of her face with one strong hand, he held her gaze with eyes of wild, impossible blue. \u201cI may not understand all of the Primary\u2019s words, but I know this with everything in me\u2014the Legion would not have woken for who I was before you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb caressing her cheekbone, his face close to her own. \u201cYou have never, and will never, weaken me. You make me a better man and a better leader than I would\u2019ve ever been without you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou said once that you couldn\u2019t do this without me. Well, I can\u2019t do this without you, Guild Hunter.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes burned from the potent power of his words, so raw and honest and necessary. She hadn\u2019t known it until he spoke, but she\u2019d needed to hear that, hear that he didn\u2019t blame her for the changes within him. \u201cDid you know,\u201d she confessed, as the snow began to fall again, soft flakes that caught on his eyelashes, \u201cI wake up terrified some nights and just watch you sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I did not know.\u201d His cheeks creasing, his lips brushing against her own as he bent his head. \u201cI must trust you a great deal indeed to allow myself to sleep so deeply.\u201d</p><p>That was when she understood the painful vulnerability inside her was forever. So long as Raphael existed, he\u2019d have the ability to hurt her by getting himself injured or worse\u2014and that was okay, because she wasn\u2019t afraid anymore, wasn\u2019t scared to live life with an open heart. Because the flip side to that awful vulnerability was an indescribable emotion that filled her up, made her happy to be alive and here, in the now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she murmured, as the joy of playing with her consort, her lover, her friend and mate, turned her blood to champagne, \u201cI could\u2019ve totally cut out your heart before you knew what was happening.\u201d</p><p>Their foreheads were touching now, his hand still cupping the side of her face, his chest a wall of muscled warmth against her palms. \u201cWhat stopped you?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her voice, she whispered, \u201cI thought Montgomery might\u2019ve been pissed off at all the blood on the sheets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMontgomery would never be something as uncouth as pissed off. Annoyed in an icily genteel manner, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>Elena knew they should get back to helping their people rebuild their city, but she reached up to trace the mark on his temple with fingers rough from the work they\u2019d all been doing. He turned slightly into her touch as he always did, her archangel who\u2019d never wanted her to be anything but what she was. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve got one heck of a scary adventure coming up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly not be bored.\u201d</p><p>His kiss was a branding, his wings folding back to leave them exposed, and when he wrapped one arm around her waist and lifted them into the snow-kissed sky, their mouths still locked together, she didn\u2019t protest. Though she might\u2019ve smiled and blushed into the kiss at the wolf whistles that floated up, followed by the cheers.</p><p>The Cascade was in full progress. The world was becoming an insane place where rivers turned to blood and the dead walked, while archangels gained powers that made it manifest they were part of the very fabric of that world. The monsters might yet get loose again and the wicked witch was probably going to come cackling back to life to join arms with her disease-spawning best friend.</p><p>Despite all of that, at this instant, with the snow falling softly around her and her consort, their city alive, Elena didn\u2019t want to be anywhere or anywhen else. And neither, she knew, did the archangel who kissed her above Manhattan, his arms holding her safe. </p> </body></html>"]
