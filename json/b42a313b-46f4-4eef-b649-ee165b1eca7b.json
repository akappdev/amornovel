But what is it that the old women see?</p><p>We see necessity, and we do the things that must be done.</p> <p>Young women don\u2019t see\u2014they are, and the spring of life runs through them.</p><p>Ours is the guarding of the spring, ours the shielding of the light we have lit, the flame that we are.</p><p>What have I seen? You are the vision of my youth, the constant dream of all my ages.</p><p>Here I stand on the brink of war again, a citizen of no place, no time, no country but my own . . . and that a land lapped by no sea but blood, bordered only by the outlines of a face long-loved.</p><p>PART ONE</p> <p>Nexus</p><p>A HUNDREDWEIGHT OF STONES</p><p>June 16, 1778</p><p>The forest between Philadelphia and Valley Forge</p><p>IAN MURRAY STOOD with a stone in his hand, eyeing the ground he\u2019d chosen. A small clearing, out of the way, up among a scatter of great lichened boulders, under the shadow of firs and at the foot of a big red cedar; a place where no casual passerby would go, but not inaccessible. He meant to bring them up here\u2014the family.</p><p>Fergus, to begin with. Maybe just Fergus, by himself. Mam had raised Fergus from the time he was ten, and he\u2019d had no mother before that. Fergus had known Mam longer than Ian had, and loved her as much. Maybe more, he thought, his grief aggravated by guilt. Fergus had stayed with her at Lally-broch, helped to take care of her and the place; he hadn\u2019t. He swallowed hard and, walking into the small clear space, set his stone in the middle, then stood back to look.</p> <p>Even as he did so, he found himself shaking his head. No, it had to be two cairns. His mam and Uncle Jamie were brother and sister, and the family could mourn them here together\u2014but there were others he might bring, maybe, to remember and pay their respects. And those were the folk who would have known Jamie Fraser and loved him well but wouldn\u2019t ken Jenny Murray from a hole in the\u2014</p><p>The image of his mother in a hole in the ground stabbed him like a fork, retreated with the recollection that she wasn\u2019t after all in a grave, and stabbed again all the harder for that. He really couldn\u2019t bear the vision of them drowning, maybe clinging to each other, struggling to keep\u2014</p><p>\u201cA Dhia!\u201d he said violently, and dropped the stone, turning back at once to find more. He\u2019d seen people drown.</p><p>Tears ran down his face with the sweat of the summer day; he didn\u2019t mind it, only stopping now and then to wipe his nose on his sleeve. He\u2019d tied a rolled kerchief round his head to keep the hair and the stinging sweat out of his eyes; it was sopping before he\u2019d added more than twenty stones to each of the cairns.</p><p>He and his brothers had built a fine cairn for their father before he died, at the head of the carved stone that bore his name\u2014all his names, in spite of the expense\u2014in the burying ground at Lallybroch. And then later, at the funeral, members of the family, followed by the tenants and then the servants, had come one by one to add a stone each to the weight of remembrance.</p><p>Fergus, then. Or . . . no, what was he thinking? Auntie Claire must be the first he brought here. She wasn\u2019t Scots herself, but she kent fine what a cairn was and would maybe be comforted a bit to see Uncle Jamie\u2019s. Aye, right. Auntie Claire, then Fergus. Uncle Jamie was Fergus\u2019s foster father; he had a right. And then maybe Marsali and the children. But maybe Germain was old enough to come with Fergus? He was ten, near enough to being a man to understand, to be treated like a man. And Uncle Jamie was his grandsire; it was proper.</p><p>He stepped back again and wiped his face, breathing heavily. Bugs whined and buzzed past his ears and hovered over him, wanting his blood, but he\u2019d stripped to a loincloth and rubbed himself with bear grease and mint in the Mohawk way; they didn\u2019t touch him.</p><p>\u201cLook over them, O spirit of red cedar,\u201d he said softly in Mohawk, gazing up into the fragrant branches of the tree. \u201cGuard their souls and keep their presence here, fresh as thy branches.\u201d</p> <p>He crossed himself and bent to dig about in the soft leaf mold. A few more rocks, he thought. In case they might be scattered by some passing animal. Scattered like his thoughts, which roamed restless to and fro among the faces of his family, the folk of the Ridge\u2014God, might he ever go back there? Brianna. Oh, Jesus, Brianna . . .</p><p>He bit his lip and tasted salt, licked it away and moved on, foraging. She was safe with Roger Mac and the weans. But, Jesus, he could have used her advice\u2014even more, Roger Mac\u2019s.</p><p>Who was left for him to ask, if he needed help in taking care of them all?</p><p>Thought of Rachel came to him, and the tightness in his chest eased a little. Aye, if he had Rachel . . . She was younger than him, nay more than nineteen, and, being a Quaker, had very strange notions of how things should be, but if he had her, he\u2019d have solid rock under his feet. He hoped he would have her, but there were still things he must say to her, and the thought of that conversation made the tightness in his chest come back.</p><p>The picture of his cousin Brianna came back, too, and lingered in his mind: tall, long-nosed and strong-boned as her father . . . and with it rose the image of his other cousin, Bree\u2019s half brother. Holy God, William. And what ought he to do about William? He doubted the man kent the truth, kent that he was Jamie Fraser\u2019s son\u2014was it Ian\u2019s responsibility to tell him so? To bring him here and explain what he\u2019d lost?</p><p>He must have groaned at the thought, for his dog, Rollo, lifted his massive head and looked at him in concern.</p><p>\u201cNo, I dinna ken that, either,\u201d Ian told him. \u201cLet it bide, aye?\u201d Rollo laid his head back on his paws, shivered his shaggy hide against the flies, and relaxed in boneless peace.</p><p>Ian worked awhile longer and let the thoughts drain away with his sweat and his tears. He finally stopped when the sinking sun touched the tops of his cairns, feeling tired but more at peace. The cairns rose knee-high, side by side, small but solid.</p><p>He stood still for a bit, not thinking anymore, just listening to the fussing of wee birds in the grass and the breathing of the wind among the trees. Then he sighed deeply, squatted, and touched one of the cairns.</p><p>\u201cTha gaol agam oirbh, a Mh\u00e0thair,\u201d he said softly. My love is upon you, Mother. Closed his eyes and laid a scuffed hand on the other heap of stones. The dirt ground into his skin made his fingers feel strange, as though he could maybe reach straight through the earth and touch what he needed.</p><p>He stayed still, breathing, then opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHelp me wi\u2019 this, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said. \u201cI dinna think I can manage, alone.\u201d</p><p>DIRTY BASTARD</p><p>WILLIAM RANSOM, Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, Viscount Ashness, Baron Derwent, shoved his way through the crowds on Market Street, oblivious to the complaints of those rebounding from his impact.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where he was going, or what he might do when he got there. All he knew was that he\u2019d burst if he stood still.</p><p>His head throbbed like an inflamed boil. Everything throbbed. His hand\u2014he\u2019d probably broken something, but he didn\u2019t care. His heart, pounding and sore inside his chest. His foot, for God\u2019s sake\u2014what, had he kicked something? He lashed out viciously at a loose cobblestone and sent it rocketing through a crowd of geese, who set up a huge cackle and lunged at him, hissing and beating at his shins with their wings.</p><p>Feathers and goose shit flew wide, and the crowd scattered in all directions.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d shrieked the goose-girl, and struck at him with her crook, catching him a shrewd thump on the ear. \u201cDevil take you, dreckiger Bastard!\u201d</p><p>This sentiment was echoed by a number of other angry voices, and he veered into an alley, pursued by shouts and honks of agitation.</p><p>He rubbed his throbbing ear, lurching into buildings as he passed, oblivious to everything but the one word throbbing ever louder in his head. Bastard.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d he said out loud, and shouted, \u201cBastard, bastard, bastard!\u201d at the top of his lungs, hammering at the brick wall next to him with a clenched fist.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s a bastard?\u201d said a curious voice behind him. He swung round to see a young woman looking at him with some interest. Her eyes moved slowly down his frame, taking note of the heaving chest, the bloodstains on the facings of his uniform coat, and the green smears of goose shit on his breeches. Her gaze reached his silver-buckled shoes and returned to his face with more interest.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said, hoarse and bitter.</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d She left the shelter of the doorway in which she\u2019d been lingering and came across the alley to stand right in front of him. She was tall and slim and had a very fine pair of high young br**sts\u2014which were clearly visible under the thin muslin of her shift, because, while she had a silk petticoat, she wore no stays. No cap, either\u2014her hair fell loose over her shoulders. A whore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m partial to bastards myself,\u201d she said, and touched him lightly on the arm. \u201cWhat kind of bastard are you? A wicked one? An evil one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sorry one,\u201d he said, and scowled when she laughed. She saw the scowl but didn\u2019t pull back.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, and took his hand. \u201cYou look as though you could do with a drink.\u201d He saw her glance at his knuckles, burst and bleeding, and she caught her lower lip behind small white teeth. She didn\u2019t seem afraid, though, and he found himself drawn, unprotesting, into the shadowed doorway after her.</p><p>What did it matter? he thought, with a sudden savage weariness. What did anything matter?</p><p>IN WHICH THE WOMEN, AS USUAL, PICK UP THE PIECES</p><p>Number 17 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia</p><p>The residence of Lord and Lady John Grey</p><p>WILLIAM HAD LEFT the house like a thunderclap, and the place looked as though it had been struck by lightning. I certainly felt like the survivor of a massive electrical storm, hairs and nerve endings all standing up straight on end, waving in agitation.</p><p>Jenny Murray had entered the house on the heels of William\u2019s departure, and while the sight of her was a lesser shock than any of the others so far, it still left me speechless. I goggled at my erstwhile sister-in-law\u2014though, come to think, she still was my sister-in-law . . . because Jamie was alive. Alive.</p><p>He\u2019d been in my arms not ten minutes before, and the memory of his touch flickered through me like lightning in a bottle. I was dimly aware that I was smiling like a loon, despite massive destruction, horrific scenes, William\u2019s distress\u2014if you could call an explosion like that \u201cdistress\u201d\u2014Jamie\u2019s danger, and a faint wonder as to what either Jenny or Mrs. Figg, Lord John\u2019s cook and housekeeper, might be about to say.</p><p>Mrs. Figg was smoothly spherical, gleamingly black, and inclined to glide silently up behind one like a menacing ball bearing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she barked, manifesting herself suddenly behind Jenny.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mother of God!\u201d Jenny whirled, eyes round and hand pressed to her chest. \u201cWho in God\u2019s name are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Mrs. Figg,\u201d I said, feeling a surreal urge to laugh, despite\u2014or maybe because of\u2014recent events. \u201cLord John Grey\u2019s cook. And, Mrs. Figg, this is Mrs. Murray. My, um . . . my . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour good-sister,\u201d Jenny said firmly. She raised one black eyebrow. \u201cIf ye\u2019ll have me still?\u201d Her look was straight and open, and the urge to laugh changed abruptly into an equally strong urge to burst into tears. Of all the unlikely sources of succor I could have imagined . . . I took a deep breath and put out my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you.\u201d We hadn\u2019t parted on good terms in Scotland, but I had loved her very much, once, and wasn\u2019t about to pass up any opportunity to mend things.</p><p>Her small firm fingers wove through mine, squeezed hard, and, as simply as that, it was done. No need for apologies or spoken forgiveness. She\u2019d never had to wear the mask that Jamie did. What she thought and felt was there in her eyes, those slanted blue cat eyes she shared with her brother. She knew the truth now of what I was, and she knew I loved\u2014and always had loved\u2014her brother with all my heart and soul\u2014despite the minor complications of my being presently married to someone else.</p><p>She heaved a sigh, eyes closing for an instant, then opened them and smiled at me, mouth trembling only a little.</p><p>\u201cWell, fine and dandy,\u201d said Mrs. Figg shortly. She narrowed her eyes and rotated smoothly on her axis, taking in the panorama of destruction. The railing at the top of the stair had been ripped off, and cracked banisters, dented walls, and bloody smudges marked the path of William\u2019s descent. Shattered crystals from the chandelier littered the floor, glinting festively in the light that poured through the open front door, the door itself cracked through and hanging drunkenly from one hinge.</p><p>\u201cMerde on toast,\u201d Mrs. Figg murmured. She turned abruptly to me, her small black-currant eyes still narrowed. \u201cWhere\u2019s his lordship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said. This was going to be rather sticky, I saw. While deeply disapproving of most people, Mrs. Figg was devoted to John. She wasn\u2019t going to be at all pleased to hear that he\u2019d been abducted by\u2014</p><p>\u201cFor that matter, where\u2019s my brother?\u201d Jenny inquired, glancing round as though expecting Jamie to appear suddenly out from under the settee.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cHmm. Well . . .\u201d Possibly worse than sticky. Because . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s my Sweet William?\u201d Mrs. Figg demanded, sniffing the air. \u201cHe\u2019s been here; I smell that stinky cologne he puts on his linen.\u201d She nudged a dislodged chunk of plaster disapprovingly with the toe of her shoe.</p><p>I took another long, deep breath and a tight grip on what remained of my sanity.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Figg,\u201d I said, \u201cperhaps you would be so kind as to make us all a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>WE SAT IN the parlor, while Mrs. Figg came and went to the cookhouse, keeping an eye on her terrapin stew.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to scorch turtle, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d she said severely to us, setting down the teapot in its padded yellow cozy on her return. \u201cNot with so much sherry as his lordship likes in it. Almost a full bottle\u2014terrible waste of good liquor, that would be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My insides turned over promptly. Turtle soup\u2014with a lot of sherry\u2014had certain strong and private associations for me, these being connected with Jamie, feverish delirium, and the way in which a heaving ship assists sexual intercourse. Contemplation of which would not assist the impending discussion in the slightest. I rubbed a finger between my brows, in hopes of dispelling the buzzing cloud of confusion gathering there. The air in the house still felt electric.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of sherry,\u201d I said, \u201cor any other sort of strong spirits you might have convenient, Mrs. Figg . . .\u201d</p><p>She looked thoughtfully at me, nodded, and reached for the decanter on the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cBrandy is stronger,\u201d she said, and set it in front of me.</p> <p>Jenny looked at me with the same thoughtfulness and, reaching out, poured a good-sized slug of the brandy into my cup, then a similar one into her own.</p><p>\u201cJust in case,\u201d she said, raising one brow, and we drank for a few moments. I thought it might take something stronger than brandy-laced tea to deal with the effect of recent events on my nerves\u2014laudanum, say, or a large slug of straight Scotch whisky\u2014but the tea undeniably helped, hot and aromatic, settling in a soft trickling warmth amidships.</p><p>\u201cSo, then. We\u2019re fettled, are we?\u201d Jenny set down her own cup and looked expectant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d I took a deep breath and gave her a pr\u00e9cis of the morning\u2019s events.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s eyes were disturbingly like Jamie\u2019s. She blinked at me once, then twice, and shook her head as though to clear it, accepting what I\u2019d just told her.</p> <p>\u201cSo Jamie\u2019s gone off wi\u2019 your Lord John, the British army is after them, the tall lad I met on the stoop wi\u2019 steam comin\u2019 out of his ears is Jamie\u2019s son\u2014well, of course he is; a blind man could see that\u2014and the town\u2019s aboil wi\u2019 British soldiers. Is that it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not exactly my Lord John,\u201d I said. \u201cBut, yes, that\u2019s essentially the position. I take it Jamie told you about William, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he did.\u201d She grinned at me over the rim of her teacup. \u201cI\u2019m that happy for him. But what\u2019s troubling his lad, then? He looked like he wouldna give the road to a bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mrs. Figg\u2019s voice cut in abruptly. She set down the tray she had just brought in, the silver milk jug and sugar basin rattling like castanets. \u201cWilliam is whose son?\u201d</p><p>I took a fortifying gulp of tea. Mrs. Figg did know that I\u2019d been married to\u2014and theoretically widowed from\u2014one James Fraser. But that was all she knew.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, and paused to clear my throat. \u201cThe, um, tall gentleman with the red hair who was just here\u2014you saw him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did.\u201d Mrs. Figg eyed me narrowly.</p><p>\u201cDid you get a good look at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t pay much heed to his face when he came to the door and asked where you were, but I saw his backside pretty plain when he pushed past me and ran up the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly the resemblance is less marked from that angle.\u201d I took another mouthful of tea. \u201cUm . . . that gentleman is James Fraser, my . . . er . . . my\u2014\u201d \u201cFirst husband\u201d wasn\u2019t accurate, and neither was \u201clast husband\u201d\u2014or even, unfortunately, \u201cmost recent husband.\u201d I settled for the simplest alternative. \u201cMy husband. And, er . . . William\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg\u2019s mouth opened, soundless for an instant. She backed up slowly and sat down on a needlework ottoman with a soft phumph.</p><p>\u201cWilliam know that?\u201d she asked, after a moment\u2019s contemplation.</p><p>\u201cHe does now,\u201d I said, with a brief gesture toward the devastation in the stairwell, clearly visible through the door of the parlor where we were sitting.</p><p>\u201cMerde on\u2014I mean, Holy Lamb of God preserve us.\u201d Mrs. Figg\u2019s second husband was a Methodist preacher, and she strove to be a credit to him, but her first had been a French gambler. Her eyes fixed on me like gun sights.</p> <p>\u201cYou his mother?\u201d</p><p>I choked on my tea.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, wiping my chin with a linen napkin. \u201cIt isn\u2019t quite that complicated.\u201d In fact, it was more so, but I wasn\u2019t going to explain just how Willie had come about, either to Mrs. Figg or to Jenny. Jamie had to have told Jenny who William\u2019s mother was, but I doubted that he\u2019d told his sister that William\u2019s mother, Geneva Dunsany, had forced him into her bed by threatening Jenny\u2019s family. No man of spirit likes to admit that he\u2019s been effectively blackmailed by an eighteen-year-old girl.</p><p>\u201cLord John became William\u2019s legal guardian when William\u2019s grandfather died, and at that point, Lord John also married Lady Isobel Dunsany, Willie\u2019s mother\u2019s sister. She\u2019d looked after Willie since his mother\u2019s death in childbirth, and she and Lord John were essentially Willie\u2019s parents since he was quite young. Isobel died when he was eleven or so.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg took this explanation in stride but wasn\u2019t about to be distracted from the main point at issue.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser,\u201d she said, tapping a couple of broad fingers on her knee and looking accusingly at Jenny. \u201cHow comes he not to be dead? News was he drowned.\u201d She cut her eyes at me. \u201cI thought his lordship was like to throw himself in the harbor, too, when he heard it.\u201d</p><p>I closed my own eyes with a sudden shudder, the salt-cold horror of that news washing over me in a wave of memory. Even with Jamie\u2019s touch still joyful on my skin and the knowledge of him glowing in my heart, I relived the crushing pain of hearing that he was dead.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can enlighten ye on that point, at least.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to see Jenny drop a lump of sugar into her fresh tea and nod at Mrs. Figg. \u201cWe were to take passage on a ship called Euterpe\u2014my brother and myself\u2014out o\u2019 Brest. But the blackhearted thief of a captain sailed without us. Much good it did him,\u201d she added, frowning.</p><p>Much good, indeed. The Euterpe had sunk in a storm in the Atlantic, lost with all hands. As I\u2014and John Grey\u2014had been told.</p><p>\u201cJamie found us another ship, but it landed us in Virginia, and we\u2019d to make our way up the coast, partly by wagon, partly by packet boat, keepin\u2019 out of the way of the soldiers. Those wee needles ye gave Jamie against the seasickness work a marvel,\u201d she added, turning approvingly to me. \u201cHe showed me how to put them in for him. But when we came to Philadelphia yesterday,\u201d she went on, returning to her tale, \u201cwe stole into the city by night, like a pair o\u2019 thieves, and made our way to Fergus\u2019s printshop. Lord, I thought my heart would stop a dozen times!\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the memory, and I was struck by the change in her. The shadow of sorrow still lay on her face, and she was thin and worn by travel, but the terrible strain of her husband Ian\u2019s long dying had lifted. There was color in her cheeks again and a brightness in her eyes that I had not seen since I had first known her thirty years before. She had found her peace, I thought, and felt a thankfulness that eased my own soul.</p><p>\u201c. . . so Jamie taps on the door at the back, and there\u2019s no answer, though we can see the light of a fire comin\u2019 through the shutters. He knocks again, makin\u2019 a wee tune of it\u2014</p><p>\u201d She rapped her knuckles lightly on the table, bump-ba-da-bump-ba-da-bump-bump-bump, and my heart turned over, recognizing the theme from The Lone Ranger, which Brianna had taught him.</p><p>\u201cAnd after a moment,\u201d Jenny went on, \u201ca woman\u2019s voice calls out fierce, \u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 And Jamie says in the G\u00e0idhlig, \u2018It is your father, my daughter, and a cold, wet, and hungry man he is, too.\u2019 For it was rainin\u2019 hammer handles and pitchforks, and we were both soaked to the skin.\u201d</p><p>She rocked back a little, enjoying the telling.</p><p>\u201cThe door opens then, just a crack, and there\u2019s Marsali wi\u2019 a horse pistol in her hand, and her two wee lasses behind her, fierce as archangels, each with a billet of wood, ready to crack a thief across his shins. They see the firelight shine on Jamie\u2019s face then, and all three of them let out skellochs like to wake the dead and fall upon him and drag him inside and all talkin\u2019 at once and greetin\u2019, askin\u2019 was he a ghost and why was he not drowned, and that was the first we learned that the Euterpe had sunk.\u201d She crossed herself. \u201cGod rest them, poor souls,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>I crossed myself, too, and saw Mrs. Figg look sideways at me; she hadn\u2019t realized I was a Papist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come in, too, of course,\u201d Jenny went on, \u201cbut everyone\u2019s talkin\u2019 at once and rushin\u2019 to and fro in search of dry clothes and hot drinks and I\u2019m just lookin\u2019 about the place, for I\u2019ve never been inside a printshop before, and the smell of the ink and the paper and lead is a wonder to me, and, sudden-like, there\u2019s a tug at my skirt and this sweet-faced wee mannie says to me, \u2018And who are you, madame? Would you like some cider?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri-Christian,\u201d I murmured, smiling at thought of Marsali\u2019s youngest, and Jenny nodded.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Why, I\u2019m your grannie Janet, son,\u2019 says I, and his eyes go round, and he lets out a shriek and grabs me round the legs and gives me such a hug as to make me lose my balance and fall down on the settle. I\u2019ve a bruise on my bum the size of your hand,\u201d she added out of the corner of her mouth to me.</p><p>I felt a small knot of tension that I hadn\u2019t realized was there relax. Jenny did of course know that Henri-</p><p>Christian had been born a dwarf\u2014but knowing and seeing are sometimes different things. Clearly they hadn\u2019t been, for Jenny.</p><p>Mrs. Figg had been following this account with interest, but maintained her reserve. At mention of the printshop, though, this reserve hardened a bit.</p><p>\u201cThese folk\u2014Marsali is your daughter, then, ma\u2019am?\u201d I could tell what she was thinking. The entire town of Philadelphia knew that Jamie was a Rebel\u2014and, by extension, so was I. It was the threat of my imminent arrest that had caused John to insist upon my marrying him in the wake of the tumult following Jamie\u2019s presumed death. The mention of printing in British-occupied Philadelphia was bound to raise questions as to just what was being printed, and by whom.</p><p>\u201cNo, her husband is my brother\u2019s adopted son,\u201d Jenny explained. \u201cBut I raised Fergus from a wee lad myself, so he\u2019s my foster son, as well, by the Highland way of reckoning.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg blinked. She had been gamely trying to keep the cast of characters in some sort of order to this point, but now gave it up with a shake of her head that made the pink ribbons on her cap wave like antennae.</p><p>\u201cWell, where the devil\u2014I mean, where on earth has your brother gone with his lordship?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTo this printshop, you think?\u201d</p><p>Jenny and I exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d I said. \u201cMore likely he\u2019s gone outside the city, using John\u2014er, his lordship, I mean\u2014as a hostage to get past the pickets, if necessary. Probably he\u2019ll let him go as soon as they\u2019re far enough away for safety.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg made a deep humming noise of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe he\u2019ll make for Valley Forge and turn him over to the Rebels instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I shouldna think so,\u201d Jenny said soothingly. \u201cWhat would they want with him, after all?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg blinked again, taken aback at the notion that anyone might not value his lordship to the same degree that she did, but after a moment\u2019s lip-pursing allowed as this might be so.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in his uniform, was he, ma\u2019am?\u201d she asked me, brow furrowed. I shook my head. John didn\u2019t hold an active commission. He was a diplomat, though technically still lieutenant colonel of his brother\u2019s regiment, and therefore wore his uniform for purposes of ceremony or intimidation, but he was officially retired from the army, not a combatant, and in plain clothes he would be taken as citizen rather than soldier\u2014thus of no particular interest to General Washington\u2019s troops at Valley Forge.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think Jamie was headed for Valley Forge in any case. I knew, with absolute certainty, that he would come back. Here. For me.</p><p>The thought bloomed low in my belly and spread upward in a wave of warmth that made me bury my nose in my teacup to hide the resulting flush.</p><p>Alive. I caressed the word, cradling it in the center of my heart. Jamie was alive. Glad as I was to see Jenny\u2014and gladder still to see her extend an olive branch in my direction\u2014I really wanted to go up to my room, close the door, and lean against the wall with my eyes shut tight, reliving the seconds after he\u2019d entered the room, when he\u2019d taken me in his arms and pressed me to the wall, kissing me, the simple, solid, warm fact of his presence so overwhelming that I might have collapsed onto the floor without that wall\u2019s support.</p><p>Alive, I repeated silently to myself. He\u2019s alive.</p><p>Nothing else mattered. Though I did wonder briefly what he\u2019d done with John.</p><p>DON\u2019T ASK QUESTIONS YOU DON\u2019T WANT TO HEAR THE ANSWERS TO</p><p>In the woods,</p><p>an hour\u2019s ride outside Philadelphia</p><p>JOHN GREY HAD BEEN quite resigned to dying. Had expected it from the moment that he\u2019d blurted out, \u201cI have had carnal knowledge of your wife.\u201d The only question in his mind had been whether Fraser would shoot him, stab him, or eviscerate him with his bare hands.</p><p>To have the injured husband regard him calmly and say merely, \u201cOh? Why?\u201d was not merely unexpected but . . . infamous. Absolutely infamous.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d John Grey repeated, incredulous. \u201cDid you say \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And I should appreciate an answer.\u201d</p><p>Now that Grey had both eyes open, he could see that Fraser\u2019s outward calm was not quite so impervious as he\u2019d first supposed. There was a pulse beating in Fraser\u2019s temple, and he\u2019d shifted his weight a little, like a man might do in the vicinity of a tavern brawl: not quite ready to commit violence but readying himself to meet it. Perversely, Grey found this sight steadying. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you bloody mean, \u2018Why\u2019?\u201d he said, suddenly irritated. \u201cAnd why aren\u2019t you f**king dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI often wonder that myself,\u201d Fraser replied politely. \u201cI take it ye thought I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and so did your wife! Do you have the faintest idea what the knowledge of your death did to her?\u201d</p><p>The dark-blue eyes narrowed just a trifle.</p> <p>\u201cAre ye implying that the news of my death deranged her to such an extent that she lost her reason and took ye to her bed by force? Because,\u201d he went on, neatly cutting off Grey\u2019s heated reply, \u201cunless I\u2019ve been seriously misled regarding your own nature, it would take substantial force to compel ye to any such action. Or am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>The eyes stayed narrow. Grey stared back at them. Then he closed his own eyes briefly and rubbed both hands hard over his face, like a man waking from a nightmare. He dropped his hands and opened his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYou are not misled,\u201d he said, through clenched teeth. \u201cAnd you are wrong.\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s ruddy eyebrows shot up\u2014in genuine astonishment, Grey thought.</p><p>\u201cYe went to her because\u2014from desire?\u201d His voice rose, too. \u201cAnd she let ye? I dinna believe it.\u201d</p> <p>The color was creeping up Fraser\u2019s tanned neck, vivid as a climbing rose. Grey had seen that happen before and decided recklessly that the best\u2014the only\u2014defense was to lose his own temper first. It was a relief.</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were dead, you bloody arsehole!\u201d he said, furious. \u201cBoth of us! Dead! And we\u2014we\u2014took too much to drink one night\u2014very much too much . . . We spoke of you . . . and . . . Damn you, neither one of us was making love to the other\u2014we were both f**king you!\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s face went abruptly blank and his jaw dropped. Grey enjoyed one split second of satisfaction at the sight, before a massive fist came up hard beneath his ribs and he hurtled backward, staggered a few steps farther, and fell. He lay in the leaves, completely winded, mouth opening and closing like an automaton\u2019s.</p><p>All right, then, he thought dimly. Bare hands it is.</p><p>The hands wrapped themselves in his shirt and jerked him to his feet. He managed to stand, and a wisp of air seeped into his lungs. Fraser\u2019s face was an inch from his. Fraser was in fact so close that Grey couldn\u2019t see the man\u2019s expression\u2014only a close-up view of two bloodshot blue eyes, both of them berserk. That was enough. He felt quite calm now. It wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me exactly what happened, ye filthy wee pervert,\u201d Fraser whispered, his breath hot on Grey\u2019s face and smelling of ale. He shook Grey slightly. \u201cEvery word. Every motion. Everything.\u201d</p> <p>Grey got just enough breath to answer.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cGo ahead and kill me.\u201d</p><p>FRASER SHOOK HIM violently, so that his teeth clacked painfully together and he bit his tongue. He made a strangled noise at this, and a blow he hadn\u2019t seen coming struck him in the left eye. He fell down again, his head exploding with fractured color and black dots, the smell of leaf mold pungent in his nose. Fraser yanked him up and set him on his feet once more, but then paused, presumably deciding how best to continue the process of vivisection.</p><p>What with the blood pounding in his ears and the rasp of Fraser\u2019s breath, Grey hadn\u2019t heard anything, but when he cautiously opened his good eye to see where the next blow was coming from, he saw the man. A rough-looking dirty thug, in a fringed hunting shirt, gawping stupidly from under a tree.</p><p>\u201cJethro!\u201d the man bellowed, taking a tighter hold on the gun he carried.</p><p>A number of men came out of the bushes. One or two had the rudiments of a uniform, but most of them were dressed in homespun, though with the addition of the bizarre \u201cliberty\u201d caps, tight-knitted woolen affairs that fitted over the head and ears, which through John\u2019s watering eye gave the men the bluntly menacing aspect of animated bombshells.</p><p>The wives who had presumably made these garments had knitted such mottoes as LIBERTY or FREEDOM into the bands, though one bloodthirsty abigail had knitted the adjuration KILL! into her husband\u2019s hat. The husband in question was, Grey noted, a small and weedy specimen wearing spectacles with one shattered lens.</p><p>Fraser had stopped at the sound of the men\u2019s approach and now rounded on them like a bear brought to bay by hounds. The hounds stopped abruptly, at a safe distance.</p> <p>Grey pressed a hand over his liver, which he thought had likely been ruptured, and panted. He was going to need what breath he could get.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d one of the men demanded, jabbing pugnaciously at Jamie with the end of a long stick.</p><p>\u201cColonel James Fraser, Morgan\u2019s Rifles,\u201d Fraser replied coldly, ignoring the stick. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>The man appeared somewhat disconcerted but covered it with bluster.</p><p>\u201cCorporal Jethro Woodbine, Dunning\u2019s Rangers,\u201d he said, very gruff. He jerked his head at his companions, who at once spread out in a businesslike way, surrounding the clearing.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your prisoner, then?\u201d</p><p>Grey felt his stomach tighten, which, given the condition of his liver, hurt. He replied through clenched teeth, not waiting for Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI am Lord John Grey. If it\u2019s any business of yours.\u201d His mind was hopping like a flea, trying to calculate whether his chances of survival were better with Jamie Fraser or with this gang of yahoos. A few moments before, he had been resigned to the idea of death at Jamie\u2019s hands, but, like many ideas, that one was more appealing in concept than in execution.</p><p>The revelation of his identity seemed to confuse the men, who squinted and murmured, glancing at him dubiously.</p><p>\u201cHe ain\u2019t got a uniform on,\u201d one observed to another, sotto voce. \u201cBe he a soldier at all? We got no business with him if he ain\u2019t, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Woodbine declared, regaining some of his self-confidence. \u201cAnd if Colonel Fraser\u2019s taken him prisoner, I reckon he has reason?\u201d His voice went up, reluctantly questioning. Jamie made no reply, his eyes fixed on Grey.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a soldier.\u201d Heads swung round to see who had spoken. It was the small man with the shattered spectacles, who had adjusted these with one hand, the better to peer at Grey through his remaining lens. A watery blue eye inspected Grey, then the man nodded, more certain.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a soldier,\u201d the man repeated. \u201cI saw him in Philadelphia, sittin\u2019 on the porch of a house on Chestnut Street in his uniform, large as life. He\u2019s an officer,\u201d he added unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cHe is not a soldier,\u201d Fraser said, and turned his head to fix the spectacled man with a firm eye.</p><p>\u201cSaw him,\u201d muttered the man. \u201cPlain as day. Had gold braid,\u201d he murmured almost inaudibly, dropping his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Jethro Woodbine approached Grey, examining him carefully. \u201cWell, you got anything to say for yourself, Lord Grey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord John,\u201d Grey said crossly, and brushed a fragment of crushed leaf off his tongue. \u201cI am not a peer; my elder brother is. Grey is my family name. As for being a soldier, I have been. I still bear rank within my regiment, but my commission is not active. Is that sufficient, or do you want to know what I had for breakfast this morning?\u201d</p><p>He was purposely antagonizing them, some part of him having decided that he would rather go with Woodbine and bear the inspection of the Continentals than remain here to face the further inspections of Jamie Fraser. Fraser was regarding him through narrowed eyes. He fought the urge to look away.</p><p>It\u2019s the truth, he thought defiantly. What I told you is the truth. And now you know it.</p><p>Yes, said Fraser\u2019s black gaze. You think I will live quietly with it?</p><p>\u201cHe is not a soldier,\u201d Fraser repeated, turning his back deliberately on Grey, switching his attention to Woodbine. \u201cHe is my prisoner because I wished to question him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not your concern, Mr. Woodbine,\u201d Jamie said, deep voice soft but edged with steel. Jethro Woodbine, though, was nobody\u2019s fool and meant to make that clear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be judge of what\u2019s my business. Sir,\u201d he added, with a notable pause. \u201cHow do we know you\u2019re who you say you are, eh? You aren\u2019t in uniform. Any of you fellows know this man?\u201d</p><p>The fellows, thus addressed, looked surprised. They looked uncertainly at one another; one or two heads shook in the negative.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d said Woodbine, emboldened. \u201cIf you can\u2019t prove who you are, then I think we\u2019ll take this man back to camp for questioning.\u201d He smiled unpleasantly, another thought having evidently occurred to him. \u201cThink we ought to take you, too?\u201d</p><p>Fraser stood quite still for a moment, breathing slowly and regarding Woodbine as a tiger might regard a hedgehog: yes, he could eat it, but would the inconvenience of swallowing be worth it?</p><p>\u201cTake him, then,\u201d he said abruptly, stepping back from Grey. \u201cI have business elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Woodbine had been expecting argument; he blinked, disconcerted, and half-raised his stick, but said nothing as Fraser stalked toward the far edge of the clearing. Just under the trees, Fraser turned and gave Grey a flat, dark look.</p><p>\u201cWe are not finished, sir,\u201d he said.</p><p>Grey pulled himself upright, disregarding both the pain in his liver and the tears leaking from his damaged eye.</p><p>\u201cAt your service, sir,\u201d he snapped. Fraser glared at him and moved into the flickering green shadows, completely ignoring Woodbine and his men. One or two of them glanced at the corporal, whose face showed his indecision. Grey didn\u2019t share it. Just before Fraser\u2019s tall silhouette vanished for good, he cupped his hands to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bloody sorry!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>THE PASSIONS OF YOUNG MEN</p><p>WHILE FASCINATED to hear about William and the dramatic circumstances under which he had just discovered his paternity, Jenny\u2019s true concern was for another young man.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken where Young Ian is?\u201d she asked eagerly. \u201cAnd did he find his young woman, the Quaker lassie he told his da about?\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a little at this; Young Ian and Rachel Hunter were\u2014thank God\u2014not on the list of fraught situations. At least not for the moment.</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cAs for where he is . . . I haven\u2019t seen him for several days, but he\u2019s often gone for longer. He scouts for the Continental army now and then, though since they\u2019ve been in their winter quarters at Valley Forge for so long, there\u2019s been less need for scouting. He spends quite a bit of time there, though, because Rachel does.\u201d</p><p>Jenny blinked at that.</p><p>\u201cShe does? Why? Do Quakers not mislike wars and such?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, more or less. But her brother, Denzell, is an army surgeon\u2014though he\u2019s a real physician, not the usual horse-leech or quack-salver the army usually gets\u2014and he\u2019s been at Valley Forge since last November. Rachel comes and goes to Philadelphia\u2014she can pass through the pickets, so she carries back food and supplies\u2014but she works with Denny, so she\u2019s out there, helping with patients, much more often than she is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about her,\u201d Jenny said, leaning forward intently. \u201cIs she a good lass? And d\u2019ye think she loves Young Ian? From what Ian told me, the lad\u2019s desperate in love with her but hadn\u2019t spoken to her yet, not knowing how she\u2019d take it\u2014he wasna sure she could deal with him being . . . what he is.\u201d Her quick gesture encompassed Young Ian\u2019s history and character, from Highland lad to Mohawk warrior. \u201cGod kens weel he\u2019ll never make a decent Quaker, and I expect Young Ian kens that, too.\u201d</p><p>I laughed at the thought, though in fact the issue might be serious; I didn\u2019t know what a Quaker meeting might think of such a match, but I rather thought they might view the prospect with alarm. I knew nothing about Quaker marriage, though.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a very good girl,\u201d I assured Jenny. \u201cExtremely sensible, very capable\u2014and plainly in love with Ian, though I don\u2019t think she\u2019s told him so, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. D\u2019ye ken her parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they both died when she was a child. She was mostly raised by a Quaker widow and then came to keep house for her brother when she was sixteen or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the little Quaker girl?\u201d Mrs. Figg had come in with a vase of summer roses, smelling of myrrh and sugar. Jenny inhaled strongly and sat up straight. \u201cMercy Woodcock thinks the world of her. She comes by Mercy\u2019s house every time she\u2019s in town, to visit that young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung man?\u201d Jenny asked, dark brows drawing together.</p><p>\u201cWilliam\u2019s cousin Henry,\u201d I hastened to explain. \u201cDenzell and I carried out a very serious operation on him during the winter. Rachel knows both William and Henry and is very kind about visiting to see how Henry is. Mrs. Woodcock is his landlady.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me that I had meant to go check on Henry today myself. There were rumors of a British withdrawal from the city, and I needed to see whether he was fit enough yet to travel. He was doing well when I\u2019d stopped by a week before but at that point had been able to walk only a few steps, leaning on Mercy Woodcock\u2019s arm.</p><p>And what about Mercy Woodcock? I wondered, with a small jolt at the pit of the stomach. It was clear to me, as it was to John, that there was a serious\u2014and deepening\u2014affection between the free black woman and her aristocratic young lodger. I had met Mercy\u2019s husband, very badly wounded, during the exodus from Fort Ticonderoga a year before\u2014and, lacking any communication from or about him, thought it very likely that he had died after being taken prisoner by the British.</p><p>Still, the possibility of Walter Woodcock returning miraculously from the dead\u2014people did, after all, and a fresh bubble of joy rose under my heart at the thought\u2014was the least of the matter. I couldn\u2019t imagine that John\u2019s brother, the very firm-minded Duke of Pardloe, would be delighted at hearing that his youngest son meant to marry the widow of a carpenter, whatever her color. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then there was his daughter, Dottie, speaking of Quakers: she was betrothed to Denzell Hunter, and I did wonder what the duke would think of that. John, who liked a wager, had given me no better than even odds between Dottie and her father.</p><p>I shook my head, dismissing the dozen things I could do nothing about. During this minor reverie, Jenny and Mrs. Figg appeared to have been discussing William and his abrupt departure from the scene.</p><p>\u201cWhere would he go to, I wonder?\u201d Mrs. Figg looked worriedly toward the wall of the stairwell, pocked with blood-smeared dents left by William\u2019s fist.</p><p>\u201cGone to find a bottle, a fight, or a woman,\u201d said Jenny, with the authority of a wife, a sister, and the mother of sons. \u201cMaybe all three.\u201d</p> <p>Elfreth\u2019s Alley</p><p>IT WAS PAST midday, and the only voices in the house were the distant chitterings of women. No one was visible in the parlor as they passed, and no one appeared as the girl led William up a foot-marked staircase to her room. It gave him an odd feeling, as though he might be invisible. He found the notion a comfort; he couldn\u2019t bear himself.</p><p>She went in before him and threw open the shutters. He wanted to tell her to close them; he felt wretchedly exposed in the flood of sunlight. But it was summer; the room was hot and airless, and he was already sweating heavily. Air swirled in, heavy with the odor of tree sap and recent rain, and the sun glowed briefly on the smooth top of her head, like the gloss on a fresh conker. She turned and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d she announced briskly. \u201cThrow off your coat and waistcoat before you suffocate.\u201d Not waiting to see whether he would take this suggestion, she turned to reach for the basin and ewer. She filled the basin and stepped back, motioning him toward the washstand, where a towel and a much-used sliver of soap stood on worn wood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch us a drink, shall I?\u201d And with that, she was gone, bare feet pattering busily down the stairs.</p> <p>Mechanically, he began to undress. He blinked stupidly at the basin but then recalled that, in the better sort of house, sometimes a man was required to wash his parts first. He\u2019d encountered the custom once before, but on that occasion the whore had performed the ablution for him\u2014plying the soap to such effect that the first encounter had ended right there in the washbasin.</p><p>The memory made the blood flame up in his face again, and he ripped at his flies, popping off a button. He was still throbbing all over, but the sensation was becoming more centralized.</p><p>His hands were unsteady, and he cursed under his breath, reminded by the broken skin on his knuckles of his unceremonious exit from his father\u2019s\u2014no, not his bloody father\u2019s house. Lord John\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou bloody bastard!\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cYou knew, you knew all along!\u201d That infuriated him almost more than the horrifying revelation of his own paternity. His stepfather, whom he\u2019d loved, whom he\u2019d trusted more than anyone on earth\u2014Lord John bloody Grey\u2014had lied to him his whole life!</p><p>Everyone had lied to him.</p><p>Everyone.</p> <p>He felt suddenly as though he\u2019d broken through a crust of frozen snow and plunged straight down into an unsuspected river beneath. Swept away into black breathlessness beneath the ice, helpless, voiceless, a feral chill clawing at his heart.</p><p>There was a small sound behind him and he whirled by instinct, aware only when he saw the young whore\u2019s appalled face that he was weeping savagely, tears running down his own face, and his wet, half-hard c**k flopping out of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he croaked, making a frantic effort to tuck himself in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t go away but came toward him, decanter in one hand and a pair of pewter cups in the other.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked, eyeing him sideways. \u201cHere, let me pour you a drink. You can tell me all about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She came on toward him, but more slowly. Through his swimming eyes, he saw the twitch of her mouth as she saw his cock.</p><p>\u201cI meant the water for your poor hands,\u201d she said, clearly trying not to laugh. \u201cI will say as you\u2019re a real gentleman, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cIs it an insult to call you a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>Overcome with fury at the word, he lashed out blindly, knocking the decanter from her hand. It burst in a spray of glass and cheap wine, and she cried out as the red soaked through her petticoat.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d she shrieked, and, drawing back her arm, threw the cups at his head. She didn\u2019t hit him, and they clanged and rolled away across the floor. She was turning toward the door, crying out, \u201cNed! Ned!\u201d when he lunged and caught her.</p><p>He only wanted to stop her shrieking, stop her bringing up whatever male enforcement the house employed. He got a hand on her mouth, yanking her back from the door, grappling one-handed to try to control her flailing arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d he kept saying. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014I don\u2019t mean\u2014oh, bloody hell!\u201d She caught him abruptly in the nose with her elbow and he let go, backing away with a hand to his face, blood dripping through his fingers.</p><p>Her face was marked with red where he\u2019d held her, and her eyes were wild. She backed away, scrubbing at her mouth with the back of her hand.</p><p>\u201cGet . . . out!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need telling twice. He rushed past her, shouldered his way past a burly man charging up the stairs, and ran down the alley, realizing only when he reached the street that he was in his shirtsleeves, having left coat and waistcoat behind, and his breeches were undone.</p><p>\u201cEllesmere!\u201d said an appalled voice nearby. He looked up in horror to find himself the cynosure of several English officers, including Alexander Lindsay.</p><p>\u201cGood Christ, Ellesmere, what happened?\u201d Sandy was by way of being a friend and was already pulling a voluminous snowy handkerchief from his sleeve. He clapped this to William\u2019s nose, pinching his nostrils and insisting that he put his head back.</p><p>\u201cHave you been set upon and robbed?\u201d one of the others demanded. \u201cGod! This filthy place!\u201d</p><p>He felt at once comforted by their company\u2014and hideously embarrassed by it. He was not one of them, not any longer.</p><p>\u201cWas it? Was it robbery?\u201d another said, glaring round eagerly. \u201cWe\u2019ll find the bastards who did it, \u2019pon my honor we will! We\u2019ll get your property back and teach whoever did it a lesson!\u201d</p><p>Blood was running down the back of his throat, harsh and iron-tasting, and he coughed but did his best to nod and shrug simultaneously. He had been robbed. But no one was ever going to give him back what he\u2019d lost today.</p><p>UNDER MY PROTECTION</p><p>THE BELL OF THE Presbyterian church two blocks away rang for half-two, and my stomach echoed it, reminding me that\u2014what with one thing and another\u2014I hadn\u2019t had any tea yet.</p><p>Jenny had had a bite with Marsali and the children but declared herself equal to dealing with an egg, if there might be one, so I sent Mrs. Figg to see whether there might, and within twenty minutes we were wallowing\u2014in a genteel fashion\u2014in soft-boiled eggs, fried sardines, and\u2014for lack of cake\u2014flapjacks with butter and honey, which Jenny had never seen before but took to with the greatest alacrity.</p><p>\u201cLook how it soaks up the sweetness!\u201d she exclaimed, pressing the spongy little cake with a fork, then releasing it. \u201cNay like a bannock at all!\u201d She glanced over her shoulder, then leaned toward me, lowering her voice. \u201cD\u2019ye think her in the kitchen might show me the way of it, if I asked?\u201d</p><p>A diffident rapping on the damaged front door interrupted her, and as I turned to look, it was shoved open and a long shadow fell across the painted canvas rug, narrowly preceding its owner. A young British subaltern peered into the parlor, looking disconcerted by the wreckage in the foyer.</p><p>\u201cLieutentant Colonel Grey?\u201d he asked hopefully, glancing back and forth between Jenny and me.</p><p>\u201cHis lordship isn\u2019t in just now,\u201d I said, attempting to sound self-possessed. I wondered just how many more times I might have to say that\u2014and to whom.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The young man looked further disconcerted. \u201cCan you tell me where he is, mum? Colonel Graves sent a message earlier, asking Lieutenant Colonel Grey to attend General Clinton at once, and the general was, er . . . rather wondering why the lieutenant colonel hadn\u2019t arrived yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said, with a sidewise glance at Jenny. \u201cWell. I\u2019m afraid his lordship was rather urgently called away before he received the colonel\u2019s message.\u201d That must have been the paper John had received moments before Jamie\u2019s dramatic reappearance from a watery grave. He\u2019d glanced at it but then shoved it unread into his breeches\u2019 pocket.</p><p>The soldier heaved a small sigh at this but was undaunted.</p><p>\u201cYes, mum. If you\u2019ll tell me where his lordship is, I\u2019ll go fetch him there. I really can\u2019t go back without him, you know.\u201d He gave me a woeful look, though with a touch of a charming smile. I smiled back, with a small touch of panic in my midsection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, but I really don\u2019t know where he is right now,\u201d I said, standing up in hopes of driving him back toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, mum, if you\u2019ll just tell me where he was heading, I shall go there and seek direction,\u201d he said, doggedly standing his ground.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d I took a step toward him, but he didn\u2019t retreat. This was escalating beyond absurdity into something more serious. I\u2019d met General Clinton briefly at the Mischianza ball a few weeks ago\u2014God, had it been only weeks? It seemed whole lifetimes\u2014and while he\u2019d been quite cordial to me, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d receive a nolle prosequi from me with any sort of complaisance. Generals tended to think highly of their own consequence.</p><p>\u201cYou know, his lordship doesn\u2019t hold an active commission,\u201d I said, in the faint hope of putting the young man off. He looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cYes, he does, mum. The colonel sent notice of it with the message this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He can\u2019t do that\u2014er, can he?\u201d I asked, a sudden dread creeping up my backbone.</p><p>\u201cDo what, mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014just tell his lordship that his commission is active?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, mum,\u201d he assured me. \u201cThe colonel of Lieutenant Colonel Grey\u2019s regiment re-called him. The Duke of Pardloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I said, sitting down. Jenny snatched up her napkin to muffle what was plainly a laugh; it had been twenty-five years since she\u2019d heard me say that. I gave her a look, but this was no time to be picking up the threads.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, turning to face the young man again and taking a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d better go with you to see the general.\u201d I got to my feet again and only at this point realized that, having been surprised whilst changing, I was still wearing nothing but my shift and dressing gown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help ye dress,\u201d Jenny said, standing up hurriedly. She gave the soldier a charming smile and gestured at the table, now strewn with toast, marmalade, and a steaming dish of kippers. \u201cHave a bite while ye wait, lad. No point wasting good food.\u201d</p><p>JENNY POKED HER head out into the corridor and listened, but the faint sound of a fork on china and Mrs. Figg\u2019s voice from below indicated that the soldier had accepted her suggestion. She quietly closed the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with ye,\u201d she said. \u201cThe town\u2019s full of soldiers; ye shouldna go out by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d I began, but then stopped, unsure. Most of the British officers in Philadelphia knew me as Lady John Grey, but that didn\u2019t mean that rank-and-file soldiers shared either that knowledge or the sense of respect that it normally engendered. I also felt like an imposter, but that was rather beside the point; it didn\u2019t show.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said abruptly. \u201cI\u2019d be glad of your company.\u201d Unsure as I felt about everything save my conviction that Jamie was coming, I was glad of a little moral support\u2014though I wondered whether I might need to warn Jenny of the need for circumspection when I talked to General Clinton.</p><p>\u201cI shallna say a word myself,\u201d she assured me, grunting slightly as she pulled my laces tight. \u201cD\u2019ye think ye should tell him what\u2019s happened to Lord John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I definitely don\u2019t,\u201d I said, exhaling forcefully. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . tight enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d She was already deep in the armoire, picking through my gowns. \u201cWhat about this one? It\u2019s got a deep d\u00e9colletage, and your bosom\u2019s still verra good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not meaning to seduce the man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, ye are,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cOr at least distract him. If ye\u2019re no going to tell him the truth, I mean.\u201d One sleek black eyebrow lifted. \u201cIf I were a British general and was told that my wee colonel had been abducted by a wicked great Hieland man, I think I might take it amiss.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t really contradict this piece of reasoning and, with a brief shrug, wriggled my way into the amber silk, which had cream-colored piping in the seams and ruched cream ribbons outlining the edge of the bodice.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, that\u2019s good,\u201d Jenny said, tying my laces and stepping back to eye the effect with approval. \u201cThe ribbon\u2019s near the same color as your skin, so the neck looks even lower than it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne would think you\u2019d spent the last thirty years running a dressmaker\u2019s salon or a brothel, rather than a farm,\u201d I remarked, nervousness making me rather cross. She snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got three daughters, nine granddaughters, and there\u2019s sixteen nieces and great-nieces on Ian\u2019s sister\u2019s side. It\u2019s often much the same sort o\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh, and she grinned at me. Then I was blinking back tears, and so was she\u2014the thought of Brianna and of Ian, our lost ones, coming suddenly\u2014and then we were embracing, holding hard to each other to keep grief at bay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she whispered, hugging me fiercely. \u201cYe\u2019ve not lost your lass. She\u2019s still alive. And Ian\u2019s still wi\u2019 me. He\u2019ll never go from my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, choked. \u201cI know.\u201d I let go and straightened up, smudging tears away with a finger, sniffing. \u201cHave you got a handkerchief?\u201d</p><p>She had one in her hand, in fact, but reached into the pocket at her waist and pulled out another, freshly washed and folded, which she handed me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grannie,\u201d she said, and blew her nose vigorously. \u201cI\u2019ve always got a spare hankie. Or three. Now, what about your hair? Ye canna be going out in the street like that.\u201d</p> <p>By the time we\u2019d got my hair done up in something resembling order, corralled in a snood and pinned respectably under a broad-brimmed woven straw hat, I\u2019d come up with at least a rough notion of what to tell General Clinton. Stick to the truth as far as possible. That was the first principle of successful lying, though it had been some time since I\u2019d been last obliged to employ it.</p><p>Well, then. A messenger had come for Lord John\u2014one had\u2014bringing a note\u2014he did. I had no idea what was in the note\u2014totally true. Lord John had then left with the messenger but without telling me where they were going. Also technically true, the only variance being that it had been a different messenger. No, I hadn\u2019t seen in which direction they had gone; no, I didn\u2019t know whether they had walked or ridden\u2014Lord John\u2019s saddle horse was kept at Davison\u2019s livery on Fifth Street, two blocks away.</p><p>That sounded good. If General Clinton chose to make inquiries, I was reasonably sure he\u2019d discover the horse still in its stall and thus conclude that John was somewhere in the city. He would also presumably lose interest in me as a source of information and send soldiers round to whatever haunts a man such as Lord John Grey might be supposed to be visiting.</p><p>And with any luck at all, by the time the general had exhausted such possibilities as Philadelphia offered, John would be back and could answer his own damned questions.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Jamie?\u201d Jenny asked, her face showing small signs of anxiety. \u201cHe\u2019ll not come back into the city, surely?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d I could scarcely draw breath, and not merely because of the tight lacing. I could feel the thudding of my heart against the placket of the stays.</p><p>Jenny gave me a long, considering look, eyes narrowed, and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, ye don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYe think he\u2019ll come straight back here. For you. And ye\u2019re right. He will.\u201d She considered for a moment longer, her brow furrowed. \u201cI\u2019d best stay here,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cShould he come back whilst ye\u2019re wi\u2019 the general, he\u2019ll need to know what\u2019s the state o\u2019 things. And I dinna think I trust her in the kitchen not to stab him wi\u2019 a toasting fork, should he loom up in her doorway without notice.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, all too easily envisioning Mrs. Figg\u2019s response to a sudden Highlander in her midst.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d she added, \u201csomeone\u2019s got to clear up the mess, and I\u2019ve had a good bit o\u2019 practice wi\u2019 that, too.\u201d</p><p>THE YOUNG SOLDIER greeted my belated reappearance with relief and, while not actually seizing my arm and hustling me down the pavement, offered me his own arm and then walked in such a fashion that I was urged into a near trot to keep up with him. It was not far to the mansion where Clinton had made his headquarters, but the day was warm and I arrived moist and gasping, with tendrils of hair escaping from under my straw hat and sticking to my neck and cheeks, and tendrils of sweat snaking their tickling slow way down inside my bodice.</p> <p>My escort delivered me\u2014with an audible sigh of relief\u2014to another soldier in the spacious parquet-floored foyer, and I had a moment to shake the dust from my skirts, straighten and re-pin my hat, and blot my face and neck discreetly with a ladylike lace hankie. I was sufficiently taken up with this that it was a moment before I recognized the man sitting on one of the little gilded chairs on the other side of the foyer.</p><p>\u201cLady John,\u201d he said, standing up when he saw that I had noticed him. \u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d He smiled slightly, though it lent no warmth at all to his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Richardson,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cHow nice.\u201d I didn\u2019t offer my hand and he didn\u2019t bow. There was no point in trying to pretend that we were anything but enemies\u2014and not very cordial ones, either. He\u2019d precipitated my marriage to Lord John by inquiring of John whether he, John, had any personal interest in me, as he, Richardson, was contemplating my immediate arrest on grounds of spying and of passing seditious materials. Both charges were quite true, and while John might not have known that, he took Richardson\u2019s word regarding his intentions, told Richardson politely that, no, there was no personal interest\u2014also true as a statement, so far as it went\u2014and two hours later I was standing in his parlor in a daze of shock and grief, mechanically saying, \u201cI do,\u201d in response to questions that I neither heard nor comprehended.</p><p>I had barely heard Richardson\u2019s name at the time, let alone known him by sight. John had introduced me\u2014with cold formality\u2014when Richardson came up to us at the Mischianza, the huge ball thrown for the British officers by the Loyalist ladies of Philadelphia a month before. And only then had he told me about Richardson\u2019s threats, with a brief admonition to avoid the fellow.</p><p>\u201cAre you waiting to see General Clinton?\u201d I inquired politely. If he was, I had half a mind to execute a quiet sneak through the house and out of the back door whilst he was ensconced with the general.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he replied, adding graciously, \u201cbut you must certainly go before me, Lady John. My business will wait.\u201d</p><p>That had a mildly sinister ring to it, but I merely inclined my head politely, with a noncommittal \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>It was dawning upon me, like an incipient case of indigestion, that my position with regard to the British army in general, and Captain Richardson in particular, was on the verge of a marked reevaluation. Once it became common knowledge that Jamie wasn\u2019t dead\u2014then I was no longer Lady John Grey. I was Mrs. James Fraser again, and while that was certainly cause for ecstatic rejoicing, it also removed any restraint on Captain Richardson\u2019s baser urges.</p> <p>Before I could think of anything useful to say to the man, a lanky young lieutenant appeared to usher me into the general\u2019s presence. The drawing room, which had been converted to Clinton\u2019s main office, was now in a state of organized disarray, with packing crates lining one wall and bare flagstaffs tied together like a bundle of faggots, the military banners they usually sported being folded briskly into tidy packets by a corporal near the window. I\u2019d heard\u2014the whole city had probably heard\u2014that the British army was withdrawing from Philadelphia. Evidently they were doing so with considerable dispatch.</p><p>There were several other soldiers carrying things in and out, but two men were seated, one on either side of the desk.</p><p>\u201cLady John,\u201d Clinton said, looking surprised but rising from his desk and coming to bow over my hand. \u201cYour most obedient servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood day to you, sir,\u201d I said. My heart had already been beating fast; it speeded up considerably at sight of the man who had risen from his chair and was standing just behind the general. He was in uniform and looked strikingly familiar, but I was sure I\u2019d never seen him before. Who\u2014?</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry to have disturbed you, Lady John. I had hoped to surprise your husband,\u201d the general was saying. \u201cBut I understand that he is not at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . no. He\u2019s not.\u201d The stranger\u2014an infantry colonel, though his uniform seemed to sport even more gold lace than the usual\u2014raised a brow at this. The sudden familiarity of the gesture gave me a slight spinning sensation in the head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a relative of Lord John Grey\u2019s,\u201d I blurted, staring at him. He had to be. The man wore his own hair, as John did, though his was dark beneath its powder. The shape of his head\u2014fine-boned and long-skulled\u2014was John\u2019s, and so was the set of his shoulders. His features were much like John\u2019s, too, but his face was deeply weathered and gaunt, marked with harsh lines carved by long duty and the stress of command. I didn\u2019t need the uniform to tell me that he was a lifelong soldier.</p><p>He smiled, and his face was suddenly transformed. Apparently he had John\u2019s charm, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re most perceptive, madam,\u201d he said, and, stepping forward, smoothly took my limp hand away from the general and kissed it briefly in the continental manner before straightening and eyeing me with interest.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Clinton informs me that you are my brother\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, scrambling to recover my mental bearings. \u201cThen you must be Hal! Er . . . I beg your pardon. I mean, you\u2019re the . . . I\u2019m sorry, I know you\u2019re a duke, but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t recall your title, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardloe,\u201d he said, still holding my hand and smiling at me. \u201cBut my Christian name is Harold; do please use it if you like. Welcome to the family, my dear. I had no idea John had married. I understand the event was quite recent?\u201d He spoke with great cordiality, but I was aware of the intense curiosity behind his good manners.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I said noncommittally. \u201cYes, quite recent.\u201d It hadn\u2019t for an instant occurred to me to wonder whether John had written to tell his family about me, and if he had, they could barely have received the letter by now. I didn\u2019t even know who all the members of his family were\u2014though I had heard about Hal, he being the father of John\u2019s nephew Henry, who\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, of course, you\u2019ve come to see Henry!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019ll be so pleased to see you! He\u2019s doing very well,\u201d I assured him.</p><p>\u201cI have already seen Henry,\u201d the duke assured me in turn. \u201cHe speaks with the greatest admiration of your skill in removing pieces of his intestine and reuniting the remnants. Though eager as I naturally was to see my son\u2014and my daughter\u201d\u2014his lips compressed for a moment; apparently Dottie had informed her parents about her engagement\u2014\u201cand delighted as I shall be to meet my brother again, it is actually duty that called me to America. My regiment is newly landed in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cEr . . . how nice.\u201d John plainly hadn\u2019t known that his brother, let alone his regiment, was coming. It occurred dimly to me that I ought to be asking questions and finding out what I could about the general\u2019s plans, but it didn\u2019t seem the time or place.</p><p>The general coughed politely.</p><p>\u201cLady John\u2014do you happen to know the whereabouts of your husband at the moment?\u201d</p><p>The shock of meeting Harold, Duke of Pardloe, had quite wiped the reason for my presence out of my mind, but this brought it back with a rush.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t,\u201d I said, as calmly as possible. \u201cI told your corporal. A messenger came a few hours ago, with a note, and Lord John went off with him. He didn\u2019t say where he was going, though.\u201d</p><p>The general\u2019s lips twitched.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d he said, still polite, \u201che didn\u2019t. Colonel Graves sent the messenger, with a note informing Lord John of his re-commission and directing him to come here at once. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, sounding as blank as I felt. Under the circumstances, it seemed all right to let that show, and I did. \u201cDear me. In that case . . . he did go off with someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know with whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see him go,\u201d I said, neatly avoiding the question. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he didn\u2019t leave word as to where he was bound.\u201d</p><p>Clinton raised a strongly marked black brow and glanced at Pardloe.</p><p>\u201cI suppose in that case he will return shortly,\u201d the duke said with a shrug. \u201cThe matter isn\u2019t urgent, after all.\u201d</p><p>General Clinton looked as though he differed somewhat with this opinion but, with a brief glance at me, said nothing. He clearly had little time to waste, though, and, bowing politely, bade me good day.</p><p>I took my leave with alacrity, barely pausing to assure the duke that I was pleased to have met him and to ask where might his brother send word . . . ?</p><p>\u201cI have rooms at the King\u2019s Arms,\u201d Pardloe said. \u201cShall I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I said hurriedly, to forestall his offer to see me home. \u201cIt\u2019s quite all right. Thank you, sir.\u201d I bowed to the general, then to Hal, and headed for the door in a whirl of skirts\u2014and emotions.</p><p>Captain Richardson was no longer in the foyer, but I hadn\u2019t time to wonder where he had gone. I gave the soldier at the door a quick nod and smile and then was out in the open air, breathing as though I\u2019d just escaped from a bathysphere.</p><p>Now what? I wondered, swerving to avoid two little boys with a hoop, who were caroming down the street, bouncing off the legs of the soldiers carrying parcels and furniture to a large wagon. The boys must belong to one of Clinton\u2019s officers, since the soldiers were tolerating them.</p><p>John had spoken fairly often of his brother and had remarked upon Hal\u2019s tendency toward ruthless high-handedness. All the current situation needed was a nosey parker with a taste for authority mixing in. I wondered briefly whether William was on good terms with his uncle; if so, perhaps Hal could be diverted and put to good use in talking sense to\u2014no, no, of course not. Hal mustn\u2019t know\u2014yet at least\u2014about Jamie, and he couldn\u2019t exchange two words with Willie without finding out\u2014if William would talk about it, but then\u2014</p><p>\u201cLady John.\u201d A voice behind me stopped me in my tracks, only momentarily but long enough for the Duke of Pardloe to come up beside me. He took me by the arm, detaining me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very bad liar,\u201d he remarked with interest. \u201cWhat are you lying about, though, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do it better with a little warning,\u201d I snapped. \u201cThough, as it happens, I\u2019m not lying at the moment.\u201d</p><p>That made him laugh. He leaned closer, examining my face at close range. His eyes were pale blue, like John\u2019s, but the darkness of his brows and lashes gave them a particularly piercing quality.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he said, still looking amused. \u201cBut if you aren\u2019t lying, you aren\u2019t telling me everything you know, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not obliged to tell you anything I know,\u201d I said with dignity, trying to retrieve my arm. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>He did let go, reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Lady John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d I said shortly, and made to go round him. He moved smartly in front of me, blocking my way.</p><p>\u201cI want to know where my brother is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI should like to know that myself,\u201d I replied, trying to sidle past him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d It gave me an odd feeling, still, to call Lord John\u2019s house \u201chome\u201d\u2014and yet I had no other. Yes, you do, a small, clear voice said in my heart. You have Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d asked Pardloe, sounding startled.</p><p>\u201cAt the thought of getting home and taking off these shoes,\u201d I said, hastily erasing the smile. \u201cThey\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched a little.</p> <p>\u201cAllow me to offer you the use of my chair, Lady John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I really don\u2019t\u2014\u201d But he had taken a wooden whistle from his pocket and uttered a piercing blast on it that brought two squat, muscular men\u2014who had to be brothers, such was their resemblance to each other\u2014trotting round the corner, a sedan chair suspended on poles between them.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, this isn\u2019t necessary at all,\u201d I protested. \u201cBesides, John says you suffer from the gout; you\u2019ll need the chair yourself.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that; his eyes narrowed and his lips compressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage, madam,\u201d he said shortly, and, seizing me by the arm again, dragged me to the chair and pushed me inside, knocking my hat over my eyes as he did so. \u201cThe lady is under my protection. Take her to the King\u2019s Arms,\u201d he instructed Tweedledum and Tweedledee, shutting the door. And before I could say, \u201cOff with his head!\u201d we were jolting down the High Street at a terrific pace.</p><p>I seized the door handle, intending to leap out, even at the cost of cuts and bruises, but the bastard had put the locking pin through the outside handle, and I couldn\u2019t reach it from the inside. I shouted at the chairmen to stop, but they ignored me completely, pounding along the cobbles as though bringing the news from Aix to Ghent.</p><p>I sat back, panting and furious, and jerked the hat off. What did Pardloe think he was doing? From what John had said, and from other remarks made by the duke\u2019s children about their father, it was clear to me that he was used to getting his own way.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll bloody see about that,\u201d I muttered, stabbing the long, pearl-headed hatpin through the hat brim. The snood that had contained my hair had come off with the hat; I crammed it inside and shook my loose hair out over my shoulders.</p> <p>We turned in to Fourth Street, which was paved with brick rather than cobbles, and the jolting grew less. I was able to let go my grip on the seat and fumbled with the window. If I could get it open, I might be able to reach the locking pin, and even if the door flew open and decanted me into the street, it would put a stop to the duke\u2019s machinations.</p><p>The window worked on a sliding-panel arrangement but had no sort of latch by which to get a grip on it; the only way of opening it was by inserting the fingertips into a shallow groove at one side and pushing. I was grimly attempting to do this, in spite of the chair\u2019s renewed bucketing, when I heard the duke\u2019s voice choke and stop in the midst of some shouted direction to the chairmen.</p><p>\u201cSt . . . stop. I . . . can\u2019t . . .\u201d His words trailed off, the chairmen faltered to a halt, and I pressed my face against the suddenly motionless window. The duke was standing in the middle of the street, a fist pressed into his waistcoat, struggling to breathe. His face was deeply flushed, but his lips were tinged with blue.</p><p>\u201cPut me down and open this bloody door this instant!\u201d I bellowed through the glass to one of the chairmen, who was glancing back over his shoulder, a look of concern on his face. They did, and I emerged from the chair in an explosion of skirts, stabbing the hatpin down into the placket of my stays as I did so. I might need it yet.</p><p>\u201cBloody sit down,\u201d I said, reaching Pardloe. He shook his head but let me lead him to the chair, where I forced him to sit, my feeling of satisfaction at this reversal of position somewhat tempered by the fear that he might just possibly be about to die.</p><p>My first thought\u2014that he was having a heart attack\u2014had vanished the moment I heard him breathe\u2014or try to. The wheezing gasp of someone in the throes of an asthmatic attack was unmistakable, but I seized his wrist and checked his pulse just in case. Hammering but steady, and while he was sweating, it was the normal warm perspiration caused by hot weather rather than the sudden clammy exudation that often accompanied a myocardial infarction.</p><p>I touched his fist, still embedded in his midsection.</p><p>\u201cDo you have pain here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, coughed hard, and took his hand away.</p><p>\u201cNeed . . . pill . . . b . . .\u201d he managed, and I saw that there was a small pocket in the waistcoat that he had been trying to reach into. I put in two fingers and pulled out a small enameled box, which proved to contain a tiny corked vial.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014never mind.\u201d I pulled the cork, sniffed, and wheezed myself as the sudden fumes of ammonia shot up my nose.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said definitely, putting the cork back in and shoving vial and box into my pocket. \u201cThat won\u2019t help. Purse your lips and blow out.\u201d His eyes bulged a bit, but he did it; I could feel the slight movement of air on my own perspiring face.</p><p>\u201cRight. Now, relax, don\u2019t gasp for air, just let it come. Blow out, to the count of four. One . . . two . . . three . . . four. In for a count of two, same rhythm . . . yes. Blow out, count of four . . . let it come in, count of two . . . yes, good. Now, don\u2019t worry; you aren\u2019t going to suffocate, you can keep doing that all day.\u201d I smiled encouragingly at him, and he managed to nod. I straightened up and looked round; we were near Locust Street, and Peterman\u2019s ordinary was no more than a block away.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d I said to one of the chairmen, \u201crun to the ordinary and fetch back a jug of strong coffee. He\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d I added, with a flip of the hand toward the duke.</p><p>We were beginning to draw a crowd. I kept a wary eye out; we were near enough to Dr. Hebdy\u2019s surgery that he might come out to see the trouble, and the very last thing I needed was that charlatan to materialize, fleam at the ready.</p><p>\u201cYou have asthma,\u201d I said, returning my attention to the duke. I knelt so that I could see into his face while I monitored his pulse. It was better, noticeably slower, but I thought I could feel the odd condition called \u201cparadoxical pulse,\u201d a phenomenon you sometimes saw in asthmatics, wherein the heart rate speeded up during exhalation and dropped during inhalation. Not that I had been in any doubt. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, still pursing his lips and blowing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he managed briefly, before breathing in again.</p><p>\u201cDo you see a doctor for it?\u201d A nod. \u201cAnd did he actually recommend sal volatile for it?\u201d I gestured toward the vial in my pocket. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cFor fain . . . ting,\u201d he managed. \u201cAll I . . . had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I put a hand under his chin and tilted his head back, examining his pupils, which were quite normal. I could feel the spasm easing, and so could he; his shoulders were beginning to drop, and the blue tinge had faded from his lips. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to use it when you\u2019re having an asthma attack; the coughing and tearing will make matters worse by producing phlegm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever are the idle lot of you doing, standing about? Go run and fetch the doctor, lad!\u201d I heard a woman\u2019s sharp voice say in the crowd behind me. I grimaced, and the duke saw it; he raised his brows in question.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that doctor, believe me.\u201d I stood up and faced the crowd, thinking.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t need a doctor, thank you very much,\u201d I said, as charmingly as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s just been overtaken by the indigestion\u2014something he ate. He\u2019s quite all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe don\u2019t look that good to me, ma\u2019am,\u201d said another voice, doubtful. \u201cI think we best fetch the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him die!\u201d came a shout from the back of the gathering crowd. \u201cFucking lobster!\u201d</p><p>An odd sort of shimmer ran through the crowd at this, and I felt a knot of dread form in my stomach. They hadn\u2019t been thinking of him as a British soldier, merely as a spectacle. But now . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the doctor, Lady John!\u201d To my horror, Mr. Caulfield, a prominent Tory, had forced his way to the front, being tolerably free with his gold-headed walking stick. \u201cGet away, you lice!\u201d</p><p>He bent to peer into the sedan chair, lifting his hat to Hal.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, sir. Help will be here presently, be assured of that!\u201d</p><p>I seized him by the sleeve. The crowd was, thank God, divided. While there were catcalls and insults directed at Pardloe and at me, there were dissenting voices, too, those of Loyalists (or perhaps merely the saner sorts who didn\u2019t think attacking a sick man in the street part of their political philosophy) chiming in, with reason, protests\u2014and not a few loud insults of their own.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d I said. \u201cLet someone else go for the doctor, please. We daren\u2019t leave His Grace here without protection!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace?\u201d Caulfield blinked, and carefully unfolding his gold-rimmed pince-nez from a little case, put them on his nose and bent to peer into the chair at Pardloe, who gave him a small, dignified nod, though he kept on assiduously with his breathing exercise.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Pardloe,\u201d I said hastily, still keeping a grip of Mr. Caulfield\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYour Grace, may I present Mr. Phineas Graham Caulfield?\u201d I waved a vague hand between them, then, spotting the chairman coming back at the gallop with a jug, I sprinted toward him, hoping to reach him before he got within earshot of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, panting as I snatched the jug from him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him away before the crowd turns nasty\u2014nastier,\u201d I amended, hearing a sharp crack! as a thrown pebble bounced off the roof of the sedan chair. Mr. Caulfield ducked.</p><p>\u201cOy!\u201d shouted the chairman, infuriated at this attack upon his livelihood. \u201cBack off, you lot!\u201d He started for the crowd, fists clenched, and I seized him by the coattails with my free hand.</p><p>\u201cGet him\u2014and your chair\u2014away!\u201d I said, as forcefully as possible. \u201cTake him to\u2014to\u2014\u201d Not the King\u2019s Arms; it was a known Loyalist stronghold and would merely inflame anyone who followed us. Neither did I want to be at the duke\u2019s mercy, once inside the place.</p><p>\u201cTake us to Number Seventeen Chestnut Street!\u201d I said hurriedly, and, digging one-handed in my pocket, grabbed a coin and thrust it into his hand. \u201cNow!\u201d He didn\u2019t pause for thought but took the coin and headed for the chair at the run, fists still clenched, and I trotted after him as fast as my red morocco heels would take me, clutching the coffee. His number was stitched into a band round his sleeve: THIRTY-NINE.</p><p>A shower of pebbles was rattling off the sedan chair\u2019s sides, and the second chairman\u2014Number Forty\u2014was batting at them as though they were a swarm of bees, shouting, \u201cFuck OFF!\u201d at the crowd, in a businesslike if repetitious fashion. Mr. Caulfield was backing him up in more genteel fashion, shouting, \u201cAway with you!\u201d and \u201cLeave off at once!\u201d punctuated with pokes of his cane at the more daring children, who were darting forward to see the fun.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I gasped, leaning into the chair. Hal was still alive, still breathing. He raised one brow at me and nodded toward the crowd outside. I shook my head and thrust the coffee into his hands.</p><p>\u201cDrink . . . that,\u201d I managed, \u201cand keep breathing.\u201d Slamming the door of the chair, I dropped the locking pin into its slot with an instant\u2019s satisfaction and straightened up to find Fergus\u2019s eldest son, Germain, standing by my side.</p><p>\u201cHave ye got a bit of trouble started again, Grand-m\u00e8re?\u201d he asked, unperturbed by the stones\u2014now augmented with clumps of fresh manure\u2014whizzing past our heads.</p><p>\u201cYou might say so, yes,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>But before I could speak further, he turned round and bellowed at the crowd, in a surprisingly loud voice, \u201cTHIS\u2019S MY GRANNIE. You touch ONE HAIR on her head and\u2014\u201d Several people in the crowd laughed at this, and I put up a hand to my head. I\u2019d completely forgotten the loss of my hat, and my hair was standing out in a mushroom-like cloud round my head\u2014what wasn\u2019t sticking to my sweating face and neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll do you BROWN!\u201d Germain yelled. \u201cAye, I mean YOU, Shecky Loew! And you, too, Joe Grume!\u201d</p><p>Two half-grown boys hesitated, clumps of filth in hand. Evidently they knew Germain.</p><p>\u201cAnd my grannie\u2019ll tell your da what you\u2019ve been a-doing, too!\u201d That decided the boys, who stepped back a pace, dropping their clods of dirt and trying to look as though they had no idea where they had come from.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Grand-m\u00e8re,\u201d Germain said, grabbing my hand. The chairmen, no slouches on the uptake, had already seized their poles and hoisted the chair. I\u2019d never manage to keep up with them in the high-heeled shoes. As I was kicking them off, I saw plump Dr. Hebdy puffing down the street, in the wake of the hectoring woman who had suggested calling him and who was now sailing toward us on the breeze of her heroism, face set in triumph. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you, Mr. Caulfield,\u201d I said hurriedly, and, snatching up the shoes in one hand, followed the chair, unable to keep my skirts up off the grubby cobbles but not terribly concerned about that. Germain fell back a little, making threatening gestures to discourage pursuit, but I could tell from the sound of the crowd that their momentary hostility had turned to amusement, and though further catcalls followed us, no missiles came in their wake.</p><p>The chairmen slowed a little once we\u2019d turned the corner, and I was able to make headway on the flat brick of Chestnut Street, coming up beside the chair. Hal was peering through the side window, looking considerably better. The coffee jug was on the seat beside him, evidently empty.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we . . . going, madam?\u201d he shouted through the window when he saw me. So far as I could tell over the steady thump of the chairmen\u2019s shoes and through the glass of the window, he sounded much better, too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Grace,\u201d I shouted back, jogging along. \u201cYou\u2019re under my protection!\u201d</p> <p>THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF ILL-CONSIDERED ACTIONS</p><p>JAMIE SHOVED THROUGH the brush, heedless of ripping brambles and slapping branches. Anything that got in his way could get out of it or be trampled.</p><p>He hesitated for no more than an instant when he reached the two horses, hobbled and grazing. He untied them both and, slapping the mare, sent her snorting into the brush. Even if no one made off with the extra horse before the militia let John Grey go, Jamie didn\u2019t mean to make it easy for the man to get back to Philadelphia. Whatever must be dealt with there would be done much more easily without the complications of his lordship\u2019s presence.</p><p>And what would be done? he wondered, nudging his heels into his horse\u2019s sides and reining its head round toward the road. He noticed with some surprise that his hands were shaking, and squeezed hard on the leather to make it stop.</p><p>The knuckles of his right hand throbbed, and a white stab of pain where his missing finger had been ran through his hand, making him hiss through his teeth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the devil did ye tell me for, ye wee idiot?\u201d he said under his breath, urging his horse up into a gallop. \u201cWhat did ye think I\u2019d do?\u201d</p><p>Just what ye damn well did was the answer. John hadn\u2019t resisted, hadn\u2019t fought back. \u201cGo ahead and kill me,\u201d the wee bugger had said. A fresh spurt of rage curled Jamie\u2019s hands as he imagined all too well doing just that. Would he have gone ahead and done it, if that pissant Woodbine and his militia hadn\u2019t turned up?</p><p>No. No, he wouldn\u2019t. Even as he longed momentarily to go back and choke the life out of Grey, he was beginning to answer his own question, reason fighting its way through the haze of fury. Why had Grey told him? There was the obvious\u2014the reason he\u2019d hit the man by sheer reflex, the reason he was shaking now. Because Grey had told him the truth.</p><p>\u201cWe were both f**king you.\u201d He breathed hard and deep, fast enough to make him giddy, but it stopped the shaking and he slowed a little; his horse\u2019s ears were laid back, twitching in agitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, a bhalaich,\u201d he said, still breathing hard but slower now. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment that he might vomit, but managed not to, and settled back in the saddle, steadier.</p> <p>He could still touch it, that raw place Jack Randall had left on his soul. He\u2019d thought it so well scarred over that he was safe now, but, no, bloody John Grey had torn it open with five words. \u201cWe were both f**king you.\u201d And he couldn\u2019t blame him for it\u2014oughtn\u2019t to, anyway, he thought, reason doggedly fighting back the fury, though he knew only too well how weak a weapon reason was against that specter. Grey couldn\u2019t have known what those words had done to him.</p><p>Reason had its uses, though. It was reason that reminded him of the second blow. The first had been blind reflex; the second wasn\u2019t. Thought of it brought anger, too, and pain, but of a different sort.</p><p>\u201cI have had carnal knowledge of your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bugger,\u201d he whispered, clutching the reins with a reflexive violence that made the horse jerk its head, startled. \u201cWhy? Why did ye tell me that, ye bugger!\u201d</p><p>And the second answer came belatedly, but as clearly as the first: Because she\u2019d tell me, the minute she had a chance. And he kent that fine. He thought if I\u2019d do violence when I heard, best I do it to him.</p><p>Aye, she would have told him. He swallowed. And she will tell me. What might he say\u2014or do\u2014when she did?</p><p>He was trembling again and had slowed inadvertently, so the horse was nearly at a walk, head turning from side to side as it snuffed the air.</p><p>It\u2019s nay her fault. I know that. It\u2019s nay her fault. They\u2019d thought him dead. He knew what that abyss looked like; he\u2019d lived there for a long while. And he understood what desperation and strong drink could do. But the vision\u2014or the lack of one . . . How did it happen? Where? Knowing it had happened was bad enough; not knowing the how and the why of it from her was almost unbearable.</p> <p>The horse had stopped; the reins hung slack. Jamie was sitting in the middle of the road, eyes closed, just breathing, trying not to imagine, trying to pray.</p><p>Reason had limits; prayer didn\u2019t. It took a little while for his mind to relax its grip, its wicked curiosity, its lust to know. But, after a bit, he felt he could go on and gathered up the reins again.</p><p>All that could wait. But he needed to see Claire before he did anything else. Just now he had no idea what he would say\u2014or do\u2014when he saw her, but he needed to see her, with the same sort of need that a man might feel who\u2019d been cast away at sea, marooned without food or water for weeks on end.</p><p>JOHN GREY\u2019S BLOOD was thrumming in his ears so loudly that he barely heard the discussion among his captors, who\u2014having taken the elementary precautions of searching him and tying his hands together in front of him\u2014had gathered into a knot a few yards away and were heatedly hissing at one another like geese in a barnyard, casting occasional hostile glares in his direction.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care. He couldn\u2019t see out of his left eye and he was by now quite certain that his liver was ruptured, but he didn\u2019t care about that, either. He\u2019d told Jamie Fraser the truth\u2014the whole bloody truth\u2014and felt the same fierce constellation of feelings that attends victory in battle: the bone-deep relief of being alive, the giddy surge of emotion that carries you on a wave much like drunkenness, then ebbs and leaves you staggering light-headed on the beach\u2014and an absolute inability to count the cost \u2019til later.</p><p>His knees experienced much the same post-battle sensations and gave way. He sat down unceremoniously in the leaves and closed his good eye.</p><p>After a short interval in which he was aware of nothing much beyond the gradual slowing of his heart, the thrumming noise in his ears began to abate, and he noticed that someone was calling his name.</p><p>\u201cLord Grey!\u201d the voice said again, louder, and close enough that he felt a warmly fetid gust of tobacco-laden breath on his face.</p><p>\u201cMy name is not Lord Grey,\u201d he said, rather crossly, opening his eye. \u201cI told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were Lord John Grey,\u201d his interlocutor said, frowning through a mat of grizzled facial hair. It was the large man in the filthy hunting shirt who had first discovered him with Fraser.</p><p>\u201cI am. If you bloody have to talk to me, call me \u2018my lord,\u2019 or just \u2018sir,\u2019 if you like. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>The man reared back a little, looking indignant.</p><p>\u201cWell, since you ask . . . sir, first off, we want to know if this elder brother of yours is Major General Charles Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d The man\u2019s unkempt eyebrows drew together. \u201cDo you know Major General Charles Grey? Is he kin to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. He\u2019s . . .\u201d Grey tried to calculate the precise degree, but gave it up and flapped a hand. \u201cCousin of some sort.\u201d</p><p>There was a satisfied rumble from the faces now peering down at him. The man called Woodbine squatted down next to him, a square of folded paper in his hand.</p><p>\u201cLord John,\u201d he said, more or less politely. \u201cYou said that you don\u2019t hold an active commission in His Majesty\u2019s army at present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Grey fought back a sudden unexpected urge to yawn. The excitement in his blood had died away now and he wanted to lie down.</p><p>\u201cThen would you care to explain these documents, my lord? We found them in your breeches.\u201d He unfolded the papers carefully and held them under Grey\u2019s nose.</p><p>John peered at them with his working eye. The note on top was from General Clinton\u2019s adjutant: a brief request for Grey to attend upon the general at his earliest convenience. Yes, he\u2019d seen that, though he\u2019d barely glanced at it before the cataclysmic arrival of Jamie Fraser, risen from the dead, had driven it from his mind. Despite what had occurred in the meantime, he couldn\u2019t help smiling. Alive. The bloody man was alive!</p><p>Then Woodbine took the note away, revealing the paper beneath: the document that had come attached to Clinton\u2019s note. It was a small piece of paper, bearing a red wax seal and instantly identifiable; it was an officer\u2019s warrant, his proof of commission, to be carried on his person at all times. Grey blinked at it in simple disbelief, the spidery clerk\u2019s writing wavering before his eyes. But written at the bottom, below the King\u2019s signature, was another, this one executed in a bold, black, all-too-recognizable scrawl.</p><p>\u201cHal!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTOLD YOU HE was a soldier,\u201d the small man with the cracked spectacles said, eyeing Grey from under the edge of his knitted KILL! hat with an avidity that Grey found very objectionable. \u201cNot just a soldier, neither; he\u2019s a spy! Why, we could hang him out o\u2019 hand, this very minute!\u201d</p><p>There was an outburst of noticeable enthusiasm for this course of action, quelled with some difficulty by Corporal Woodbine, who stood up and shouted louder than the proponents of immediate execution, until those espousing it reluctantly fell back, muttering. Grey sat clutching the commission crumpled in his bound hands, heart hammering.</p><p>They bloody could hang him. Howe had done just that to a Continental captain named Hale, not two years before, when Hale was caught gathering intelligence while dressed as a civilian, and the Rebels would like nothing better than a chance to retaliate. William had been present, both at Hale\u2019s arrest and his execution, and had given Grey a brief account of the matter, shocking in its starkness.</p><p>William. Jesus, William! Caught up in the immediacy of the situation, Grey had had barely a thought to spare for his son. He and Fraser had absquatulated onto the roof and down a drainpipe, leaving William, clearly reeling with the shock of revelation, alone in the upstairs hallway.</p><p>No. No, not alone. Claire had been there, and the thought of her steadied him a bit. She would have been able to talk to Willie, calm him, explain . . . well, possibly not explain, and possibly not calm, either\u2014but at least if Grey was hanged in the next few minutes, William wouldn\u2019t be left to face things entirely alone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking him back to camp,\u201d Woodbine was saying doggedly, not for the first time. \u201cWhat good would it do to hang him here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne less redcoat? Seems like a good thing to me!\u201d riposted the burly thug in the hunting shirt.</p><p>\u201cNow, Gershon, I\u2019m not saying as how we shouldn\u2019t hang him. I said, not here and now.\u201d Woodbine, musket held in both hands, looked slowly round the circle of men, fixing each one with his gaze. \u201cNot here, not now,\u201d he repeated. Grey admired Woodbine\u2019s force of character and narrowly kept himself from nodding agreement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking him back to camp. You all heard what he said; Major General Charles Grey\u2019s kin to him. Might be as Colonel Smith will want to hang him in camp\u2014or might even be as he\u2019ll want to send this man to General Wayne. Remember Paoli!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Paoli!\u201d Ragged cries echoed the call, and Grey rubbed at his swollen eye with his sleeve\u2014tears were leaking from it and irritating his face. Paoli? What the devil was Paoli? And what had it to do with whether, when, or how he should be hanged? He decided not to ask at just this moment and, when they hauled him to his feet, went along with them without complaint.</p><p>HOMO EST OBLIGAMUS AEROBE (\u201cMAN IS AN OBLIGATE AEROBE\u201d)\u2014HIPPOCRATES</p><p>THE DUKE\u2019S FACE WAS dangerously flushed when Number Thirty-Nine ceremoniously opened the sedan chair\u2019s door, and not, I thought, from the heat.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see your brother, did you not?\u201d I inquired, before he could gather enough breath to say any of the things on his mind. I gestured toward the house. \u201cThis is his house.\u201d The fact that John was not presently in the house could wait.</p><p>He gave me a marked look, but he was still short of breath and wisely saved it, irritably waving off Number Forty\u2019s helping hand as he struggled out of the sedan chair. He did pay the chairmen\u2014rather fortunate, as I hadn\u2019t any more money with me\u2014and, wheezing, bowed and offered me his arm. I took it, not wanting him to fall on his face in the front garden. Germain, who had kept up with the chair without noticeable effort, followed at a tactful distance.</p><p>Mrs. Figg was standing in the front doorway, watching our approach with interest. The broken door was now lying on a pair of trestles next to a camellia bush, having been removed from its hinges, and was presumably awaiting some sort of professional attention.</p><p>\u201cMay I present Mrs. Mortimer Figg, Your Grace?\u201d I said politely, with a nod in her direction. \u201cMrs. Figg is his lordship\u2019s cook and housekeeper. Mrs. Figg, this is His Grace, the Duke of Pardloe. Lord John\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>I saw her lips form the words \u201cMerde on toast,\u201d but fortunately without sound. She moved nimbly down the steps despite her bulk and took Hal by the other arm, shoring him up, as he was beginning to turn blue again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPurse your lips and blow,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cNow!\u201d He made an ugly choking noise but did start blowing, though making evil grimaces in my direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of the everlasting Holy Ghost did you do to him?\u201d Mrs. Figg asked me accusingly. \u201cSounds like he\u2019s about to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved his life, to start with,\u201d I snapped. \u201cUps-a-daisy, Your Grace!\u201d and between us we hoicked him up the steps. \u201cThen I saved him from being stoned and beaten by a mob\u2014with Germain\u2019s invaluable help,\u201d I added, glancing back at Germain, who grinned hugely. I was also in the act of abducting him, but I thought we needn\u2019t go into that.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m about to save his life again, I think,\u201d I said, pausing on the porch to pant for a moment myself. \u201cHave we a bedroom we can put him in? William\u2019s, perhaps?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill\u2014\u201d the duke began, but then started to cough spasmodically, going a nasty shade of puce. \u201cWh\u2014wh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was forgetting,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course, William\u2019s your nephew, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s not here just now.\u201d I looked narrowly at Mrs. Figg, who snorted briefly but said nothing. \u201cBlow, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I saw that some progress had been made toward restoring order. The debris had been swept into a neat pile by the open doorway, and Jenny Murray was sitting on an ottoman beside it, picking unbroken crystals from the fallen chandelier out of the rubbish and dropping them into a bowl. She lifted an eyebrow at me but rose unhurriedly to her feet, putting the bowl aside.</p><p>\u201cWhat d\u2019ye need, Claire?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBoiling water,\u201d I said, grunting slightly as we maneuvered Pardloe\u2014he was lean and fine-boned, like John, but a solid man, nonetheless\u2014into a wing chair. \u201cMrs. Figg? Cups, several cups, and, Jenny, my medicine chest. Don\u2019t lose your rhythm, Your Grace\u2014blow . . . two . . . three . . . four\u2014don\u2019t gasp. Sip the air\u2014you\u2019ll get enough, I promise.\u201d Hal\u2019s face was twitching, shining with sweat, and while he still had control over himself, I could see panic creasing the lines around his eyes as his airways closed.</p> <p>I fought down a similar sense of panic; it wouldn\u2019t serve either of us. The fact was that he could die. He was having a severe asthmatic attack, and even with access to epinephrine injections and the facilities of a major hospital, people did die in such circumstances, whether of a heart attack brought on by stress and lack of oxygen or from simple suffocation.</p><p>His hands were clenched on his knees, the moleskin breeches crumpled and dark with sweat, and the cords of his neck stood out with strain. With some difficulty, I pried one of his hands loose and grasped it strongly in mine; I had to distract him from the panic darkening his mind, if he was to have any chance at all.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I said, leaning close and looking straight into his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right. Do you hear me? Nod if you can hear me.\u201d</p><p>He managed a short nod. He was blowing, but too fast; no more than a wisp of air touched my cheek. I squeezed his hand.</p><p>\u201cSlower,\u201d I said, my voice as calm as I could make it. \u201cBreathe with me, now. Purse your lips . . . blow . . .\u201d I tapped out a regular count of four on his knee with my free hand, as slow as I dared. He ran out of air between two and three but kept his lips pursed, straining.</p><p>\u201cSlow!\u201d I said sharply as his mouth opened, gasping, starving for air. \u201cLet it come by itself; one . . . two . . . blow!\u201d I could hear Jenny hurrying down the stairs with my medicine chest. Mrs. Figg had departed like a great rushing wind in the direction of the cookhouse, where she kept a cauldron boiling\u2014yes, here she came, three teacups looped over the fingers of one hand, a can of hot water wrapped in a towel clutched to her bosom with the other.</p> <p>\u201c. . . three . . . four\u2014joint fir, Jenny\u2014one . . . two . . . blow out, two . . . three . . . four\u2014a good handful in each cup\u2014two, yes, that\u2019s it . . . blow . . .\u201d Still holding his gaze, willing him to blow\u2014it was all that was keeping his airways open. If he lost his rhythm, he\u2019d lose what little air pressure he had, the airways would collapse, and then\u2014I shoved the thought aside, squeezing his hand as hard as I could, and gave disjoint directions between chanting the rhythm. Joint fir . . . what the bloody hell else did I have?</p><p>Not much, was the answer. Bowman\u2019s root, jimsonweed\u2014much too dangerously toxic, and not fast enough. \u201cSpikenard, Jenny,\u201d I said abruptly. \u201cThe root\u2014grind it.\u201d I pointed at the second cup, then the third. \u201c. . . two . . . three . . . four . . .\u201d A large handful of crumbled joint fir (aptly named; it looked like a pile of miniature sticks) had been placed in each cup and was already steeping. I\u2019d give him the first as soon as it had cooled enough to drink, but it took a good half hour of steeping to get a truly effective concentration. \u201cMore cups, please, Mrs. Figg\u2014in, one . . . two . . . that\u2019s good . . .\u201d</p><p>The hand in mine was slick with sweat, but he was gripping me with all the strength he had; I could feel my bones grind, and twisted my hand a bit to ease them. He saw and released the pressure a little. I leaned in, cradling his hand in both of mine\u2014not incidentally taking the opportunity to get my fingers on his pulse.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to die,\u201d I said to him, quietly but as forcefully as I could. \u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d The flicker of something much too faint to be a smile passed behind those winter-sharp blue eyes, but he hadn\u2019t enough breath even to think of speaking. His lips were still blue and his face paper-white, in spite of the temperature.</p><p>The first cup of joint-fir tea helped briefly, the heat and moisture doing as much as the herb; joint fir did contain epinephrine and was the only really good treatment for asthma I had available\u2014but there wasn\u2019t enough of the active principle in a cup of the stuff after only ten minutes\u2019 brewing. Even the momentary sense of relief steadied him, though. His hand turned, fingers linking with mine, and he squeezed back.</p><p>A fighter. I knew one when I saw one and smiled involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cStart three more cups, please, Jenny?\u201d If he drank them slowly\u2014and he couldn\u2019t do more than sip briefly between gasps\u2014and continuously, we should have got a decent amount of stimulant into him by the end of the sixth, most-concentrated cup. \u201cAnd, Mrs. Figg, if you would boil three handfuls of the joint fir and half that of spikenard in a pint of coffee for a quarter hour, then let it steep?\u201d If he wasn\u2019t going to die, I wanted a concentrated tincture of Ephedra easily on hand; this obviously wasn\u2019t his first attack, and\u2014if it wasn\u2019t his last\u2014there\u2019d be another sometime. And quite possibly sometime soon.</p><p>The back of my mind had been ticking through diagnostic possibilities, and now that I was fairly sure he was going to survive the moment, I could spare time to think about them consciously.</p> <p>Sweat was pouring down the fine-cut bones of his face; I\u2019d got his coat, waistcoat, and leather stock off first thing, and his shirtfront was pasted to his chest, his breeches black-wet in the creases of his groin. No wonder, though, between the heat of the day, his exertions, and the hot tea. The blue tinge was fading from his lips, and there was no sign of edema in face or hands . . . no distention of the blood vessels in his neck, in spite of his effort.</p><p>I could hear the crackling rales in his lungs easily without a stethoscope, but he showed no thoracic enlargement; his torso was as trim as John\u2019s, a bit narrower through the chest. Probably not a chronic obstructive pulmonary condition, then . . . and I didn\u2019t think he had congestive heart failure. His color when I met him had been good, and his pulse was presently thumping against my fingers very steadily, fast, but no flutters, no arrhythmia . . .</p><p>I became aware of Germain hovering by my elbow, staring interestedly at the duke, who was now sufficiently himself as to lift an eyebrow in the boy\u2019s direction, though still unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d I said, before resuming my now-automatic counting of breaths.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only thinking, Grand-m\u00e8re, as how himself there\u201d\u2014Germain nodded at Pardloe\u2014\u201cmight be missed. Had I maybe best carry a message to someone, so as they aren\u2019t sending out soldiers after him? The chairmen will talk, will they not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d That was a thought, all right. General Clinton, for one, certainly knew that Pardloe was in my company when last seen. I had no idea with whom Pardloe might be traveling or whether he was in command of his regiment. If he was, people would be looking for him right now; an officer couldn\u2019t be gone from his place for long without someone noticing.</p><p>And Germain\u2014an observant lad, if ever there was one\u2014was right about the chairmen. Their numbers meant they were registered with the central chairmen\u2019s agency in Philadelphia; it would be the work of a moment for the general\u2019s staff to locate numbers Thirty-Nine and Forty and find out where they\u2019d delivered the Duke of Pardloe.</p><p>Jenny, who had been tending the array of teacups, stepped in now with the next and knelt by Pardloe, nodding to me that she would see to his breathing while I talked to Germain.</p><p>\u201cHe told the chairmen to bring me to the King\u2019s Arms,\u201d I said to Germain, taking him out onto the porch, where we could confer unheard. \u201cAnd I met him at General Clinton\u2019s office in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken where it is, Grand-m\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay you do. Have you something in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019\u2014\u201d He glanced into the house, then back at me, eyes narrowed in thought. \u201cHow long d\u2019ye mean to keep him prisoner, Grand-m\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>So my motives hadn\u2019t escaped Germain. I wasn\u2019t surprised; he undoubtedly had heard all about the day\u2019s excitements from Mrs. Figg\u2014and, knowing as he did who Jamie was, had probably deduced even more. I wondered if he\u2019d seen William. If so, he likely knew everything. If he didn\u2019t, though, there was no need to reveal that little complication until it was necessary.</p><p>\u201cUntil your grandfather comes back,\u201d I said. \u201cOr possibly Lord John,\u201d I added as an afterthought. I hoped with all my being that Jamie would come back shortly. But it might be that he would find it necessary to stay outside the city and send John in to bring me news. \u201cThe minute I let the duke go, he\u2019ll be turning the city upside down in search of his brother. Always assuming for the sake of argument that he doesn\u2019t drop dead in the process.\u201d And the very last thing I wanted was to instigate a dragnet in which Jamie might be snared.</p><p>Germain rubbed his chin thoughtfully\u2014a peculiar gesture in a child too young for whiskers, but his father to the life, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s maybe not too long,\u201d he said. \u201cGrand-p\u00e8re will come back directly; he was wild to see ye last night.\u201d He grinned at me, then looked through the open doorway, pursing his lips.</p><p>\u201cAs to himself, ye canna hide where he is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if ye were to send a note to the general, and maybe another to the King\u2019s Arms, saying as how His Grace was staying with Lord John, they wouldna start searching for him right away. And even if someone was to come here later and inquire, I suppose ye might give him a wee dram that would keep him quiet so ye could tell them he was gone. Or maybe lock him in a closet? Tied up wi\u2019 a gag if it should be he\u2019s got his voice back by then,\u201d he added. Germain was a very logical, thorough-minded sort of person; he got it from Marsali.</p><p>\u201cExcellent thought,\u201d I said, forbearing to comment on the relative merits of the options for keeping Pardloe incommunicado. \u201cLet me do that now.\u201d</p><p>Pausing for a quick look at Pardloe, who was doing better though still wheezing strongly, I whipped upstairs and flipped open John\u2019s writing desk. It was the work of a moment to mix the ink powder and write the notes. I hesitated briefly over the signature but then caught sight of John\u2019s signet on the dressing table; he hadn\u2019t had time to put it on.</p><p>The thought gave me a slight pang; in the overwhelming joy of seeing Jamie alive, and then the shock of William\u2019s advent, Jamie\u2019s taking John hostage, and the violence of William\u2019s exit\u2014dear Lord, where was William now?\u2014I had pushed John to the back of my mind.</p><p>Still, I told myself, he was quite safe. Jamie wouldn\u2019t let any harm come to him, and directly he came back into Philadelphia\u2014the chiming of the carriage clock on the mantelpiece interrupted me, and I glanced at it: four o\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cTime flies when you\u2019re having fun,\u201d I murmured to myself, and, scribbling a reasonable facsimile of John\u2019s signature, I lit the candle from the embers in the hearth, dripped wax on the folded notes, and stamped them with the smiling half-moon ring. Maybe John would be back before the notes were even delivered. And Jamie, surely, would be with me as soon as darkness made it safe.</p><p>A TIDE IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN</p><p>JAMIE WASN\u2019T ALONE on the road. He\u2019d been dimly aware of horses passing by, heard the distant talk of men on foot, but now that he\u2019d come out of his red haze, he was startled to see how many there were. He saw what was plainly a militia company\u2014not marching, but on the move as a body, knots and clumps of men, solitary riders\u2014and a few wagons coming from the city, piled with goods, women and children afoot beside them.</p><p>He\u2019d seen a few folk leaving Philadelphia when he\u2019d come in the day before\u2014God, was it only yesterday?\u2014and thought to ask Fergus about it, but in the excitement of arrival and the later complications had quite forgotten.</p><p>His sense of disturbance increased and he kicked up his horse to a faster pace. It was no more than ten miles to the city; he\u2019d be there long before nightfall.</p><p>Maybe just as well if it\u2019s dark, he thought grimly. Easier to have things out with Claire alone and undisturbed\u2014and whether the having-out led to beating or bed, he wanted no interference. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought was like the striking of one of Brianna\u2019s matches. Just the word \u201cbed\u201d and he was aflame with fresh rage.</p><p>\u201cIfrinn!\u201d he said aloud, and slammed his fist against the pommel. All the trouble to calm himself, and all to waste in an instant! God damn it\u2014damn him, damn her, John Grey\u2014damn everything!</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d</p><p>He jerked as though shot in the back, and the horse slowed at once, snorting.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d came the loud, wheezy voice again, and Daniel Morgan came trotting up alongside on a small, sturdy bay, grinning all over his big scarred face. \u201cKnew that was you, knew it! Ain\u2019t no other rascal that size with that color hair, and if there is one, I don\u2019t want to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel Morgan,\u201d he said, noting auld Dan\u2019s unaccustomed uniform with the fresh insignia on the collar. \u201cOn your way to a wedding?\u201d He did his best to smile, though the turmoil inside him was like the whirlpools off the rocks of Stroma.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, that,\u201d said Dan, trying to look sideways down his own neck. \u201cPshaw. Washington\u2019s a damned stickler for \u2018proper dress.\u2019 The Continental army got more generals than they got private soldiers, these days. An officer lives through more \u2019n two battles, they make him some kind of general on the spot. Now, gettin\u2019 any pay for it, that\u2019s a different kettle of fish.\u201d</p><p>He tipped back his hat and looked Jamie up and down.</p><p>\u201cJust come back from Scotland? Heard you went with Brigadier Fraser\u2019s body\u2014your kin, I suppose?\u201d He shook his head regretfully. \u201cCryin\u2019 shame. Fine soldier, good man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, he was that. We buried him near his home at Balnain.\u201d</p><p>They continued together, auld Dan asking questions and Jamie replying as briefly as good manners\u2014and his real affection for Morgan\u2014would allow. They hadn\u2019t met since Saratoga, where he\u2019d served under Morgan as an officer of his Rifle Corps, and there was a good deal to say. Still, he was glad of the company, and even of the questions; they distracted him and kept his mind from catapulting him again into fruitless fury and confusion.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we must part here,\u201d Jamie said, after a bit. They were approaching a crossroads, and Dan had slowed his pace a bit. \u201cI\u2019m bound into the city myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Morgan asked, rather surprised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014to see my wife.\u201d His voice wanted to tremble on the word \u201cwife,\u201d and he bit it off sharp.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes? Could you maybe spare a quarter hour?\u201d Dan was giving him a sort of calculating look that made Jamie instantly uneasy. But the sun was still high; he didn\u2019t want to enter Philadelphia before dark.</p> <p>\u201cAye, maybe,\u201d he replied cautiously. \u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to see a friend\u2014want you to meet him. It\u2019s right close, won\u2019t take a moment. Come on!\u201d Morgan veered right, waving at Jamie to follow, which, cursing himself for a fool, he did.</p><p>Number 17 Chestnut Street</p><p>I WAS SWEATING as freely as the duke was by the time the spasm eased enough for him to breathe without the positive-pressure exercise. I wasn\u2019t quite as tired as he was\u2014he lay back in the chair, exhausted, eyes closed, drawing slow, shallow\u2014but free!\u2014breaths\u2014but close. I felt light-headed, too; it\u2019s not possible to help someone breathe without doing a lot of it yourself, and I was hyperventilated.</p><p>\u201cHere, a piuthar-ch\u00e8ile.\u201d Jenny\u2019s voice spoke by my ear, and it was only when I opened my eyes in surprise that I realized they\u2019d been closed. She put a small glass of brandy in my hand. \u201cThere\u2019s nay whisky in the house, but I expect this will help. Shall I give His Grace a dram, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you shall,\u201d the duke said, with great authority, though he didn\u2019t move a muscle or open his eyes. \u201cThank you, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt him,\u201d I said, drawing myself up and stretching my back. \u201cOr you, either. Sit down and have a drink. You, too, Mrs. Figg.\u201d Jenny and Mrs. Figg had worked nearly as hard as I had, fetching and grinding and brewing, bringing cool cloths to mop the sweat, spelling me now and then with the counting, and, by combining their not-inconsiderable force of will with mine, helping to keep him alive.</p><p>Mrs. Figg had very fixed notions of what was proper, and these didn\u2019t include sitting down to share a dram with her employer, let alone a visiting duke, but even she was obliged to admit that the circumstances were unusual. Glass in hand, she perched primly on an ottoman near the parlor door, where she could deal with any potential invasions or domestic emergencies.</p> <p>No one spoke for some time, but there was a great sense of peace in the room. The hot, still air carried that sense of odd camaraderie that binds people who have passed through a trial together\u2014if only temporarily. I gradually became aware that the air was carrying noises, too, from the street outside. Groups of people moving hurriedly, shouts from the next block, and a rumble of wagons. And a distant rattle of drums.</p><p>Mrs. Figg was aware of it, too; I saw her head rise, the ribbons of her cap atremble with inquisitiveness.</p><p>\u201cBaby Jesus, have mercy,\u201d she said, setting down her empty glass with care. \u201cSomething\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Jenny looked startled and glanced at me, apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cComing?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Continental army, I expect,\u201d said Pardloe. He let his head fall back, sighing. \u201cDear God. What it is . . . to draw breath.\u201d His breath was still short, but not very much constrained. He raised his glass ceremoniously to me. \u201cThank you, my . . . dear. I was . . . already in your debt for your . . . kind services to my son, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018the Continental army\u2019?\u201d I interrupted. I set down my own glass, now empty. My heart rate had calmed after the exertions of the last hour but now abruptly sped up again.</p><p>Pardloe closed one eye and regarded me with the other.</p><p>\u201cThe Americans,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cThe Rebels. What else . . . would I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you say, \u2018coming . . .\u2019\u201d I said carefully.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he pointed out, then nodded at Mrs. Figg. \u201cShe did. She\u2019s right, though. General Clinton\u2019s . . . forces are with . . . drawing from Philadelphia. . . . I daresay Wa . . . Washington is . . . poised to rush in.\u201d</p><p>Jenny made a small sputtering noise, and Mrs. Figg said something really blasphemous in French, then clapped a broad pink-palmed hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, doubtless sounding as blank as I felt. I\u2019d been so distracted during my meeting with Clinton earlier in the day that the logical consequences of a British withdrawal had not occurred to me at all.</p><p>Mrs. Figg stood up.</p><p>\u201cI best go and be burying the silver, then,\u201d she said in a matter-of-fact sort of way. \u201cIt\u2019ll be under the laburnum bush by the cookhouse, Lady John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, raising a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need do that just yet, Mrs. Figg. The army hasn\u2019t yet left the city; the Americans aren\u2019t precisely snapping at our heels. And we\u2019ll need a few forks with which to eat our supper.\u201d</p><p>She made a low rumbling noise in her throat but seemed to see the sense in this; she nodded and began to collect the brandy glasses instead.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you be wanting for supper, then? I got a cold boiled ham, but I was thinking to make a chicken fricassee, William liking that so much.\u201d She cast a bleak look at the hallway, where the bloody smudges on the wallpaper had now turned brown. \u201cYou think he\u2019s coming back for his supper?\u201d William had an official billet somewhere in the town, but frequently spent the night at the house\u2014particularly when Mrs. Figg was making chicken fricassee.</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d I said. I hadn\u2019t had time to contemplate the William situation, what with everything else. Might he come back, when he\u2019d cooled down, determined to have things out with John? I\u2019d seen a Fraser on the boil, many times, and they didn\u2019t sulk, as a rule. They tended to take direct action, at once. I eyed Jenny speculatively; she returned the look and casually leaned her elbow on the table, chin in hand, and tapped her fingers thoughtfully against her lips. I smiled privately at her.</p><p>\u201cWhere is my nephew?\u201d Hal asked, finally able to take note of something other than his next breath. \u201cFor that matter . . . where is my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I told him, putting my own glass on Mrs. Figg\u2019s tray and scooping his up to add to it. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t lying about that. But I do expect he\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d I rubbed a hand over my face and smoothed my hair back as well as I could. First things first. I had a patient to tend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure John wants to see you as much as you want to see him. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt it,\u201d the duke said. His eyes traveled slowly over me, from bare feet to disheveled hair, and the faint look of amusement on his face deepened. \u201cYou must tell me how John . . . happened to marry you . . . when there\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA counsel of desperation,\u201d I said shortly. \u201cBut in the meantime we must get you to bed. Mrs. Figg, is the back bedroom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Figg,\u201d the duke interrupted, \u201cI shan\u2019t be . . . requiring . . .\u201d He was trying to struggle up out of the chair and hadn\u2019t enough breath to talk. I walked up to him and gave him my best piercing head-matron look.</p><p>\u201cHarold,\u201d I said in measured tones. \u201cI am not merely your sister-in-law.\u201d The term gave me an odd frisson, but I ignored it. \u201cI am your physician. If you don\u2019t\u2014what?\u201d I demanded. He was staring up at me with a most peculiar expression on his face, something between surprise and amusement. \u201cYou invited me to use your Christian name, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone has . . . actually called me Harold since . . . I was three years old.\u201d He did smile then, a charming smile quite his own. \u201cThe family call me Hal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHal, then,\u201d I said, smiling back but refusing to be distracted. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a nice refreshing sponge bath, Hal, and then you\u2019re going to bed.\u201d</p><p>He laughed\u2014though he cut it short, as he began to wheeze. He coughed a little, fist balled under his ribs, and looked uneasy, but it stopped, and he cleared his throat and glanced up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think I was . . . three years old. Sister-in-law. Trying to send me . . . to bed without my tea?\u201d He pressed himself gingerly upright, getting his feet under him. I put a hand on his chest and pushed. He hadn\u2019t any strength in his legs and fell back into the chair, astonished and affronted. And afraid: he hadn\u2019t realized\u2014or at least had not admitted\u2014his own weakness. A severe attack usually left the victim completely drained, and often with the lungs still dangerously twitchy.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I said, tempering my tone with gentleness. \u201cYou\u2019ve had attacks like this before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . yes,\u201d he said unwillingly, \u201cbut . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long were you in bed after the last one?\u201d</p><p>His lips compressed.</p><p>\u201cA week. But the fool doctor\u2014\u201d</p><p>I put a hand on his shoulder and he stopped\u2014as much because he\u2019d temporarily run short of air as because of the touch.</p><p>\u201cYou. Cannot. Breathe. Yet. On. Your. Own,\u201d I said, separating the words for emphasis. \u201cListen to me, Hal. Look what\u2019s happened this afternoon, will you? You had a fairly severe attack in the street; had that crowd on Fourth Street decided to set upon us, you would have been quite helpless\u2014don\u2019t argue with me, Hal, I was there.\u201d I narrowed my eyes at him. He did the same back at me but didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cThen the walk from the street to the door of the house\u2014a distance of some twenty feet\u2014threw you straight into a full-blown status asthmaticus; have you heard that term before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you have, and now you know what it is. And you were in bed for a week the last time? Was it as bad as this?\u201d</p><p>His lips were a thin line and his eyes sparking. I imagined most people didn\u2019t speak to a duke\u2014let alone the commander of his own regiment\u2014like this. Be good for him, I thought.</p><p>\u201cBloody doctor . . . said it was my heart.\u201d His fist had uncurled and the fingers were slowly rubbing his chest. \u201cKnew it wasn\u2019t that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re probably right about that,\u201d I conceded. \u201cWas this the same doctor who gave you smelling salts? Complete quack, if so.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a brief, breathless sound.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d He paused to breathe for a moment. \u201cThough in . . . justice, he . . . he didn\u2019t give me . . . salts. Got them . . . myself. For fainting . . . told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did.\u201d I sat down beside him and took hold of his wrist. He let me, watching curiously. His pulse was fine; it had slowed and was thumping along very steadily.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been subject to fainting spells?\u201d I asked, bending to look closely into his eyes. No sign of petechial hemorrhage, no jaundice, pupils the same size . . .</p><p>\u201cA long time,\u201d he said, and pulled his wrist abruptly away. \u201cI haven\u2019t time to chat about my health, madam. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire,\u201d I said, and put a restraining hand on his chest, smiling amiably at him. \u201cYou\u2019re Hal, I\u2019m Claire\u2014and you aren\u2019t going anywhere, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your hand off me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seriously tempted to do just that and let you fall on your face,\u201d I told him, \u201cbut wait until Mrs. Figg finishes brewing the tincture. I don\u2019t want you thrashing about on the floor, gasping like a landed fish, and no way of getting the hook out of your mouth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I did in fact take my hand off his chest, though, and, rising, I went out into the hall before he could find breath to say anything. Jenny had taken up a stand by the open doorway, looking up and down the street.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on out there?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d she said, not taking her eyes off a couple of rough-looking men who were lounging down the other side of the street. \u201cBut I dinna like the feel of it a bit. D\u2019ye think he\u2019s right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the British army is leaving? Yes. They are. And very likely half the Loyalists in the city with them.\u201d I knew exactly what she meant by not liking the feel of things. The air was hot and thick, buzzing with cicadas, and the leaves of the chestnut trees along the street hung limp as dishrags. But something was moving in the atmosphere. Excitement? Panic? Fear? All three, I thought.</p> <p>\u201cHad I best go to the printshop, d\u2019ye think?\u201d she asked, turning to me with a slight frown. \u201cWould Marsali and the weans be safer if I fetched them here, I mean? If there was to be a riot or the like?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. They\u2019re well-known Patriots. It\u2019s the Loyalists who will be in danger, if the British army is leaving. They won\u2019t have any protection, and the Rebels may well . . . do things to them. And\u201d\u2014a very unpleasant feeling snaked down my backbone, like a cold, slimy finger\u2014\u201cthis is a Loyalist household.\u201d \u201cWithout even a door to shut and bolt,\u201d I might have added, but didn\u2019t.</p><p>There was a loud thump from the parlor, as of a body hitting the floor, but Jenny didn\u2019t turn a hair, nor did I. We\u2019d both had a lot of experience with stubborn men. I could hear him panting; if he started wheezing again, I\u2019d go in.</p><p>\u201cWill it put ye in danger, then, to have him here?\u201d she asked, sotto voce, with a tilt of her head toward the parlor. \u201cMaybe ye\u2019d best come to the printshop.\u201d</p> <p>I grimaced, trying to evaluate the possibilities. The notes I\u2019d sent with Germain would delay inquiries, and I could put off anyone who did come. But that also meant I could expect no immediate help from the army, if help was needed. And it might be; someone in that hostile crowd on Fourth Street might well have heard where I\u2019d told the chairmen to come. That hostility now showed itself in a different light.</p><p>If the Rebels in the city were about to rise and turn upon the defenseless Loyalists\u2014and the currents I sensed beginning to swirl through the streets were dark ones\u2014</p><p>\u201cSomeone might just show up on your porch wi\u2019 a keg of tar and a bag o\u2019 feathers,\u201d Jenny observed, preempting my thought in a most unnerving way.</p><p>\u201cWell, that wouldn\u2019t help His Grace\u2019s asthma a bit,\u201d I said, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cHad ye maybe better give him back to General Clinton?\u201d she suggested. \u201cI\u2019ve had soldiers search my house, wi\u2019 a wanted man hidin\u2019 in the bottom o\u2019 my wardrobe and my newborn bairn in his arms. I dinna think it would be a great deal easier on the nerves to have the Sons o\u2019 Liberty come in here after His Grace, if half what Marsali told me about them is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably is.\u201d A gunshot smacked through the heavy air, flat and dull, from somewhere near the river, and we both tensed. It wasn\u2019t repeated, though, and after a moment I drew breath again.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, he\u2019s not stable. I can\u2019t risk taking him through streets filled with dust and tree pollen and then leaving him in the care of an army surgeon, or even that quack Hebdy. Were he to have another attack and no one able to get him through it . . .\u201d</p><p>Jenny grimaced.</p><p>\u201cAye, ye\u2019re right,\u201d she said reluctantly. \u201cAnd ye canna leave him here and go yourself, for the same reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d And Jamie would be coming here, to find me. I wouldn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cKen, if Jamie came and didna find ye here, he\u2019d go to the printshop next thing,\u201d Jenny observed, making the hair prickle on the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop doing that!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, startled.</p><p>\u201cReading my mind!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d She grinned at me, blue eyes creasing into triangles. \u201cEverything ye think shows on your face, Claire. Surely Jamie\u2019s told ye that?\u201d</p><p>A deep flush burned upward from my low-cut d\u00e9colletage, and only then did I recall that I was still wearing the amber-colored silk, which was now soaked with sweat, rimed with dust, and altogether rather the worse for wear. And which had very tight stays. I rather hoped that everything I was thinking didn\u2019t show on my face, because there was quite a bit of information I didn\u2019t mean to share with Jenny just yet.</p><p>\u201cWell, I canna tell everything ye think,\u201d she admitted\u2014doing it again, dammit!\u2014\u201cbut it\u2019s easy to tell when ye\u2019re thinking about Jamie.\u201d</p><p>I decided that I really didn\u2019t want to hear what I looked like when thinking about Jamie and was about to excuse myself to look in on the duke, who I could hear coughing and swearing breathlessly to himself in German, when my attention was distracted by a boy sprinting down the street as though the devil were after him, his coat on inside out and shirttails streaming.</p><p>\u201cColenso!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jenny said, startled.</p><p>\u201cNot what. Who. Him,\u201d I said, pointing at the grubby little creature panting up the walk. \u201cColenso Baragwanath. William\u2019s groom.\u201d</p><p>Colenso, who always looked as though he should be squatting atop a toadstool, came hurtling toward the door with such violence that Jenny and I both leapt out of the way. Colenso tripped on the doorsill and fell flat on his face.</p><p>\u201cYe look as though Auld Hornie himself was after ye, lad,\u201d Jenny said, bending down to hoick him to his feet. \u201cAnd whatever\u2019s become of your breeks?\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the boy was barefoot and wearing only his shirt beneath his coat.</p><p>\u201cThey took \u2019em,\u201d he blurted, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I said, pulling his coat off and turning it right side out again.</p><p>\u201cThem,\u201d he said, gesturing hopelessly toward Locust Street. \u201cI put me head into the ordinary, to see was Lord Ellesmere there\u2014he is, sometimes\u2014and there was a knot o\u2019 men all buzzin\u2019 like a hive o\u2019 bees together. They was big lads with \u2019em, and one of \u2019em as knew me saw me and raises up a great cry, shoutin\u2019 as I\u2019m a-spyin\u2019 on \u2019em and mean to take word back to the army, and then they grabbed me and they called me a turncoat and put me coat on backward and the one man said he\u2019d beat me and teach me not to do such as that and pulled off me breeches and . . . and . . . anyway, I squirmed out of his hand and fell down on the floor and crawled out under the tables and took off a-runnin\u2019.\u201d He wiped a sleeve under his runny nose. \u201cHis lordship here, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy do you want him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t, ma\u2019am,\u201d he assured me, with evident sincerity. \u201cMajor Findlay wants him. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well . . . wherever he is at the moment, he\u2019ll likely go back to his regular billet this evening. You know where that is, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, but I\u2019m not a-goin\u2019 back in the street \u2019thout my breeches!\u201d He looked both horrified and indignant, and Jenny laughed.</p><p>\u201cDinna blame ye a bit, lad,\u201d she said. \u201cTell ye what, though\u2014my eldest grandson\u2019s likely got an old pair of breeches he could spare. I\u2019ll step round to the printshop,\u201d she said to me, \u201cfetch the breeches, and tell Marsali what\u2019s ado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, a little reluctant to see her go. \u201cBut hurry back. And tell her not to print any of this in the newspaper!\u201d</p><p>THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY GHOST UPON A RELUCTANT DISCIPLE</p><p>DAN MORGAN\u2019S \u201cIT\u201d WAS nearby: a ramshackle cabin set in a little elm grove, down a short dirt lane off the main road. There was a big gray gelding hobbled and cropping grass nearby, his tack resting on the porch; he looked up briefly and whinnied at the newcomers.</p><p>Jamie ducked under the lintel after Dan and found himself in a dark, shabby room that smelled of cabbage water, grime, and the sharp reek of urine. There was one window, its shutters left open for air, and the sunlight coming in silhouetted the long-skulled head of a large man sitting at the table, who raised his head at the opening of the door.</p><p>\u201cColonel Morgan,\u201d he said, in a soft voice touched with the drawl of Virginia. \u201cHave you brought me good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I brought you, General,\u201d auld Dan said, and shoved Jamie ahead of him toward the table. \u201cI found this rascal on the road and bade him come along. This\u2019ll be Colonel Fraser, who I\u2019ve told you of before. Just come back from Scotland, and the very man to take command of Taylor\u2019s troops.\u201d</p><p>The big man had risen from the table and put out a hand, smiling\u2014though he smiled with his lips pressed tight together, as though afraid something might escape. The man was as tall as Jamie himself, and Jamie found himself looking straight into sharp gray-blue eyes that took his measure in the instant it took to shake hands.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Washington,\u201d the man said. \u201cYour servant, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser,\u201d Jamie said, feeling mildly stunned. \u201cYour . . . most obedient. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit with me, Colonel Fraser.\u201d The big Virginian gestured toward one of the rough benches at the table. \u201cMy horse pulled up lame, and my slave\u2019s gone to find another. No notion how long it may take him, as I require a good sturdy beast to bear my weight, and those are thin on the ground these days.\u201d He looked Jamie up and down with frank appraisal; they were much of a size. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have a decent horse with you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d It was clear what Washington expected, and Jamie yielded gracefully. \u201cWill ye do me the honor to take him, General?\u201d</p><p>Auld Dan made a disgruntled noise and shifted from foot to foot, clearly wanting to object, but Jamie gave him a brief shake of the head. It wasn\u2019t that far to Philadelphia; he could walk.</p><p>Washington looked pleased and thanked Jamie with grace in turn, saying that the horse should be returned to him as soon as another suitable mount might be procured.</p><p>\u201cBut it is somewhat necessary that I be nimble at present, Colonel,\u201d Washington remarked, with an air of apology. \u201cYou\u2019re aware, are you, that Clinton is withdrawing from Philadelphia?\u201d</p><p>A shock went through Jamie like a hot penny dropped on butter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014he\u2014no, sir. I was not aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just about to get to that,\u201d Dan said tetchily. \u201cNo one lets me get one word in edgewise, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve got one,\u201d Washington said, amused. \u201cYou might get another, if you\u2019re quick enough to speak before Lee gets here. Sit down, gentlemen, if you will. I\u2019m expecting\u2014ah, there they are.\u201d Sounds from the dooryard indicated a number of horsemen arriving, and within a few moments the cabin was crowded with Continental officers.</p><p>They were a creased and weathered lot, for the most part, dressed in motley bits of uniform, these coupled uneasily with hunting shirts or homespun breeches. Even the complete suits of clothes were mud-spattered and worn, and the smell of men who\u2019d been living rough quite overcame the gentler domestic reeks of the cabin.</p><p>Among the shuffling and excited greetings, Jamie spotted the source of the urinous smell, though: a thin-faced woman stood with her back pressed into a corner of the room, holding an infant wrapped in a ratty shawl against her bosom, her eyes darting to and fro among the intruders. A dark wet patch showed on the shawl, but it was plain the woman was afraid to move from her place to change the wean and instead shifted mechanically from foot to foot, patting the child to soothe it.</p><p>\u201cColonel Fraser! Well met! Well met!\u201d The voice jerked his attention away, and, to his astonishment, he found his hand being pumped with enthusiasm by Anthony Wayne\u2014known quite openly by now as \u201cMad Anthony\u201d\u2014whom he had last seen a few weeks before the fall of Ticonderoga.</p><p>\u201cIs your wife well, sir, and your Indian nephew?\u201d Wayne was asking, beaming up into Jamie\u2019s face. Anthony was short and stocky, with the full cheeks of a chipmunk, but also equipped with a sharp, poking sort of nose over which his eyes did now and then seem to glow with fire. At the moment, Jamie was relieved to see them merely alight with friendly interest.</p><p>\u201cAll well, sir, I thank ye. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, is your wife near at hand?\u201d Wayne moved a little closer and lowered his voice a bit. \u201cI\u2019ve been having the most damnable time with my gouty foot, and she did wonders with the abscess at the base of my spine while we were at Ti\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cColonel Fraser, allow me to make you acquainted with Major General Charles Lee and with General Nathanael Greene.\u201d George Washington\u2019s voice drove a smooth Virginia wedge between himself and the base of Mad Anthony\u2019s spine, to Jamie\u2019s relief.</p><p>Besides Washington himself, Charles Lee was the best equipped of the lot, wearing complete uniform from gorget to polished boots. Jamie hadn\u2019t met him before but could have picked him out of a crowd as a professional soldier, no matter how he was dressed. An Englishman of the sort who seemed always to be smelling something dubious, but he shook hands cordially enough, with a clipped \u201cYour servant, sir.\u201d Jamie knew exactly two things about Charles Lee, both told to him by Young Ian: to wit, that the man had a Mohawk wife\u2014and that the Mohawk called him \u201cOunewaterika.\u201d Ian said it meant \u201cBoiling Water.\u201d</p><p>Between Mad Anthony and Boiling Water, Jamie was beginning to feel that he should have spurred up and run for it when he met Dan Morgan on the road, but too late for regrets.</p><p>\u201cSit, gentlemen, we have no time to waste.\u201d Washington turned to the woman in the corner. \u201cHave you anything to drink, Mrs. Hardman?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie saw her throat move as she swallowed, squeezing the child so hard that it squealed like a piglet and started to cry. He felt several of the men, doubtless fathers, wince at the sound.</p><p>\u201cNo, Friend,\u201d she said, and he realized she was a Quaker. \u201cNaught but water from the well. Shall I fetch you a bucket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t trouble thyself, Friend Hardman,\u201d Nathanael Greene said, soft-voiced. \u201cI\u2019ve two bottles in my saddlebag will do us.\u201d He moved slowly toward the woman, not to startle her, and took her gently by the arm. \u201cCome outside. Thee needn\u2019t be disturbed by this business.\u201d He was a heavy, imposing man, who walked with a noticeable limp, but she seemed reassured by his plain speech and went with him, though looking back with an anxious face, as though fearing that the men might set fire to the place.</p><p>A quarter hour later, Jamie wasn\u2019t so sure that they might not ignite the cabin by the sheer force of their excitement. Washington and his troops had been bottled up at Valley Forge for the last six months, drilling and preparing, and the generals were on fire to be at the enemy.</p> <p>Much talk, plans proposed, argued over, put aside, returned to. Jamie listened with half a mind; the other half was in Philadelphia. He\u2019d heard enough from Fergus to know that the city was divided, with regular clashes between Patriots and Loyalists, these kept under control only by the presence of the British soldiers\u2014but the Loyalists were a minority. The moment the army\u2019s protection was withdrawn, the Loyalists would be at the mercy of the Rebels\u2014and Rebels who had been suppressed for months were not likely to be merciful.</p><p>And Claire . . . His mouth went dry. Claire was, so far as anyone in Philadelphia knew, the wife of Lord John Grey, a very visible Loyalist. And Jamie himself had just removed John Grey\u2019s protection from her, leaving her alone and helpless in a city about to explode.</p><p>How long did he have before the British left the city? No one at the table knew.</p><p>He took as little part as possible in the conversation, both because he was estimating how fast he could reach Philadelphia on foot\u2014versus the possibility of going out to the privy and stealing back the horse he\u2019d just given Washington\u2014and because he hadn\u2019t forgotten what auld Dan had said to General Washington when he\u2019d dragged Jamie in here. The very last thing he wanted was\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Colonel Fraser,\u201d Washington said. Jamie closed his eyes and commended his soul to God. \u201cWill you do me the signal service of accepting command of Henry Taylor\u2019s battalion? General Taylor fell ill and died two days ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . . am honored, sir,\u201d Jamie managed, thinking frantically. \u201cBut I have very urgent business . . . in Philadelphia. I should be happy to oblige ye, so soon as my business is accomplished\u2014and I could, of course, bring back word of exactly how matters stand with General Clinton\u2019s forces.\u201d Washington had been looking severe during the first part of this speech, but the last sentence made Greene and Morgan hum with approval and Wayne nod his little chipmunk head.</p><p>\u201cCan you manage your business within three days, Colonel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d It was no more than ten miles to the city; he could do that in two or three hours. And it wasn\u2019t going to take him more than thirty seconds to take Claire out of that house, once he reached it.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then. You\u2019re appointed to a temporary field rank of General of the Army. That\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIfrinn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Colonel?\u201d Washington looked puzzled. Dan Morgan, who\u2019d heard Jamie say \u201cHell!\u201d in G\u00e0idhlig before, shook silently beside him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014thank ye, sir.\u201d He swallowed, feeling a dizzy wave of heat pass over him.</p><p>\u201cThough the Congress will have to approve your appointment,\u201d Washington went on, frowning a little, \u201cand there\u2019s no guarantee as to what those contentious, shopkeeping sons of bitches will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, sir,\u201d Jamie assured him. He could only hope. Dan Morgan passed him a bottle, and he drank deep, hardly noticing what was in it. Sweating profusely, he sank back on the bench, hoping to avoid any further notice.</p><p>Jesus, now what? He\u2019d meant to slip quietly into the city and out again with Claire, then head south to retrieve his printing press, perhaps establish a wee business in Charleston or Savannah until the war was over and they could go home to the Ridge. But he had known there was a risk; any man below the age of sixty could be compelled into militia service, and if it came down to it, he was likely a little safer being a general than a commander of militia. Maybe. And a general could resign; that was a heartening thought.</p><p>Despite all the talk and the worrying prospects of the immediate future, Jamie found himself paying more attention to Washington\u2019s face than to what he said, taking note of how the man talked and carried himself, so that he could tell Claire. He wished that he could tell Brianna; she and Roger Mac had sometimes speculated about what it might be like to meet someone like Washington\u2014though having met a number of famous people himself, he\u2019d told her that the experience was likely to prove a disappointment.</p><p>He would admit that Washington knew what he was about, though; he listened more than he talked, and when he said something, it was to the point. And he did give off an air of relaxed authority, though it was clear the present prospect excited him very much. His face was pockmarked, big-featured, and far from handsome, but had a good bit of dignity and presence.</p><p>His expression had become very animated, and he went so far as to laugh now and then, showing very bad, stained teeth. Jamie was fascinated; Brianna had told him they were false, made of wood or hippopotamus ivory, and he had a sudden dislocating recollection of his grandfather: the Old Fox had had a set of teeth made of beechwood. Jamie had thrown them on the fire during an argument at Beaufort Castle\u2014and just for an instant he was there, smelling peat smoke and roasting venison, every hair on his body a-prickle with warning, surrounded by kinsmen who might just kill him.</p><p>And as suddenly he was back, pressed between Lee and auld Dan, smelling sweat and exhilaration and, despite himself, feeling the rising excitement among them begin to seep into his blood.</p> <p>It gave him a queer feeling in his wame, to sit nay more than a foot away from a man whom he knew not at all but about whom he maybe kent more than the man himself.</p><p>True, he\u2019d sat with Charles Stuart many evenings, knowing\u2014and believing\u2014what Claire had said would happen to him. But still . . . Christ had told doubting Thomas, \u201cBlessed are those who have not seen but have believed.\u201d Jamie wondered what you called those who had seen and were obliged to live with the resultant knowledge. He thought \u201cblessed\u201d was maybe not the word.</p><p>IT WAS MORE than an hour before Washington and the others took their leave\u2014an hour during which Jamie thought repeatedly that he might just stand up, flip the table over, and run out the door, leaving the Continental army to make shift without him.</p><p>He kent perfectly well that armies moved slowly, save when fighting. And clearly Washington expected that it would be a week or more before the British actually quit Philadelphia. But it was no use talking sense to his body, which as usual had its own measures of importance. He could ignore or suppress hunger, thirst, fatigue, and injury. He couldn\u2019t suppress the need to see Claire.</p><p>Likely it was what she and Brianna called testosterone poisoning, he thought idly\u2014their term for the obvious things men did that women didn\u2019t understand. Someday he must ask her what testosterone was. He shifted uncomfortably on the narrow bench, forcing his mind back to what Washington was saying.</p><p>At long last, there came a rap on the door, and a black man put his head in and nodded to Washington.</p><p>\u201cReady, suh,\u201d he said, in the same soft Virginia accent as his master.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Caesar.\u201d Washington nodded back, then put his hands on the table and rose swiftly. \u201cWe are agreed, then, gentlemen? You\u2019re coming with me, General Lee. I\u2019ll see the rest of you in due course at Sutfin\u2019s farm, save you hear otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s heart leapt and he made to rise, too, but auld Dan put a hand on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cSet a bit, Jamie,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to know something about your new command, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d he began, but there was no help for it. He sat and waited while Nathanael Greene thanked Mrs. Hardman for her hospitality and begged her to accept a small recompense from the army for her civil reception of them. Jamie would have wagered a good deal that the coins he plucked from his purse were his own and not the army\u2019s, but the woman took them, an acceptance too faint to be pleasure showing in her worn face. He saw her shoulders sag with relief as the door closed behind the generals and realized that their presence might have put her and her child in considerable peril, should the wrong people see uniformed Continental officers visiting her house.</p><p>She glanced consideringly at him and Dan, but they seemed to trouble her much less, in their rough civilian clothes. Dan had taken off his uniform coat and folded it inside out, laying it on the bench beside him.</p><p>\u201cFeel any tongues of fire come down on your head just now, Jamie?\u201d Dan asked, seeing his look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you,\u201d Dan quoted, and grinned wide at Jamie\u2019s look of astonishment.</p><p>\u201cMy Abigail\u2019s a reading woman, and she reads bits o\u2019 the Bible out to me regular, in hopes it\u2019ll do some good, though ain\u2019t much luck in that direction yet.\u201d He took up the rucksack he\u2019d brought in and dredged about in it, coming out with a folded sheaf of dog-eared papers, an inkhorn, and a couple of tattered quills.</p><p>\u201cWell, now that the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost are gone off about their own business, let me write you down the names of your company commanders, what-all you got in the way of militia, and where they all are, \u2019cuz it ain\u2019t like they\u2019re all in barracks\u2014or even in the same village. Missus Hardman, might I trouble you, ma\u2019am, for a drop of water for my ink?\u201d</p><p>Jamie bent his mind with difficulty to the business at hand, the better to dispatch it quickly, and within a quarter hour was gathering together the lists, made out in Dan\u2019s slow, crabbed hand. Two hours to Philadelphia . . . maybe three . . .</p><p>\u201cGot any money on you to speak of?\u201d Dan asked, pausing by the door.</p><p>\u201cNot a penny,\u201d Jamie admitted, with a glance at the spot on his belt where his purse was normally fastened. He\u2019d given it to Jenny to keep on the journey, as she delighted in making their small purchases. And this morning he\u2019d been so much on fire to see Claire that he\u2019d left the printshop with nothing but the clothes on his back and the packet of papers for Fergus. He spared an instant to wonder whether things would be different now, had he not been spotted giving the papers to Fergus and followed to Lord John\u2019s house by the soldiers\u2014and William\u2014but there was no point in regrets.</p><p>Dan pawed in his sack again, came out with a smaller bag and a clinking purse, both of which he tossed to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cA bit of food for your journey, and an advance on your general\u2019s pay,\u201d he said, and chortled with amusement at his own wit. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to pay hard cash for a uniform these days; ain\u2019t a tailor in Philadelphia will take Continentals. And woe betide you if you show up before his worshipfulness George Washington without being dressed proper. He\u2019s a stickler for proper uniform, says you can\u2019t expect to command respect without lookin\u2019 like you deserve it. But I reckon you know all about that.\u201d</p><p>Dan, who had fought both battles of Saratoga in a hunting shirt, leaving his uniform coat hung over a tree branch in camp because of the heat, smiled broadly at Jamie, the scar on his upper lip where a bullet had torn through his face showing white against the weathered skin.</p><p>\u201cFare thee well, General Fraser!\u201d</p><p>Jamie snorted but smiled nonetheless as he stood to shake Dan\u2019s hand. Then he turned back to the litter on the table, stowing the papers and purse\u2014and a stray quill that Dan had abandoned, overlooked\u2014into the bag. He was grateful for the food; the scent of jerked meat and journeycake floated out of the canvas depths, and he could feel the hard shape of apples at the bottom. He\u2019d left the printshop without breakfast, too.</p><p>He straightened, and a pain like white lightning shot from the middle of his spine down the back of his leg to the sole of his foot. He gasped and collapsed onto a stool, his lower back and right buttock clenched with cramp.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary, and Bride\u2014not now,\u201d he said between his teeth, and meant it somewhere between prayer and curse. He\u2019d felt something small wrench or tear in his back when he\u2019d hit John Grey, but in the heat of the moment it hadn\u2019t seemed important. It hadn\u2019t troubled him much walking\u2014he\u2019d barely noticed, with all there was on his mind\u2014but now that he\u2019d sat for a time and the muscles had chilled . . .</p><p>He tried rising, carefully, collapsed again. Bent sweating over the table with his fists clenched, he said a number of things in Gaelic that weren\u2019t at all prayerful.</p><p>\u201cIs thee quite well, Friend?\u201d The woman of the house leaned near, peering nearsightedly at him in concern.</p><p>\u201cA . . . moment,\u201d he managed, trying to do as Claire told him and breathe through the spasm.</p><p>\u201cLike labor pains,\u201d she\u2019d told him, amused. He hadn\u2019t thought it was funny the first time and didn\u2019t now.</p><p>The pain eased. He extended his leg, then flexed it back under him, very gingerly. So far, so good. But when he once more tried to rise, his lower back was locked in a vise, and a pain that made him catch his breath stabbed down his buttock.</p><p>\u201cHave ye . . . anything like . . . whisky? Rum?\u201d If he could just get to his feet . . . But the woman was shaking her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Friend. I have not even small beer. Not even milk for the children any longer,\u201d she added with a certain bitterness. \u201cThe army took my goats away.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say which army, but he supposed it didn\u2019t matter to her. He made a sound of apology, just in case it had been the Continentals or the militia, and subsided, breathing heavily. This had happened three times before\u2014just the same sudden flashing pain, the inability to move. Once, it had taken four days before he could hobble; the other two times, he had got to his feet within two days, and while it had twinged sporadically for weeks, he\u2019d been able to walk, if slowly.</p><p>\u201cIs thee ill? I could give thee rhubarb syrup,\u201d she offered. He managed to smile at that, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI thank ye, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s no but a clench in my back. When it eases, all will be well.\u201d The trouble was that until it eased, he was all but helpless, and the dawning realization of that gave him a sense of panic.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman hesitated for a moment, hovering, but then the baby started to wail and she turned away to fetch it. A little girl\u2014five or six, he thought, a stunted little creature\u2014crawled out from under the bed and stared at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cIs thee going to stay to supper?\u201d she asked, in a high, precise voice. She gave him an appraising frown. \u201cThee looks like thee would eat a lot.\u201d</p><p>He revised his estimate of the girl\u2019s age to eight or nine and smiled at her. He was still sweating with the pain, but it was easing a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not take your food, a nighean,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIn fact, there\u2019s a good loaf and some jerked meat in yon bag; it\u2019s yours.\u201d Her eyes went round as pennies, and he amended, \u201cYour family\u2019s, I mean.\u201d</p><p>She glanced eagerly at the bag, swallowing painfully as her mouth watered; he could hear the tiny gulp and it wrung his heart.</p> <p>\u201cPru!\u201d she whispered, turning urgently toward the table. \u201cFood!\u201d</p><p>Another small girl crawled out and stood beside her sister. They were both plain as fence posts, though they otherwise didn\u2019t resemble each other much.</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d the newcomer told her sister, and turned a solemn gaze on Jamie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Mam give thee rhubarb syrup,\u201d she advised him. \u201cIt makes thee shit like the blazes, and if thee can\u2019t get to the privy, it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrudence!\u201d</p><p>Prudence obligingly shut her mouth, though she continued to look Jamie over with interest. Her sister knelt and rummaged under the bed, emerging with the family utensil, this a homely object of brown earthenware, which she presented gravely for his inspection.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll turn our backs, sir, if thee should need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatience!\u201d</p><p>Red in the face, Mrs. Hardman took the piss pot from her daughter and shooed the little girls to the table, where\u2014with a glance at Jamie to be sure he had meant it\u2014she took the bread and meat and apples from his bag, dividing the food scrupulously into three parts: two large portions for the girls, and a smaller one for herself, put aside for later.</p><p>She had left the chamber pot on the floor beside the bed, and as she eased him gingerly onto the corn-shuck mattress, Jamie caught sight of lettering painted in white across the bottom. He squinted to make it out in the dim light, then smiled. It was a Latin motto, encircling a vividly executed bee with a jovial expression and a pronounced wink. Iam apis potanda fineo ne.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the jest before\u2014the brothel in Edinburgh where he\u2019d once kept a room had been equipped throughout with utensils sporting a variety of Latin tags, most of them prurient, but some merely puns, like this one. It was a Latin sentence, if a foolish one\u2014</p><p>\u201cDrink not the bee now\u201d\u2014but if read phonetically in English, ignoring the spacing, it read, \u201cI am a piss pot and a fine one.\u201d He glanced up at Mrs. Hardman in speculation but thought it was likely not her work. The absent Mr. Hardman must be\u2014or have been, he thought, given the obvious poverty of the household, and he crossed himself unobtrusively at the thought\u2014an educated man.</p><p>The baby had waked and was fussing in her cradle, making small sharp yelps like a fox kit. Mrs. Hardman scooped the child out, pulling a worn nursing chair toward the fire with one foot. She laid the baby momentarily on the bed beside Jamie, opening her blouse with one hand, the other reaching automatically to save an apple that was rolling toward the edge of the table, nudged by a little girl\u2019s elbow.</p><p>The baby smacked her lips, hungry as her sisters. \u201cAnd this will be wee Chastity, I make nay doubt?\u201d he said.</p> <p>Mrs. Hardman gaped at him. \u201cHow did thee know the child\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Prudence and Patience, who were silently stuffing bread and meat into their mouths as quickly as they could eat. \u201cWell, I havena yet met a lassie named Sobriety or Fortitude,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cThe wean\u2019s sopping; have ye a clean clootie for her?\u201d</p><p>There were two worn clouts hung to dry before the fire; she brought one, to find that Jamie had already unpinned the baby\u2019s soggy nappie\u2014that\u2019s what Claire called them\u2014and wiped the shit from her bottom, holding her tiny ankles in one hand.</p><p>\u201cThee has children, I see.\u201d Eyebrows raised, Mrs. Hardman took the soiled clout from him with a nod of thanks and dropped it into a bucket of vinegar and water that stood in the far corner.</p><p>\u201cAnd grandchildren,\u201d he said, wiggling a finger in front of wee Chastity\u2019s nose. She gurgled and went cross-eyed, kicking her legs enthusiastically. \u201cTo say nothing of six nephews and nieces.\u201d And where are Jem and wee Mandy, I wonder? Can she breathe easy now, poor lassie? He gently tickled the baby\u2019s soft pink foot, remembering the strangely beautiful, heart-wrenching blue tinge to Mandy\u2019s perfect toes, long-jointed and graceful as a frog\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just like yours,\u201d Claire had told him, drawing a fingernail lightly down the sole of Mandy\u2019s foot, making the long big toe spring suddenly away from the others. What had she called that?</p><p>He tried it himself, gingerly, and smiled with delight to see it happen to Chastity\u2019s chubby toes.</p><p>\u201cBabinski,\u201d he said to Mrs. Hardman, with a sense of deep satisfaction at recalling the name. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s called when a wean\u2019s great toe does that. A Babinski reflex.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Hardman looked astonished\u2014though much more so when he skillfully repinned the new clout and swaddled wee Chastity afresh in her blanket. She took the baby from him and, with an uncertain expression, sank down in the chair and pulled the ratty shawl over the baby\u2019s head. Unable to turn over easily, Jamie instead closed his eyes to afford her such privacy as he could.</p><p>REMEMBER PAOLI!</p><p>IT WAS HARD TO wipe away the sweat with his hands tied and impossible to keep the stinging salt out of his wounded eye, so puffed and slitted that he couldn\u2019t close it tightly. Water ran down his cheek in a steady flow, dripping off his chin. Blinking in a vain attempt to clear his vision, John Grey missed a fallen branch in his path and fell heavily.</p><p>Those behind him on the narrow trail halted abruptly, with sounds of mild collision, jangling weapons and canteens, confusion and impatience. Rough hands seized him and hauled him up again, but the tall, rawboned man deputed to be his escort said only, \u201cWatch your step, me lord,\u201d in a mild tone of voice, and gave him a nudge down the path rather than a shove.</p><p>Encouraged by this evidence of consideration, he thanked the man and asked his name.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d The man sounded surprised. \u201cOh. Bumppo. Natty Bumppo.\u201d Adding, after a moment, \u201cFolks mostly call me \u2018Hawkeye,\u2019 though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wonder,\u201d Grey said, half under his breath. He bowed, as well as he could whilst walking, and nodded at the long rifle that bobbed in a sling at the man\u2019s back. \u201cYour servant, sir. I deduce that you are a fine shot, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReckon that would be a good deduction, your lordship.\u201d Bumppo\u2019s voice sounded amused. \u201cWhy? D\u2019you want something shot? Or somebody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping a list,\u201d Grey told him. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s complete.\u201d</p><p>He felt, rather than heard, the other\u2019s laugh\u2014the amusement was palpable, but it made little sound.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess who\u2019s first on your list\u2014the big Scotch fellow what put your light out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be fairly high on the list, yes.\u201d Actually, he couldn\u2019t decide who he\u2019d rather see shot first: Jamie Fraser or his own bloody brother. Probably Hal, all things considered. Rather ironic, if Hal ended up getting him shot. Though his captors seemed quite convinced that hanging was the preferred method.</p><p>That reminded him of the uncomfortable bit of conversation that had preceded his being chivvied through the woods on a deer trail bountifully equipped with bramblish bushes, low-hanging branches, ticks, and biting flies the size of the ball of his thumb.</p><p>\u201cWould you happen to know what\u2014or possibly who\u2014Paoli is, Mr. Bumppo?\u201d he asked politely, kicking a fir cone out of his way.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Paoli?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was filled with astonishment. \u201cWhy, man, are you just come to this neck o\u2019 the woods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairly recently,\u201d Grey replied guardedly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bumppo considered, carefully matching his lengthy stride to Grey\u2019s shorter one. \u201cWhy, \u2019twas an infamous attack, to be sure. Your kinsman\u2014Major General Grey, as they said\u2014him and his troops snuck up by night to where General Wayne\u2019s men were camped. Grey didn\u2019t want to risk a stray flint sparking and giving them away, so he gives the order to take out all the flints from their guns and use the bayonets. Fell upon the Americans and bayoneted near a hundred men in their beds, in cold blood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Grey tried to reconcile this account with any recent battle he knew of, and failed. \u201cAnd . . . Paoli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s the name of the tavern nearby\u2014Paoli\u2019s Tavern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Where is it? Geographically, I mean. And when, exactly, did this battle occur?\u201d</p><p>Bumppo\u2019s prehensile lips pushed out in thought, then withdrew.</p><p>\u201cBe up near Malvern, last September. The Paoli Massacre, they calls it,\u201d he added with a certain dubiousness.</p><p>\u201cMassacre?\u201d Grey echoed. The engagement had taken place before his own arrival, but he\u2019d heard it talked about\u2014briefly, and not in terms of massacre, to be sure. But, then, perceptions of the event were bound to be different, depending upon one\u2019s position in the matter. William Howe had spoken of it with approval\u2014as a successful engagement in which a minimal number of British troops had routed an entire American division, with a loss of only seven men.</p><p>Bumppo seemed disposed to share Grey\u2019s opinion of the rhetorical nature of the name, albeit from yet a third perspective.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know how folks will talk,\u201d he said, lifting one shoulder. \u201cAin\u2019t what I\u2019d call a proper massacre, but, then, ain\u2019t many folk seen one, and I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d Glancing up at the tall, bearded ruffian, Grey thought it only too likely.</p><p>\u201cWas raised as an Indian,\u201d Bumppo said, with visible pride. \u201cBy the Mohican, my own folks havin\u2019 died when I were just a tadpole. Aye, I\u2019ve seen a massacre or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d Grey said, innate courtesy obliging him to invite the man to elaborate, should he wish to. Besides, it would pass the time; they seemed to have been walking for hours, and no end in sight\u2014not that he was eagerly anticipating the end. . . .</p><p>As it was, Mr. Bumppo\u2019s reminiscences passed the time to such good effect that Grey was surprised when Corporal Woodbine, in the lead, called the company to a halt at the edge of a fairly sizable encampment. He was glad enough to stop, though; he was wearing city shoes, not suited for the terrain at all, and they had worn through his stockings and rubbed his feet to blood and blisters.</p><p>\u201cScout Bumppo,\u201d Woodbine said, with a short nod to Grey\u2019s companion. \u201cYou\u2019ll take the company on to Zeke Bowen\u2019s place. I\u2019ll deliver the prisoner to Colonel Smith.\u201d</p><p>This statement gave rise to vocal discontent, from which Grey gathered that the company wished very much to accompany Woodbine, in order not to miss Grey\u2019s execution, which they confidently expected to occur within moments of his delivery to the aforesaid Colonel Smith. Woodbine was firm about it, though, and with democratic mutterings and execrations, the militia moved reluctantly off under the guidance of Natty Bumppo.</p><p>Woodbine watched them out of sight, then drew himself up, brushing a stray caterpillar from the breast of his shabby coat and straightening his disreputable hat.</p><p>\u201cWell, Lieutenant Colonel Grey. Shall we go?\u201d</p><p>NATTY BUMPPO\u2019S reminiscences of the proper way to conduct a massacre had left Grey with the feeling that perhaps, by contrast, hanging was not the worst way to die. But while he hadn\u2019t personally witnessed any first-rate massacres, he\u2019d seen men hanged, very close to\u2014and the memory of it dried his throat. The leakage from his eye hadn\u2019t stopped completely but had lessened; the skin felt raw and inflamed, though, and the swelling gave him the annoying sense that his head was grossly misshapen. Still, he drew himself upright and strode chin out into the ragged canvas tent ahead of Corporal Woodbine.</p><p>Colonel Smith looked up from his lap desk, startled at the intrusion\u2014though not quite as startled as Grey.</p><p>He\u2019d last seen Watson Smith in his own sister-in-law\u2019s drawing room in London two years ago, eating cucumber sandwiches. In the uniform of a captain of the Buffs.</p><p>\u201cMr. Smith,\u201d he said, recovering his wits first. He bowed very correctly. \u201cYour servant, sir.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother trying to keep the edge out of his voice or his expression. He sat down upon a vacant stool without being invited and gave Smith as direct a stare as he could with one operant eye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Smith\u2019s cheeks flushed, but he leaned back a little, gathering his own wits before replying, and returned Grey\u2019s stare, with interest. He was not a big man but had broad shoulders and considerable presence of manner\u2014and Grey knew him to be a very competent soldier. Competent enough not to reply directly to Grey but to turn instead to Corporal Woodbine.</p><p>\u201cCorporal. How comes this gentleman here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Lieutenant Colonel Lord John Grey, sir,\u201d Woodbine said. He was near bursting with pride at his capture and placed Grey\u2019s King\u2019s warrant and Graves\u2019s accompanying note on the rickety table with the manner of a butler presenting a roast pheasant with diamond eyes to a reigning monarch. \u201cWe caught him in the woods near Philadelphia. Out of uniform. Er . . . as you see, sir.\u201d He cleared his throat in emphasis. \u201cAnd he admits to being a cousin of Major General Charles Grey. You know\u2014the Paoli Massacre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Smith picked up the papers but cocked an eyebrow at Grey. \u201cWhat was he doing there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaving the shit beaten out of him by Colonel Fraser, sir\u2014he\u2019s one of Morgan\u2019s officers. He said,\u201d Woodbine added, with less certainty.</p><p>Smith looked blank.</p><p>\u201cFraser . . . don\u2019t believe I know him.\u201d Switching his attention to Grey, he addressed him for the first time. \u201cDo you know Colonel Fraser . . . Colonel Grey?\u201d</p><p>The elaborate hesitation spoke volumes. Well, he hadn\u2019t expected anything else. Grey wiped his nose as well as he could on a forearm and sat straight.</p><p>\u201cI decline to answer your questions, sir. They are improperly put. You know my name, rank, and regiment. Beyond that, my business is my own.\u201d</p> <p>Smith stared at him, eyes narrowed. Smith\u2019s eyes were rather attractive, a pale gray with black brows and lashes, very dramatic. Grey had noticed them when the man came to tea with Minnie.</p><p>Woodbine coughed.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . Colonel Fraser said the man was his prisoner, sir. But he wouldn\u2019t say what for, and when I pressed the matter, he . . . er . . . left. That\u2019s when we searched Lord . . . er, the lord colonel here, and found his papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left,\u201d Smith repeated carefully. \u201cAnd you allowed him to leave, Corporal?\u201d</p><p>Woodbine was looking less confident in the virtue of his conduct but wasn\u2019t the sort to be easily cowed, Grey saw. He lowered his brow and gave Smith a look of his own.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have stopped him, short of shooting him. Sir,\u201d he added flatly. The flesh around Smith\u2019s nostrils whitened, and Grey had the distinct impression that the Englishman must find his new command not quite what he\u2019d been used to.</p> <p>The quarters certainly weren\u2019t. While Smith\u2019s Continental uniform was smart and well tended, and his wig in good order, his tent, while large, appeared to have been through several campaigns, being worn to the threads in places and patched in others. Not entirely a bad thing, Grey thought, briefly closing his eyes as a faint evening breeze came wafting through the walls of the tent, relieving the stifling heat. He had a noticeable headache, and even such minor relief was welcome.</p><p>\u201cVery well, Corporal,\u201d Smith said after a moment, having evidently tried and failed to think of something new to ask. \u201cWell done,\u201d he added, offering a belated note of congratulation.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Woodbine hovered, obviously loath to surrender his share of the excitement. \u201cIf I may ask, sir\u2014what do you mean to do with the prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Grey opened his eye and a half, interested to hear what the answer might be, and found Smith eyeing him in what seemed a faintly carnivorous fashion. The turncoat smiled.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll think of something, Corporal Woodbine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are dismissed. Good night.\u201d</p><p>SMITH GOT UP and came over to Grey, leaning down to examine his face. Grey could smell his sweat, sharp and musky.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a doctor?\u201d he asked dispassionately, but without hostility.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grey said. Both his head and his side ached deeply, and he felt dizzy, but he doubted there was anything a doctor could do about either condition. And he found that after prolonged contact with Claire and her opinions, he had much less trust in physicians than heretofore\u2014and he hadn\u2019t had much to begin with.</p> <p>Smith nodded and, straightening up, went to a battered campaign chest and dug out two dented pewter cups and a stone bottle of what proved to be applejack. He poured two generous tots, and they sat in silence for a time, sipping.</p><p>So close to Midsummer Day, it was still bright light out, though Grey could hear the rattle and shuffle of a camp beginning the evening routine. A mule brayed loudly, and several more answered it in raucous chorus. Wagons, then . . . perhaps artillery? He breathed deeply, nostrils flaring; an artillery company had a distinct smell to it, a sort of distillation of sweat, black powder, and hot metal, much more pungent than the scent of an infantry company with their muskets\u2014the scent of searing iron seeped into an artilleryman\u2019s clothes, as well as his soul.</p><p>What came to him was not the stink of guns but the smell of roasting meat. It drifted through the tent, and his stomach growled loudly; he\u2019d eaten nothing since the beer that had been his preliminary to a preempted meal. He thought Smith\u2019s mouth twitched a little at the noise, but the colonel politely ignored it.</p><p>Smith finished his drink, refilled both cups, and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI will not plague you with questions, as you don\u2019t wish to answer them,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cbut in the interests of civil conversation, should you wish to make any inquiries of me, I should not take offense.\u201d</p><p>Grey smiled wryly.</p><p>\u201cVery gracious of you, sir. Do you wish to justify your present allegiance to me? I assure you, it\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p><p>Small red patches sprang up immediately on Smith\u2019s cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cThat was not my intent, sir,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cThen I apologize,\u201d Grey said, and took another mouthful. The sweet strong cider was assuaging his hunger pangs as well as the pain in his side, though it admittedly wasn\u2019t doing much for the dizziness. \u201cWhat sort of question did you think I might ask? What is the current state of the Continental army? I could deduce that easily enough, I think, from the state of the gentlemen who captured me, and . . . other evidence.\u201d He let his eyes roam deliberately around the tent, taking in the chipped pottery utensil under the lopsided cot, the tail of dirty linen straggling out of a portmanteau in the corner; evidently Smith had either no orderly or an inept one. For an instant, Grey felt a pang of nostalgia for Tom Byrd, the best valet he had ever had.</p><p>Smith\u2019s flush had faded; he gave a small, ironic laugh. \u201cI imagine you could. It\u2019s not much of a secret. No, I rather thought you might be curious as to what I propose to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d Grey put down his cup and rubbed gingerly at his forehead, trying not to touch the swollen area around his eye. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019d forgotten, in the surprise of seeing you. And the pleasure of your kind hospitality,\u201d he added, lifting the cup with no irony at all. \u201cCorporal Woodbine and his men appeared to think I should be promptly hanged, both on the charge of spying and on the more serious one of being related to Major General Charles Grey, who I gather is believed to have committed some atrocity at a place called Paoli.\u201d</p><p>Smith\u2019s brow creased.</p><p>\u201cDo you deny being a spy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Smith. I\u2019m a lieutenant colonel. What on earth would I be doing, spying in a deserted wood? Well, deserted until Woodbine and his merry men showed up,\u201d he added. His cup was empty; he stared into it, wondering how that had happened. With a small sigh, Smith refilled it.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I was carrying no documents of information, no secret writings\u2014no evidence whatever of spying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless you committed to memory whatever information you had gained,\u201d Smith said, sounding cynically amused. \u201cI recall that you have a prodigious memory.\u201d He gave a small snort that could perhaps have been called a snigger. \u201cSo sayeth Sally, nimble-fingered, as her grip upon his prick did linger . . .\u201d</p><p>In fact, Grey\u2019s memory was quite good. Good enough to remember a dinner at which a number of officers from different regiments had been guests. When the gentlemen were at their port, Grey had\u2014upon invitation, and to thunderous applause\u2014recited entirely from memory one of the longer, and very scabrous, odes from Harry Quarry\u2019s infamous Certain Verses Upon the Subject of Eros, copies of which were still eagerly sought and covertly passed around the circles of society, though the book had been published nearly twenty years before.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is there to spy on?\u201d he demanded, realizing the logical trap too late. Smith\u2019s mouth turned up at one corner.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to tell you?\u201d Because the answer, of course, was that Washington\u2019s entire force was likely on the move in his immediate vicinity, positioning for the move into Philadelphia\u2014and, very possibly, for an attack on Clinton\u2019s withdrawing troops.</p><p>Grey dismissed Smith\u2019s question as rhetorical and took another tack\u2014though a dangerous one.</p><p>\u201cWoodbine gave you a correct assessment of the circumstances in which he discovered me,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly I was not discovered in flagrante by Colonel Fraser, as he would simply have done what Corporal Woodbine did and arrested me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asserting that Colonel Fraser met you by arrangement, to pass on information?\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. He\u2019d known this tack was dangerous but hadn\u2019t foreseen that possibility\u2014that Jamie Fraser could be suspected of being his confederate. But of course Smith would be particularly sensitive to such a possibility, given his own change of loyalties.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d Grey said, allowing a certain asperity to creep into his tone. \u201cThe encounter that Corporal Woodbine witnessed was of a purely personal nature.\u201d</p><p>Smith, who plainly knew a thing or two about interrogation, cocked a brow at him. Grey knew a thing or two about it, too, and sat back, sipping his applejack insouciantly, as though quite sure his statement had settled matters.</p><p>\u201cThey will probably hang you, you know,\u201d Smith said after a suitable pause. He spoke quite casually, eyes on the amber stream as he refilled both cups again. \u201cAfter what Howe did to Captain Hale? Even more, after Paoli. Charles Grey is your cousin, is he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond or third cousin, yes.\u201d Grey knew the man, though they didn\u2019t move in the same circles, either socially or militarily. Charles Grey was a pig-faced professional killer, rather than a soldier, and while he doubted that the Paoli Massacre had been entirely as described\u2014what sort of idiots would lie on the ground waiting to be bayoneted in their beds? Because he didn\u2019t for an instant think a column of infantry was capable of sneaking up in the dark over rough country to within stabbing distance without giving some notice of their presence\u2014he did know about Charles\u2019s merciless bayonet tactics at Culloden.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Grey said, with as much confidence as he could summon. \u201cWhatever one may think of the American high command, I doubt it is composed entirely of fools. My execution would yield nothing, whereas my exchange might be of value. My brother does have some small influence.\u201d</p><p>Smith smiled, not without sympathy.</p><p>\u201cAn excellent argument, Lord John, and one I\u2019m sure would find favor with General Washington. Unfortunately, the Congress and the King remain at loggerheads over the matter of exchange; at present, there is no mechanism to allow the exchange of prisoners.\u201d</p><p>That one struck him in the pit of the stomach. He knew all too well that there were no official channels of exchange; he\u2019d been trying to have William exchanged for months.</p><p>Smith upended the bottle, dribbling the last amber drops into Grey\u2019s cup.</p><p>\u201cAre you a Bible-reading man, Colonel Grey?\u201d</p><p>Grey looked at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cNot habitually. I have read it, though. Some of it. Well . . . bits. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you were familiar with the concept of a scapegoat.\u201d Smith rocked back a little on his stool, gazing at Grey with his lovely deep-set eyes, which seemed to hold a certain sympathy\u2014though perhaps it was just the applejack. \u201cBecause I\u2019m afraid that is where your chief value lies, Colonel. It is no secret that the Continental army is in poor condition, lacking money, disillusion and desertion rife. Nothing would hearten and unify the troops more\u2014or send a more potent message to General Clinton\u2014than the trial and very public execution of a high-ranking British officer, a convicted spy and close relation to the infamous \u2018No Flints\u2019 Grey.\u201d</p><p>He belched softly and blinked, eyes still fixed on Grey.</p><p>\u201cYou asked what I meant to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Smith ignored this, leveling a long, knobby finger at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending you to General Wayne, who, believe me, has \u2018Paoli\u2019 carved upon his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very painful for him,\u201d Grey said politely, and drained his cup.</p><p>EINE KLEINE NACHTMUSIK</p><p>THE INTERMINABLE DAY was reluctantly ending, the heat at last beginning to fade from the forest along with the waning light. He didn\u2019t suppose that he would be taken directly to General Wayne, unless that worthy were close at hand, and he thought not. He could tell from the sounds and the feel of the camp that it was a small one, and plainly Colonel Smith was the senior officer present.</p><p>Smith had asked him, pro forma, to give his parole\u2014and been substantially taken aback when Grey had courteously refused to do so.</p><p>\u201cIf I am in fact a duly commissioned British officer,\u201d Grey had pointed out, \u201cthen clearly it is my duty to escape.\u201d</p><p>Smith eyed him, the failing light shading his face with sufficient ambiguity that Grey was not sure whether he was fighting an impulse to smile or not. Probably not. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not escaping,\u201d he said definitely, and went out. Grey could hear a brief, heated discussion, conducted in low voices outside the tent, as to just what to do with him. A militia camp on the move had no facilities for prisoners. Grey amused himself by composing a mental entertainment in which Smith was obliged to share his narrow cot with Grey, in the interests of keeping his prisoner secure.</p><p>In the end, though, a corporal came in, carrying a rusty set of fetters that looked as though they had last seen use during the Spanish Inquisition, and took Grey to the edge of camp, where a soldier who had been a blacksmith in private life banged them into place with a stout hammer, using a flattish rock as an anvil.</p><p>He felt the oddest sensations, kneeling on the ground in the twilight, an interested group of militiamen gathered round in a circle to watch. He was forced to lean forward in a crouching posture, hands laid before him, as though he were about to be beheaded, and the hammer blows echoed through the metal, into the bones of his wrists and arms.</p><p>He kept his eyes on the hammer, and not only from fear that the smith would miss his aim in the growing dusk and smash one of his hands. Under the influence of intoxication and a growing, deeper fear that he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge, he sensed the mingled curiosity and animus surrounding him and felt it as he would a nearby thunderstorm, electricity crawling over his skin, the threat of lightning annihilation so close he could smell its sharp odor, mixed with gunpowder and the heavy tang of the sweat of men.</p> <p>Ozone. His mind seized on the word, a small escape into rationality. That\u2019s what Claire called the smell of lightning. He\u2019d told her he thought it was from the Greek ozon, the neuter present participle of ozein, meaning \u201cto smell.\u201d</p><p>He began to work his way methodically through the complete conjugation; by the time he\u2019d finished, surely they would be done with it. Ozein, to smell. I smell . . .</p><p>He could smell his own sweat, sharp and sweet. In the old days, it was considered a better death, beheading. To be hanged was shameful, a commoner\u2019s death, a criminal\u2019s death. Slower. He knew that for a fact.</p><p>A final reverberating blow, and a visceral sound of satisfaction from the watching men. He was made prisoner.</p><p>THERE BEING NO shelter other than the brushy wigwams and scraps of canvas the militiamen rigged near their fires, he was escorted back to Smith\u2019s big, threadbare tent, given supper\u2014which he forced down, not much noticing what he ate\u2014and then tethered to the tent pole with a long, thin rope run through the chain of his irons, with sufficient play as to allow him to lie down or use the utensil.</p> <p>At Smith\u2019s insistence, he took the cot and did lie down with a slight groan of relief. His temples throbbed with each heartbeat, and so did the entire left side of his face, which was now radiating small jolts down into his upper teeth, very unpleasant. The pain in his side had dulled to a deep ache, almost negligible by comparison. Luckily, he was so tired that sleep swamped all discomfort, and he fell into it with a sense of profound gratitude.</p><p>He woke in the full dark sometime later, slicked with sweat, heart hammering from some desperate dream. He raised a hand to push the soaked hair off his face and felt the heavy, chafing weight of the fetters, which he\u2019d forgotten about. They clanked, and the dark figure of a sentry silhouetted in the fire glow at the entrance of the tent turned sharply toward him, but then relaxed as he turned over on the cot, clanking further.</p><p>Bugger, he thought, still groggy with sleep. Couldn\u2019t even masturbate if I wanted to. The thought made him laugh, though fortunately it came out as a mere breath of sound.</p><p>Another body turned over, rustling, shifting heavily near him. Smith, he supposed, sleeping on a canvas bed sack stuffed with grass; Grey could smell the meadow scent of dry hay, faintly musty in the humid air. The bed sack was standard issue to the British army; Smith must have kept it, along with his tent and other equipment, changing only his uniform.</p><p>Why had he turned his coat? Grey wondered vaguely, peering at Smith\u2019s humped shape, just visible against the pale canvas. Advancement? Starved as they were for professional soldiers, the Continentals offered rank as inducement; a captain in any European army might become anything from a major to a general in the blink of an eye, whereas the only means of achieving higher rank in England was to find the money to purchase it.</p><p>What was rank without pay, though? Grey was no longer a spy, but he had been one, once\u2014and still knew men who labored in those dark fields. From what he\u2019d heard, the American Congress had no money at all and depended upon loans\u2014these unpredictable in amount and erratic in occurrence. Some from French or Spanish sources, though the French wouldn\u2019t admit to it, of course. Some from Jewish moneylenders, said one of his correspondents. Salomon, Solomon . . . some name like that.</p> <p>These random musings were interrupted by a sound that made him stiffen. A woman\u2019s laughter.</p><p>There were women in the camp, wives who had come along to war with their husbands. He\u2019d seen a few when they took him across the campground, and one had brought his supper, glancing suspiciously up at him from under her cap. But he thought he knew that laugh\u2014deep, gurgling, and totally unself-conscious.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he whispered under his breath. \u201cDottie?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t impossible. He swallowed, trying to clear his left ear, to listen through the multitude of small sounds outside. Denzell Hunter was a Continental surgeon, and Dottie had\u2014to her brother\u2019s, cousin\u2019s, and uncle\u2019s horror\u2014joined the camp followers at Valley Forge in order to help her fianc\u00e9, though she rode into Philadelphia regularly to visit her brother Henry. If Washington\u2019s forces were moving\u2014and very plainly they were\u2014it was entirely possible that a surgeon might be anywhere among them.</p><p>A high, clear voice, raised in question. An English voice, and not common. He strained to hear but couldn\u2019t make out the words. He wished she\u2019d laugh again.</p><p>If it was Dottie . . . he breathed deep, trying to think. He couldn\u2019t call out to her; he\u2019d felt the avid hostility directed at him from every man in camp\u2014letting the relationship be known would be dangerous for her and Denzell, both, and certainly wouldn\u2019t help Grey. And yet he had to risk it\u2014they\u2019d move him in the morning.</p><p>Out of sheer inability to think of anything better, he sat up on the cot and began to sing \u201cDie Sommernacht.\u201d Quietly at first, but gathering strength and volume. As he hit \u201cIn den Kulungen wehn\u201d at the top of his very resonant tenor voice, Smith sat up like a jack-in-the-box and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d in tones of utter amazement.</p><p>\u201cSo umschatten mich Gedanken an das Grab</p> <p>Meiner Geliebten, und ich seh\u2019 im Walde</p><p>Nur es d\u00e4mmern, und es weht mir</p><p>Von der Bl\u00fcte nicht her.\u201d</p><p>Grey went on, reducing his volume somewhat. He didn\u2019t want Dottie\u2014if it was Dottie\u2014coming to look, only to let her know he was here. He\u2019d taught her this lied when she was fourteen; she sang it often at musicales.</p><p>\u201cIch geno\u00df einst, o ihr Toten, es mit euch!</p><p>Wie umwehten uns der Duft und die K\u00fchlung,</p><p>Wie versch\u00f6nt warst von dem Monde,</p><p>Du, o sch\u00f6ne Natur!\u201d</p><p>He stopped, coughed a little, and spoke into the marked silence before him, slurring his words a bit, as though still drunk. In fact, he discovered, he was.</p><p>\u201cMight I have some water, Colonel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you sing anymore if I give it to you?\u201d Smith asked, deeply suspicious.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m finished now,\u201d Grey assured him. \u201cCouldn\u2019 sleep, you know\u2014too much to drink\u2014but I find a song settles the mind rem-remarkably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, does it?\u201d Smith breathed heavily for a moment, but clambered to his feet and fetched the ewer from his basin. Grey could feel him repressing an urge to douse his prisoner with the contents, but Smith was a man of strong character and merely held the pitcher for him to drink, then put it back and resumed his own bed with no more than a few irritable snorts.</p><p>The lied had caused some comment in the camp, and a few musical souls took it as inspiration and began singing everything from \u201cGreensleeves\u201d\u2014a very poignant and tender rendition\u2014to \u201cChester.\u201d Grey quite enjoyed the singing, though it was only by exercise of his own strong character that he refrained from shaking his fetters at the end of:</p><p>\u201cLet tyrants shake their iron rods. And slavery clank her galling chains.\u201d</p><p>They were still singing when he fell asleep again, to dream in anxious fragments, the fumes of applejack drifting through the hollow spaces of his head.</p><p>Number 17 Chestnut Street</p><p>THE BELL OF the Presbyterian church struck midnight, but the city wasn\u2019t sleeping. The sounds were more furtive now, muffled by darkness, but the streets were still alive with hurrying feet and the sound of moving wagons\u2014and, in the far distance, I heard a faint cry of \u201cFire!\u201d being raised.</p><p>I stood by the open window, sniffing the air for smoke and watching out for any sign of flames that might spread in our direction. I wasn\u2019t aware of Philadelphia having ever burned to the ground like London or Chicago, but a fire that merely engulfed the neighborhood would be just as bad from my point of view.</p><p>There was no wind at all; that was something. The summer air hung heavy, damp as a sponge. I waited for a bit, but the cries stopped, and I saw no red glimmer of flames against the half-clouded sky. No trace of fire save the cool green sparks of fireflies, drifting among the shadowed leaves in the front garden.</p><p>I stood for a bit, letting my shoulders slump, letting go of my half-formed plans for emergency evacuation. I was exhausted but unable to sleep. Beyond the need to keep an eye on my unsettled patient, and the unsettled atmosphere beyond the quiet room, I was most unsettled in myself. I\u2019d been listening all day, constantly on the alert for a familiar footstep, the sound of Jamie\u2019s voice. But he hadn\u2019t come.</p><p>What if he had learned from John that I had shared his bed on that one drunken evening? Would the shock of that, given without preparation or suitable explanation, be enough to have made him run away\u2014for good?</p><p>I felt sudden tears come to my eyes and shut them, hard, to stem the flow, gripping the sill with both hands.</p><p>Don\u2019t be ridiculous. He\u2019ll come as soon as he can, no matter what. You know he will. I did know. But the shocked joy of seeing him alive had wakened nerves that had been numb for a long time, and while I might seem calm externally, on the inside my emotions were at a rolling boil. The steam was building up, and I had no way to release the pressure\u2014save pointless tears, and I wouldn\u2019t give way to those.</p><p>For one thing, I might not be able to stop. I pressed the sleeve of my dressing gown briefly to my eyes, then turned back resolutely into the darkness of the room.</p><p>A small brazier burned near the bed under a tented wet cloth, casting a flickering red glow on Pardloe\u2019s sharp-cut features. He was breathing with an audible rasp and I could hear his lungs rattle with each exhalation, but it was a deep breathing, and regular. It occurred to me that I might not have been able to smell the smoke of a fire outside, had there been one: the atmosphere in the room was thick with oil of peppermint, eucalyptus . . . and cannabis. Despite the wet cloth, enough smoke had escaped the brazier to form a hanging cloud of purling wisps, moving pale as ghosts in the darkened air.</p><p>I sprinkled more water on the muslin tent and sat down in the small armchair beside the bed, breathing the saturated atmosphere in cautiously but with an agreeable small sense of illicit pleasure. Hal had told me that he was in the habit of smoking hemp to relax his lungs and that it seemed to be effective. He\u2019d said \u201chemp,\u201d and that was undoubtedly what he\u2019d been smoking; the psychoactive form of the plant didn\u2019t grow in England and wasn\u2019t commonly imported.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t any hemp leaves in my medical supply but did have a good bit of ganja, which John had acquired from a Philadelphia merchant who had two Indiamen. It was useful in the treatment of glaucoma, as I\u2019d learned when treating Jamie\u2019s aunt Jocasta, it relieved nausea and anxiety\u2014and it had occasional non-medicinal uses, as John had informed me, to my private amusement.</p><p>Thought of John gave me a small internal qualm, to add to my anxiety over Jamie, and I took a deep, deliberate breath of the sweet, spicy air. Where was he? What had Jamie done with him?</p><p>\u201cDo you ever make bargains with God?\u201d Hal\u2019s voice came quietly out of the half dark.</p><p>I must subconsciously have known he wasn\u2019t sleeping, for I wasn\u2019t startled.</p><p>\u201cEveryone does,\u201d I said. \u201cEven people who don\u2019t believe in God. Do you?\u201d</p><p>There was the breath of a laugh, followed by coughing, but it stopped quickly. Perhaps the smoke was helping.</p><p>\u201cHave you got such a bargain in mind?\u201d I asked, as much from real curiosity as to make conversation. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to die, you know. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you said that,\u201d he replied dryly. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he turned on his side to face me. \u201cI do believe you,\u201d he said rather formally. \u201cAnd . . . I thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite welcome. I can\u2019t let you die in John\u2019s house, you know; he\u2019d be upset.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that, his face visible in the brazier\u2019s glow. We didn\u2019t speak for a bit but sat looking at each other, with no particular sense of self-consciousness, both of us calmed by the smoke and the sleepy chirping of crickets outside. The sound of wagon wheels had ceased, but there were still people passing by. Surely I would know Jamie\u2019s step, be able to distinguish his, even among so many. . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cJohn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said quickly, but I saw one dark brow rise and remembered that he already knew me for a bad liar. \u201cThat is . . . I\u2019m sure he\u2019s quite all right. But I would have expected him home by now. And with so much commotion in the city . . .\u201d I waved a hand toward the window. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what might happen, do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heard him draw breath, his chest rattling faintly, and clear his throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd you still decline to tell me where he is.\u201d</p><p>I lifted one shoulder and let it fall; it seemed pointless to repeat that I didn\u2019t know, even though that was the truth. Instead, I took up a comb from the table and began to deal slowly with my hair, untangling and smoothing the unruly mass, enjoying the cool feel of it in my hands. After we had bathed Hal and got him put to bed, I\u2019d taken a quarter hour for a somewhat more leisurely wash of my own and had rinsed the sweat and dust from my hair, despite knowing it would take hours to dry in the humid air.</p><p>\u201cThe bargain I had in mind was not for my own life,\u201d he said after a bit. \u201cAs such.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure John isn\u2019t going to die, either, if that\u2019s what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot John. My son. My daughter. And my grandson. You have grandchildren, I collect? I believe I heard that rather stalwart young man call you \u2018Grannie\u2019 this afternoon, did I not?\u201d His voice held a trace of amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou did, and I do. You mean Dorothea? Is something the matter with her?\u201d A stab of alarm made me set down the comb. I\u2019d seen Dottie only a few days before, at the house where her brother Henry was staying.</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that she appears to be on the verge of marrying a Rebel and declares her intent to accompany the man onto battlefields and to live with him under the most insalubrious conditions imaginable?\u201d</p><p>He sat up in bed and spoke with evident passion, but I couldn\u2019t help smiling at his mode of expression; evidently the Grey brothers shared the same habit of speech. I coughed to hide this, though, and replied as tactfully as possible.</p> <p>\u201cUm . . . you\u2019ve seen Dottie, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cShe was with Henry when I arrived yesterday, and wearing the most extraordinary garment. Evidently the man to whom she considers herself affianced is a Quaker, and she declares that she has become one, as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand,\u201d I murmured. \u201cYou . . . er . . . hadn\u2019t heard about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I had not! And I have a few things to say to John regarding both his cowardice in not telling me about it and his son\u2019s unpardonable machi . . . machinations . . .\u201d The choler in this speech literally choked him, and he had to stop and cough, wrapping his arms round his knees to steady himself against the racking spasms.</p><p>I took up the fan I\u2019d left on the table earlier and wafted a bit of smoke from the brazier into his face. He gasped, coughed harder for a moment, and then subsided, wheezing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d tell you not to excite yourself, if I thought there was the slightest chance of you listening,\u201d I remarked, handing him a cup of the boiled tincture of Ephedra in coffee. \u201cDrink that. Slowly.</p> <p>\u201cAs for John,\u201d I went on, watching him make faces over the bitter taste, \u201che considered writing to you when he found out what Dottie intended. He didn\u2019t, because at the time he thought it might be nothing more than a passing whim and that once she\u2019d seen the reality of Denny\u2019s\u2014er, that\u2019s her fianc\u00e9, Dr. Hunter\u2014of his life, she might think better of it. And if she did, there was no need to alarm you and your wife. He never expected you to turn up here.\u201d</p><p>Hal coughed once, then drew breath in a tentative fashion.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either,\u201d he said, and, putting the cup aside, coughed again and lay back against the heaped pillows. \u201cThe War Office decided to send my regiment to support Clinton when the new strategy was decided upon; there wasn\u2019t time to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich new strategy is this?\u201d I asked, only mildly interested.</p><p>\u201cTo sever the southern colonies from the north, suppress the rebellion there, and thus starve the north into submission. Keep the bloody French out of the West Indies, too,\u201d he added as an afterthought. \u201cYou think Dottie might change her mind?\u201d He sounded dubious but hopeful.</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d I said. I stretched and ran my fingers through my damp hair, which had settled softly on my neck and shoulders, curling light and tickling round my face. \u201cI wondered whether it was you or your wife she took after in terms of willfulness, but the instant I met you, it was clear.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a narrow look but had the grace to smile.</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d he admitted. \u201cSo does Benjamin\u2014my eldest son. Henry and Adam are both like my wife in terms of temperament. Which does not mean that they aren\u2019t capable of seeking their own way,\u201d he added thoughtfully. \u201cOnly that they\u2019re rather more diplomatic about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet your wife,\u201d I said, smiling, too. \u201cHer name is Minnie, John said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinerva,\u201d he said, his smile growing more genuine. \u201cMinerva Cunnegunda, to be exact. Couldn\u2019t call her \u2018Cunny,\u2019 could I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not in public, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t try it in private, either,\u201d he assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s very demure\u2014to look at.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and darted a glance at the brazier. I hadn\u2019t thought the active principle in ganja would be very strong, burned as an atmospheric rather than smoked directly. Still, it was obviously having a beneficial effect on Hal\u2019s mood as well as his asthma, and I was conscious of a slight feeling of well-being beginning to creep into my own outlook. I was still worried about Jamie\u2014and John\u2014but the worry had lifted from my shoulders and seemed to be floating a little way above my head: still visible, and a dull purple-gray in color, but floating. Like a lead balloon, I thought, and gave a small, amused snort.</p><p>Hal was lying back, eyes half lidded, watching me with a sort of detached interest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman,\u201d he said, sounding faintly surprised. \u201cNot demure, though,\u201d he added, and made a low chuckling noise. \u201cWhat could John have been thinking?\u201d</p><p>I knew what John had been thinking but didn\u2019t want to talk about it\u2014for assorted reasons.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean earlier,\u201d I asked curiously, \u201cabout making bargains with God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His eyelids closed slowly. \u201cWhen I arrived at General Clinton\u2019s office this morning\u2014God, was that only this morning?\u2014he had rather bad news for me\u2014and a letter. Sent some weeks ago from New Jersey, forwarded eventually to him through the army post.</p><p>\u201cMy eldest son, Benjamin, was captured by the Rebels at the Brandywine,\u201d he said, almost dispassionately. Almost; there was enough light for me to see the bulge of his jaw muscle. \u201cThere is at present no agreement with the Americans involving the exchange of prisoners, so he remains in captivity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d I asked, disturbed at the news.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cYet. But I shall discover his whereabouts as quickly as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGodspeed,\u201d I said sincerely. \u201cWas the letter from Benjamin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His jaw tightened a little further.</p><p>The letter had been from a young woman named Amaranthus Cowden, who informed His Grace the Duke of Pardloe that she was the wife of his son Benjamin\u2014and the mother of Benjamin\u2019s son, Trevor Wattiswade Grey, aged three months. Born after Benjamin was captured, I thought, and wondered whether Benjamin knew about the baby.</p><p>The young Mrs. Grey found herself in difficult circumstances, she wrote, owing to her husband\u2019s sad absence, and therefore proposed to go to her relatives in Charleston. She felt some delicacy in approaching His Grace for assistance, but her state was such that she felt she had little choice in the matter and hoped that he would forgive her forwardness and look kindly upon her plea. She enclosed a lock of her son\u2019s hair, feeling that His Grace might like to have such a keepsake of his grandson.</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d I said. I hesitated for a moment, but the same thought must surely have occurred to him. \u201cDo you think she\u2019s telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, a mixture of anxiety and aggravation.</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly she is. My wife\u2019s maiden name was Wattiswade, but no one outside the family would know that.\u201d He nodded toward the wardrobe where Mrs. Figg had hung his uniform. \u201cThe letter is in my coat, should you wish to read it.\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand in polite dismissal.</p><p>\u201cI see what you meant about making bargains with God. You want to live to see your grandchild\u2014and your son, of course.\u201d</p><p>He sighed again, his lean body seeming to diminish slightly. Mrs. Figg had undone his queue\u2014much against his will\u2014brushed out his hair, and tied it in a loose tail that now fell over his shoulder, a soft dark brown shot with streaks of white that glinted red and gold in the fire glow.</p><p>\u201cNot precisely. I do want that, of course, but\u2014\u201d He groped for words, quite unlike his earlier elegant loquacity. \u201cYou\u2019d die for them, happily. Your family. But at the same time you think, Christ, I can\u2019t die! What might happen to them if I weren\u2019t here?\u201d He gave me a wry and rueful smile. \u201cAnd you know bloody well that you mostly can\u2019t help them anyway; they\u2019ve got to do it\u2014or not\u2014themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d A draft of air moved the muslin curtains and stirred the hanging pall of smoke. \u201cNot the grandchildren, though. You can help them.\u201d And I suddenly missed Henri-Christian\u2019s soft weight, his solid head against my shoulder; I\u2019d saved his life by removing his tonsils and adenoids, and I thanked God that I\u2019d been in time to do it. And Mandy . . . God, take care of her, I prayed fiercely. I\u2019d been able to tell Bree what was wrong and that it could be fixed\u2014but I couldn\u2019t fix her heart defect, and I regretted that lack every day of my life. If I could have done the necessary surgery in this time, they\u2019d all still be here. . . .</p><p>The curtains moved again, and the heavy atmosphere drew a clean, sudden breath. I inhaled deeply, catching the faint, sharp scent of ozone. \u201cRain,\u201d I said. \u201cRain\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>The duke didn\u2019t reply but turned, lifting his face toward the window. I got up and raised the sash higher, gratefully letting in a cool breeze. I looked out into the night again; clouds were drifting fast across the moon, so the light seemed to pulse rather than flicker, like the beat of a palpitating heart. The streets were dark, with no more than the occasional glow of a moving lantern to mark the muted agitation of the city.</p><p>Rain might damp the movement, both of fleeing Loyalists and the army readying itself to depart. Would the cover of the storm make it easier for Jamie to come into the city? A bad storm might hamper him, turning the roads to mud. How far away was he?</p><p>The lead balloon had come down on my head. My mood had taken a plunge, whether from fatigue, the oncoming storm, or merely as a natural effect of cannabinol, I didn\u2019t know. I shivered, though the air was still hot, unable to keep my brain from projecting vivid images of all the dire possibilities that could befall a man caught between two armies, alone in the night.</p><p>Maybe alone. What had he done with John? Surely he wouldn\u2019t have\u2014</p><p>\u201cI was twenty-one when my father died,\u201d Hal remarked out of the blue. \u201cGrown. Had my own life, had a wife\u2014\u201d He broke off abruptly, his mouth twisting. \u201cDidn\u2019t think I needed him at all, until he suddenly wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could he have done for you?\u201d I asked, sitting down again. I was curious\u2014but also anxious to avoid my own racing thoughts.</p><p>Hal lifted one slender shoulder. The neck of the nightshirt was unbuttoned, both because of the heat and so I could more easily see the pulse in his neck. It fell open, the cloth limp with moisture, and his clavicle showed, high-arched and clean, shadowed sharp against his skin.</p><p>\u201cBeen there,\u201d he said simply. \u201cListened. Perhaps . . . approved of what I was doing.\u201d The last few words came low, barely audible. \u201cOr maybe not. But . . . been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d I said, more to myself than to him. I\u2019d been lucky; I was very young when my parents died, and my uncle had stepped promptly into my life, to be there for me. And casual as his own life had been\u2014he always was there. I\u2019d felt his loss acutely when he died, but I\u2019d been married then\u2014a spasm of guilt seized me out of nowhere, thinking of Frank. And another, worse, thinking of Brianna. I\u2019d left her, once\u2014and then she had left me.</p><p>That unleashed a jumble of morbid thoughts: of Laoghaire, abandoned by both daughters, unlikely ever to see her grandchildren, now mine. Of Jem and Mandy . . . and Jamie.</p><p>Where was he? And why wasn\u2019t he here? Surely, whatever John might have told him . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said hopelessly, under my breath. I could feel the tears prick and well, pressing up against the dam of my determination.</p><p>\u201cDo you know, I\u2019m most remarkably hungry,\u201d Hal said, sounding surprised. \u201cIs there any food in the house?\u201d</p><p>JAMIE\u2019S STOMACH GROWLED, and he coughed to cover the sound, but there was no need. The little girls were curled up like a pair of capped hedgehogs under a tattered quilt by the hearth, back to back and snoring like drunken bumblebees. Mrs. Hardman was on the settle, singing to the baby under her breath. He couldn\u2019t make out the words, so he couldn\u2019t tell what song it was, but imagined it to be a lullaby. On the other hand, he\u2019d heard Highland women sing their babes asleep often enough with things like \u201cNighean Nan Geug,\u201d which dealt with severed heads and blood-soaked ground. But Mrs. Hardman was a Friend; presumably she\u2019d have no truck with that sort of lullaby. Maybe \u201cThe Great Silkie of Sule Skerry,\u201d he thought, beginning to relax. Clearly Friends had no objection to carnal relations as such . . .</p><p>That reminded him of bloody John Grey, and he grimaced, then stifled a grunt as his back sent a warning shot down his leg, indicating that even that much movement wouldn\u2019t be tolerated.</p><p>The song was no more music to him than the snoring, but both were gentle sounds, and he eased himself cautiously, checked that knife and pistol were easily to hand, and shut his eyes. He was tired to the bone but doubted he\u2019d sleep. He couldn\u2019t even shift himself in the bed without white stabs of pain jabbing him in the backside like the devil\u2019s pitchfork. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had been years since his back had last done this to him. Ached frequently, now and then was stiff in the morning, but it hadn\u2019t done this in . . . ten years? He remembered it vividly. It was soon after they\u2019d come to the Ridge, just after he and Ian built the cabin. He\u2019d gone out a-hunting, sprung over a bank in pursuit of a fleeing elk, and found himself lying on his face at the foot of the bank, quite unable to move.</p><p>Claire, bless her, had come searching for him\u2014he smiled wryly at thought of it; she\u2019d been so proud of tracking him through the forest. If she hadn\u2019t found him . . . well, it would have been the luck of the draw as to whether a painter, bear, or wolf came upon him before his back released its clench and let him move. He supposed he wouldn\u2019t have died of cold, though he might well have lost a few toes to frostbite.</p><p>She\u2014</p><p>A sound brought his head up, fast. His back stabbed viciously, but he set his teeth, ignoring it, and pulled the pistol out from underneath his pillow.</p> <p>Mrs. Hardman\u2019s head jerked up at his movement. She stared at him, wide-eyed, then heard what he had heard and got up hastily. Feet on the path, more than one pair. She turned, looking for the cradle, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cKeep the bairnie with ye,\u201d he said, low-voiced. \u201cAnswer when they knock, open if they ask.\u201d</p><p>He saw her swallow, but she did as he said. There were three or four, he thought, but not bent on mischief. There were feet on the porch, low murmurs, and a bit of laughing. A knock, and Mrs. Hardman called, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends, missus,\u201d said a man\u2019s voice, slurred with drink. \u201cLet us in.\u201d</p><p>She cast a frightened glance at Jamie, but he nodded, and she lifted the latch, opening the door to the night. The first man started to come in but then saw Jamie on the bed and stopped, mouth open.</p> <p>\u201cGood evenin\u2019 to ye,\u201d Jamie said, polite, but holding the other man\u2019s eyes with his own. The pistol lay in plain sight, under his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said the other man, disconcerted. He was young and rather stout, dressed in hunting garb but with a militia badge; he glanced over his shoulder at his companions, who had stopped on the threshold. \u201cI\u2014er\u2014good evening to you, sir. We didn\u2019t\u2014er\u2014we thought . . .\u201d He cleared his throat.</p><p>Jamie smiled at him, well aware what he thought. Keeping the man in sight from the corner of his eye, he turned to Mrs. Hardman and gestured to her to sit down. She did and bent her head over the child, brushing her lips over Chastity\u2019s tiny cap.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve nothing to offer ye in the way of food, gentlemen,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cBut there\u2019s cold water from the well, and a bed in the shed, if ye need it.\u201d</p><p>The other two men stood outside, shuffling awkwardly. There was a strong smell of liquor coming off them, but they hadn\u2019t come in a mood to do damage.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d the young man said, backing up to his friends. His round face was flushed, as much with embarrassment as with liquor. \u201cWe\u2019ll just . . . sorry to disturb you. Sir.\u201d</p> <p>The other two bobbed their heads, and all three retreated, shuffling and bumping into one another in their haste to leave. The last one pulled the door to, but not all the way. Mrs. Hardman rose and pushed it to with a small bang, then leaned against it, her eyes closed, the child clasped against her bosom.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll not come back. Put the bairn down and bar the door, aye?\u201d</p><p>She did, then turned and leaned against the door, her hands pressed flat against it. She looked at the floor between her feet, breathing audibly for a moment, then slowly straightened.</p><p>Her plain jacket was fastened with pins\u2014he didn\u2019t know if this was to avoid the vanity of buttons, as the Moravians did, or whether she was simply too poor to have any. Her fingers fiddled nervously with the top pin, and then she suddenly pulled it out and laid it glinting on the shelf. She looked directly at him then, her fingers gripping the head of the next pin. Her long upper lip was pressed down, and a nervous sweat glistened on it.</p><p>\u201cDinna even think about it,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cIn my present condition, I couldna swive a dead sheep. To say nothing of which, I\u2019m old enough to be your father, lass\u2014and I\u2019m marrit, forbye.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quivered slightly, though he couldn\u2019t tell whether with disappointment or relief. Her fingers relaxed, though, and her hand dropped to her side.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna need to pay me for the food, lass,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a gift.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014yes, I know. I thank thee, Friend.\u201d She looked aside, swallowing a little. \u201cI only\u2014I hoped that perhaps\u2014thee might stay. For a time.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m marrit, lass,\u201d he repeated gently, then, after an uncomfortable pause, felt compelled to ask, \u201cDo ye have such callers often?\u201d It had been clear to him that the men were strangers to her\u2014but she was not to them. They\u2019d heard of the Quaker woman who lived alone with three young girls.</p><p>\u201cI take them to the shed,\u201d she blurted, her face going redder than the flames made it. \u201cAfter the girls are asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said, after another pause that lasted much too long. His eyes went to the cradle but then shot away. He wondered how long Mr. Hardman had been gone from home, but it wasn\u2019t his business. Nor was it his business how she managed to feed her girls.</p><p>\u201cSleep, lass,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch.\u201d</p><p>MORNING AIR AWASH WITH ANGELS</p><p>Next day</p><p>JAMIE AWOKE TO THE smell of frying meat and sat up straight in bed, forgetting his back.</p><p>\u201cLord have mercy,\u201d said Mrs. Hardman, looking over her shoulder. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a noise like that since the last time my husband, Gabriel, killed a pig.\u201d She shook her head and returned to her cookery, pouring batter into an oiled cast-iron spider that sat in the coals, smoking and spitting in a baleful sort of way.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilvia is my name, Friend. And thine?\u201d she asked, raising one brow at him.</p><p>\u201cFriend Silvia,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cMy name Is Jamie. Jamie Fraser.\u201d He\u2019d raised his knees in the involuntary jerk that brought him upright, and now he wrapped his arms around them and laid his sweating face against the worn quilt that covered them, trying to stretch his recalcitrant back. The effort shot pain down his right leg and caused an instant sharp cramp in his left calf muscle, which made him grunt and pant until it let go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see thee sit up, Friend Jamie,\u201d Silvia Hardman remarked, bringing him a plate filled with sausage, fried onions, and johnnycake. \u201cYour back is some better, I collect?\u201d She smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat,\u201d he managed, and smiled back as well as he could while trying not to groan. \u201cYou\u2014have fresh food, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, God be thanked,\u201d she said fervently. \u201cI sent Pru and Patience out to the main road at dawn to watch for wagons coming in to the market in Philadelphia, and they came back with a pound of sausage, two of cornmeal, a sack of oats, and a dozen eggs. Eat up!\u201d She placed the wooden plate on the bed beside him, with a wooden spoon.</p><p>Jamie could see Prudence and Patience behind their mother, industriously wiping sausage grease from their empty plates with chunks of johnnycake. Easing himself gingerly around in order to put his back against the wall, he stretched out his legs, picked up the plate, and followed their example.</p><p>The food filled him with a surprising sense of well-being, and he put down the empty plate determined upon enterprise.</p><p>\u201cI propose to visit your privy, Friend Silvia. But I may need some assistance to rise.\u201d</p><p>Once on his feet, he found that he could make shift to stagger a few inches at a time, and Prudence and Patience at once rushed up to seize him by the elbows, in the manner of small flying buttresses.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Prudence advised him, squaring her puny shoulders and looking confidently up at him. \u201cWe won\u2019t let thee fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure ye won\u2019t,\u201d he said gravely. In fact, the little girls had a wiry strength that belied their fragile appearance, and he found their presence an actual help, as they provided something for him to hold on to for balance when it was necessary to stop\u2014as it was every few feet.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the wagons that go into Philadelphia,\u201d he said at one such stop, as much to make conversation as because he required the information. \u201cDo they come only in the early morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly,\u201d Patience said. \u201cThey go back empty an hour or two before sunset.\u201d She set her feet wider, bracing herself. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she assured him. \u201cLean on me. Thee seems summat shaky.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder gently in thanks and let her take a very little of his weight. Shaky, indeed. It was more than half a mile to the main road; it would take over an hour to totter that far, even with the girls\u2019 assistance, and the likelihood of his back freezing again and stranding him midway was yet too high to risk it. To say nothing of the risk of arriving in Philadelphia completely unable to move. By tomorrow, though . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd did ye see soldiers on the road?\u201d he asked, essaying a ginger step that shot pain from hip to foot. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Patience said, taking a tighter grip on his elbow. \u201cCourage, Friend. Thee will prevail. We saw two companies of militia, and one Continental officer on a mule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw some British solders, too, though,\u201d Prudence put in, eager not to be overlooked. \u201cThey were with a train of carts, going in the other direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other\u2014away from Philadelphia?\u201d Jamie asked, his heart jumping. Was the evacuation of the British army already begun? \u201cCould you see what was in the carts?\u201d</p><p>Prudence shrugged. \u201cFurniture. Trunks and baskets. There were ladies riding atop some of the carts, though mostly they walked alongside. No room,\u201d she clarified. \u201cGuard thy shirttail, Friend, or thy modesty will be at risk.\u201d The morning was cool and breezy, and an errant gust of wind had risen up, bellying his shirt\u2014wonderful on his sweating body, but definitely a risk to maiden eyes.</p><p>\u201cShall I knot the tails between thy legs?\u201d Patience inquired. \u201cI can tie a granny knot, an overhand knot, or a square knot. My daddy taught me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Patience,\u201d her sister said crossly. \u201cIf thee knots his shirt, how will he lift it to shit? No one can untie her knots,\u201d she confided to Jamie. \u201cShe always makes them too tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do not, liar!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFie upon thee, sister! I\u2019ll tell Mummy what thee said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is your father?\u201d Jamie interrupted, wanting to stop the acrimony before they began pulling each other\u2019s hair. They did stop and glanced at each other for a moment before replying.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Prudence said, her voice small and sad. \u201cHe went a-hunting one day a year ago and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be that Indians took him,\u201d Patience said, trying to sound hopeful. \u201cIf so, may be that he\u2019ll escape one day and come home.\u201d</p><p>Prudence sighed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cMummy thinks the militia shot him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jamie asked, looking down at her. \u201cWhy would they shoot him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor being a Friend,\u201d Patience explained. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t fight, and so they said he was a Loyalist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Was\u2014er, I mean\u2014is he?\u201d</p><p>Prudence looked at him, grateful for the \u201cis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. But Mummy says Philadelphia yearly meeting told everyone that all Friends should be for the King, as the King would keep peace and the Rebels seek to break it. So\u201d\u2014she shrugged\u2014\u201cpeople think all Friends are Loyalists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy wasn\u2019t\u2014isn\u2019t,\u201d Patience put in. \u201cHe used to say all kinds of things about the King, and Mummy would get worried and beg him to hold his tongue. Here\u2019s the privy,\u201d she announced unnecessarily, letting go of Jamie\u2019s elbow in order to open the door. \u201cDon\u2019t wipe thyself with the towel; it\u2019s for hands. There are corncobs in the basket.\u201d</p><p>JOHN GREY WOKE feverish and heavy-limbed, with a pounding headache, and a stabbing pain in his left eye when he tried to open it. Both his eyes were crusted and gummy. He\u2019d been dreaming in vivid, fractured swaths, a confusion of images, voices, emotions . . . Jamie Fraser had been shouting at him, face dark with passion, but then something changed, some sort of pursuit began, and he fell back into queasy nightmare. They were running together through a bog, a sucking quagmire that pulled at his steps, and Fraser was struggling just ahead of him, trapped, shouting at him to go back, but he couldn\u2019t, his feet were mired fast and he was sinking, flailing madly but unable to get a purchase on anything . . .</p><p>\u201cGaah!\u201d A hand shook him by the shoulder, startling him out of the morass. He pried his good eye open and saw the wavering form of a neat young man in a dark coat and spectacles, peering down at him in an oddly familiar way.</p><p>\u201cJohn Grey?\u201d said the young man.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said. He swallowed painfully. \u201cHave I\u2014the honor of your acquaintance, sir?\u201d</p><p>The young man flushed a bit.</p><p>\u201cThee has, Friend Grey,\u201d he said, low-voiced. \u201cI am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Grey said, sitting up in a rush. \u201cOf course, you\u2014oh. Oh, Jesus.\u201d His head, disturbed by the abrupt change of posture, had apparently decided to fly off his shoulders and thump into the nearest wall. The young man . . . Hunter, he thought, finding the name turn up with an odd neatness among the chaos inside his skull. Dr. Hunter. Dottie\u2019s Quaker.</p><p>\u201cI think thee had best lie down, Friend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think I had best vomit first.\u201d</p><p>Hunter snatched the pot out from under the cot just in time.

He nudged Hunter aside and bent over Grey.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me, Colonel?\u201d he asked, speaking in the slow, distinct manner one used with idiots and foreigners.</p><p>\u201cIch bin ein Fisch . . .\u201d Grey murmured beatifically, and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHis pulse is much disordered,\u201d Hunter said warningly, his thumb pressing Grey\u2019s wrist. His hand was cool and firm; Grey found the touch comforting. \u201cI really cannot answer for the consequences should he be moved abruptly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Smith stood still for a moment; Grey could hear his heavy breathing but forbore opening his eyes. \u201cVery well, then.\u201d He gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cIf Mohammed cannot go to the mountain, then the mountain will jolly well have to come here. I\u2019ll send a note to General Wayne. Do what you can, please, to see that he\u2019s coherent, Doctor?\u201d</p> <p>HE COULD SEE Denzell Hunter out of his damaged eye; that was reassuring: he wasn\u2019t blind. Yet. Hunter had removed his spectacles in order to peer more closely into the injured organ; he had very nice eyes himself, Grey thought\u2014the iris just the light-brown color of the flesh of a ripe olive, with tiny streaks of deep green.</p><p>\u201cLook up, please,\u201d Hunter murmured.</p><p>Grey tried to oblige.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? Look down.\u201d This attempt was no more successful, nor could he move the eye to the right or left. It seemed to have solidified in its socket, like a hard-boiled egg. He put this theory to Hunter, who smiled, though in a rather worried way.</p><p>\u201cThere is a great deal of swelling, to be sure. Whatever struck thee did so with a good deal of force.\u201d Hunter\u2019s fingers moved gently over Grey\u2019s face, prodding here and there in a questioning manner. \u201cDoes this\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he did. Don\u2019t keep asking if it hurts; everything from my scalp to my chin hurts, including my left ear. What you said regarding extravasation of blood into the brain\u2014did you mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Hunter did smile at that, though. \u201cBut since thee has shown no disposition to seizure or unconsciousness\u2014save that due to alcohol\u2014and thee apparently walked for several hours following the injury, I think perhaps the probability is lower. There is bleeding beneath the sclera, though.\u201d His cool fingertips brushed the puffy lid. \u201cThy eyeball is crimson, as is the lining of thy eyelid. It\u2019s rather . . . dramatic.\u201d There was a distinct tone of amusement in this, which Grey found reassuring.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cHow long will it take to go away?\u201d</p><p>That made the Quaker grimace and shake his head.</p><p>\u201cThe blood will take a week to a month to clear; it\u2019s essentially the same as mere bruising\u2014the bursting of small blood vessels under the skin. What worries me is thy inability to move the eye. I think thee has a fracture of the bony orbit, which is somehow trapping the orbicularis muscle. I do wish thy wife was here; she has a much greater\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife,\u201d Grey said blankly. \u201cOh!\u201d Memory and realization collided, and he felt a sudden leap of spirit. \u201cShe isn\u2019t my wife! Not anymore,\u201d he added, and found himself grinning. He leaned forward to whisper into Hunter\u2019s astonished ear, \u201cJamie Fraser isn\u2019t dead!\u201d</p><p>Hunter stared at him, blinked, put his spectacles back on, and resumed staring, obviously rethinking his appraisal of Grey\u2019s brain.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who hit me,\u201d Grey said helpfully. \u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he added at Hunter\u2019s frown. \u201cI was asking for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod be praised,\u201d Hunter whispered, breaking into a huge smile\u2014apparently at the news of Fraser\u2019s survival rather than Grey\u2019s assurance of the morality of his actions. \u201cIan will be\u2014\u201d He broke off with a gesture indicating his inability to describe Ian Murray\u2019s probable emotions.</p><p>\u201cAnd Friend Claire!\u201d he exclaimed, eyes huge behind his spectacles. \u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d Approaching footsteps made Grey hurl himself back onto the cot, with a completely authentic exclamation of pain. He shut his eyes and rolled his head to one side, groaning.</p><p>\u201cThe mountain seems to be with General Washington,\u201d Smith said, plainly disedified. Grey felt him come to a stop by the cot, bumping it with his legs. \u201cDo what you can to see that he\u2019s capable of travel by tomorrow, Doctor\u2014we\u2019ll load him into one of the wagons, if necessary.\u201d</p><p>Number 17 Chestnut Street</p><p>HIS GRACE WOKE up in the morning red-eyed as a ferret and in roughly the same temper as a rabid badger. Had I a tranquilizing dart, I would have shot him with it without an instant\u2019s hesitation. As it was, I prescribed a large slug of brandy to be added to his breakfast coffee and\u2014after a brief struggle with my Hippocratic conscience\u2014added a very small amount of laudanum to it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t give him much; it depressed the respiration, among other things. Still, I reasoned, counting the aromatic reddish-brown drops as they plinked into the brandy, it was a more humane way of dealing with him than crowning him with the chamber pot or calling Mrs. Figg to sit on him whilst I tied him to the bedstead and gagged him.</p><p>And I did require him to be both immobile and quiet for a short period. Mr. Figg, a preacher of the Methodist Society, was bringing round two young men of the society who were carpenters, to rehang the front door and nail boards over the shutters of the downstairs windows, in case of roving mobs. I\u2019d told Mrs. Figg that of course she might confide our circumstances to her husband\u2014I couldn\u2019t very well stop her\u2014but that perhaps he might be persuaded not to mention His Grace\u2019s presence, in the interests of protecting Lord John\u2019s safety and property\u2014to say nothing of His Grace, who was, after all, Lord John\u2019s presumably beloved brother.</p><p>Mrs. Figg would cheerfully have handed the duke over to be tarred and feathered, but an appeal on Lord John\u2019s behalf would always carry weight with her, and she nodded in sober agreement. So long as His Grace didn\u2019t draw attention to himself by shouting out of the upstairs window or hurling things at the workmen, she thought his presence could be concealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat you mean to do with him, though, Lady John?\u201d she asked, glancing warily toward the ceiling. We were standing in the back parlor, conferring in lowered voices while Jenny administered Hal\u2019s breakfast and made sure all the brandy-laced coffee was drunk. \u201cAnd what if the army sends someone round to ask after him?\u201d</p><p>I made a helpless gesture.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I confessed. \u201cI just need to keep him here until either Lord John or my\u2014er, Mr. Fraser\u2014comes. They\u2019ll know what to do with him. As for the army, if anyone comes asking after His Grace, I\u2019ll . . . um . . . speak to them.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a look indicating that she\u2019d heard better plans, but nodded reluctantly and went off to fetch her marketing basket. The first thing that happens in a newly occupied city is a shortage of food, and with the Continental army poised to descend on Philadelphia like a plague of locusts, the wagons that normally brought in produce from the countryside would likely be sparse. If either army was on the road already, they\u2019d be seizing anything that came along.</p><p>At the door, though, Mrs. Figg paused and turned around.</p><p>\u201cWhat about William?\u201d she demanded. \u201cIf he comes back . . .\u201d She was obviously torn between hope that he would come back\u2014she was worried for him\u2014and consternation at what might happen if he encountered his uncle in captivity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to him,\u201d I repeated firmly, and waved a hand toward the door.</p><p>Running upstairs, I found Hal yawning over a nearly empty breakfast tray and Jenny fastidiously wiping egg yolk off the corner of his mouth. She\u2019d spent the night at the printshop but had come back to help, bringing with her a battered portmanteau filled with possibly useful items.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace made a good breakfast,\u201d she reported, stepping back to examine her work critically. \u201cAnd he\u2019s moved his bowels. I made him do that afore he drank his coffee, just in case. Wasna sure how quick it might be.\u201d</p><p>Hal frowned at her, though whether in puzzlement or offense, I couldn\u2019t tell. His pupils were already noticeably constricted, which gave him a slightly staring look. He blinked at me and shook his head, as though trying to clear it.</p><p>\u201cLet me have a quick check of your vital signs, Your Grace,\u201d I said, smiling and feeling like Judas. He was my patient\u2014but Jamie was my husband, and I hardened my resolve.</p><p>His pulse was slow and quite regular, which reassured me. I took out my stethoscope, unbuttoned his nightshirt, and had a listen: a nice, steady heartbeat, no palpitations, but the lungs were gurgling like a leaky cistern, and his breathing was interrupted by small gasps.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d best have some of the Ephedra tincture,\u201d I said, straightening up. It was a stimulant and would antagonize the opiate in his system, but I couldn\u2019t risk his stopping breathing while asleep. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with him; will you go down and get a cup\u2014don\u2019t bother heating it, cold will do.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d stay conscious long enough to have a cup heated.</p><p>\u201cI really must go to see General Clinton this morning,\u201d Pardloe said, with surprising firmness, considering his foggy mental state. He cleared his throat and coughed. \u201cThere are arrangements to make. . . . My regiment . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Er . . . where is your regiment just now?\u201d I asked cautiously. If they were in Philadelphia, Hal\u2019s adjutant would be starting to look for him in earnest at any minute. He might reasonably have spent the night with a son or daughter, but by now . . . and I didn\u2019t know precisely how much distraction value my forged notes might have had.</p><p>\u201cNew York,\u201d he replied. \u201cOr at least I sincerely hope so.\u201d He closed his eyes, swayed slightly, then straightened his back with a jerk. \u201cLanded there. I came down to Philadelphia . . . to see Henry . . . Dottie.\u201d His face twisted with pain. \u201cMean . . . to go back with Clinton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said soothingly, trying to think. When, exactly, would Clinton and his troops leave? Assuming Pardloe to be sufficiently recovered that he wouldn\u2019t actually die without my attendance, I could give him back as soon as the exodus was under way. At that point, he\u2019d have no way of starting a major search for John and endangering Jamie. But surely Jamie\u2014with or without John\u2014would come back at any moment?</p><p>Who did come back was Jenny, with the Ephedra tincture\u2014and a hammer in the pocket of her apron and three stout laths under her arm. She handed me the cup without comment and proceeded to nail the laths over the window, in a surprisingly brisk and competent manner.</p><p>Hal sipped his Ephedra slowly, watching Jenny with bemusement.</p><p>\u201cWhy is she doing that?\u201d he asked, though not as if he cared particularly what the answer was.</p><p>\u201cHurricanes, Your Grace,\u201d she said with a straight face, and zipped out to return the hammer to the carpenters, whose cheerful banging sounded like a battalion of woodpeckers attacking the house.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Hal said. He was glancing vaguely round the room, possibly in search of his breeches, which Mrs. Figg had thoughtfully taken away and hidden in the cookhouse. His eye rested on the small pile of Willie\u2019s books I had moved to the top of the dressing table. Evidently he recognized one or more, because he said, \u201cOh. William. Where is William?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Willie\u2019s very busy today,\u201d I said, and picked up his wrist again. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ll see him later.\u201d His heartbeat was slow but still strong. Just as his grip loosened, I caught the empty cup and set it on the table. His head drooped, and I eased him carefully back on the pillow, propped for easier breathing.</p><p>\u201cIf he comes back . . .\u201d Mrs. Figg had said of Willie, with the obvious implication, \u201cwhat then?\u201d</p><p>What indeed?</p><p>Colenso had not returned, so presumably he had found William; that was reassuring. But what William was doing\u2014or thinking . . .</p><p>INCIPIENT THUNDER</p><p>\u201cAN ASSIGNMENT BEFITTING your peculiar situation,\u201d Major Findlay had said. Findlay didn\u2019t know the half of it, William reflected bitterly. Not that his situation wasn\u2019t \u201cpeculiar,\u201d even without his recent discoveries.</p><p>He had surrendered at Saratoga, with the rest of Burgoyne\u2019s army, in October of \u201977. The British soldiers and their German allies had been obliged to yield their weapons but were not to be held prisoner; the Convention of Saratoga, signed by Burgoyne and by the Continental general, Gates, had stated that all troops would be allowed to return to Europe, once they had given their parole not to take up arms again in the American conflict.</p><p>But ships could not sail during the winter storms, and something had to be done with the captured soldiers. Referred to as the Convention army, they had been marched en masse to Cambridge, Massachusetts, there to await spring and repatriation. All but William and a few like him, who had either connections in America with influence, or connections with Sir Henry, who had succeeded Howe as commander in chief of the American campaign. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>William, fortunate fellow, had both; he had served on Howe\u2019s personal staff, his uncle was the colonel of a regiment, and his father was an influential diplomat, presently in Philadelphia. He had been released under an exceptional personal parole, as a favor to General Lord Howe, and sent to Lord John. He was, however, still part of the British army, merely precluded from actual fighting. And the army had any number of obnoxious chores that did not involve fighting; General Clinton had been delighted to make use of him.</p><p>Deeply galled by his situation, William had begged his father to try to have him exchanged; that would remove the conditions of his parole and allow him to resume full military duties. Lord John had been quite willing to do this, but in January of 1778 there had been a falling-out between General Burgoyne and the Continental Congress over the former\u2019s refusal to provide a list of the surrendered soldiers. The Convention of Saratoga had been repudiated by the Congress, which then declared that it would detain the entire Convention army until the convention and the required list were ratified by King George\u2014the Congress knowing damned well that the King would do no such thing, as such an act would be tantamount to acknowledging the independence of the colonies. The upshot of this was that there was at present no mechanism at all for the exchange of prisoners. Any prisoners.</p><p>Which left William in a deeply ambiguous position. Technically, he was an escaped prisoner, and in the highly unlikely event that he was recaptured by the Americans and discovered to be one of the Saratoga officers, he would promptly be marched off to Massachusetts to languish for the rest of the war. At the same time, no one was quite sure whether it was appropriate for him to take up arms again, since even though the convention had been repudiated, William had been given a personal parole.</p><p>Which had led to William\u2019s present invidious situation, in charge of troops assisting the evacuation of Philadelphia\u2019s richest Loyalists. The only thing he could think of that might be worse was driving a herd of swine through the eye of a needle.</p> <p>While the poorer citizens who felt endangered by the proximity of General Washington\u2019s militias were obliged to brave the dangers of the road, making their exodus by wagon, handcart, and foot, the wealthier Loyalists were allowed a safer and theoretically more luxurious removal by ship. And not one of them could be brought to understand that there was but one ship presently available\u2014General Howe\u2019s own ship\u2014and very limited room aboard it.</p><p>\u201cNo, madam, I\u2019m very sorry, but it\u2019s quite impossible to accommodate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, young man, my husband\u2019s grandfather purchased that tall clock in the Netherlands in 1670. It displays not only the time but also the phases of the moon and a complete table of tides for the Bay of Napoli! Surely you do not expect me to allow such an instrument to fall into the clutches of the Rebels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, madam, I\u2019m afraid I do. No, sir, no servants; only the members of your immediate family and a very small amount of baggage. I\u2019m sure that your bond servants will be perfectly safe following by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll starve!\u201d exclaimed a cadaverous-looking gentleman who was loath to part with his talented cook and a plumply voluptuous housemaid, who, if not talented at sweeping, obviously had other desirable abilities, these clearly on display. \u201cOr be abducted! They are my responsibility! Surely you cannot\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can,\u201d said William firmly, with an appreciative sideways glance at the housemaid, \u201cand I must. Corporal Higgins, please see Mr. Hennings\u2019s bond servants safely off the quay. No, madam. I agree that the matched armchairs are quite valuable, but so are the lives of the people who will drown if the ship sinks. You may take your carriage clock, yes.\u201d He raised his voice and bellowed, \u201cLieutenant Rendill!\u201d</p><p>Rendill, face red and streaming, fought his way through the crowd of pushing, cursing, heaving, shrieking evacuees. Arriving in front of William, who was perched on a box in order to avoid being trampled or pushed into the water by the crowd, the lieutenant saluted but was rudely jostled by several people attempting to gain William\u2019s attention and ended with his wig pushed over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d he said gamely, pushing it back and elbowing a gentleman out of the way as politely as possible.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a list of General Howe\u2019s particular acquaintances, Rendill. Go on board and see if they\u2019ve all made it\u2014if they haven\u2019t . . .\u201d He cast an eloquent glance over the surging throng on the dock, surrounded by mountains of semi-abandoned possessions and trampled baggage, and thrust the list unceremoniously into the lieutenant\u2019s hand. \u201cFind them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d said Rendill. \u201cI mean . . . yes, sir. At once, sir.\u201d And, with a hopeless air, he turned and began to swim through the crowd, doing a modified but vigorous form of br**ststroke.</p><p>\u201cRendill!\u201d</p> <p>Rendill obediently turned and made his way resignedly back into earshot, a stout red porpoise surging his way through shoals of hysterical herring.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>William leaned down and lowered his voice to a level inaudible to the press of people around them, then nodded at the piles of furniture and baggage heaped unsteadily all over the dock\u2014many of them dangerously close to the edge.</p><p>\u201cAs you pass, tell the fellows on the dock that they should take no great pains to preserve those heaps of things from falling into the river, would you?\u201d</p><p>Rendill\u2019s perspiring face brightened amazingly.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d He saluted and swam off again, radiating renewed enthusiasm, and William, his soul slightly soothed, turned courteously to attend to the complaint of a harried German father with six daughters, all of them carrying what appeared to be their entire lavish wardrobes, anxious round faces peering out between the brims of their wide straw hats and the piles of silk and lace in their arms.</p><p>Paradoxically, the heat and incipient thunder in the air suited his mood, and the sheer impossibility of his task relaxed him. Once he\u2019d realized the ultimate futility of satisfying all these people\u2014or even one in ten of them\u2014he stopped worrying about it, took what steps he could to preserve order, and let his mind go elsewhere while he bowed courteously and made noises of reassurance to the phalanx of faces pressing in upon him.</p><p>Had he been in a mood for irony, he reflected, there was plenty of it to go round. He was neither fish nor fowl nor good red beef, as the country folk said of an ambiguous cut of meat. Not a full soldier, not a free civilian. And, evidently, neither an Englishman nor an earl . . . and yet . . . how could he possibly not be an Englishman, for God\u2019s sake?</p> <p>Once he had regained enough of his temper to think, he had realized that he was still legally the Ninth Earl of Ellesmere, regardless of his paternity. His parents\u2014his real parents\u2014his theoretically real parents\u2014had undeniably been married at the time of his birth. At the moment, though, that seemed to make matters worse: how could he go about letting people think and act as though he were the heir of Ellesmere\u2019s ancient blood when he knew damned well that he was really the son of\u2014</p><p>He choked that thought off, shoving it violently to the back of his mind. \u201cSon of\u201d had brought Lord John vividly to mind, though. He breathed deep of the hot, murky, fish-smelling air, trying to quell the sudden pang that came to him at thought of Papa.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wanted to admit it to himself, but he\u2019d been looking through the crowd all day, scanning the faces in search of his fa\u2014yes, dammit, his father! John Grey was as much his father now as he ever had been. Goddamned liar or not. And William was growing worried about him. Colenso had reported that morning that Lord John had not returned to his house\u2014and Lord John should have returned by now. And if he had, he would have come to find William, he was sure of that. Unless Fraser had killed him.</p><p>He swallowed bile at the thought. Why would he? The men had once been friends, good friends.</p><p>True, war severed such bonds. But even so\u2014</p><p>On account of Mother Claire? He recoiled from that thought, too, but made himself come back to it. He could still see her face, glowing in spite of the uproar, fierce as flame with the joy of seeing Jamie Fraser, and felt a prick of jealousy on behalf of his father. If Fraser felt similarly impassioned, might he . . . but that was nonsense! Surely he must realize that Lord John had only taken her under his protection\u2014and done that for the sake of his good friend!</p><p>But, then, they were married . . . and his father had always been quite open regarding matters of sex. . . . His face grew even hotter, with embarrassment at the vision of his father enthusiastically bedding the not-quite-ex-Mrs. Fraser. And if Fraser had discovered that\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, sir!\u201d he said sharply to the importunate merchant who\u2014he realized belatedly\u2014had just tried to bribe him to admit the merchant\u2019s family to Howe\u2019s ship. \u201cHow dare you? Begone, and think yourself fortunate that I have no time to deal with you as I ought!\u201d</p><p>The man shuffled disconsolately away, and William felt a small pang of regret, but there was in fact little he could do. Even had he felt able to stretch a point in the merchant\u2019s favor, once a bribe was offered, he had no choice.</p><p>Even if it were true, how would Fraser have discovered it? Surely Lord John wouldn\u2019t have been foolish enough to tell him. No, it must be something else that was delaying Papa\u2019s return\u2014doubtless the muddle of people leaving Philadelphia; the roads must be choked. . . .</p><p>\u201cYes, madam. I think we have room for you and your daughter,\u201d he said to a young mother, very frightened-looking, with a baby clutched against her shoulder. He reached out and touched the infant\u2019s cheek; she was awake, but not troubled by the crowd, and regarded him with soft brown long-lashed eyes. \u201cHallo, sweetheart. Want to go on a boat with your mummy?\u201d</p><p>The mother gave a stifled sob of relief.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, Lord\u2014it is Lord Ellesmere, is it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he said automatically, and then felt as though someone had punched him in the belly. He swallowed and his face burned.</p><p>\u201cMy husband is Lieutenant Beaman Gardner,\u201d she said, offering the name in anxious justification of his mercy, and bobbed a short curtsy. \u201cWe\u2019ve met. At the Mischianza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course!\u201d he said, bowing, though he didn\u2019t recall Mrs. Lieutenant Gardner at all. \u201cHonored to be of service to a brother officer\u2019s wife, ma\u2019am. If you will be so good as to go on board directly, please? Corporal Anderson? Escort Mrs. Gardner and Miss Gardner on board.\u201d</p><p>He bowed again and turned away, feeling as though his insides had been scooped out. Brother officer. My lord. And what would Mrs. Lieutenant Gardner have thought if she\u2019d known? What would the lieutenant himself think?</p><p>He sighed deeply, closing his eyes for an instant\u2019s escape. And when he opened them, found himself face-to-face with Captain Ezekiel Richardson.</p><p>\u201cStercus!\u201d he exclaimed, startled into his uncle Hal\u2019s habit of Latin denunciation in moments of extreme stress.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Richardson remarked politely. \u201cMay I have a word with you? Yes, just so\u2014Lieutenant!\u201d He beckoned to the nearby Rendill, who was eyeball-to-eyeball with an elderly woman in black bombazine with no fewer than four small dogs yapping at her heels, these held by a long-suffering small black boy. Rendill made a quelling motion to her and turned to Richardson.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelieve Captain Lord Ellesmere, please. I require a moment of his time.\u201d</p><p>Before William could decide whether to object or not, Richardson had him by the elbow and was towing him out of the scrum and into the lee of a neat little sky-blue boathouse that stood on the riverbank.</p><p>William breathed deep with relief as the shade fell upon him but had by then gathered his wits. His first impulse had been to speak sharply to Richardson\u2014followed perhaps by knocking him into the river\u2014but wisdom spoke in his ear, advising otherwise.</p><p>It was at Richardson\u2019s instigation that William had become for a short time an intelligencer for the army, collecting information in the context of various journeys and delivering this to Richardson. On the last of these missions, though, a journey into the Great Dismal Swamp of Virginia, William had had the misfortune to become lost, be wounded, and suffer a fever that would certainly have killed him had Ian Murray not found and rescued him\u2014in the course of the rescue informing William that he had almost certainly been gulled and sent not into the bosom of British allies but into a nest of Rebels, who would hang him should they discover who he was.</p><p>William was of two minds as to whether to believe Murray or not\u2014particularly after the arrival of Jamie Fraser had made it patently clear that Murray was his own cousin but hadn\u2019t felt it necessary to apprise him of the fact. But a deep suspicion of Richardson and his motives remained, and it was no friendly face that he turned on the man.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d Richardson replied, causing William\u2019s heart to give a great thump that he thought must be audible to the other. \u201cWhere is Lord John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u201d William said shortly. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since yesterday.\u201d The day my bloody life ended. \u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d he asked, not bothering with any semblance of courtesy.</p><p>Richardson twitched an eyebrow but didn\u2019t otherwise respond to his tone.</p><p>\u201cHis brother, the Duke of Pardloe, has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe\u2014what?\u201d William stared at him for a moment, uncomprehending. \u201cHis brother? Disappeared . . . from where? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently from your father\u2019s house. As to when: Lady John said that he left the house just after tea yesterday afternoon, presumably in search of your father. Have you seen him since then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him at all.\u201d William felt a distinct ringing in his ears\u2014probably his brains trying to get out through them. \u201cWhat\u2014I mean, I had no idea he was in Philadelphia. In the colonies at all, for that matter. When did he arrive?\u201d Jesus, did he come to deal with Dottie and her Quaker? No, he can\u2019t have, he couldn\u2019t have had time . . . could he? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richardson was squinting at him, probably trying to determine whether he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen either of them,\u201d William said flatly. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, Captain . . .\u201d There was a tremendous splash from the direction of the dock and a loud chorus of shock and dismay from the crowd. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d William repeated, and turned away.</p><p>Richardson seized him by the arm and made an effort to fix William with his gaze. William looked deliberately in the direction of his neglected duty.</p><p>\u201cWhen you see either one of them, Captain Ransom, be so good as to send word to me. It would be a great help\u2014to many people.\u201d</p> <p>William jerked his arm free and stalked off without reply. Richardson had used his family name instead of his title\u2014did that mean anything beyond mere rudeness? At the moment, he didn\u2019t care. He couldn\u2019t fight, he couldn\u2019t help anyone, he couldn\u2019t tell the truth, and he wouldn\u2019t live a lie. God damn it, he was stuck like a hog, mired to the hocks.</p><p>He wiped the sweat from his face on his sleeve, squared his shoulders, and strode back into the fray. All there was to do was his duty.</p><p>AN ARMY ON THE MOVE</p><p>WE WERE JUST IN time. No sooner had I closed the bedroom door on Pardloe\u2019s gentle snore than a knock came on the newly hung front door below. I hurried downstairs to find Jenny face-to-face with a British soldier, this time a lieutenant. General Clinton was escalating his inquiries.</p><p>\u201cWhy, no, lad,\u201d she was saying, in a tone of mild surprise, \u201cthe colonel isn\u2019t here. He took tea with Lady John yesterday, but then he went off to look for his brother. His lordship hasn\u2019t come back, and\u201d\u2014I saw her lean closer, her voice lowered dramatically\u2014\u201cher ladyship\u2019s that worried. Ye\u2019ll not have news of him, I suppose?\u201d</p> <p>This was my cue, and I came down from the landing, rather surprised to find that I was indeed \u201cthat worried.\u201d Tending Hal had distracted me from the situation temporarily, but by now there was no denying that something had gone seriously wrong.</p><p>\u201cLady John. Lieutenant Roswell, your servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d The lieutenant bowed, with a professional smile that didn\u2019t hide the slight furrowing of his brow. The army was getting worried, too, and that was bloody dangerous. \u201cYour servant, mum. Have you in fact had no word from Lord John or Lord Melton\u2014oh, I beg your pardon, my lady, I mean from His Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think I\u2019m a liar, lad?\u201d Jenny said tartly.</p><p>\u201cOh! No, mum, not at all,\u201d he said, flushing. \u201cBut the general will want to know that I spoke with her ladyship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said soothingly, though my heart was pittering in my throat. \u201cTell the general that I haven\u2019t heard from my husband\u201d\u2014either of them\u2014\u201cat all. I\u2019m most disturbed.\u201d I wasn\u2019t a good liar, but I wasn\u2019t lying now.</p><p>He grimaced.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing is, mum, the army has begun withdrawing from Philadelphia, and all Loyalists remaining in the city are being advised that they may wish to . . . er . . . make preparations.\u201d His lips compressed for a moment as he glanced at the stairwell, with its ruined banister and bloody fist marks. \u201cI . . . see that you have already experienced some . . . difficulty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no,\u201d Jenny said, and with a deprecating glance at me, stepped nearer the lieutenant and put her hand on his arm, pushing him gently toward the door. He automatically moved away with her, and I heard her murmur, \u201c. . . no but a wee family quarrel . . . his lordship . . .\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant shot me a swift glance, in which surprise mingled with a certain sympathy. But the lines in his forehead eased. He had an explanation to take back to Clinton.</p><p>Blood flamed in my cheeks at his look\u2014as though there truly had been a family row, during which Lord John had stamped out, leaving wreckage in his wake and a wife at the mercy of the Rebels. True, it was a family row, but the circumstances were more through-the-looking-glass than a matter of mere common scandal.</p><p>The White Rabbit shut our new door firmly on Lieutenant Roswell and turned to me, back pressed against it.</p><p>\u201cLord Melton?\u201d she asked, one black eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the duke\u2019s titles, one he used before he became Duke of Pardloe. Lieutenant Roswell must have known him some years ago,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. Well, lord or duke, how long can we keep him asleep?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe laudanum will keep him out for two or three hours,\u201d I replied, glancing at the gilt carriage clock on the mantel, which had somehow escaped the carnage. \u201cBut he had a very hard day yesterday and a rather disturbed night; he may well go straight off into a natural sleep as the drug wears off. If no one comes along to knock the house down round our ears,\u201d I added, wincing at sounds of a violent altercation somewhere nearby.</p><p>Jenny nodded. \u201cAye. I\u2019d best go along to the printshop now, then, to see what the news in the city is. And perhaps Jamie will ha\u2019 gone there,\u201d she added hopefully. \u201cNot thinking it safe to come here, I mean, wi\u2019 the streets full of soldiers.\u201d</p><p>A spark of hope at the suggestion flared up like a lit match. Though even as I envisioned the possibility, I knew that if Jamie was in the city at all, he\u2019d be standing before me right now. Possibly enraged, possibly disturbed, but before me.</p><p>With the army already beginning its withdrawal, and the concomitant public disturbances, no one would have time or inclination to notice\u2014let alone arrest\u2014a tall Scotsman suspected of nothing more than passing suspicious documents. It wasn\u2019t as though there was an all points bulletin out on him\u2014or at least I hoped not. William was the only soldier who knew that Jamie had taken Lord John hostage, and from his manner in leaving, I rather thought that the last thing William would have done was give a full report of the situation to his superiors.</p><p>I said as much to Jenny, though agreed that she ought to go back to the printshop, to check on the welfare of Fergus and Marsali\u2019s family, as well as to find out what was going on amongst the Rebels in the city.</p><p>\u201cWill you be safe in the streets?\u201d I asked, unfolding her cloak and holding it up for her to put on.</p><p>\u201cOh, I expect so,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cNo one much thinks to look at an auld woman. But I suppose I\u2019d best put away my wee bawbee.\u201d The bawbee in question was a small silver chiming watch, with a delicately filigreed cover, which she wore pinned to the bosom of her dress.</p><p>\u201cJamie bought it for me in Brest,\u201d she explained, seeing me looking at it as she unpinned it. \u201cI told him it was foolery; I didna need such a thing to ken the time, nay more than he did himself. But he said, no, I must have it, that knowing what o\u2019clock it is gives ye the illusion that ye have some control over your circumstances. Ye ken how he is,\u201d she added, putting the watch carefully away in her pocket, \u201calways explaining ye to yourself. Though I will say as he\u2019s no often wrong.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d she added, turning to me as she opened the door. \u201cI\u2019ll come back before him upstairs wakes up, unless I can\u2019t, and if I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll send Germain to say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should you not be able to?\u201d I asked, in some surprise.</p><p>\u201cYoung Ian,\u201d she said, equally surprised that I should not have thought of this. \u201cWi\u2019 the army leaving, he may have come back from Valley Forge by now\u2014and ye ken, the poor lad thinks I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>ROOM FOR SECRETS</p><p>In the forest,</p><p>five miles from Valley Forge</p><p>\u201cDO QUAKERS BELIEVE in heaven?\u201d Ian Murray asked.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d Rachel Hunter replied, pausing to turn over a large toadstool with the toe of her shoe. \u201cNo, dog, don\u2019t touch that one. See the color of its gills?\u201d Rollo, who had come to sniff at the fungus, dismissed it with a perfunctory sneeze and lifted his snout to the wind in hopes of more promising prey.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Claire says dogs canna see colors,\u201d Ian remarked. \u201cAnd what d\u2019ye mean, \u2018Some do\u2019? Is there a difference of opinion on the matter?\u201d Quaker beliefs puzzled him beyond measure, but he found Rachel\u2019s explanations invariably entertaining.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they smell them instead. The dogs, I mean. But to return to thy question, we consider our life here on earth to be a sacrament, lived in the light of Christ. There may be an afterlife, but as no one has come back to say so, it\u2019s a matter of speculation, left to each person individually.\u201d</p><p>They had paused in the shade of a small walnut grove, and the soft green sun that fell flickering through the leaves gave Rachel herself an unearthly glow that any angel might have envied.</p><p>\u201cWell, I havena been there, either, so I\u2019ll no just say that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said, and bent to kiss her just above the ear. A faint rush of tiny gooseflesh stippled her temple for an instant, and the sight touched his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhy does thee think of heaven?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cDoes thee think there will be fighting in the city? I haven\u2019t known thee overly fearful for thy life before.\u201d Valley Forge had been hoaching like a grain sack full of weevils when they left it an hour before, the soldiers salvaging what they could from the camp, molding fresh musket balls and packing cartridges, preparing to march on Philadelphia when the word was given that Clinton\u2019s men had withdrawn.</p><p>\u201cOch, no. There\u2019ll be nay fighting in the city. Washington will try to catch Clinton\u2019s men in retreat.\u201d He took her hand, small and brown and work-roughened but the fingers reassuringly strong as they turned and clasped his. \u201cNay, I was thinking of my mam\u2014that I should ha\u2019 liked to show her places like this.\u201d He gestured toward the little clearing in which they stood, a tiny spring of an improbably deep blue welling up from the rock under their feet, overhung by a yellow wild-rose brier, humming with summer bees. \u201cShe had a big yellow rose brier growin\u2019 up the wall at Lallybroch; my grandmother planted it.\u201d He swallowed a small lump in his throat. \u201cBut then I thought, may be as she\u2019s happier in heaven with my da than she would be here without him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s hand squeezed his, hard.</p><p>\u201cShe would be with him always, in life or in death,\u201d she whispered, and stood a-tiptoe to kiss him back. \u201cAnd you will take me someday to see your grandmother\u2019s rose in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>They stood in silence for a bit, and Ian felt his heart, clenched with a sudden grief at the thought of his mother, ease in Rachel\u2019s sympathetic company. He hadn\u2019t said it, but what he most regretted was not his inability to show his mother the beauties of America but the fact that he couldn\u2019t show her Rachel.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d have liked ye,\u201d he blurted. \u201cMy mam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that she would,\u201d Rachel said, though with a tinge of dubiousness. \u201cDid thee tell her about me, in Scotland? That I am a Friend, I mean. Some Catholics find us scandalous.\u201d</p><p>Ian tried to remember whether he had mentioned that to his mother, but couldn\u2019t. It made no difference, in any case, and he shrugged, dismissing it.</p><p>\u201cI told her I loved ye. That seemed to be enough. Come to think, though\u2014my da asked all kinds of questions about ye; he wanted to know everything he could. He kent ye were a Quaker, so that means she kent it, too.\u201d He took her elbow to help her down from the rock.</p><p>She nodded, thoughtful, but as she followed him out of the clearing, he heard her ask behind him, \u201cDoes thee think a married couple should be completely in each other\u2019s confidence\u2014share not only their histories, I mean, but every thought?\u201d</p><p>That sent a qualm skittering down his backbone like a mouse with cold feet, and he took a deep breath. He loved Rachel with every fiber of his being, but he found her apparent ability to read him like a book\u2014if not to actually hear his thoughts, and sometimes he thought for sure she did that, too\u2014unsettling.</p><p>He had in fact suggested that they walk together to Matson\u2019s Ford and meet Denzell with the wagon there, rather than ride with him from Valley Forge, so that Ian might have sufficient time and solitude in which to share a few necessary things with her. He\u2019d rather be tortured by Abenakis than tell her some of those things, but it was right she should know them, no matter what the result might be.</p><p>\u201cAye. I mean . . . well, so far as one can, I think they maybe should. Not every thought, I dinna mean, but important things. Ahh . . . history, like ye said. Here, come sit for a wee while.\u201d There was a big fallen log, half rotted and covered with moss and fuzzy gray lichens, and he led her to it, sitting down beside her in the fragrant shade of a big red cedar.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but lifted a brow in question.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He drew a deep breath, feeling that there wasn\u2019t enough air in the whole forest for this. \u201cDid ye ken . . . I\u2019ve been marrit before?\u201d</p><p>Her face flickered, surprise overcome by determination so fast that he\u2019d have missed it if he hadn\u2019t been watching so close.</p><p>\u201cI did not,\u201d she said, and began to pleat the folds of her skirt, one-handed, clear hazel eyes fixed intently on his face. \u201cThee did say been married. Thee isn\u2019t now, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, feeling a little easier\u2014and very grateful to her. Not every young woman would have taken it so calmly.</p><p>\u201cNo. I wouldna have spoken to ye\u2014asked ye to marry me, I mean\u2014otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips a little and her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cIn point of fact,\u201d she said thoughtfully, \u201cthee never has asked me to marry thee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d he said, staggered. \u201cAre ye sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have noticed,\u201d she assured him gravely. \u201cNo, thee didn\u2019t. Though I recall a few very moving declarations, there was no suggestion of marriage among them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014well.\u201d Heat had risen in his cheeks. \u201cI\u2014but you . . . ye said . . .\u201d Maybe she was right. She had said . . . or had she? \u201cDid ye not say ye loved me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth turned up just a little, but he could see her laughing at him at the back of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words. But I did give thee to understand that, yes. Or at least I meant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, then,\u201d he said, much happier. \u201cYe did.\u201d And he pulled her into his one sound arm and kissed her with great fervor. She kissed him back, panting a little, her fists curled in the fabric of his shirt, then broke away, looking mildly dazed. Her lips were swollen, the skin around them pink, scraped by his beard.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, and swallowed, pushing him away with one hand flat on his chest, \u201cperhaps thee should finish telling me about not being married, before we go further? Who was thy\u2014thy wife\u2014and what happened to her?\u201d</p> <p>He let go of her reluctantly but would not surrender her hand. It felt like a small live thing, warm in his.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa,\u201d he said, and felt the accustomed inner shift at the speaking of it, as though the line between his Mohawk self and his white self had momentarily disappeared, leaving him awkwardly suspended somewhere in between. \u201cIt means \u2018Works With Her Hands.\u2019\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI called her Emily. Most of the time.\u201d</p><p>Rachel\u2019s small, smooth hand jerked in his.</p><p>\u201cIs?\u201d she said, blinking. \u201cThee said is? Thy wife is alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a year ago,\u201d he said, and, with an effort, didn\u2019t cling to her hand but let her take it back. She folded her hands in her lap, fixed her eyes on him, and swallowed; he saw her throat move.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, with no more than a faint tremor in her voice. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p><p>He took another deep breath, trying to think how to do that, but then abandoned the effort and spoke simply.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye truly want to know that, Rachel? Or do ye only want to ken whether I loved her\u2014or whether I love her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart there,\u201d she said, lifting one brow. \u201cDoes thee love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes,\u201d he said, helpless to speak other than the truth to her. Rollo, sensing some disturbance among his pack, got up from his resting place and padded over to Rachel. He sat down by her foot, making his allegiance in the matter clear, and gave Ian a yellow-eyed wolf look over Rachel\u2019s knee that bore an uncomfortable resemblance to the look in her own eye. \u201cBut . . .\u201d</p><p>The brow lifted a fraction of an inch higher.</p> <p>\u201cShe . . . was my refuge,\u201d he blurted. \u201cWhen I left my own family and became a Mohawk, it was as much to be wi\u2019 her as because I had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to . . . what?\u201d She looked baffled, and he saw her eyes drop a little, tracing the tattooed lines across his cheekbones. \u201cThee had to become a Mohawk? Why?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, feeling momentarily on firmer ground. He could tell her this story; it was only what had happened. Her eyes went round when he explained how he and Uncle Jamie had met Roger Wakefield, not realized who he was and thought him to be the man who had raped his cousin Brianna and got her with child, had come close to killing him, but had thought better of the notion\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d Rachel said, half under her breath. He glanced sidelong at her but couldn\u2019t tell if she meant this ironically or not, so he coughed and went on, telling how they had instead given the man to the Tuscarora, who in turn had sold him as a slave to the Mohawk farther north.</p><p>\u201cWe didna want to risk him ever comin\u2019 back to trouble Brianna, aye? Only then\u2014\u201d He swallowed, reliving in memory both the terror of his asking Brianna to marry him and the utter horror when cousin Bree had drawn a picture of the man she loved, the man she was waiting for\u2014and the strong dark features of the man they had given to the Mohawk sprang into view.</p><p>\u201cYou asked thy cousin to marry thee? Did thee want to?\u201d She looked wary; he supposed she must be thinking that he went about proposing to every third or fourth woman he met and hastened to correct this impression.</p><p>\u201cNay, I mean\u2014well, Brianna\u2019s a . . . well, I didna mind, ken, we\u2019d ha\u2019 got on fine, and she\u2014well . . . I mean, no, not exactly,\u201d he added hurriedly, seeing Rachel\u2019s graceful brows draw together. The truth was that he\u2019d been seventeen and Brianna several years older; she\u2019d terrified him, but the thought of bedding her had\u2014He choked that thought off as though it were a venomous snake.</p><p>\u201cIt was Uncle Jamie\u2019s idea,\u201d he said, with as much an air of casual dismissal as could be assumed on short notice. He lifted one shoulder. \u201cTo give the bairn a name, aye? I said I would, for the family honor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe family honor,\u201d she repeated, giving him a fishy look. \u201cTo be sure. But then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then we found it was Roger Mac\u2014he\u2019d taken back his own name of MacKenzie, is why we didna recognize him\u2014that we\u2019d given to the Indians by mistake, and so we went to retrieve him,\u201d he said quickly. By the time he\u2019d finished explaining all the events that had culminated in his volunteering to take the place of a Mohawk killed during Roger\u2019s rescue, the washing of his body in the river, the Mohawk women scrubbing him with sand to remove the last trace of his white blood, the plucking of his hair and the tattoos, he thought his marriage to Emily might seem only one more picturesque detail.</p><p>But of course it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He stopped dead, realizing suddenly that the conversation was about to become even stickier than he\u2019d thought. He glanced at her apprehensively, heart beating in his throat and ears. But she was still looking back; the pinkness round her mouth showing more vividly because she\u2019d gone a little pale\u2014but looking, clear and steady.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014wasna a virgin when I wed,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>The eyebrow went up again.</p><p>\u201cReally, I am not quite sure what to ask,\u201d she said, examining him in the way he\u2019d seen his auntie Claire appraise some horrible growth\u2014fascinated rather than repelled, but with a firm air of deciding exactly how best to deal with the offending bit. He hoped fervently she didn\u2019t mean to cut him out of her life like a wart or amputate him like a gangrenous toe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll . . . tell ye anything ye want to know,\u201d he said bravely. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA generous offer,\u201d she said, \u201cand one I shall accept\u2014but I think I must offer thee the same accommodation. Thee does not wish to ask whether I am virgin?\u201d</p><p>His mouth fell open, and her shoulders shook briefly.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re not?\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I am,\u201d she assured him, still quivering with the effort not to laugh. \u201cBut why should thee assume it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He felt the blood rise in his face. \u201cBecause\u2014anyone who looked at ye would know ye on the instant for a\u2014a\u2014a virtuous woman!\u201d he concluded, with a sense of relief at having found a reasonable term.</p><p>\u201cI might have been raped,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cThat would not mean I was not virtuous, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014well. No, I suppose not.\u201d He knew that a good many folk would think a raped woman was not virtuous\u2014and Rachel knew that. He was on the verge of becoming completely confused, and she knew that, too; he could see her taking pains not to laugh. He squared his shoulders and gave a great sigh, then met her eyes directly.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want to hear about every woman whose bed I\u2019ve shared? Because I\u2019ll tell ye, if so. I\u2019ve never taken a woman unwilling\u2014though they were mostly whores. I\u2019m no poxed, though,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYe should ken that.\u201d</p><p>She considered that for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI think I need not know the details,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBut should we ever meet a woman thee has bedded, I wish to know it. Thee does not mean to continue fornicating with prostitutes once we are wed, though, does thee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, but rocked back a little on the log, hands linked around her knees, holding his gaze. \u201cI do wish to hear more about thy wife. Emily.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the warmth of her leg, her body, close beside him. She hadn\u2019t moved away from him when he\u2019d said about sleeping with whores. The silence grew around them, and a jay called somewhere in the wood beyond.</p><p>\u201cWe loved each other,\u201d he said at last, softly, eyes on the ground. \u201cAnd I wanted her. I\u2014could talk to her. Then, at least.\u201d</p><p>Rachel drew breath but didn\u2019t say anything. He took his courage in his hands and looked up. Her face was carefully expressionless, her eyes intent on his face.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken how to say it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasna the same way I want you\u2014but I dinna mean to make it sound as though . . . as though Emily didna matter to me. She did,\u201d he added, very low-voiced, and glanced down again.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . she does?\u201d Rachel asked quietly, after a long pause. After a longer one, he nodded, swallowing.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said, and stopped, searching for the way to go on, because now they were coming to the most perilous part of his confession, the thing that might make Rachel stand up and walk away, dragging his heart behind her through the rocks and brush.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she said, and her voice was gentle.</p><p>\u201cThe Mohawk,\u201d he began, and had to stop for a breath. \u201cIt\u2019s the woman\u2019s choice, about being married. If a woman should take against her husband for some reason\u2014if he beats her, or he\u2019s a lazy sot, or smells too bad when he farts\u201d\u2014he stole a glance and saw the corner of her mouth twitch, which heartened him a little\u2014\u201cshe puts his things out o\u2019 the longhouse, and he has to go back to live wi\u2019 the unmarried men\u2014or find another woman who\u2019ll have him at her fire. Or leave altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Emily put you out?\u201d She sounded both startled and a bit indignant. He gave her a wee smile in return.</p><p>\u201cAye, she did. Not because I beat her, though. Because . . . of the bairns.\u201d</p><p>He felt the tears come to his eyes and clenched his hands in frustration on his knees. Damn, he\u2019d sworn to himself that he wouldn\u2019t weep. Either she\u2019d think he made a show of his grief to win her sympathy\u2014or she\u2019d see too deep; he wasn\u2019t ready . . . but he had to tell her, he\u2019d started this on purpose to tell her, she had to know. . . .</p><p>\u201cI couldna give her children,\u201d he blurted. \u201cThe first\u2014we had a wee daughter, born too early, who died. I called her Iseaba\u00ecl.\u201d He wiped the back of his hand viciously under his nose, swallowing his pain. \u201cAfter that, she\u2014Emily\u2014she got wi\u2019 child again. And again. And when she lost the third . . . her heart toward me died with it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel made a small sound, but he didn\u2019t look at her. Couldn\u2019t. Just sat hunched on the log like a toadstool, shoulders drawn up around his ears, and eyes blurred with the tears he couldn\u2019t shed.</p><p>A small warm hand settled on his.</p><p>\u201cAnd your heart?\u201d she asked. \u201cYours died, too?\u201d</p><p>He closed his hand on hers and nodded. And then just breathed for a bit, holding on to her hand, until he could speak again without his voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cThe Mohawk think that the man\u2019s spirit fights wi\u2019 the woman\u2019s, when they . . . lie together. And she willna get with child unless his spirit can conquer hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Rachel said softly. \u201cSo she blamed you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI canna say she was wrong.\u201d He turned a little on the log, to look at her directly. \u201cAnd I canna say that it would be different\u2014with us. But I did ask Auntie Claire, and she told me about things in the blood . . . well, perhaps ye should ask her to explain it; I wouldna make a decent job of it. But the end of it was that she thought it might be different wi\u2019 another woman. That I maybe could. Give ye bairns, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He only realized that Rachel had been holding her breath when she let it out, a sigh that brushed his cheek.</p><p>\u201cDo ye\u2014\u201d he began, but she had risen a little, into him, and she kissed him gently on the mouth, then held his head against her breast and took the end of her kerchief and wiped his eyes and then her own.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI do love thee.\u201d</p><p>FREEDOM!</p><p>GREY PASSED ANOTHER interminable\u2014though less eventful\u2014day, broken only by watching Colonel Smith write dispatches, which he did at a furious rate, quill scratching with the sound of a scuttling cockroach. This bit of imagery did nothing for Grey\u2019s digestion, which, in the aftermath of intoxication, hadn\u2019t dealt all that well with the cold grease-caked journeycake and burnt-acorn coffee he\u2019d been given for breakfast.</p><p>In spite of physical infelicity and an uncertain future, though, he found himself surprisingly cheerful. Jamie Fraser was alive, and he, John, wasn\u2019t married. Given those two marvelous facts, the dubious prospects of escape and the much higher probability of being hanged seemed only mildly concerning. He settled himself to wait with what grace he could, sleeping as much as his head allowed, or singing softly to himself\u2014a practice that caused Smith to hunch his shoulders up around his ears and scratch faster.</p><p>Messengers came and went with great frequency. If he hadn\u2019t already known that the Continentals were not only moving but preparing for a fight, it would have been clear to him within an hour. The hot air was burdened with the scent of molten lead and the whine of a sharpening wheel, and the camp had a sense of rising urgency that any soldier would have felt at once.</p><p>Smith made no attempt to keep him from hearing what was said by and to the messengers and subalterns; clearly he didn\u2019t expect the information gained to be of any use to Grey. Well . . . neither did Grey, to be honest.</p><p>Toward the evening, the tent\u2019s door was darkened by a slender female form, though, and Grey raised himself to a sitting position, careful of his tender head, because his heart had begun to beat strongly again and it made his eye throb.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His niece Dottie was in sober Quaker garb, but the soft blue of much-laundered indigo was surprisingly flattering to her English-rose coloring\u2014and she was in amazing fine looks. She nodded to Colonel Smith and set down her tray upon his desk, before glancing over his shoulder at the prisoner. Her blue eyes widened in shock, and Grey grinned at her over the colonel\u2019s shoulder. Denzell must have warned her, but he supposed he must look a literal fright, with a grotesquely swollen face and a fixed and glaring crimson eye.</p><p>She blinked and swallowed, then said something low-voiced to Smith, with a brief questioning gesture in Grey\u2019s direction. He nodded impatiently, already taking up his own spoon, and she wrapped a thick rag around one of the steaming cans on the tray and came across to Grey\u2019s cot.</p><p>\u201cDear me, Friend,\u201d she said mildly. \u201cThee seems much injured. Dr. Hunter says thee may eat as much as is comfortable, and he will attend thee later to put a dressing on your eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, young woman,\u201d he said gravely, and, glancing over her shoulder to be sure Smith\u2019s back was turned, nodded at her. \u201cIs it squirrel stew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPossum, Friend,\u201d she said. \u201cHere, I brought thee a spoon. The stew is boiling; be careful.\u201d Putting herself carefully between him and Smith, she placed the rag-wrapped can between his knees and rapidly touched the rags, then the links of his fetters, her eyebrows raised. A horn spoon was produced from the pocket tied at her waist\u2014and a knife with it, which was slipped under his pillow, quick as any conjurer could have managed it.</p><p>Her pulse was beating fast in her throat, and perspiration gleamed at her temples. He touched her hand once, softly, and picked up the spoon.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said again. \u201cTell Dr. Hunter I look forward to seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>THE ROPE WAS horsehair and the knife dull, and it was very late and with innumerable small cuts stinging his hands and fingers that Grey rose cautiously from the cot. His heart was pounding; he could feel it thumping briskly behind his injured eye and hoped the eye itself was not going to explode under the impact.</p><p>He bent and picked up the tin chamber pot and used it; Smith was a very sound sleeper, thank God; if he roused at all, he would hear the familiar noise, be reassured, and\u2014presumably\u2014fall back asleep, subconsciously ignoring any further small noises as being Grey resettling himself.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s breathing didn\u2019t change. He had a small, buzzing snore like a bee working in a flower, a tidy, busy sound that Grey found mildly comical. He lowered himself to his knees, slowly, between the cot and Smith\u2019s pallet, fighting a momentary insane impulse to kiss Smith on the ear\u2014he had sweet, small ears, very pink. This vanished in an instant, and he crept on hands and knees to the edge of the tent. He\u2019d threaded the rags and the gauze with which Denzell Hunter had packed his eye through the links of his fetters but still moved with the utmost caution. Being caught would be bad for him; it would be disastrous for Hunter and Dottie.</p><p>He\u2019d been listening intently to the sentries for hours. There were two guarding the colonel\u2019s tent, but he was fairly sure that both were presently near the front flap, warming themselves at the fire; hot as the day had been, this late at night the forest\u2019s blood ran cold. So did his.</p><p>He lay down and squirmed as quickly as he could under the edge of the tent, clinging to the canvas to minimize any shaking of the tent itself\u2014though he\u2019d taken pains to jerk on his rope every so often through the evening, so that any shifting of the structure might be put down to his normal movements.</p><p>Out! He allowed himself one deep gulp of air\u2014fresh, cold, and leafy\u2014then rose, clutching the padded fetters close against his body, and walked as silently as possible away from the tent. He mustn\u2019t run.</p><p>He had had a short, sharp, whispered argument with Hunter during the latter\u2019s evening visit, seizing the brief moment when Smith had left the tent to visit the latrine. Hunter had insisted that Grey hide in his wagon; he was going into Philadelphia, everyone knew that, there would be no suspicion, and Grey would be safe from patrols. Grey appreciated Hunter\u2019s desire to rescue him, but he couldn\u2019t possibly put the doctor\u2014let alone Dottie\u2014at risk, and risk it would be. In Smith\u2019s place, the first thing he would do was prevent anyone from leaving, the second, search the camp and everything in it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time,\u201d Hunter had said, briskly tucking in the end of the bandage he had wrapped around Grey\u2019s head, \u201cand thee may be right.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder; Smith would be back any minute. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a bundle of food and clothing in my wagon for thee. If thee chooses to make use of it, I\u2019m glad. If not, God go with thee!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d Grey seized Hunter by the sleeve, making his fetters rattle. \u201cHow will I know which wagon is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hunter coughed, seeming embarrassed. \u201cIt . . . has a, um, sign painted on the tailboard. Dottie purchased it from\u2014Now, you must take care, Friend,\u201d he said, abruptly raising his voice. \u201cEat generously but slowly, take no alcohol, and be careful in moving. Do not stand up too quickly.\u201d</p><p>Colonel Smith came in and, seeing the doctor present, came over to inspect the patient himself.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better, Colonel?\u201d he inquired politely. \u201cOr are you still suffering from the need to burst into song? If so, might I suggest you do so now and get it out of your system, before I retire for the night?\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2014who had of course heard \u201cDie Sommernacht\u201d the night before\u2014made a small noise in his throat but managed to take his leave without losing control.</p><p>Grey grinned to himself, recalling Smith\u2019s glower\u2014and imagining what the colonel might look like in a few hours, when he woke to discover that his songbird had flown. He made his way around the edge of the camp, avoiding the picket lines of mules and horses\u2014easy to detect by the smell of manure. The wagons were parked nearby: no artillery, he noted.</p><p>The sky was overcast, a sickle moon glimmering uneasily between racing clouds, and the air held the scent of impending rain. Fine. There were worse things than being wet and cold, and rain would hamper pursuit, if anyone discovered his absence before daylight.</p><p>No abnormal sounds from the camp behind him; none he could hear above the noise of his own heart and breathing. Hunter\u2019s wagon was easy to find, even in the flickering dark. He\u2019d thought by \u201csign\u201d that the doctor meant a name, but it was one of the barn signs that some of the German immigrants painted on their houses and sheds. He smiled when the clouds parted, revealing this one clearly, and he saw why Dottie had chosen it: it was a large circle, in which two comical birds faced each other, beaks open in the manner of lovebirds. Distlefink. The word floated into his head; someone, somewhere, had told him the name of that sort of bird, saying it was a symbol of good luck.</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said under his breath, climbing up into the wagon. \u201cI\u2019ll need it.\u201d</p><p>He found the bundle under the seat, where Hunter had told him, and took a moment to remove the silver buckles from his shoes, tying the flaps together instead with a length of leather lacing that had evidently been meant for his hair. He left the buckles tucked under the seat, put on the shabby coat, which smelled strongly of stale beer and what he thought was old blood, and peered at the knitted cap, which held two journeycakes, an apple, and a small canteen of water. Turning back the edge of the hat, he read by the fitful moonlight, LIBERTY OR DEATH, in bold white letters.</p><p>HE WASN\u2019T HEADED in any particular direction; even had the sky been clear, he wasn\u2019t sufficiently familiar as to be able to chart his direction by the stars. His only goal was to get as far away from Smith as possible, without running into another militia company or a patrol of Continentals. Once the sun was up, he could orient himself; Hunter had told him that the main road lay south\u2013southwest of the camp, about four miles away.</p><p>What the public might make of a man strolling down the main road in fetters was another question, but not one he needed to answer just now. After walking for an hour or so, he found a sheltered spot among the roots of an enormous pine tree and, taking out the knife, hacked off his hair as best he could. He stuffed the shorn locks well back under a root, rubbed his hands in the dirt, and then applied them vigorously to hair and face before donning his Phrygian cap.</p><p>Thus suitably concealed, he heaped a thick blanket of fallen dry needles over himself, curled up, and went to sleep to the sound of pattering rain in the trees above, once more a free man.</p><p>NAMELESS, HOMELESS, DESTITUTE, AND VERY DRUNK INDEED</p><p>HOT, DISHEVELED, AND still thoroughly out of temper from his encounter with Richardson, William made his way back through the crowded streets. One more night in a decent bed, at least. Tomorrow he\u2019d leave Philadelphia with the last few companies of the army, following Clinton north\u2014and leaving the remaining Loyalists to fend for themselves. He was torn between relief and guilt at the thought but had little energy left to consider them.</p><p>He arrived at his billet to find that his orderly had deserted and had taken with him William\u2019s best coat, two pairs of silk stockings, a half bottle of brandy, and the seed-pearl-encrusted double miniature of William\u2019s mother, Geneva, and his other mother, her sister, Isobel.</p><p>This was so far over the bloody limit of what could be borne that he didn\u2019t even swear, merely sank down on the edge of the bed, closed his eyes, and breathed through clenched teeth until the pain in his stomach subsided. It left a raw-edged hollow. He\u2019d had that miniature since he was born, was accustomed to bid it good night before he slept, though since he\u2019d left home he did this silently.</p><p>He told himself it didn\u2019t matter; he was unlikely to forget what his mothers looked like\u2014there were other paintings, at home at Helwater. He remembered Mama Isobel. And he could see the traces of his real mother in his own face. . . . Involuntarily, he glanced at the shaving mirror that hung on the wall\u2014the orderly had somehow overlooked that in his flight\u2014and felt the hollow inside him fill with hot tar. He no longer saw the curve of his mother\u2019s mouth, her dark wavy chestnut hair; he saw instead the too-long, knife-edged nose, the slanted eyes and broad cheekbones.</p><p>He stared at this blunt evidence of betrayal for an instant, then turned and stamped out.</p><p>\u201cFuck the resemblance!\u201d he said, and slammed the door behind him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care where he was going, but within a few streets he ran into Lindsay and another couple of fellows he knew, all intent on making the most of their last evening in a semi-civilized city.</p><p>\u201cCome along, young Ellesmere,\u201d Sandy said, collaring him firmly and shoving him down the street. \u201cLet\u2019s make a few memories to see us through the long winter nights up north, eh?\u201d</p><p>Some hours later, viewing the world through the bottom of a beer glass, William wondered rather blearily whether memories counted if you didn\u2019t remember them. He\u2019d lost count some time ago of what\u2014and how many of what\u2014he\u2019d drunk. He thought he\u2019d lost one or two or three of the companions with whom he\u2019d started the evening, too, but couldn\u2019t swear to it.</p><p>Sandy was still there, swaying in front of him, saying something, urging him to his feet. William smiled vaguely at the barmaid, fumbled in his pocket, and laid his last coin on the table. That was all right, he had more in his trunk, rolled up in his spare pair of stockings.</p><p>He followed Sandy outside into a night that seized and clung, the hot air so thick that it was hard to breathe, clogged with the smell of horse droppings, human ordure, fish scales, wilted vegetables, and fresh-slaughtered meat. It was late, and dark; the moon had not yet risen, and he stumbled over the cobbles, lurching into Sandy, a blacker smudge on the night before him.</p><p>Then there was a door, a blur of light, and an enveloping hot scent of liquor and women\u2014their flesh, their perfume, the smell more befuddling than the sudden light. A woman in a ribboned cap was smiling at him, greeting him, too old to be a whore. He nodded amiably at her and opened his mouth, only to be mildly surprised by the fact that he\u2019d forgotten how to talk. He closed his mouth and went on nodding; the woman laughed in a practiced way and guided him to a shabby wing chair, where she deposited him as she might leave a parcel to be called for later.</p><p>He sat slumped in a daze for some time, the sweat running down his neck under his stock and dampening his shirt. There was a fire burning in a hearth near his legs, a small cauldron of rum punch steaming on the hob, and the scent of it made him queasy. He had the feeling that he was melting like a candle but couldn\u2019t move without being sick. He shut his eyes.</p><p>Some time later, he slowly became aware of voices near him. He listened for a little, unable to make sense of any words but feeling the flow vaguely soothing, like ocean waves. His stomach had settled now, and with his eyelids at half-mast, he gazed placidly at a shifting sand of light and shadow, pricked with bright colors, like darting tropical birds.</p><p>He blinked a few times, and the colors shimmered into coherence: the hair and ribbons and white shifts of women, the red coats of infantry, the blue of an artilleryman moving among them. Their voices had given him the impression of birds, high and trilling, squawking now and then, or scolding like the mockingbirds who lived in the big oak near the plantation house at Mount Josiah. But it wasn\u2019t the women\u2019s voices that caught his attention.</p><p>A pair of dragoons were lounging on the settee nearby, drinking rum punch and eyeing up the women. He thought they\u2019d been talking for some time, but now he could make out the words.</p><p>\u201cEver buggered a girl?\u201d one of the dragoons was saying to his friend. The friend giggled and flushed, shook his head, murmured something that sounded like, \u201cToo dear for my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you want\u2019s a girl that hates it.\u201d The dragoon hadn\u2019t moved his gaze from the women across the room. He raised his voice, just a little. \u201cThey clamp down, trying to get rid of you. But they can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>William turned his head and looked at the man, repulsed, and making his disgust evident. The man ignored him. He seemed vaguely familiar, dark and heavy-featured, but no one William knew by name.</p><p>\u201cThen you take her hand and make her reach back and feel you. God, the squirming\u2014milk you like a dairymaid, she will!\u201d The man laughed loudly, still staring across the room, and for the first time William looked to see the target of this brutish farrago. There were three women standing in a group, two in their shifts, the thin fabric molded damply to their bodies, one in an embroidered petticoat, but it was plain to see who the dragoon\u2019s insinuations were meant for: the tallish one in the petticoat, who stood there with her fists clenched, glaring back at the dragoon fit to burn a hole through his forehead.</p><p>The madam was standing a little apart, frowning at the dragoon. Sandy had disappeared. The other men present were drinking and talking with four girls at the far end of the room; they hadn\u2019t heard this vulgar impertinence. The dragoon\u2019s friend was scarlet as his coat, between liquor, amusement, and embarrassment.</p><p>The dark dragoon was flushed, too, a livid line across his heavy stubbled jowls where they pressed against the leather of his stock. One hand plucked absently at the sweat-stained crotch of his moleskin breeches. He was having too much fun with his prey to cut the chase short, though.</p> <p>\u201cMind, you don\u2019t want one who\u2019s used to it. You want her tight.\u201d He leaned forward a little, elbows on his knees, eyes intent on the tall girl. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want one who\u2019s never had it before, either. Better if she knows what\u2019s coming, eh?\u201d</p><p>His friend mumbled something indistinct, glanced at the girl and hastily away. William looked back at the girl, too, and as she made a small involuntary movement\u2014not quite a flinch\u2014the candlelight glowed for an instant on the smooth crown of her head: soft chestnut, with the gloss of a fresh conker. Jesus Christ.</p><p>Before he knew it, he was on his feet. He took two swaying paces to the madam\u2019s side, touched her shoulder politely, and when she turned a surprised face up to him\u2014all her attention had been on the dragoon, a worried line between her brows\u2014he said slowly, so as not to slur his words, \u201cI\u2019ll take that one, please. The\u2014the tall girl. In the petticoat. For the night.\u201d</p><p>The madam\u2019s plucked eyebrows all but vanished into her cap. She looked quickly at the dragoon, who was still so fixed on his prey that he hadn\u2019t noticed William at all. His friend had, though; he nudged the dragoon and muttered in his ear.</p><p>\u201cEh? What\u2019s that?\u201d The man was already moving, scrambling to his feet. William groped hastily in his pocket, remembering too late that he was penniless.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this, Madge?\u201d The dragoon was with them, dividing a glower between the madam and William. William straightened instinctively\u2014he had six inches on the man\u2014and squared up. The dragoon assessed his size and his age and lifted the corner of his upper lip to show an eyetooth. \u201cArabella\u2019s mine, sir. I\u2019m sure Madge will find another young lady to accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am before you, sir,\u201d William said, and bowed, inclining his head a quarter inch, keeping a close eye on the cullion. Wouldn\u2019t put it past the filthy bugger to try to kick him in the balls\u2014the look on his face, he wouldn\u2019t stick at it.</p><p>\u201cHe is, Captain Harkness,\u201d the madam said quickly, stepping between the men. \u201cHe\u2019s already offered for the girl, and as you hadn\u2019t made up your mind . . .\u201d She wasn\u2019t looking at Harkness; she jerked her chin urgently at one of the girls, who looked alarmed but swiftly vanished through a door at the back. Gone to fetch Ned, William thought automatically, and wondered dimly for an instant how he knew the doorkeeper\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen the color of his money yet, have you?\u201d Harkness reached into his bosom and pulled out a well-stuffed wallet, from which he withdrew a careless sheaf of paper money. \u201cI\u2019ll have her.\u201d He grinned unpleasantly at William. \u201cFor the night.\u201d</p><p>William promptly whipped off his silver gorget, took the madam\u2019s hand, and pressed the crescent into it.</p><p>\u201cFor the night,\u201d he repeated politely, and without further ado turned and walked across the room, though the floor seemed to undulate slightly beneath his feet. He took Arabella\u2014Arabella?\u2014by the arm and steered her toward the back door. She looked appalled\u2014plainly she recognized him\u2014but a quick glance at Captain Harkness decided her that William was the lesser of two weevils, as he\u2019d heard a sailor friend of his father\u2019s put it.</p> <p>He could hear Harkness\u2019s shout behind them, but just then the door opened and a very large, tough-looking man walked in. He had but one eye, but that one focused instantly on Harkness. The man advanced on the captain, walking lightly on the balls of his feet, fists half curled. Ex-boxer, William thought, pleased. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Harkness!</p><p>Then, a hand on the stairwell wall to stop from stumbling, he found himself following a round, agitated bum up the same worn, lye-soap-smelling stairs he had trodden yesterday, wondering what the devil he\u2019d say to her when he reached the top.</p><p>HE\u2019D BEEN VAGUELY hoping that it wouldn\u2019t be the same room, but it was. It was night now, though, and the windows were open. The warmth of the day lingered in the walls and floor, but there was a breeze, spicy with tree sap and the river\u2019s breath, that made the single candle flame flicker and bend. The girl waited for him to come in, then closed the door and stood with her back against it, her hand still on the knob.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he blurted. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, last time.\u201d Her hand relaxed a bit, though she continued to look narrowly at him. It was dark where she stood, and he could barely make out the gleam of her eyes. She didn\u2019t look friendly.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou spoilt my best petticoat, though, and a decanter of wine. Cost me a beating and a week\u2019s wages, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cTruly. I\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll pay for the wine and the petticoat.\u201d Using what? he wondered. It had belatedly occurred to him that the spare stockings in which he kept his cash had vanished with his orderly, and undoubtedly so had the cash. Well, he\u2019d pawn something if he had to, or borrow a bit. \u201cCan\u2019t do much about the beating. But I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>She made a small huffing noise through her nose but seemed to accept this. She took her hand off the doorknob and came a little way into the room, so he could see her face in the candlelight. She was very pretty, despite the look of suspicious wariness, and he felt a mild stirring.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She looked him up and down, much as she\u2019d done when she met him in the alley. \u201cWilliam, you said your name is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d The silence lengthened a heartbeat past comfort, and he asked, almost at random, \u201cIs your name really Arabella?\u201d</p><p>That surprised her, and her mouth twitched, though she didn\u2019t laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m a fancy piece, though, and Madge thinks the fancies should have names like\u2014like\u2014ladies?\u201d She raised a brow, and he wasn\u2019t sure whether she was questioning whether ladies had names like Arabella or what he thought of Madge\u2019s philosophy.</p><p>\u201cI do know a couple of Arabellas,\u201d he offered. \u201cOne of them\u2019s six and the other\u2019s eighty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they ladies?\u201d She waved a hand, dismissing the question as soon as it was asked. \u201cOf course they are. You wouldn\u2019t know them, otherwise. Do you want me to send for wine? Or punch?\u201d She gave him an assessing eye. \u201cOnly, if you want to do anything, I really think you\u2019d best stay off the drink. Your choice, though.\u201d She put a hand to the tie of her petticoat in tepid invitation but didn\u2019t pull it loose. Clearly, she wasn\u2019t keen to induce him to \u201cdo anything.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his sweating face, imagined he smelled the alcohol oozing from his pores, and wiped it on his breeches.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want wine, no. Nor do I want to . . . to do . . . well, that\u2019s not true,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI do want to\u2014very much,\u201d he added hurriedly, lest she think him insulting, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him openmouthed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou\u2019ve paid well over the odds for anything you want to do. Including buggery, if that\u2019s your pleasure.\u201d Her lip curled a little.</p><p>He flushed to the scalp.</p><p>\u201cYou think I would save you from\u2014that, and then do it myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Often men don\u2019t think of something until another mentions it, and then they\u2019re all eagerness to try it themselves.\u201d</p><p>He was outraged.</p><p>\u201cYou must have a most indifferent opinion of gentlemen, madam!\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twitched again, and she gave him a look of such barely veiled amusement that the blood burned in his face and ears.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI take your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a novelty,\u201d she said, the twitch breaking into a malicious smile. \u201cIt\u2019s generally the other way round.\u201d</p><p>He breathed deeply through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI . . . it is meant as an apology, if you like.\u201d It was a struggle to keep meeting her eye. \u201cFor what happened last time.\u201d</p><p>A faint breeze came in, ruffling the hair about her shoulders and filling the fabric of her shift so it billowed, which afforded him a glimpse of her nipple, like a dark rose in the candlelight. He swallowed and looked away.</p><p>\u201cMy . . . um . . . my stepfather . . . told me once that a madam of his acquaintance said to him that a night\u2019s sleep was the best gift you could give a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt runs in the family, does it? Frequenting brothels?\u201d She didn\u2019t pause for a response to that. \u201cHe\u2019s right, though. Do you really mean that you intend for me to . . . sleep?\u201d From her tone of incredulity, he might have asked her to engage in some perversion well past buggery.</p><p>He kept his temper with some difficulty.</p><p>\u201cYou can sing songs or stand on your head, if you prefer, madam,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t propose to . . . er . . . molest you. Beyond that, your actions are quite up to you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, a small frown between her brows, and he could see that she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cI . . . would go,\u201d he said, feeling awkward again, \u201cbut I have some concern that Captain Harkness might be still on the premises, and should he learn that you are alone . . .\u201d And he somehow couldn\u2019t face his own dark, empty room. Not tonight.</p><p>\u201cI imagine Ned\u2019s disposed of him,\u201d she said, then cleared her throat. \u201cBut don\u2019t go. If you do, Madge will send somebody else up.\u201d She took off her petticoat, with no display of coquetry or artifice in the motion. There was a screen in the corner; she went behind this, and he heard the splash of her using a chamber pot.</p><p>She came out, glanced at him, and with a brief wave at the screen said, \u201cJust there. If you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . . thank you.\u201d He did in fact need to piss fairly badly, but the thought of using her pot, so soon after her own use of it, caused him an unreasonable amount of embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He looked round, found a chair, and sat down in it, ostentatiously thrusting out his boots and leaning back in an attitude of relaxation. He closed his eyes\u2014mostly.</p><p>Through slitted lids, he saw her observe him closely for a moment, then she leaned over and blew out the candle. Ghostlike in the darkness, she climbed into her bed\u2014the ropes creaked with her weight\u2014and drew up the quilt. A faint sigh came to him over the sounds of the brothel below.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . Arabella?\u201d He didn\u2019t expect thanks, exactly, but he did want something from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She sounded resigned, obviously expecting him to say that he\u2019d changed his mind about buggery.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a minute, as she made up her mind. There was nothing tentative about the young woman, though, and when she did reply, it was without reluctance.</p><p>\u201cJane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Just\u2014the one thing more. My coat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sold it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er . . . good night, then.\u201d</p><p>There was a prolonged moment, filled with the unspoken thoughts of two people, then a deep, exasperated sigh.</p><p>\u201cCome and get into bed, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>HE COULDN\u2019T GET into bed in full uniform. He did keep his shirt on, with some idea of preserving her modesty and his original intent. He lay quite rigid beside her, trying to envision himself as the tomb figure of a Crusader: a marble monument to noble behavior, sworn to a chastity enforced by his stone embodiment.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was a rather small bed and William was rather large. And Arabella\u2013Jane wasn\u2019t trying at all to avoid touching him. Granted, she wasn\u2019t trying to arouse him, either, but her mere presence did that without half trying.</p><p>He was intensely aware of every inch of his body and which of them were in contact with hers. He could smell her hair, a faint scent of soap mingled with the sweetness of tobacco smoke. Her breath was sweet, too, with the smell of burnt rum, and he wanted to taste it in her mouth, share the lingering stickiness. He closed his eyes and swallowed.</p><p>Only the fact that he needed desperately to pee made it possible to keep his hands off her. He was in that state of drunkenness where he could perceive a problem but could not analyze a solution to it, and sheer inability to think of two things at once prevented him either speaking to her or laying a hand on hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she whispered hoarsely. \u201cYou\u2019re wiggling like you\u2019ve got tadpoles in your drawers\u2014only you haven\u2019t any drawers on, have you?\u201d She giggled, and her breath tickled his ear. He groaned softly.</p><p>\u201cHere, now\u2014\u201d Her voice took on a tone of alarm, and she sat up in bed, twisting round to look at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be sick in my bed! Get up! Get up right this minute!\u201d She pushed at him with small, urgent hands, and he stumbled out of bed, swaying and clutching at furniture to keep from falling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The window gaped before him, open to the night, a lovely sickle moon pale above. Taking this as the celestial invitation it surely was, he raised his shirt, gripped the window frame, and pissed into the night in a majestically arching rush of blinding bliss.</p><p>The sense of relief was so intense that he noticed nothing whatever in its wake, until Arabella\u2013Jane seized him by the arm and pulled him away from the window.</p><p>\u201cGet out of sight, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d She risked a hasty glance downward, then dodged back, shaking her head. \u201cOh, well. It\u2019s not as though Captain Harkness was ever going to propose you for membership in his favorite club, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarkness?\u201d William swayed toward the window, blinking. There was a remarkable amount of shouting and abuse coming from below, but he was having trouble in focusing his eyes and perceived nothing save the flicker of red uniforms, redder still in the light from the lantern over the establishment\u2019s door.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind. He\u2019ll likely think I did it,\u201d Arabella\u2013Jane said, a dark note in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a girl,\u201d William pointed out logically. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t piss out a window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without making a prime spectacle of myself, no,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut \u2019tisn\u2019t unknown for a whore to throw the contents of her chamber pot out on someone, accidental on purpose. Well.\u201d She shrugged, went behind the screen, and emerged with the aforementioned receptacle, which she promptly upended out the open window. In response to renewed howls from below, she leaned out and shrieked several insults that a regimental sergeant would have been proud to author, before ducking back in and banging the shutters closed.</p><p>\u201cMay as well be hanged\u2014or buggered\u2014for a sheep as a lamb,\u201d she remarked, taking him by the arm again. \u201cCome back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only in Scotland that they bugger sheep,\u201d William said, obediently following her. \u201cAnd maybe part of Yorkshire. Northumbria, too, maybe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really? Is Captain Harkness from one of those places, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him?\u201d William sat down on the bed rather suddenly, as the room had begun to revolve in a stately manner round him. \u201cNo. I\u2019d say maybe Devon, from his\u2014his . . . speech,\u201d he concluded, pleased to have found the word.</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ve got sheep in Devon, too, then, I suppose.\u201d Arabella\u2013Jane was unbuttoning his shirt. He raised a hand to stop her, wondered why he should, and left the hand hanging in midair.</p><p>\u201cLot of sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cLot of sheep everywhere in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod save the Queen, then,\u201d she murmured, intent on her work. The last button came free, and a faint draft of air stirred the hairs on William\u2019s chest.</p><p>He remembered then why he should have been stopping her, but she\u2019d put her head inside the open front of his shirt and licked his nipple before he could make his arrested hand complete its motion, and when he did, it merely settled gently on her head, which was surprisingly warm. So was her breath. So was her hand, which had wrapped itself around his prick in a possessive sort of way.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, after what seemed a very long time but could have been no more than seconds. His hand descended and closed\u2014regretfully\u2014over hers where it grasped him. \u201cI . . . I meant it. I won\u2019t bother you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let go but did sit up and regard him with an air of puzzled impatience, just visible in the lantern light that seeped through the shutters.</p><p>\u201cIf you bother me, I\u2019ll tell you to stop; how\u2019s that?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. He was concentrating fiercely now; it seemed exceedingly important that she understand. \u201cHonor. It\u2019s my honor.\u201d</p><p>She made a small sound that might have been impatience or amusement.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have considered your honor before you came to a whorehouse. Or did someone drag you inside against your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came with a friend,\u201d he said with dignity. She still hadn\u2019t let go but couldn\u2019t move her hand, not with his clasped tightly around it. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . not what I mean. I mean . . .\u201d The words that had come easily a moment before had slipped away again, leaving him blank.</p><p>\u201cYou could tell me later, once you\u2019ve had a good think,\u201d she suggested, and he was startled to discover that she had two hands and knew what to do with the other one, too.</p> <p>\u201cUnhand my . . .\u201d Damn, what is the bloody word? \u201cUnhand my testicles if you please, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as you like,\u201d she replied crisply, and, doing so, put her head back inside his damp, smelly shirt, seized one nipple between her teeth, and sucked so hard that it pulled every last word out of his head.</p><p>Matters thereafter were unsettled but largely pleasant, though at one point he found himself rearing above her, sweat dripping from his face onto her br**sts, muttering, \u201cI\u2019m a bastard, I\u2019m a bastard, I\u2019m a bastard, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t reply to this but stretched up a long white arm, cupped her hand round the back of his head, and pulled him down again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d He came gradually to himself, aware that he was talking and evidently had been for some time, in spite of his head being cradled in the curve of her shoulder, his senses aswim in her musk (like a sweating flower, he thought dreamily), and her nipple a dark sweet thing an inch or two from his nose. \u201cThe only honor I have left is my word. Have to keep it.\u201d Then tears came suddenly to his eyes, with recollection of the moments just past. \u201cWhy did you make me break my word?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer for a while, and he would have thought she\u2019d fallen asleep, save for the hand that roved over his bare back, gentle as a whisper.</p><p>\u201cEver think that maybe a whore has a sense of honor, too?\u201d she said at last.</p><p>Frankly, he hadn\u2019t, and opened his mouth to say so, but once more his words had gone missing. He closed his eyes and fell asleep on her breast.</p><p>DESPERATE MEASURES</p><p>SILVIA HARDMAN STOOD regarding Jamie with a lowered brow, her lips pushed out in concentration. Finally she shook her head, sighed, and drew herself up.</p><p>\u201cThee means it, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Friend Silvia. I must be in Philadelphia as quickly as may be. And to do that, I must reach the road. I must be able to walk tomorrow morning, however haltingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Patience, fetch me thy father\u2019s special flask. And, Prudence, will thee grind a good measure of mustard seed . . .\u201d She stepped a little closer to the bed, peering nearsightedly at Jamie\u2019s back as though to gauge the acreage. \u201cA good handful\u2014no, make it two; thy hands are small.\u201d She took a digging stick from the shelf near the door but hesitated before opening it. \u201cDo not touch thy eyes or face, Pru\u2014and by no means touch Chastity without washing thy hands first. Let Patience mind her if she cries.\u201d</p><p>Chastity was making fretful noises, though freshly fed and changed. Patience, though, had already run out the door, making Jamie wonder where her father\u2019s special flask might be. Hidden, apparently.</p><p>\u201cPut the wean beside me,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI can mind her for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Silvia did so without hesitation, which pleased him, and he lay face-to-face with wee Chastity, amusing them both by making faces at her. She giggled\u2014and so did Prudence, as the pestle scraped and the hot smell of ground mustard thickened the air. He stuck out his tongue and waggled it; Chastity shook like a small jelly and put out a tiny pink tongue tip in turn, which made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you all laughing at?\u201d Patience demanded, opening the door. She frowned censoriously from one sister to the other, making them all laugh harder. When Mrs. Hardman came in a few moments later with a large grubby root in her hand, they had reached the point of laughing at absolutely nothing, and she blinked in bewilderment, but then shook her head and smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell, they do say laughter is good medicine,\u201d she remarked, when the hilarity had run its course, leaving the girls pink-faced and Jamie feeling slightly better\u2014to his surprise. \u201cMay I borrow thy knife, Friend James? It is more suited to the purpose than mine.\u201d</p><p>This was patently true; her knife was a crude iron blade, badly sharpened, the haft bound with string. Jamie had a good ivory case knife, bought in Brest, of hardened steel, with an edge that would shave the hairs off his forearm. He saw her smile with involuntary pleasure at the feel of it in her hand and had a momentary flash of memory\u2014Brianna, delicately unfolding a blade of her Swiss Army knife, an air of pleased satisfaction on her face.</p><p>Claire appreciated good tools, too. But she touched tools with immediate thought of what she meant to do with them, rather than simple admiration for elegance and function. A blade in her hand was no longer a tool but an extension of her hand. His own hand closed, thumb rubbing gently against his fingertips, remembering the knife he had made for her, the handle carefully grooved and sanded smooth to fit her hand, to match her grip exactly. Then he closed his fist tight, not wanting to think of her so intimately. Not just now.</p><p>Bidding the girls stand well back out of the way, Silvia carefully peeled the root and grated it into a small wooden bowl, keeping her face averted as much as possible from the rising fumes of the fresh horseradish but still with tears streaming down her face. Then, wiping her eyes on her apron and taking up the \u201cspecial flask\u201d\u2014this being a dark-brown stoneware bottle stained with earth (had the lass just dug it up?)\u2014she cautiously poured a small amount of the very alcoholic contents. What was it? Jamie wondered, sniffing cautiously. Very old applejack? Twice-fermented plum brandy? It had probably started life as some sort of fruit, but it had been some time since that fruit hung on a tree.</p><p>Mrs. Hardman relaxed, putting the cork back into the bottle as though relieved that the contents had not in fact exploded upon being decanted.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d she said, coming over to pick up Chastity, who squealed and fussed at being removed from Jamie, whom she plainly regarded as a large toy. \u201cThat must steep for a few hours. Thee needs heat. Thee should sleep, if thee can. I know thee passed a wakeful night, and tonight may not be much better.\u201d</p><p>JAMIE HAD STEELED himself to the prospect of drinking horseradish liquor with a mix of trepidation and curiosity. The first of these emotions was momentarily relieved when he discovered that Mrs. Hardman didn\u2019t mean him to drink it, but it returned in force when he found himself a moment later facedown on the bed with his shirt rucked up to his oxters and his hostess vigorously rubbing the stuff into his bu**ocks.</p><p>\u201cHave a care, Friend Silvia,\u201d he managed, trying to turn his head enough to get his mouth clear of the pillow without either twisting his back or unclenching his bum. \u201cIf ye drip that down the crack of my arse, I may be cured wi\u2019 a somewhat sudden violence.\u201d</p><p>A small snort of amusement tickled the hairs in the small of his back, where the flesh was still smarting and tingling from her administrations.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother did say this receipt would raise the dead,\u201d she said, her voice pitched low in order not to disturb the girls, who were rolled up on the hearth in their blankets like caterpillars. \u201cPerhaps she was less careful in her applications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHEE NEEDS HEAT,\u201d she\u2019d said. Between the horseradish liniment and the mustard plaster resting on his lower back, he thought he might suffer spontaneous combustion at any moment. He was sure his skin was blistering. \u201cI know thee passed a wakeful night, and tonight may not be much better.\u201d She\u2019d got that right.</p><p>He shifted, trying to turn stealthily onto his side without making noise or dislodging the plaster\u2014she\u2019d bound it to his lower back by means of strips of torn flannel tied round his body, but they had a tendency to slip. The pain when shifting was in fact much less, which encouraged him greatly. On the other hand, he felt as though someone was repeatedly passing a pine torch within inches of his body. And while she had been very careful while working the liniment into him from rib cage to knees, a bit of the ferocious liquid had touched his balls, giving him a not-unpleasant sense of remarkable heat between his legs but also an uncontrollable urge to squirm.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t, while she was working on him, and hadn\u2019t said a word. Not after seeing the state of her hands: red as a lobsterback\u2019s coat, and a milky blister rising on the side of her thumb. She hadn\u2019t said a word, either, just drawn down his shirt when she was done and patted him gently on the backside before going to wash and then smooth a little cooking grease gingerly into her hands.</p><p>She was asleep now, too, a hunched form curled up in the corner of the settle, little Chastity\u2019s cradle by her foot, safely away from the banked embers of the fire. Now and then one of the glowing chunks of wood split with a loud crack! and a small fountain of sparks.</p><p>He stretched gingerly, experimenting. Better. But whether he was cured in the morning or not, he was leaving\u2014if he had to drag himself on his elbows to the road. The Hardmans must have their bed back\u2014and he must have his. Claire\u2019s bed.</p><p>The thought made the heat in his flesh bloom up through his belly, and he did squirm. His thoughts squirmed, too, thinking of her, and he grabbed one, pinning it down like a disobedient dog.</p><p>It\u2019s nay her fault, he thought fiercely. She\u2019s done me nay wrong. They\u2019d thought him dead\u2014Marsali had told him so and told him that Lord John had wed Claire in haste following the news of Jamie\u2019s death, in order to protect not only her but Fergus and Marsali as well, from imminent arrest.</p><p>Aye, and then he took her to his bed! The knuckles of his left hand twinged as he curled his fist. \u201cNever hit them in the face, lad.\u201d Dougal had told him that a lifetime ago, as they watched a knockdown fight between two of Colum\u2019s men in the courtyard at Leoch. \u201cHit them in the soft parts.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d hit him in the soft parts.</p><p>\u201cNay her fault,\u201d he muttered under his breath, turning restlessly into his pillow. What the bloody hell had happened, though? How had they done it\u2014why? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt as though he was fevered, his mind dazed with the waves of heat that throbbed over his body. And like the half-glimpsed things in fever dreams, he saw her naked flesh, pale and shimmering with sweat in the humid night, slick under John Grey\u2019s hand . . .</p><p>We were both f**king you!</p><p>His back felt as though someone had laid a hot girdle on it. With a deep growl of exasperation, he turned onto his side again and fumbled at the bandages holding the scalding plaster to his skin, at last wriggling out of its torrid embrace. He dropped it on the floor and flung back the quilt that covered him, seeking the relief of cool air on body and mind.</p><p>But the cabin was filled to the rooftree with the fuggy warmth of fire and sleeping bodies, and the heat that flamed over him seemed to have rooted itself between his legs. He clenched his fists in the bedclothes, trying not to writhe, trying to calm his mind.</p> <p>\u201cLord, let me stand aside from this,\u201d he whispered in G\u00e0idhlig. \u201cGrant me mercy and forgiveness. Grant me understanding!\u201d</p><p>What his mind presented him with instead was a fleeting sense, a memory of cold, as startling as it was refreshing. It was gone in a flash but left his hand tingling with the touch of cold stone, cool earth, and he clung to the memory, closing his eyes, in imagination pressing his hot cheek to the wall of the cave.</p><p>Because it was his cave. The place where he\u2019d hidden, where he\u2019d lived, in the years after Culloden. He had throbbed there, too, pulsing with heat and hurt, rage and fever, desolation and the sweet brief consolation of dreams wherein he met his wife again. And he felt in mind the coldness, the dark chill that he\u2019d thought would kill him, finding it now relief in the desert of his thoughts. He envisioned himself pressing his naked, scalded back to the rough damp of the cave wall, willing the coldness to pass into his flesh, to kill the fire.</p><p>His rigid body eased a little, and he breathed slower, stubbornly ignoring the ripe reeks of the cabin, the fumes of horseradish and plum brandy and mustard, of cooking and bodies washed infrequently. Trying to breathe the piercing cleanliness of the north wind, the scents of broom and heather.</p><p>And what he smelled was . . .</p> <p>\u201cMary,\u201d he whispered, and his eyes flew open, shocked.</p><p>The scent of green onions and cherries, not quite ripe. A cold boiled fowl. And the warm smell of a woman\u2019s flesh, faintly acrid with the sweat in her clothes, overlaid by the mild, fatty smell of his sister\u2019s lye soap.</p><p>He took a deep breath, as though he might capture more of it, but the cool air of the Highlands had fled, and he inhaled a thick gulp of hot mustard, and coughed.</p><p>\u201cAye, all right,\u201d he muttered ungraciously to God. \u201cYe\u2019ve made your point.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t sought out a woman, even in his most abject loneliness, living in the cave. But when Mary MacNab had come to him on the eve of his departure for an English prison, he\u2019d found consolation for his grief in her arms. Not as replacement for Claire, never that\u2014but only desperately needing, and gratefully accepting, the gift of touch, of not being alone for a little while. How could he possibly find it wrong that Claire had done the same?</p><p>He sighed, wriggling to find a more comfortable position. Little Chastity emitted a faint cry, and Silvia Hardman sat up at once in a rustle of clothes, bending down to the cradle with a sleepy murmur.</p> <p>For the first time, the child\u2019s name struck him. The baby was perhaps three or four months old. How long had Gabriel Hardman been gone? More than a year, he thought, from what the little girls had said. Chastity, indeed. Was the name merely the natural companion to Prudence and Patience\u2014or Mrs. Hardman\u2019s private, poignant bitterness, a reproach to her missing husband?</p><p>He closed his eyes and sought a sense of coolness in the dark. He thought he had burned long enough.</p><p>OF CABBAGES AND KINGS</p><p>HE WALKED TO THE road just before dawn, declining help from Prudence and Patience, though they insisted upon coming with him, in case he should fall flat on his face, be stricken with sudden paralysis, or step into a gopher\u2019s hole and twist an ankle. They had no great opinion of his powers but were well mannered enough to keep a distance of a foot or so on either side, their hands hovering like small white butterflies near his elbows, pale in the half dark.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not so many wagons coming in, these last few days,\u201d Patience observed, in a tone somewhere between anxiety and hope. \u201cThee may not find a suitable conveyance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be satisfied wi\u2019 a dung cart or a wagon filled with cabbages,\u201d he assured her, already glancing down the road. \u201cMy business is somewhat urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Prudence reminded him. \u201cWe were under the bed when Washington appointed you.\u201d She spoke with a certain reserve, as a Quaker opposed to the practice of war, and he smiled at her small, serious face, long-lipped and kind-eyed like her mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWashington is nay my greatest concern,\u201d he said. \u201cI must see my wife, before . . . before anything else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThee has not seen her in some time?\u201d Prudence asked, surprised. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was detained upon business in Scotland,\u201d he said, deciding not to observe that he\u2019d seen her but two days ago. \u201cIs that a wagon coming, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>It was a drover with a herd of swine, in fact, and they were obliged to scuttle back from the roadside with some haste, in order to avoid being either bitten or trampled. By the time the sun was fully up, though, regular traffic had begun to flow along the road.</p><p>Most of this was coming from Philadelphia, as the girls had told him: Loyalist families who could not afford to leave by ship, fleeing the city with what they could carry, some with wagons or handcarts, many with no more than what they could convey on their backs or in their arms. There were also British soldiers in groups and columns, presumably assisting the exodus and protecting the Loyalists from being attacked or looted, should Rebel militia suddenly come out of the wood.</p><p>That thought reminded him of John Grey\u2014who had been mercifully absent from his mind for several hours. Jamie ruthlessly pushed him out again, muttering, \u201cAye, stay gone,\u201d under his breath. But a reluctant second thought occurred to him\u2014what if Grey had been released by the militia at once and had already made his way back to Philadelphia? On the one hand, he would see to Claire\u2019s safety; he could trust the man for that. But on the other . . .</p><p>Aye, well. If he walked into the house and found Grey there with her, he\u2019d just take her away with him and say nothing. Unless . . .</p><p>\u201cDoes thee still suffer from the horseradish, Friend Jamie?\u201d Patience asked politely. \u201cThee snorts quite fearful. Perhaps thee had best take my hankie.\u201d</p><p>In the woods outside Philadelphia</p><p>GREY WOKE ABRUPTLY to full daylight and a musket barrel jabbed into his belly.</p><p>\u201cCome out of there with your hands up,\u201d said a cold voice. He got his good eye sufficiently open as to see that his interlocutor wore a tattered Continental officer\u2019s coat over homespun breeches and an open-collared shirt, topped by a slouch hat turned up with a turkey feather through the brim. Rebel militia. Heart in his throat, he crawled stiffly out of his refuge and rose, hands in the air.</p><p>His captor blinked at Grey\u2019s battered face, then at the fetters, strips of muslin bandage hanging from the rusted links. He withdrew the musket slightly but didn\u2019t lower it. Now that Grey was on his feet, he could see several other men, as well, all peering at him with extreme interest.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . where did you escape from?\u201d the officer with the musket asked carefully.</p><p>There were two possible answers, and he chose the riskier option. Saying \u201cgaol\u201d would have likely led to them leaving him alone or, at worst, taking him with them but leaving him in irons; either way, he\u2019d still be wearing fetters.</p><p>\u201cI was put in irons by a British officer who took me up as a spy,\u201d he said boldly. Entirely true, he reflected, so far as it goes.</p><p>A deep hum of interest ran among the men, who pressed closer to look at him, and the prodding musket barrel was withdrawn altogether.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d said his captor, who had an educated English voice, with a slight Dorset accent. \u201cAnd what might be your name, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBertram Armstrong,\u201d he replied promptly, using two of his middle names. \u201cAnd may I have the pleasure of knowing your own name, sir?\u201d</p><p>The man pursed his lips a little but answered readily enough.</p><p>\u201cI am the Reverend Peleg Woodsworth, Captain of the Sixteenth Pennsylvania, sir. And your company?\u201d Grey saw Woodsworth\u2019s eyes flick toward his liberty cap with its bold motto.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t yet joined a company, sir,\u201d he said, softening his own accent just a little. \u201cI was on my way to do so, in fact, when I ran afoul of a British patrol and shortly thereafter found myself in the straits you see.\u201d He raised his wrists a little, clanking. The hum of interest came again, this time with a distinct note of approval.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Woodsworth said, and lifted his musket to his shoulder. \u201cCome along with us, Mr. Armstrong, and I think we might be able to relieve your straits.\u201d</p><p>BLOODY MEN</p><p>ONCE THEY REACHED the trace, there were horses, mules, and wagons, as well as militia companies. Rachel was able to ride in a teamster\u2019s wagon filled with sacks of barley, Ian and Rollo trotting along beside, as far as Matson\u2019s Ford, where they were meant to meet Denzell and Dottie. They waited at the ford until midmorning, but there was no sign of Denzell\u2019s wagon, and none of the militia groups crossing there had seen him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have had an emergency,\u201d Rachel said, lifting one shoulder in resignation. \u201cWe\u2019d best go on by ourselves; perhaps we can find a wagon on the main road that will carry us into the city.\u201d She wasn\u2019t troubled; any doctor\u2019s family was used to fending for themselves unexpectedly. And she loved being alone with Ian, talking, looking at his face.</p><p>Ian agreed that this was good sense, and they splashed across, shoes in hand, the cold water a relief. Even in the forest, the air was close and hot, restless with prowling thunder that never came close enough to do much good.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said to Rachel, and handed her his moccasins, his rifle, and his belt, with powder horn, shot bag, and dirk. \u201cStand back a bit, aye?\u201d He could see a scour in the streambed, where a persistent eddy had carved a deep hole, a dark, inviting shadow in the ripples of the creek. He leapt from stone to stone and jumped from the last one, going into the hole with a PLUNK! like a dropped boulder. Rollo, belly-deep in the ford and soaked to the shoulders, barked and showered Rachel with water from a huge wagging tail.</p><p>Ian\u2019s head lunged back into view, streaming water, and he reached a long, skinny arm toward her leg, beckoning her to join him. She didn\u2019t retreat but held his rifle out at arm\u2019s length and raised one brow, and he dropped his invitation, scrambling out of the hole on hands and knees. He stood up in the ford and shook himself like Rollo, spattering her with icy drops.</p><p>\u201cWant to go in?\u201d he asked, grinning as he took back his weapons. He wiped water from his brows and chin with the back of his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll cool ye right down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d she said, smearing the cold droplets over her sweating face with one hand, \u201cif my clothes were as impervious to the elements as thine are.\u201d He had on his worn buckskin leggings and breechclout, with a calico shirt so faded that the red flowers on it were nearly the same color as the brown background. Neither water nor sun would make any difference, and he would look just the same wet or dry\u2014while she would look like a drowned rat all day, and an immodest drowned rat at that, shift and dress half transparent with water and sticking to her.</p><p>The casual thought coincided with Ian\u2019s buckling of his belt, and the movement drew her eye to the flap of his linen breechclout\u2014or, rather, to where it had been before he raised it to pull it over his belt.</p><p>She drew in her breath audibly and he looked up at her, surprised.</p><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said, her face going hot despite the cool water. But he looked down, following the direction of her gaze, and then looked back, right into her eyes, and she had a strong impulse to jump straight into the water, damage to her wardrobe notwithstanding.</p><p>\u201cAre ye bothered?\u201d he said, eyebrows raised, as he plucked at the wet cloth of his breechclout, then dropped the flap.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with dignity. \u201cI\u2019ve seen one before, thee knows. Many of them. Just not . . .\u201d Not one with which I am soon to be intimately acquainted. \u201cJust not . . . yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna think it\u2019s anything out o\u2019 the ordinary,\u201d he assured her gravely. \u201cBut ye can look, if ye like. Just in case. I wouldna want ye to be startled, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStartled,\u201d she repeated, giving him a look. \u201cIf thee thinks I am under any illusions about either the object or the process, after living for months in a military camp . . . I doubt I shall be shocked, when the occasion a\u2014\u201d She broke off, a moment too late.</p><p>\u201cRises,\u201d he finished for her, grinning. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be verra disappointed if ye\u2019re not, ken?\u201d</p><p>IN SPITE OF the hot blush, which seemed to run from her scalp straight down into her nether regions, she didn\u2019t begrudge him fun at her expense. Anything that made him smile like that was balm to her own spirit.</p><p>He\u2019d been deeply oppressed, ever since the dreadful news of the ship\u2019s sinking had come, and while he\u2019d borne up with a stoicism she thought natural to both Highlanders and Indians, saying little about it, he hadn\u2019t tried to hide his desolation from her, either. She was glad of that, despite her own sadness for Mr. Fraser, for whom she had a deep respect and affection.</p><p>She did wonder about Ian\u2019s mother and how she might have got on with that lady. At the best, she might have had a mother again herself\u2014and that would have been a great blessing. She hadn\u2019t been expecting the best, though; she doubted that Jenny Murray would have been any more pleased at the notion of her son marrying a Friend than a Quaker meeting might be to hear of Rachel\u2019s intention of marrying a man of blood\u2014and a Catholic, to boot. She wasn\u2019t sure which of those would be more cause for consternation but was sure that Ian\u2019s tattoos would pale in contrast to his affiliation with the Pope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow shall we be wed, d\u2019ye think?\u201d Ian, who had been walking in front of her to push branches out of her way, paused and turned to let her come alongside, the path here being wide enough to walk abreast for a little.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she told him frankly. \u201cI think I cannot in good conscience be baptized Catholic, no more than you in good conscience could live as a Friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo Friends marry only other Friends, then?\u201d One side of his mouth curled. \u201cI\u2019d think the choice might be a bit sparse. Or d\u2019ye all end up marrying your cousins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey marry other Friends or they get put out of meeting,\u201d she told him, ignoring the gibe about cousins. \u201cWith rare exceptions. A marriage between a Friend and a non-Friend might be allowed in case of dire circumstance\u2014after a committee on clearness had conferred with both bride and groom\u2014but it\u2019s rare. I fear that even Dorothea may have difficulty, in spite of her very evident sincerity of conversion.\u201d</p> <p>Ian laughed at thought of Denny\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Lady Dorothea Jacqueline Benedicta Grey was no one\u2019s notion of a demure Quaker\u2014though, for that matter, Rachel thought that anyone who supposed female Friends to be demure had never met one.</p><p>\u201cHave ye asked Denny what they mean to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d she admitted. \u201cTo tell the truth, I am somewhat afraid to ask.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s feathery brows shot up.</p><p>\u201cAfraid? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth on his account and ours. You know we were put out of our meeting in Virginia\u2014or, rather, he was, and I went with him. It affected him very much, and I know he wishes above all things to marry Dottie properly, before the witness of a meeting to which they both belong.\u201d</p><p>Ian shot her a quick glance, and she knew he was about to ask if she felt likewise. She hurried on, to forestall him.</p><p>\u201cThere are other Friends in his same case, though: men who cannot abide the thought of capitulation to the King and who feel obliged to assist the Continental army. \u2018Fighting Quakers,\u2019 they call themselves.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help smiling at the name; it conjured such incongruous images.</p><p>\u201cSome such held meeting now and then at Valley Forge, but they aren\u2019t accepted by Philadelphia yearly meeting. Denny has to do with them but hasn\u2019t joined them as yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d The trail had narrowed again and Ian moved ahead, turning his head to speak over his shoulder so she would know he attended. She was somewhat distracted herself; the buckskin was drying slowly, molding itself damply to Ian\u2019s long, sinewy shanks, and reminding her of his breechclout.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, recovering her train of thought. \u201cThe thing is\u2014is thee familiar with religious disputation, Ian?\u201d</p> <p>That made him laugh again.</p><p>\u201cI thought not,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cI am. And the thing is, when a group of . . . of . . . persons who disagree with a central teaching of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeretics?\u201d he offered helpfully. \u201cQuakers wouldna burn folk, would they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose who are led of the spirit to follow a different path, let us say,\u201d she said, a little tersely. \u201cAnd, no, they wouldn\u2019t. But the point I am making is that when such a group breaks away over some point of doctrine, they are inclined to cling even more rigorously to the rest of their beliefs and be more fierce even than the original group.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s head lifted; so did Rollo\u2019s. Both hunters turned to and fro, nostrils flaring, but then shook themselves slightly and resumed walking. \u201cAye, so?\u201d Ian said, reminding her of her point.</p><p>\u201cSo even if Denny should become convinced that he should belong to a meeting of Fighting Quakers, they might be that much more reluctant to accept a member such as Dottie. Though, on the other hand, should they be willing to do so, that might mean that they would at least consider our marriage. . . .\u201d She tried to sound hopeful about that prospect but in truth thought pigs might fly before any meeting of Friends accepted Ian Murray\u2014or vice versa. \u201cIs thee attending, Ian?\u201d she asked a little sharply, for man and dog were still moving but with a new wariness. Rollo\u2019s ears cocked alertly and Ian shifted his rifle from shoulder to hand. Within a few steps, she heard what they had heard\u2014the distant sounds of wagon wheels and marching feet. An army on the move, and the thought made the fine hairs prickle on her arms, in spite of the heat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ian turned a blank face toward her, then came to himself and smiled. \u201cWell, no. I was wondering what a dire circumstance might be. To Friends.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had wondered that herself, if only briefly. \u201cWell . . .\u201d she began dubiously. In truth, she had no idea what sort of dire circumstance would make such a marriage thinkable, let alone acceptable.</p> <p>\u201cI was only thinking,\u201d he went on, before she could think of anything. \u201cUncle Jamie told me how it was when his parents wed. His father stole his mother away from her brothers, and they were obliged to hide where they could, for the MacKenzies of Leoch werena anything ye\u2019d want to face, when roused.\u201d</p><p>His face was animated, telling the story.</p><p>\u201cThey couldna be marrit in kirk, for the banns couldna be called, and they\u2019d be discovered the moment they came out of hiding to speak to a priest. So they stayed hidden until Ellen\u2014that would be my grannie, aye?\u2014was big wi\u2019 child, and then came out. Her brothers couldna object to the marriage at that point, and so they were wed.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo I was only wondering: would Friends think a coming child a dire circumstance?\u201d</p><p>Rachel stared at him.</p><p>\u201cIf thee thinks that I will lie with thee without marriage, Ian Murray,\u201d she said, in measured tones, \u201cthee has no notion just how dire thy own circumstances might become.\u201d</p><p>BY THE TIME they reached the main road that led to Philadelphia, the sound had grown amazingly\u2014and so had the traffic making it. Normally a busy road, carrying travelers and wagons full of produce to and from the nearby countryside, it was all but choked now, mules braying, children shrieking, harried parents calling out for their offspring, pushing handcarts and barrows full of possessions along the road, often with a resentful pig towed alongside by a rope round its neck or a basket of chickens wobbling atop the pile.</p><p>And in, around, and through the struggling knots of civilians fleeing at footpace was the army. Marching columns, two by two, leather straps and gaiters creaking as they sweated through their coats, faces more crimson in the heat than their fading uniforms. Small platoons of cavalry, still fine on their horses, knots of green-clad Hessians, and, here and there, companies of infantry stationed at the side of the road, providing support for officers who were stopping wagons, sometimes commandeering them, sometimes waving them on.</p><p>Ian paused in the shadow of the trees, judging the situation. The sun was nearly overhead\u2014plenty of time. And they had nothing that the army would want; no one would stop them.</p><p>He was aware of the militia companies, too. They had met several, passing through the woods. These for the most part stayed off the road, making their way carefully through the verges in ones and twos and threes, not hiding, but not drawing attention to themselves, either.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Rachel exclaimed, her hand tightening on his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s William!\u201d She pointed at a tall officer on the far side of the road and looked up at Ian, her face bright as sun on water. \u201cWe must speak to him!\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s hand had tightened on her shoulder in response, and he felt the urgency of her flesh\u2014but also the terrible fragility of the bones under it.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d he said, and lifted his chin toward the plodding ranks of disgruntled troops, sweating and dust-stained. \u201cI dinna want ye anywhere in sight o\u2019 them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed just a trifle\u2014but Ian had been married once and took his hand off her shoulder promptly.</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d he said hastily, \u201cI\u2019ll go and talk to William. I\u2019ll bring him here to ye.\u201d</p><p>Rachel opened her mouth to reply, but he snooved his way hastily through the screening bushes before she could speak.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he said sternly to Rollo, turning back for an instant. The dog, who had not stirred from his comfortable spot at Rachel\u2019s feet, twitched one ear.</p><p>William was standing by the roadside, looking hot, tired, disheveled, and thoroughly unhappy. As well he might, Ian thought with some sympathy. He kent William had surrendered at Saratoga; he was likely bound for England\u2014if he was lucky\u2014or for a long parole in some rough lodging somewhere far to the north. In either case, his active role as a soldier was over for some time.</p><p>His face changed abruptly at sight of Ian. Surprise, the beginnings of indignation, then a quick glance round, decision clamping down upon his features. Ian was surprised for a moment that he could read William\u2019s face so easily but then remembered why. Uncle Jamie guarded his own expression in company\u2014but not with Ian. Ian\u2019s own face didn\u2019t show his knowledge, though, any more than William\u2019s now showed more than an irritable acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cScout,\u201d William said, with the briefest of nods. The corporal to whom he had been talking gave Ian a brief, incurious look, then saluted William and plunged back into the trudging stream.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell do you want?\u201d William drew a grubby sleeve across his sweating face. Ian was mildly surprised at this evident hostility; they\u2019d parted on good terms the last time they had seen each other\u2014though there had been little conversation at the time, William having just put a pistol ball through the brain of a madman trying to kill Rachel, Ian, or both, with an ax. Ian\u2019s left arm had healed enough to dispense with a sling, but it was still stiff.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lady who\u2019d like to speak with ye,\u201d he said, ignoring William\u2019s narrowed eyes. The eyes relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hunter?\u201d A small gleam of pleasure lit William\u2019s eyes, and Ian\u2019s own narrowed slightly. Aye, well, he thought, let her tell him, then.</p><p>William waved to another corporal down the line, who waved back, then he stepped off the road after Ian. A few soldiers glanced at Ian, but he was unremarkable, the double line of dotted tattooing on his cheeks, his buckskin breeches, and his sun-browned skin marking him as an Indian scout\u2014a good many of these had deserted the British army, but there were still a good many left, mostly Loyalists like Joseph Brant, who held land in Pennsylvania and New York; there were also still some ranging parties from the Iroquois nations who had come down to fight at Saratoga.</p><p>\u201cWilliam!\u201d Rachel flew across the little clearing and clasped the tall captain\u2019s hands, beaming up at him with such joy that he smiled back at her, all irritability vanished. Ian hung back a bit, to give her time. There hadn\u2019t been any, really, what with Rollo roaring and tearing at Arch Bug\u2019s miserable auld carcass, Rachel sprawled on the floor, frozen with horror, himself lying on the floor pouring blood, and half the street outside screaming bloody murder.</p><p>William had pulled Rachel to her feet and thrust her into the arms of the first woman available, who, as it happened, was Marsali.</p><p>\u201cGet her out of here!\u201d William had snapped. But Rachel, Ian\u2019s nut-brown maiden\u2014her brownness much splattered with blood\u2014had pulled herself together in an instant and, gritting her teeth\u2014Ian had seen her do it, bemused by shock as he lay on the floor, watching things happen as though in a dream\u2014had stepped over auld Arch\u2019s body, fallen to her knees in the mess of brains and blood, wrapped her apron tight about Ian\u2019s wounded arm and tied it with her kerchief, and then, with Marsali, had dragged him bodily out of the printshop and into the street, where he\u2019d promptly passed out, waking only when Auntie Claire began stitching his arm.</p><p>Ian hadn\u2019t had time to thank William, even had he been able to speak, and he meant to convey his own thanks as soon as he might. But clearly Rachel wanted to talk to him first, and he waited, thinking how beautiful she looked, her eyes the clouded hazel of thicket and greenbrier, face clever and quick as flame.</p><p>\u201cBut thee is tired, William, and thin,\u201d she was saying, drawing a finger disapprovingly down the side of his face. \u201cDo they not feed thee? I\u2019d thought it was only the Continentals who went short of rations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I\u2014I haven\u2019t had time of late.\u201d The happiness that had lit William\u2019s face while he talked with Rachel faded noticeably. \u201cWe\u2014well, you see.\u201d He waved an arm toward the invisible road, where the hoarse chants of the sergeants rang like the calling of disgruntled crows above the shuffle of feet.</p><p>\u201cI do see. Where is thee going?\u201d</p><p>William rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth and glanced at Ian.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he oughtn\u2019t to say,\u201d Ian said, coming across and touching Rachel\u2019s arm, smiling at William in apology. \u201cWe\u2019re the enemy, mo nighean donn.\u201d</p><p>William looked sharply at Ian, catching the tone of his voice, then back at Rachel, whose hand he was still holding.</p><p>\u201cWe are betrothed, William\u2014Ian and I,\u201d she said, gently pulling her hand out of his and putting it on Ian\u2019s.</p><p>William\u2019s face changed abruptly, losing its look of happiness altogether. He eyed Ian with something remarkably close to dislike.</p><p>\u201cAre you,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI suppose I must wish you every happiness, then. Good day.\u201d He turned on his heel, and Ian, surprised, reached out to pull him back.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d he said, and then William turned and hit him in the mouth.</p><p>He was lying on his back in the leaves, blinking in disbelief, as Rollo hurtled over him and sank his teeth into some soft part of William, judging by the yelp and the brief cry of startlement from Rachel.</p><p>\u201cRollo! Bad dog\u2014and thee is a bad dog, too, William Ransom! What the devil does thee mean by this?\u201d</p><p>Ian sat up, tenderly fingering his lip, which was bleeding. Rollo had retreated a little under Rachel\u2019s scolding but kept a yellow eye fixed on William and a curled lip raised over bared teeth, the faintest rumble of a growl coming from his huge chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuirich,\u201d Ian said to him briefly, and got to his feet. William had sat down and was examining the calf of his leg, which was bleeding through his torn silk hose, though not badly. When he saw Ian, he scrambled to his feet. His face was bright red and he looked as though he meant to either do murder or burst into tears. Maybe both, Ian thought in surprise.</p><p>He was careful not to touch William again but stood back a bit\u2014in front of Rachel, just in case the man meant to go off again. He was armed, after all; there was a pistol and knife at his belt.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, man?\u201d Ian asked, in the same tone of mild concern he\u2019d heard his da use now and then on his mam or Uncle Jamie. Evidently it was in fact the right tone to take with a Fraser about to go berserk, for William breathed like a grampus for a moment or two, then got himself under control.</p><p>\u201cI ask your pardon, sir,\u201d he said, back stiff as a stick of rock maple. \u201cThat was unforgivable. I shall . . . leave you. I\u2014Miss Hunter . . . I\u2014\u201d He turned, stumbling a little, and that gave Rachel time to dart round in front of Ian.</p> <p>\u201cWilliam!\u201d Her face was full of distress. \u201cWhat is it? Have I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his face contorted, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d he said, with an obvious effort. \u201cYou . . . you could never do anything that\u2014\u201d He swung round toward Ian, fist clenched on his sword. \u201cBut you, you f**king bas\u2014you son of a bitch! Cousin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Ian stupidly. \u201cYe know, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody know! You could have f**king told me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Rachel looked from him to William and back again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you bloody tell her!\u201d William snapped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Rachel said reasonably. \u201cOf course he\u2019ll tell me, the minute we\u2019re alone. Does thee not wish to tell me thyself? I think perhaps thee might not trust Ian to say it aright.\u201d Her eye rested on Ian\u2019s lip, and her own mouth twitched. Ian might have taken offense at this, save that William\u2019s distress was so apparent.</p><p>\u201cIt isna really a disgrace\u2014\u201d he began, but then stepped hastily back as William\u2019s clenched fist drew back.</p><p>\u201cYou think not?\u201d William was so furious, his voice was nearly inaudible. \u201cTo discover that I am\u2014am\u2014the . . . the get of a Scottish criminal? That I am a f**king bastard?\u201d</p><p>Despite his resolve to be patient, Ian felt his own dander start to rise.</p> <p>\u201cCriminal, forbye!\u201d he snapped. \u201cAny man might be proud to be the son of Jamie Fraser!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Rachel, forestalling William\u2019s next heated remark. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He glared down at her. \u201cWhat the devil do you mean, \u2018that\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought it must be the case, Denny and I.\u201d She lifted one shoulder, though keeping a close watch on William, who looked as if he were about to go off like a twelve-pound mortar. \u201cBut we supposed that thee didn\u2019t wish the matter talked about. I didn\u2019t know that thee\u2014how could thee not have known?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cThe resemblance\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck the resemblance!\u201d</p><p>Ian forgot Rachel and hit William on the head with a double-fisted thump that knocked him to his knees, then kicked him in the stomach. Had the kick landed where he\u2019d meant it to, it would have finished the matter right there, but William was a good deal faster than Ian expected him to be. He twisted sideways, caught Ian\u2019s foot, and yanked. Ian hit the ground on one elbow, rolled up, and got hold of William\u2019s ear. He was dimly aware of Rachel screaming and was momentarily sorry for it, but the relief of fighting was too great to think of anything else, and she disappeared as his fury surged.</p><p>There was blood in his mouth and his ears were ringing, but he had one hand on William\u2019s throat and the other stabbing forked for his eyes, when hands seized him by the shoulders and jerked him off his cousin\u2019s squirming body.</p><p>He shook his head to clear it, panting and pulling at whoever was holding him\u2014there were two of the villains. That earned him a thump in the ribs that knocked out what little breath he had.</p> <p>William wasn\u2019t doing much better. He got to his feet, wiping the back of his hand under his nose, which was bleeding profusely. He glanced at the result and grimaced in disgust, wiping the hand on his coat.</p><p>\u201cTake him,\u201d he said, half breathless but in control of himself. One of his eyes was swelling shut, but the other gave Ian a look of straightforward bloodlust\u2014and, despite the circumstances, Ian was once more startled at seeing one of Uncle Jamie\u2019s expressions on another face.</p><p>There was a thunderous growl from Rollo. Rachel had the big dog\u2019s scruff twisted tight, but Ian kent well enough that she couldn\u2019t hold him if he decided to savage William. \u201cFuirich, a cu!\u201d he said, with all the authority he could summon. The soldiers would kill Rollo without a second thought if he lunged for William\u2019s throat. The dog eased back down on his haunches but stayed tensed, his lips drawn back from saliva-dripping fangs and a deep, constant growl echoing through his body.</p><p>William glanced at Rollo, then turned his back on the dog. He sniffed, hawked, and spat blood to one side, then continued, still breathing heavily. \u201cTake him to the head of the column, to Colonel Prescott. He\u2019s under arrest for assaulting an officer; he\u2019ll be dealt with at camp this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does thee mean, \u2018dealt with\u2019?\u201d Rachel demanded, pushing her way past the two soldiers holding Ian. \u201cAnd how dare thee, William Ransom? How\u2014how . . . how dare thee?!\u201d She was white-faced with fury, small fists clenched and shaking at her sides, and Ian grinned at her, licking fresh blood from his split lip. She was paying no attention to him, though, all her ire focused on William, who drew himself up to his full height and glared down the steep bridge of his nose at her.</p><p>\u201cThis is no longer your concern, madam,\u201d he said, as coldly as a man who was red as a piece of flannel and shooting sparks out of his ears could manage.</p><p>Ian thought Rachel might actually kick William in the shins, and would have paid good money to see that, but her Quaker principles got the better of the situation and she drew herself up to her own not insignificant height\u2014she was as tall as Auntie Claire\u2014and thrust her chin pugnaciously up at William.</p><p>\u201cThee is a coward and a brute,\u201d she declared at the top of her voice. Swinging round toward the men holding Ian, she added, \u201cAnd so are you brutes and cowards, to be following an order so lacking in justice!\u201d</p><p>One of the soldiers sniggered, then coughed as he caught William\u2019s bloodshot eye upon him.</p><p>\u201cTake him,\u201d William repeated. \u201cNow.\u201d And, turning on his heel, stalked off. There was a broad stripe of pale road dust down the back of his coat and a good deal of it in his hair.</p><p>\u201cBest bugger off, miss,\u201d one of the soldiers advised Rachel, not unkindly. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be down amongst the troops, like, not on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not bugger off,\u201d Rachel said, narrowing her eyes at the man in a way that reminded Ian of a panther about to spring. \u201cWhat does thee intend to do to this man?\u201d She gestured at Ian, who was getting his own breath back by now.</p><p>\u201cRachel,\u201d he began, but was interrupted by the other soldier.</p><p>\u201cAssaulting an officer? Probably five hundred lashes. Wouldn\u2019t hang him, I don\u2019t s\u2019pose,\u201d the man added dispassionately. \u201cSeeing as young Galahad\u2019s not maimed, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rachel went even whiter at this, and Ian jerked hard at his arms, getting his feet solidly under him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, a nighean,\u201d he said, hoping he sounded reassuring. \u201cRollo! Sheas! But he\u2019s right\u2014the camp\u2019s nay place for ye, and ye canna do me any good by coming. Go back to the city, aye? Tell Auntie Claire what\u2019s happened\u2014she can speak to L\u2014ungk!\u201d A third soldier, coming out of nowhere, had hit him in the pit of the stomach with a musket butt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you lot hangin\u2019 about for? Get on! And you\u2014 \u201d The soldier turned on Rachel and the dog, glowering. \u201cShoo.\u201d He jerked his head at Ian\u2019s captors, who obligingly hauled Ian around.</p><p>Ian tried to turn his head to give Rachel a final word, but they jerked him back and firmly down the road.</p><p>He stumbled along, in preference to being dragged, thinking furiously. Auntie Claire was his best chance\u2014likely his only one. If she could make Lord John take a hand, either speaking to Willie or directly to this Colonel Prescott . . . He glanced up at the sun. Noon, more or less. And the British on the march carried out routine flogging and other punishment after the evening meal; he\u2019d seen it now and then, and he\u2019d seen his uncle\u2019s back now and then, too. A cold worm crawled through his sore belly.</p><p>Six hours. Maybe.</p><p>He risked another quick glance back. Rachel was running, Rollo loping alongside.</p><p>WILLIAM SWABBED HIS face with what was left of his handkerchief. His features felt foreign to him, lumped and swollen, and he explored the inside of his mouth gingerly with his tongue: no teeth missing, a couple maybe loose, and a stinging cut inside his cheek. Not bad. He thought he\u2019d done worse to Murray and was glad of it.</p><p>He was still trembling\u2014not with shock but with the urge to rip someone limb from limb. At the same time, he was beginning to feel shock, though conscious thought still came in fleeting snatches. What the devil had he done?</p><p>A short column of soldiers marched past, a few of them openly staring at him. He gave them a vicious look, and their heads snapped forward so fast he could hear the leather of their stocks creak.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t done it. Murray had attacked him. Where did Rachel Hunter get off, calling him a coward and a brute? He felt the tickle of blood crawling down from one nostril and stanched it, snorting into the filthy rag. He saw someone approaching, coming up the road, accompanied by a large dog. He straightened, stuffing the handkerchief into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cSpeak of the bloody she-devil,\u201d he muttered, and coughed, his throat raw with the iron taste of blood.</p><p>Rachel Hunter was pale with rage. Apparently she hadn\u2019t turned round to apologize for her insults. She had snatched off her cap and held it clutched in one hand\u2014did she mean to throw it at him? he wondered in fogged amazement.</p><p>\u201cMiss Hunter\u2014\u201d he began in a rasping voice, and would have bowed, save he was afraid the motion would make his nose bleed again.</p><p>\u201cThee cannot mean it, William!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean what?\u201d he said, and she gave him a look that might have singed the small hairs off his body, had he not still been hot himself.</p><p>\u201cDo not be obtuse!\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat possessed thee, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed your\u2014your fianc\u00e9?\u201d he snapped back. \u201cDid I attack him? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did! You struck him in the mouth, without the slightest provocation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he hit me on the head, without the least warning! If anyone is a coward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare call Ian Murray coward, you\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him what I bloody like\u2014what he bloody is. Just like his goddamned uncle, goddamned Scottish bastard fu\u2014I mean . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis uncle? Thy father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he bellowed, and felt the blood surge into his face, stinging all the raw places. \u201cDon\u2019t call him my father!\u201d</p><p>She breathed stertorously through her nose for a moment, glaring up at him.</p><p>\u201cIf thee allow this to be done, William Ransom, I will\u2014I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>William could feel the blood pool in his belly and thought he might faint, but not because of her threats.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d he asked, half breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re a Quaker. You don\u2019t believe in violence. Ergo, you can\u2019t\u2014or at least won\u2019t\u201d\u2014he corrected himself, seeing the dangerous look in her eye\u2014\u201cstab me. You probably won\u2019t even strike me. So what did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>She did strike him. Her hand whipped out like a snake and slapped him across the face hard enough to make him stagger.</p><p>\u201cSo now thee has doomed thy kinsman, repudiated thy father, and caused me to betray my principles. What next?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell,\u201d he said, and grabbed her arms, pulled her roughly to him, and kissed her. He let go and stepped back quickly, leaving her bug-eyed and gasping.</p><p>The dog growled at him. She glared at him, spat on the ground at his feet, then wiped her lips on her sleeve and, turning away, marched off, the dog at her heels casting a red-eyed look at William.</p><p>\u201cIs spitting on people a part of your bloody principles?\u201d he shouted after her.</p><p>She swung round, fists clenched at her sides.</p><p>\u201cIs assaulting women part of thine?\u201d she bellowed back, to the amusement of the infantrymen who had been standing still by the road, leaning on their weapons and gaping at the show provided.</p><p>Flinging her cap on the ground at his feet, she whirled on her heel and stamped away, before he could say more.</p><p>JAMIE CAUGHT SIGHT of a small group of redcoats coming down the road and slumped on the wagon\u2019s seat, hat pulled down over his eyes. No one would be looking for him, with the British army on the move, and even were he recognized, probably no one would bother trying to detain or question him in the midst of such an exodus\u2014but the sight of British soldiers would likely put a knot in his tailbone for the rest of his life, and today was no exception.</p><p>He turned his head casually away toward the far side of the road as the soldiers passed, but then heard a loud \u201cIfrinn!\u201d in a very familiar voice, and jerked round in reflex to find himself staring straight into his nephew Ian\u2019s startled, horrified face.</p><p>He was equally startled\u2014and nearly as horrified\u2014to see Ian, hands tied behind his back, smeared with dirt and blood and obviously the worse for wear, being shoved along by two cross-looking British privates, red-faced and sweating in their heavy uniforms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stifled his immediate urge to leap off the wagon and stared hard at Ian, willing the lad not to speak. He didn\u2019t, just goggled back with his eyes bulging out of his head and his face pale, as though he\u2019d seen a ghost, and walked past, speechless.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jamie murmured under his breath, realizing. \u201cHe thinks he has seen my fetch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho thinks what?\u201d asked the driver, though without much interest.</p><p>\u201cI think I must get down here, sir, if ye\u2019d be so civil as to stop? Aye, thanks.\u201d Without thought of his back, he swung down off the wagon; it twinged, but there was no warning stab of pain down his leg\u2014and if there had been, he would still have gone up the road as fast as he could, because he saw a small figure a little way ahead, running like a rabbit with its tail on fire. The figure was plainly female, it was accompanied by a large dog, and he had the sudden thought that it might be Rachel Hunter.</p> <p>It was, and he just managed to catch her up, seizing her by the arm as she ran, petticoats kirtled up in her arms and feet hammering the dust.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, lass,\u201d he said urgently, grabbed her round the waist, and pulled her off the road. She uttered a stifled shriek\u2014and then a much louder one, when she looked up and saw his face.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not dead,\u201d he said hurriedly. \u201cLater, aye? Step back on the road wi\u2019 me now, or someone\u2019s going to come see am I raping ye in the bushes. Ciamar a tha thu, a choin?\u201d he added to Rollo, who was sniffing him industriously.</p><p>She made an odd gargling noise in her throat and continued to stare, but after an instant blinked and nodded and they were back on the road. Jamie smiled and acknowledged a man who had stopped in the middle of the road, dropping the handles of a barrow he was trundling. The man looked suspiciously at them, but Rachel, after a moment\u2019s stunned bewilderment, waved at him with a ghastly smile, and he shrugged and picked up his barrow.</p><p>\u201cWh-what\u2014\u201d she croaked. She looked as though she might collapse or vomit, chest heaving and her face going scarlet and white and scarlet again. She\u2019d lost her cap, and her dark hair was matted with sweat and sticking to her face.</p> <p>\u201cLater,\u201d he said again, but gently. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to Ian? Where are they taking him?\u201d</p><p>Between wrenching gasps, she told him what had happened.</p><p>\u201cA mh\u2019ic an diabhail,\u201d he said softly, and wondered for a split second what\u2014or who\u2014he meant by that. The thought vanished, though, as he looked up the road. Perhaps a quarter mile back, he could see the large, slow-moving knot of evacuees, a sprawling mass of slow wagons and trudging people, with the neat scarlet columns of soldiers splitting to flow round them, coming on now four abreast.</p><p>\u201cAye, then,\u201d he said grimly, and touched Rachel\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDinna fash, lassie. Get your breath and go back after Ian, but dinna get close enough that the soldiers take notice of ye. When he\u2019s free, tell him the two of ye must come back to the city straightaway. Go to the printshop. Oh\u2014and best leash the hound wi\u2019 your sash. Ye dinna want him to eat anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree? But what\u2014what are you going to do?\u201d She\u2019d got the hair out of her eyes and was calmer, though the whites of her eyes still showed all round. She reminded him of a young badger at bay, baring its teeth in panic, and the thought made him smile a little.</p><p>\u201cI mean to have a word with my son,\u201d he said, and, leaving her, strode purposefully up the road.</p> <p>HE MADE OUT William at a considerable distance. The young man was standing at the side of the road, bare-headed, disheveled, and slightly battered, but evidently attempting to look collected; his hands were folded behind his back, and he appeared to be counting the wagons that passed him. He was alone, and Jamie hastened his step to reach the lad before anyone came along to talk to him; he needed privacy for his own conversation.</p><p>He was reasonably sure Rachel hadn\u2019t told him everything about the recent stramash and wondered whether she herself had been partly the cause of it. She had said the trouble began just after she\u2019d told William about her betrothal to Ian. Her account had been slightly confused overall, but he\u2019d got the gist of it well enough, and his jaw tightened as he came up to William and saw the look on his face.</p><p>Christ, do I look like that in a temper? he wondered briefly. It was off-putting to speak to a man who looked as though he asked nothing more of the world than the chance to rend someone limb from limb and dance on the pieces.</p><p>\u201cWell, rend away, lad,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see who dances.\u201d He stepped up beside William and took off his hat.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said baldly, not wishing to call the lad by either title or name, \u201ccome aside wi\u2019 me. Now.\u201d</p><p>The look on William\u2019s face changed from incipient murder to the same look of startled horror Jamie had just surprised on Ian\u2019s. Had matters been otherwise, he\u2019d have laughed. As it was, he gripped William hard by the upper arm, pushed him off-balance, and had him into the shelter of a scrim of saplings before he could set his feet hard.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d William blurted, wrenching loose. \u201cWhat the devil are you doing here? And where is my\u2014what have you\u2014\u201d He made a convulsive gesture of dismissal. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to you, if ye\u2019ll close your mouth for a moment,\u201d Jamie said coldly. \u201cListen to me, lad, because I\u2019m telling ye what you\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me anything,\u201d William began furiously, and cocked a fist. Jamie grabbed him by the upper arm again, and this time dug his fingers hard into the spot Claire had shown him, on the underside of the bone. William let out a strangled \u201cAgh!\u201d and started to pant, his eyes bulging.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to catch up the men ye sent Ian with and tell them to set him free,\u201d Jamie said evenly. \u201cIf ye don\u2019t, I go down under a flag of truce to the camp where they\u2019re taking him, introduce myself, tell the commander who you are, and explain the reason for the fight. Ye\u2019ll be right there beside me. Do I make myself clear?\u201d he asked, increasing the pressure of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The word came out in a hiss, and Jamie let go suddenly, folding his fingers into a fist to hide the fact that they were trembling and twitching from the effort.</p><p>\u201cGod damn you, sir,\u201d William whispered, and his eyes were black with violence. \u201cGod damn you to hell.\u201d His arm hung limp and must have hurt, but he wouldn\u2019t rub it, not with Jamie watching.</p><p>Jamie nodded. \u201cNay doubt,\u201d he said quietly, and went into the forest. Once out of sight of the road, he leaned against a tree, feeling sweat stream down his face. His back felt cast in cement. His whole body was trembling, but he hoped that William had been too distrait to notice.</p><p>God, should it have come to blows, I couldna take him.</p><p>He closed his eyes and listened to his heart, which was thumping like a bodhran. After a little, he heard the sound of hooves on the road, a horse galloping, and, turning to peer through the trees, caught a glimpse of William thundering past, heading in the direction Ian had been taken.</p><p>THE GATHERING STORM</p><p>BY BREAKFAST ON Thursday, I\u2019d come to the firm conclusion that it was the Duke of Pardloe or me. If I stayed in the house, only one of us would remain alive by sundown. Denzell Hunter must have come into the city by now, I reasoned; he\u2019d call in daily at Mrs. Woodcock\u2019s house, where Henry Grey was convalescing. A very kind and capable doctor, he could easily manage Hal\u2019s recovery\u2014and perhaps his future father-in-law would be grateful for his professional attention.</p><p>The thought made me laugh out loud, despite my increasing anxiety.</p><p>To Dr. Denzell Hunter</p><p>From Dr. C. B. R. Fraser</p><p>I am called away to Kingsessing for the day. I surrender His Grace the Duke of Pardloe to your most competent care, in the happy confidence that your religious scruples will prevent your striking him in the head with an ax.</p><p>Yours most sincerely,</p><p>C.</p><p>Postscriptum: I\u2019ll bring you back some asafoetida and ginseng root as recompense.</p><p>Post-postscriptum: Strongly suggest you don\u2019t bring Dottie, unless you possess a pair of manacles. Preferably two.</p><p>I sanded this missive, gave it to Colenso for delivery to Mrs. Woodcock\u2019s house, and executed a quiet sneak out the front door before Jenny or Mrs. Figg should pop up and demand to know where I was going.</p><p>It was barely seven o\u2019clock, but the air was already warming, gradually heating up the city. By noon, the pungent mix of animals, humans, sewage, rotting vegetable matter, resinous trees, river mud, and hot brick would be stifling, but for the moment, the faint scent lent a piquant touch to the gentle air. I was tempted to walk, but even my most utilitarian shoes weren\u2019t up to an hour\u2019s walk on country roads\u2014and if I waited for sundown and the cooling evening to make my way back, I\u2019d be remarkably late.</p><p>Neither was it a good idea for a woman to be alone on the roads, on foot. Day or night.</p><p>I thought I could manage the three blocks to the livery stable without incident, but at the corner of Walnut I was hailed by a familiar voice from a carriage window.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser? I say, Mrs. Fraser!\u201d</p><p>I looked up, startled, to see the hawk-nosed face of Benedict Arnold smiling down at me. His normally fleshy features were gaunt and lined, and his usually ruddy complexion had faded to an indoor pallor, but there was no mistaking him.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I said, and made a quick bob. \u201cHow nice to see you, General!\u201d</p><p>My heart had sped up. I\u2019d heard from Denny Hunter that Arnold had been appointed military governor of Philadelphia but hadn\u2019t expected to see him so soon\u2014if at all.</p><p>I should have left it there but couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cHow\u2019s the leg?\u201d I knew he\u2019d been badly injured at Saratoga\u2014shot in the same leg that had been wounded a short time before, and then crushed by his horse falling with him in the storming of Breymann Redoubt\u2014but I hadn\u2019t seen him then. The regular army surgeons had attended him, and from what I knew of their work, I was rather surprised that he was not only alive but still had two legs.</p><p>His face clouded a bit at that, but he continued to smile.</p><p>\u201cStill present, Mrs. Fraser. If two inches shorter than the other. Where are you going this morning?\u201d He glanced automatically behind me, registering my lack of a maid or companion, but didn\u2019t seem disturbed by it. He\u2019d met me on the battlefield and knew me\u2014and appreciated me\u2014for what I was.</p><p>I knew what he was, too\u2014and what he would become.</p><p>The hell of it was that I liked the man.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . I\u2019m on my way out to Kingsessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn foot?\u201d His mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cActually, I had it in mind to hire a gig from the livery stable.\u201d I nodded in the general direction of Davison\u2019s stable. \u201cJust round the corner there. Lovely to see you, General!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a moment, Mrs. Fraser, if you would . . .\u201d He turned his head toward his aide, who was leaning over his shoulder, nodding toward me, and saying something inaudible. Next thing I knew, the carriage door popped open and the aide jumped down, offering me an arm.</p><p>\u201cDo come up, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Evans here says the livery is closed, Mrs. Fraser. Allow me to put my carriage at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Before I could think of anything to complete this protest, I was handed up opposite the general and the door firmly shut, Captain Evans hopping nimbly up beside the driver.</p><p>\u201cI gather that Mr. Davison was a Loyalist,\u201d General Arnold said, eyeing me.</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d I said, rather alarmed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain Evans says that Davison and his family have left the city.\u201d</p><p>They had. The carriage had turned in to Fifth Street, and I could see the livery stable, its doors hanging open\u2014one of them pulled entirely off and lying in the street. The stable was empty, as was the stable yard\u2014the wagon, the gig, and the small coach gone with the horses. Sold, or stolen. From the Davisons\u2019 house, next to the stable, the tatters of Mrs. Davison\u2019s lace curtains fluttered limp in a broken window.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, and swallowed. I darted a quick look at General Arnold. He\u2019d called me \u201cMrs. Fraser.\u201d Obviously, he didn\u2019t know what my current situation was\u2014and I couldn\u2019t make up my mind whether to tell him. On impulse, I decided not to. The less official inquiry there was into events at Number 17 Chestnut Street, the better, whether the inquiry was British or American.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told the British kept quite a clamp on Whigs in the city,\u201d he went on, looking me over with interest. \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t much troubled, you and the colonel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said. \u201cNot really.\u201d I took a deep breath, groping for some means of diverting the conversation. \u201cBut I have been rather short of news\u2014er, American news, I mean. Have there been any . . . remarkable developments of late?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, but wryly.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall I start, madam?\u201d</p><p>Despite my unease at meeting Benedict Arnold again, I was glad for his courtesy in offering me a ride; the air was thick with moisture and the sky white as a muslin sheet. My shift was moist with perspiration after only a brief walk; I would have been wringing wet\u2014and likely on the verge of heatstroke\u2014by the time I had walked as far as Kingsessing.</p><p>The general was excited, both by his new appointment and by the impending military developments. He was not at liberty to tell me what those were, he said\u2014but Washington was on the move. Still, I could see that his excitement was much tempered by regret; he was a natural warrior, and sitting behind a desk, no matter how important and ornate, was no substitute for the bone-deep thrill of leading men into a desperate fight.</p><p>Watching him shift in his seat, hands clenching and unclenching on his thighs as he talked, I felt my uneasiness deepen. Not just about him, but about Jamie. They were quite different kinds of men\u2014but Jamie\u2019s blood roused at the scent of battle, too. I could only hope he wasn\u2019t going to be anywhere in the vicinity of whatever battle might be impending. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The general set me down at the ferry; Kingsessing was on the other side of the Schuylkill. He got out himself to hand me down from the carriage, in spite of his bad leg, and pressed my hand in parting.</p><p>\u201cShall I send the carriage to retrieve you, Mrs. Fraser?\u201d he asked, glancing up at the hazy white sky. \u201cThe sky looks untrustworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be much longer than an hour or two about my business; it won\u2019t rain before four o\u2019clock\u2014it never does at this time of year. Or so my son assures me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son? Do I know your son?\u201d His brow wrinkled; he prided himself on his memory, Jamie had said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you would. Fergus Fraser, he\u2019s called; he\u2019s my husband\u2019s adopted son, really. He and his wife own the printshop on Market Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d His face lighted with interest, and he smiled. \u201cA newspaper called . . . The Onion? I heard it mentioned in the ordinary where I breakfasted this morning. A Patriot periodical, I gather, and somewhat given to satire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cL\u2019Oignon,\u201d I agreed, laughing. \u201cFergus is a Frenchman, and his wife has a sense of humor. They do print other things, though. And they sell books, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall call upon them,\u201d Arnold declared. \u201cI\u2019m quite without books, having left such belongings as I possess to follow after me. But really, my dear, how will you get back to Philadelphia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can borrow some form of transportation from the Bartrams,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI\u2019ve been to their gardens several times; they know me.\u201d In fact, I intended to walk\u2014I was in no hurry to return to the Chestnut Street house and my cantankerous prisoner (what the devil was I going to do with him? Particularly now that the British had left . . .), and it was no more than an hour on foot\u2014but knew better than to tell him that, and we parted with mutual expressions of esteem.</p> <p>It was only a quarter hour\u2019s walk from the ferry to Bartram\u2019s Garden, but I took my time about it, as much because my mind was still on General Arnold as because of the heat.</p><p>When? I wondered uneasily. When would it begin to happen? Not yet; I was almost sure of that. What was it, what would it be, that turned this gallant, honorable man from patriot to traitor? Who would he talk to, what would plant the deadly seed?</p><p>Lord, I thought in a moment of sudden, horrified prayer, please! Don\u2019t let it be something I said to him!</p><p>The very idea made me shudder, in spite of the oppressive heat. The more I saw of how things worked, the less I knew. Roger worried a lot about it, I knew: the why of it. Why were a few people able to do this? What effect\u2014conscious or unconscious\u2014did travelers have? And what ought they to do about it if they\u2014we\u2014did?</p><p>Knowing what would happen to Charles Stuart and the Rising hadn\u2019t stopped him, and it hadn\u2019t stopped our being dragged into the tragedy, either. But it had\u2014maybe\u2014saved the lives of a number of men whom Jamie had led from Culloden before the battle. It had saved Frank\u2019s life, or so I thought. Would I have told Jamie, though, if I\u2019d known what the cost would be to him and me? And if I hadn\u2019t told him, would we have been dragged into it anyway?</p><p>Well, there weren\u2019t any bloody answers, no more than there had been the hundreds of other times I\u2019d asked those bloody questions, and I heaved a sigh of relief as the gate to Bartram\u2019s Garden came in sight. An hour in the midst of acres of cool greenery was just what I needed.</p> <p>IN WHICH MRS. FIGG TAKES A HAND</p><p>JAMIE\u2019S BREATH CAME SHORT, and he found that he was clenching and unclenching his fists as he turned in to Chestnut Street. Not as a means of controlling his temper\u2014he had it well leashed and it would stay that way\u2014but only to let out more of the energy inside him.</p><p>He was trembling with it, with the need to see her, touch her, have her tight against him. Nothing else mattered. There\u2019d be words, there needed to be words\u2014but those could wait. Everything could wait.</p><p>He\u2019d left Rachel and Ian at the corner of Market and Second, to go on to the printshop to find Jenny, and he spared an instant\u2019s quick prayer that his sister and the wee Quaker might get on well together, but this vanished like smoke.</p><p>There was a burning just under his ribs that spread through his chest and throbbed in his restless fingers. The city smelled like burning, too; smoke hung under a lowering sky. He noted automatically the signs of looting and violence\u2014a half-burnt wall, the smudge of soot like a giant thumbprint on the plaster, broken windows, a woman\u2019s cap snagged on a bush and left to hang limp in the heavy air\u2014and the streets around him were full of people, but not those going about their business. Mostly men, many of them armed, half of them walking warily, glancing about, the rest standing in loose knots of excited conversation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care what was happening, providing only that it wasn\u2019t happening to Claire.</p><p>There it was, Number 17; the neat brick three-story house that he\u2019d rushed into\u2014and out of\u2014three days ago. The sight of it hit him in the pit of the stomach. He\u2019d been in there perhaps five minutes and recalled every second. Claire\u2019s hair, half brushed and clouding up around his face as he bent to her, smelling of bergamot, vanilla, and her own green scent. Her warmth and solidness in his arms, his hands; he\u2019d grabbed her by the arse, her lovely round arse so warm and firm under the thin shift, and his palms tingled with the memory of instant lust. And no more than an instant later . . .</p><p>He pushed the vision of William out of his mind. William could wait, too.</p> <p>His knock at the door was answered by the rotund black woman he\u2019d seen on his first arrival, and he greeted her in much the same way, though with not quite the same words.</p><p>\u201cGood day to ye, madam. I\u2019ve come for my wife.\u201d He stepped inside, past her open mouth and raised brows, and paused, blinking at the damage.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded, rounding on the housekeeper. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect she is, if you\u2019re meaning Lady John,\u201d the woman said, with a heavy emphasis on the name. \u201cAs to all this\u201d\u2014she rotated smoothly on her axis, gesturing toward the gouged, blood-smeared wall, the broken banister, and the iron skeleton of a chandelier, lying drunkenly in a corner of the foyer\u2014\u201cthat would be Captain Lord Ellesmere. Lord John\u2019s son.\u201d She narrowed her eyes and glared at Jamie in a way that made it apparent to him that she knew damned well what had happened in the hallway above when he\u2019d come face-to-face with William\u2014and she was not at all pleased.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t time to worry about her feelings and pushed past her as politely as possible, heading up the stairs as quickly as his twitching back muscles would allow.</p><p>As he reached the top of the stair, he heard a woman\u2019s voice\u2014but not Claire\u2019s. To his astonishment, it was his sister\u2019s voice, and he approached the farthest bedroom to see her back blocking the doorway. And over her shoulder . . .</p><p>He\u2019d felt unreal ever since his conversation with William at the roadside. Now he was convinced that he was hallucinating, because what he thought he saw was the Duke of Pardloe, face contorted in annoyance, rising from a chair, clad in nothing but a nightshirt.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d The words were spoken quietly, but their effect on Pardloe was instantaneous. He froze, and everything in his face save his eyes went blank.</p><p>Leaning forward, Jamie peered over Jenny\u2019s shoulder to see a large Highland dag in her hand, its eighteen-inch barrel trained steady on the duke\u2019s chest. What he could see of her face was white and set like marble. \u201cYe heard me,\u201d she said, her voice little more than a whisper.</p><p>Very slowly, Pardloe\u2014yes, it really was him, Jamie\u2019s eyes informed his dazed mind\u2014took two steps backward and lowered himself into the chair. Jamie could smell the gunpowder in the priming pan and thought the duke very likely could, too.</p><p>\u201cLord Melton,\u201d Jenny said, moving slightly so as to have him silhouetted against the dim light that filtered through the shutters. \u201cMy good-sister said that you\u2019re Lord Melton\u2014or were. Is that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Pardloe said. He wasn\u2019t moving, but Jamie saw that he had sat down with his legs flexed under him; he could be out of the chair in one lunge, if he chose. Very quietly, Jamie edged to the side. He was close enough that Jenny should have sensed him behind her, but he could see why she didn\u2019t; her shoulder blades were pressed together in concentration, sharp-edged under the cloth as a pair of hawk\u2019s wings.</p><p>\u201cIt was your men who came to my house,\u201d she said, her voice low. \u201cCame more than once, to loot and destroy, to take the food from our mouths. Who took my husband away\u201d\u2014for an instant, the barrel trembled, but then steadied again\u2014\u201caway to the prison where he took the ill that killed him. Move one inch, my lord, and I\u2019ll shoot ye in the guts. Ye\u2019ll die quicker than he did, but I daresay ye willna think it fast enough.\u201d</p><p>Pardloe didn\u2019t say a word but moved his head a fraction of an inch to indicate that he\u2019d understood her. His hands, which had been clutching the arms of the chair, relaxed. His eyes left the pistol\u2014and saw Jamie. His mouth fell open, his eyes sprang wide, and Jenny\u2019s finger whitened on the trigger.</p><p>Jamie got a hand under the gun just as it went off in a puff of black smoke, the crack of the firing simultaneous with the explosion of a china figure on the mantelpiece.</p><p>Pardloe sat frozen for an instant, then\u2014very carefully\u2014reached up and removed a large shard of porcelain from his hair.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser,\u201d he said, in a voice that was almost steady. \u201cYour servant, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour most obedient, Your Grace,\u201d Jamie replied, suffering an insane urge to laugh, and kept from it only by the sure knowledge that his sister would immediately reload and shoot him at point-blank range if he did. \u201cI see ye\u2019re acquainted with my sister, Mrs. Murray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\u2014dear lord, she is.\u201d Pardloe\u2019s eyes had flicked back and forth between their faces, and he now drew a long, slow breath. \u201cIs your entire family given to irascibility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are, Your Grace, and I thank ye for the compliment,\u201d Jamie said, and laid a hand on Jenny\u2019s back. He could feel her heart going like a trip-hammer, and her breath was coming in shallow pants. Putting the pistol aside, he took her hand in both of his. It was cold as ice in spite of the temperature in the room, which was slightly hotter than Hades, with the window shuttered and boarded over.</p><p>\u201cWould ye be so amiable as to pour out a dram of whatever\u2019s in that decanter, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Pardloe did and approached warily, holding out the glass\u2014it was brandy; Jamie could smell the hot fumes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him out,\u201d Jenny said, getting hold of herself. She glared at Pardloe and took the brandy, then glared at Jamie. \u201cAnd where in the name of St. Mary Magdalene have you been these three days past?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, heavy footsteps came hastily down the hallway and the black housekeeper appeared in the doorway, breathing audibly and holding a silver-inlaid fowling piece in a manner suggesting that she knew what to do with it.</p><p>\u201cThe two of you can just sit yourselves down this minute,\u201d she said, moving the barrel of the gun back and forth between Pardloe and Jamie in a businesslike fashion. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to take that man out of here, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014I beg your pardon, madam, but would ye honor me with your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d The housekeeper blinked, disconcerted. \u201cI\u2014Mrs. Mortimer Figg, if it\u2019s any of your business, and I doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Jamie assured her, not sitting down. The duke, he saw, had. \u201cMrs. Figg, as I said to ye downstairs, I\u2019ve come for my wife and nothing more. If ye\u2019ll tell me where she is, I\u2019ll leave ye to your business. Whatever that may be,\u201d he added, with a glance at Pardloe.</p><p>\u201cYour wife,\u201d Mrs. Figg repeated, and the barrel swiveled toward him. \u201cWell, now. I\u2019m thinking that perhaps you ought just to sit down and wait until his lordship comes and we see what he has to say about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna be daft, Jerusha,\u201d said Jenny, rather impatiently. \u201cYe ken Claire\u2019s my brother\u2019s wife; she told ye that herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire?\u201d exclaimed Pardloe, standing up again. He had been drinking from the decanter and still held it carelessly in one hand. \u201cMy brother\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no such thing,\u201d Jamie said crossly. \u201cShe\u2019s mine, and I\u2019ll thank someone to tell me where the devil she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone to a place called Kingsessing,\u201d Jenny said promptly. \u201cTo pick herbs and the like. We\u2019ve been doctoring this mac na galladh\u2014\u201d She scowled at Pardloe. \u201cHad I kent who ye were, a mh\u2019ic an diabhail, I\u2019d ha\u2019 put ground glass in your food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d Pardloe murmured, and took another gulp from the decanter. He turned his attention to Jamie. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that you know where my brother is at the moment?\u201d</p><p>Jamie stared at him, a sudden feeling of unease tickling the back of his neck. \u201cIs he not here?\u201d</p><p>Pardloe made a wide gesture round the room, wordlessly inviting Jamie to look. Jamie ignored him and turned to the housekeeper. \u201cWhen did ye see him last, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust before he and you skedaddled out the attic window,\u201d she replied shortly, and prodded him in the ribs with the barrel of the fowling piece. \u201cWhat have you done with him, fils de salope?\u201d</p><p>Jamie edged the barrel gingerly aside with one finger. The fowling piece was primed but not yet cocked.</p><p>\u201cI left him in the woods outside the city, two days ago,\u201d he said, a sudden feeling of disquiet tightening the muscles at the base of his spine. He backed against the wall, discreetly pressing his arse into it to ease his back. \u201cI expected to find him here\u2014with my wife. Might I inquire how you come to be here, Your Grace?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClaire kidnapped him,\u201d Jenny said, before Pardloe could speak. The duke\u2019s eyes bulged slightly, though whether at the remark or at the fact that Jenny was reloading her pistol, Jamie couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? What did she want him for, did she say?\u201d</p><p>His sister gave him a look.</p><p>\u201cShe was afraid he\u2019d turn the city upside down looking for his brother and you\u2019d be taken up in the kerfuffle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, I think I\u2019m safe enough now,\u201d he assured Jenny. \u201cOught ye to turn him loose, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said promptly, pounding home her ball and patch. She reached into her apron and came out with a tiny powder horn. \u201cWe canna do that; he might die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He considered this for a moment, watching the duke, whose face had assumed a slight purple tinge. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe canna breathe properly, and she was afraid if she let him loose before he was quite over it, he\u2019d die in the street, and her conscience wouldna let her do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The urge to laugh was back, but he controlled it manfully. \u201cSo ye were about to shoot him in the house, in order to keep him from dyin\u2019 in the street.\u201d</p> <p>Her dark-blue eyes narrowed, though she kept her gaze fixed on the powder she was pouring into the priming pan.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna really have shot him in the guts,\u201d she said, though from the press of her lips it was apparent that she\u2019d have liked nothing more. \u201cI\u2019d just have winged him in the leg. Or maybe shot off a couple o\u2019 toes.\u201d</p><p>Pardloe made a sound that might have been outrage, but, knowing the man as he did, Jamie recognized it as smothered laughter. He hoped his sister wouldn\u2019t. He opened his mouth to ask just how long Pardloe had been held captive, but before he could speak, there was a knock at the door below. He glanced at Mrs. Figg, but the housekeeper was still regarding him with narrowed eyes and made no move either to lower the fowling piece or to go downstairs and answer the door.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d Jamie shouted, sticking his head out into the hall, then jerking back into the room before Mrs. Figg should take it into her head that he was attempting to escape and discharge a load of buckshot into his backside.</p><p>The door opened, closed, and there was a pause as the caller apparently looked around the devastated entry, then light, quick steps came up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLord John!\u201d breathed Mrs. Figg, her stern face lightening.</p> <p>\u201cIn here!\u201d called the duke, as the steps reached the landing. An instant later, the slight, bespectacled form of Denzell Hunter appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cMerde!\u201d said Mrs. Figg, bringing her shotgun to bear on the newcomer. \u201cI mean, Shepherd of Judea! Who in the name of the Holy Trinity are you?\u201d</p><p>HUNTER WAS NEARLY as pale as Jenny, Jamie thought. Nonetheless, he didn\u2019t blink or pause but walked up to Pardloe and said, \u201cI am Denzell Hunter, Friend Grey. I am a physician, come at the request of Claire Fraser to attend thee.\u201d</p><p>The duke dropped the decanter, which fell over and disgorged the few drops it still contained onto the braided hearth rug.</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d he said, drawing himself abruptly to his full height. He was in fact no taller than Hunter, but it was obvious that he had the habit of command. \u201cYou are the skulking fellow who has had the temerity to seduce my daughter, and you dare come here and offer to physic me? Get out of my sight, before I\u2014\u201d At this point, it dawned on Pardloe that he was in his nightshirt and unarmed. Nothing daunted, he seized the decanter from the floor and swung it at Denzell\u2019s head.</p><p>Denzell ducked, and Jamie got hold of Pardloe\u2019s wrist before he could try again. Denny straightened up, fire glinting behind his spectacles.</p><p>\u201cI take issue both with thy description of my behavior and thy slur upon thy daughter\u2019s reputation,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cI can only conceive that the order of thy mind is deranged by illness or drugs, for surely the man who sired and reared such a person as Dorothea could not speak so meanly of her or have so little faith in her strength of character and her virtue as to think that anyone might seduce her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure His Grace didna mean physical seduction,\u201d Jamie said hastily, twisting Pardloe\u2019s wrist to make him let go of the decanter.</p> <p>\u201cIs it the act of a gentleman, sir, to induce a young woman to run away with him? Ow! Let go, damn you!\u201d he said, dropping the decanter as Jamie jerked his arm up behind his back. It fell to the hearth and burst in a shower of glass, but the duke disregarded this entirely.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman would have sought the approval of the young lady\u2019s father, sir, before ever venturing to speak to her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Denzell said more mildly. \u201cOr, rather, I did write to thee at once, apologizing for having been unable to speak with thee in person beforehand, and explaining that Dorothea and I wished to become betrothed and sought thy blessing upon our desire. I doubt thee received my letter before embarking for America, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thee did, did thee? Your desire?\u201d Pardloe snorted, tossing a hank of loosened hair out of his face. \u201cWill you let go of me, you bloody Scotchman! What do you think I\u2019m going to do, strangle him with his own neckcloth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe might,\u201d Jamie said, easing his grip but keeping hold of Pardloe\u2019s wrist. \u201cJenny, would ye put that pistol somewhere out of His Grace\u2019s reach?\u201d</p><p>Jenny promptly handed the freshly loaded pistol to Denzell, who took it by reflex, then regarded the thing in his hand in astonishment. \u201cYou need it more than I do,\u201d she said, and looked grimly at the duke. \u201cIf ye shoot him, we\u2019ll all swear it was self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will not,\u201d said Mrs. Figg indignantly. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m going to tell his lordship I let his brother be murdered in cold blood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend Jamie,\u201d Denny interrupted, holding out the pistol. \u201cI should feel much happier was thee to release Dorothea\u2019s father and take charge of this. I think that might increase the civility of our conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might,\u201d Jamie said dubiously, but let go of Pardloe and took the pistol.</p><p>Denny approached the duke, edging glass shards out of the way, and looked carefully into his face.</p><p>\u201cI will be pleased to speak and counsel with thee, Friend, and offer any reassurances that lie within my power regarding thy daughter. But thy breathing alarms me, and I would examine thee first.\u201d</p><p>The duke was in fact making a faint wheezing noise, and Jamie noted that the purple tinge to his face had become more pronounced. At Denzell\u2019s remark, this was augmented by a wash of dull red.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t touch me, you qu . . . quack-salver!\u201d</p><p>Denzell glanced round and seized upon Jenny as the most likely source of information.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Friend Claire say regarding him, in terms of ailment and treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsthma, and joint fir brewed in coffee. She calls it Ephedra.\u201d Jenny replied promptly, turning to add to Pardloe, \u201cYe ken, I didna have to tell him that. I might ha\u2019 let ye strangle, but I suppose that\u2019s no a Christian way to carry on. Are Quakers Christians, by the by?\u201d she asked Denny curiously.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, advancing cautiously on Pardloe, whom Jamie had forced to sit down by pressing on his shoulder. \u201cWe believe the light of Christ is present in all men\u2014though in some cases, perceiving it is somewhat difficult,\u201d he added, under his breath but loud enough for Jamie\u2014and the duke\u2014to hear.</p><p>Pardloe appeared to be trying to whistle, blowing with pursed lips, meanwhile glaring at Denzell. He gasped in air and managed a few more words.</p><p>\u201cI will . . . not be doctored . . . by you, sir.\u201d Another pause for blowing and gasping. Jamie noticed Mrs. Figg stir uneasily and take a step toward the door. \u201cI will not . . . leave my . . . daughter in your . . . clutches\u2014\u201d Blow. Gasp. \u201cIf you kill me.\u201d Blow. Gasp. \u201cNor risk . . . you sav . . . ing my life . . . and putting . . . me in . . . your . . . debt.\u201d The effort involved in getting that one out turned him a ghastly gray, and Jamie was seriously alarmed.</p><p>\u201cHas he medicine, Jenny?\u201d he asked urgently. His sister compressed her lips but nodded, and, with a final glare at the duke, scurried out of the room.</p><p>With the ginger air of one embracing a crocodile, Denzell Hunter crouched, took hold of the duke\u2019s wrist, and peered closely into his eyes, these organs repaying his inspection by narrowing in the most threatening fashion manageable by a man dying of suffocation. Not for the first time, Jamie suffered a reluctant admiration for Pardloe\u2019s strength of character\u2014though he was likewise obliged to admit that Hunter\u2019s nearly matched it.</p><p>His concentration on the tableau before him was broken by the sound of an excited fist hammering the front door below. The door opened, and he heard his nephew Ian exclaim, \u201cMam!\u201d in a hoarse voice, concurrent with his sister\u2019s astonished \u201cIan!\u201d Jamie stepped out of the room and, reaching the shattered banister in a few steps, saw his sister engulfed and all but obliterated by her tall son\u2019s embrace.</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes were closed and his cheeks wet, arms wrapped tight round his small mother, and Jamie felt a sudden lump in his own throat. What would he not give to embrace his daughter that way once more?</p><p>A slight motion drew his eye, and he saw Rachel Hunter standing shyly back, smiling at mother and son, her own eyes filled with tears. She dabbed at her nose with a handkerchief, then, happening to glance up, saw Jamie above and blinked.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rachel,\u201d he said, smiling down at her. He pointed at a jug standing on the occasional table by the door, which he assumed was Pardloe\u2019s medicine. \u201cMight ye bring that wee jug up here? Quickly?\u201d He could hear Pardloe\u2019s heavy breathing from the room behind him; it didn\u2019t seem to be getting worse but was still worrying.</p><p>The gasping was momentarily drowned out by the footsteps of Mrs. Figg, appearing behind him with her fowling piece. She peered over the banister at the touching scene below, then at Rachel Hunter, trotting up the stairs, jug in hand.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d she demanded of Jamie, not quite brandishing her weapon under his nose.</p><p>\u201cDr. Hunter\u2019s sister,\u201d he told her, interposing his body between Rachel, who looked taken aback, and the agitated housekeeper. \u201cYour brother wants the stuff in the jug, Miss Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg made a low rumbling noise but stepped back and allowed Rachel to pass. With a bleak look down at Jenny and Ian, who had now separated enough to speak and were waving their hands and interrupting each other in excited G\u00e0idhlig, she vanished back into the bedroom on Rachel\u2019s heels. Jamie hesitated, wanting to rush out the front door and head for Kingsessing, but a sense of morbid responsibility obliged him to follow her.</p><p>Denny had pulled up the stool from the dressing table and was still holding Pardloe\u2019s wrist, addressing him in calm tones.</p><p>\u201cThee is in no immediate danger, as thee likely knows. Thy pulse is strong and regular, and while thy breathing is clearly compromised, I think\u2014ah, is this the tincture the Scotswoman mentioned? I thank thee, Rachel; will thee pour\u2014\u201d But Rachel, long accustomed to medical situations, was already decanting into the brandy glass some blackish-brown stuff that looked like the contents of a spittoon.</p><p>\u201cShall I\u2014\u201d Denzell\u2019s attempt to hold the glass for the duke was preempted by Pardloe\u2019s seizing the glass for himself and taking a gulp that all but choked him on the spot. Hunter calmly observed the coughing and spluttering, then handed him a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cI have heard it theorized that such cataclysms of breath as thee is experiencing may be precipitated by violent exercise, a rapid change of temperature, exposure to smoke or dust, or, in some cases, by a surge of violent emotion. In the present instance, I believe I may possibly have caused thy crisis by my appearance, and if so, I ask thy pardon.\u201d Denny took the handkerchief and handed Pardloe back the glass, wise enough not to tell him to sip the stuff.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I may make some recompense for this injury, though,\u201d he said. \u201cI gather thy brother is not at home, since I can\u2019t suppose that he would remain absent from this gathering unless he were dead in the cellar, and I should hope that\u2019s not the case. Has thee seen him recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have\u2014not.\u201d Pardloe\u2019s breathing was in fact growing smoother and his face a more normal color, though the expression on it was still feral. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Hunter took off his spectacles and smiled, and Jamie was struck by the kindness of his eyes. He glanced at Rachel; her eyes were hazel, rather than her brother\u2019s soft olive brown, and, while good-natured, were much warier. Jamie thought wariness a good thing in a woman.</p><p>\u201cI have, Friend. Thy daughter and I discovered him in a militia camp some distance from the city. He had been taken prisoner, and\u2014\u201d Pardloe\u2019s exclamation collided with Jamie\u2019s, and Hunter patted the air with his hand, begging attention. \u201cWe were able to assist his escape, and, since he\u2019d been injured during his capture, I treated him; his injuries were not intrinsically serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Jamie asked. \u201cWhen did ye see him?\u201d His heart had given a small, disquietingly happy lurch at the news that John Grey was not dead.</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d Denny told him. \u201cWe heard of his escape this morning and heard nothing of his recapture as we made our way back to Philadelphia, though I asked each group of regulars or militia we encountered. He will have needed to go with care, both woods and roads being alive with men, but I imagine he\u2019ll be with you soon.\u201d</p><p>Pardloe drew a long, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, and closed his eyes.</p><p>WELCOME COOLNESS IN THE HEAT, COMFORT IN THE MIDST OF WOE</p><p>THERE WAS PLENTY OF cool greenery available; the gardens covered the best part of a hundred acres, with trees, bushes, shrubs, vines, and flowers of all descriptions\u2014and the odd exotic fungus thrown in here and there for variety. John Bartram had spent the greater part of a long life combing the Americas for botanical specimens, most of which he had hauled home and induced to grow. I regretted not having met the old gentleman; he had died a year before, leaving his famous garden in the capable hands of his children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I found Young Mr. Bartram\u2014he was about forty, but so called to distinguish him from his elder brother\u2014in the center of the gardens, sitting under the shade of an immense creeper that covered half the porch of his house, a sketchbook open on the table before him, making careful drawings of a handful of pale, leggy roots that lay on a napkin.</p><p>\u201cGinseng?\u201d I asked, bending to peer at them.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, not taking his eyes off the delicate line of his pen. \u201cGood morning, Lady John. You\u2019re familiar with the root, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fairly common in the mountains of North Carolina, where I . . . used to live.\u201d The casual sentence caught in my throat with a sudden unexpectedness. Out of nowhere, I smelled the woods on Fraser\u2019s Ridge, pungent with balsam fir and poplar sap, heavy with the musty scent of wood ears and the tang of wild muscats.</p> <p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d Reaching the end of his line, he set down his pen, removed his spectacles, and looked up at me with the bright face of a man who lives for plants and fully expects the world to share his obsession. \u201cThese are Chinese ginseng; I want to see whether I might be able to persuade it to grow here\u2014\u201d He waved a hand toward the encompassing acres of lush garden. \u201cThe Carolina variety languishes, and the Canadian ginseng stubbornly refuses even to try!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very perverse of it. Though I expect it\u2019s too hot,\u201d I observed, taking the stool he gestured me to and setting down my basket on the floor. My shift was sticking to me, and I could feel a large splotch of spreading wetness between my shoulder blades, where my hair dripped sweat down my back. \u201cThey like cold weather.\u201d</p><p>The vivid memory of the woods had blossomed into a visceral longing for the Ridge, so immediate that I felt the ghost of my vanished house rise around me, a cold mountain wind thrumming past its walls, and thought that, if I reached down, I could feel Adso\u2019s soft gray fur under my fingers. I swallowed, hard.</p><p>\u201cIt is hot,\u201d he said, though he himself looked as dry as one of the roots on the table, dappled with shade from his vine. \u201cMay I offer you some refreshment, Lady John? I have some iced negus in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d I said, meaning it. \u201cBut\u2014iced?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, we have quite a large icehouse by the river, Sissy and I,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cLet me just tell her . . .\u201d</p><p>I had had sufficient forethought as to bring a fan with me and now pulled this out of my basket. The sense of longing had turned suddenly into a new\u2014and wonderful\u2014realization. We could go home. Jamie had been released from service with the Continental army in order to see his cousin\u2019s body back to Scotland. He\u2019d meant, when we returned, to go back to North Carolina, reclaim his printing press, and take up arms on behalf of the revolution via the pen rather than the sword.</p><p>That plan had vanished, along with the rest of my life, when he\u2019d been reported drowned. But now . . . A thrill of excitement ran through me and must have shown on my face, for Mr. and Miss Bartram both blinked at me as they came out onto the porch. They were twins, and while their faces bore only a faint similarity of feature, they often shared the same expression and were doing so presently, both looking slightly bewildered but pleased.</p><p>I could barely keep myself from sharing my wonderful thought with them, but that wouldn\u2019t do, and I managed to sip the negus\u2014port mixed with hot water, sugar, and spices, then chilled to a cold\u2014truly cold!\u2014water-beaded delight\u2014and engage in civil admiration of the ongoing improvements to Bartram\u2019s Garden, these being already famous for their beauty and variety. Old Mr. Bartram had been planning and planting and extending them for fifty years, and his children had evidently inherited the family mania, as well as the gardens.</p><p>\u201c. . . and we\u2019ve improved the river path, and we\u2019ve just put up a much bigger potting shed,\u201d Sissy Bartram was saying eagerly. \u201cSo many customers wanting potted vines and flowers for their drawing rooms and conservatories! Though I don\u2019t know . . .\u201d Her eagerness faded a little, and she made a moue of doubt. \u201cWith all this kerfuffle\u2014war is so bad for business!\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bartram coughed a little. \u201cIt does depend on the sort of business,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid we shall have a much increased demand for the medicinals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut if the army is leaving . . .\u201d Miss Bartram began hopefully, but her brother shook his head, his face growing sober.</p><p>\u201cDoes thee not feel it in the air, Sissy?\u201d he said softly. \u201cSomething is coming.\u201d He lifted his face, as though scenting something on the heavy air, and she reached to put a hand on his arm, silent, listening with him for the sound of distant violence.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realized that you were Friends, Mr. Bartram,\u201d I said, to break the ominous quiet. Both of them blinked and smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Miss Bartram. \u201cFather was read out of meeting some years ago. But sometimes the habits of childhood come back when you least expect them.\u201d She lifted one plump shoulder, smiling, but with something regretful behind it. \u201cI see you have a list, Lady John?\u201d</p><p>That recalled me abruptly to my business, and the next hour was spent in busy exploration, discussion of the merits and drawbacks of various medicinals, the selection of dried herbs from the vast drying sheds, and cutting of fresh ones from the beds. With my sudden realization that we might return to the Ridge quite soon, and Mr. Bartram\u2019s very acute observation about the impending demand for medicinals, I bought much more than I had originally intended, replenishing not only my usual stocks (including a pound of dried Chinese joint fir, just in case. What was I going to do with the bloody man?), but also a good quantity of Jesuit bark, elecampane, and even lobelia, plus the asafoetida and ginseng I\u2019d promised Denny.</p><p>In the end, there was too much for my basket, and Miss Bartram said she would put it up into a package and have one of the assistant gardeners who lived in Philadelphia bring it into the city when he went home in the evening.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the river path, before you go?\u201d she asked me, with a quick glance skyward. \u201cIt\u2019s not finished yet, of course, but we have some amazing things put in, and it is wonderfully cool at this time of day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you. I really\u2014wait. You wouldn\u2019t have fresh arrowhead down there, would you?\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought to put that on my list, but if it was available . . .</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d she cried, beaming. \u201cMasses of it!\u201d We were standing in the largest of the drying sheds, and the late-afternoon light falling through the boards striped the walls with bars of swimming gold, illuminating the constant rain of tiny pollen grains from the drying flowers. There was a scatter of tools on the table, and she plucked a wooden trowel and a stubby knife from the litter without hesitation. \u201cWould you like to dig your own?\u201d</p><p>I laughed with pleasure. The opportunity to grub around in the wet mud wasn\u2019t an offer that most women would have made\u2014especially to another woman dressed in pale-blue muslin. But Miss Bartram spoke my language. I hadn\u2019t had my hands in the earth in months, and the mere suggestion made my fingers tingle.</p><p>THE RIVER PATH was lovely, edged with willow and silver birch that cast a flickering shade over banks of nasturtium and azalea and the floating masses of dark-green cress. I felt my blood pressure drop as we strolled, chatting of this and that.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I ask you something about the Friends?\u201d I asked. \u201cI have a colleague who was read out of meeting\u2014he and his sister\u2014because he volunteered as a surgeon with the Continental army. Since you mentioned your father . . . I wondered, how important a thing is that? Belonging to a meeting, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She laughed, rather to my surprise. \u201cI imagine it depends upon the individual\u2014everything does, really, as a Friend. My father, for instance: he was read out of meeting, for refusing to acknowledge the divinity of Jesus Christ, but he went right on going to meeting; it made no particular difference to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was rather reassuring. \u201cWhat if\u2014what is a Quaker marriage like? Would one have to belong to a meeting in order to get married?\u201d</p><p>She thought that interesting and made low humming noises for a bit.</p><p>\u201cWell, a marriage between Friends is . . . between the Friends marrying. No clergyman, I mean, and no specific prayer or service. The two Friends marry each other, rather than it being considered a sacrament administered by a priest or the like. But it does need to be done before witnesses\u2014other Friends, you know,\u201d she added, a small crease forming between her brows. \u201cAnd I think that there might be considerable objection if the Friends involved\u2014or one of them\u2014had been formally expelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting\u2014thank you.\u201d I wondered how this might affect Denzell and Dorothea; even more, how it might affect Rachel and Ian. \u201cCan a Friend marry a, er, non-Friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course. Though I think they would be put out of meeting as a result,\u201d she added dubiously. \u201cBut there might be special consideration for dire circumstances. The meeting would appoint a committee of clearness to look into the situation, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t got so far as worrying about dire circumstances, but thanked her, and the conversation went back to plants.</p><p>She\u2019d been right about the arrowhead: there were masses of it. She smiled happily at my amazement but then left me to my digging, assuring me that I might take some of the lotus and some Sweet Flag rhizomes, as well, if I liked. \u201cAnd fresh cress, of course!\u201d she added over her shoulder, waving a blithe hand at the water. \u201cAll you like!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thoughtfully brought along a burlap sack for me to kneel on; I spread it carefully, not to crush anything, and kirtled up my skirts out of the way as best I could. There was a faint breeze; there always is, over moving water, and I sighed in relief, both at the coolness and the sudden sense of solitude. The company of plants is always soothing, and after the incessant\u2014well, you couldn\u2019t call it sociability, exactly, but at least the incessant presence of people requiring to be conversed with, directed, hectored, scolded, conferred with, persuaded, lied to\u2014that I had experienced over the last few days, I found the rooted silence, rushing stream, and rustling leaves balm to the spirit.</p><p>Frankly, I thought, my spirit could use a bit of balm. Between\u2014or rather, among\u2014Jamie, John, Hal, William, Ian, Denny Hunter, and Benedict Arnold (to say nothing of Captain Richardson, General Clinton, Colenso, and the whole bloody Continental army), the male of the species had been rather wearing on my nerves of late.</p><p>I dug slowly and peaceably, lifting the dripping roots into my basket and packing each layer between mats of watercress. Sweat was running down my face and between my br**sts, but I didn\u2019t notice it; I was melting quietly into the landscape, breath and muscle turning to wind and earth and water.</p><p>Cicadas buzzed heavily in the trees nearby, and gnats and mosquitoes were beginning to collect in uneasy clouds overhead. These were luckily only a nuisance when they flew up my nose or hovered too close to my face; apparently my twentieth-century blood wasn\u2019t attractive to eighteenth-century insects, and I was almost never bitten\u2014a great blessing to a gardener. Lulled into mindlessness, I had quite lost track of time and place, and when a pair of large, battered shoes appeared in my field of view, I merely blinked at them for a moment, as I might at the sudden appearance of a frog.</p><p>Then I looked up.</p><p>\u201cOH,\u201d I SAID, a little blankly. Then, \u201cThere you are!\u201d I said, dropping my knife and scrambling to my feet in a surge of joyous relief. \u201cWhere the bloody hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>A smile flickered briefly across Jamie\u2019s face, and he took my hands, wet and muddy as they were. His were large and warm and solid.</p><p>\u201cIn a wagon full of cabbages, most recently,\u201d he said, and the smile took hold as he looked me over. \u201cYe look well, Sassenach. Verra bonny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d I said frankly. He was grubby, very thin, and he plainly hadn\u2019t been sleeping well; he had shaved, but his face was gaunt and shadowed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to reply but then seemed to think better of it. He let go my hands, cleared his throat with a low Scottish noise, and fixed his eyes on mine. The smile had gone.</p><p>\u201cYe went to bed with John Grey, aye?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, startled, then frowned at him. \u201cWell, no, I wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose.</p><p>\u201cHe told me ye did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what he said?\u201d I asked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Now it was his turn to frown. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d had carnal knowledge of ye. Why would he lie about such a thing as that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s right. Carnal knowledge is a very reasonable description of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Going to bed,\u2019 though . . . For one thing, we didn\u2019t. It started on a dressing table and ended\u2014so far as I recall\u2014on the floor.\u201d Jamie\u2019s eyes widened noticeably, and I hastened to correct the impression he was obviously forming. \u201cFor another, that phraseology implies that we decided to make love to each other and toddled off hand in hand to do so, and that wasn\u2019t what happened at all. Umm . . . perhaps we should sit down?\u201d I gestured toward a rustic bench, standing knee-deep in creamy drifts of ranunculus.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t had a single thought of that night since learning Jamie was alive, but it was beginning to dawn on me that it might quite possibly seem important to Jamie\u2014and that explaining what had happened might be somewhat tricky.</p><p>He nodded, rather stiffly, and turned toward the bench. I followed, noting with some concern the set of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHave you hurt your back?\u201d I asked, frowning as I saw the care with which he sat down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did happen?\u201d he asked, ignoring the question. Politely, but with a distinct edge.</p><p>I took a deep breath, then blew out my cheeks in a helpless gesture.</p><p>He growled. I glanced at him, startled, having never heard such a noise from him before\u2014at least, not aimed at me. Apparently it was somewhat more than important.</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d I said cautiously, sitting down beside him. \u201cWhat did John say, exactly? After telling you about the carnal knowledge, I mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe desired me to kill him. And if ye tell me ye want me to kill you rather than tell me what happened, I warn ye, I willna be responsible for what happens next.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him narrowly. He seemed self-possessed, but there was an undeniable tension in his posture.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I remember how it began, at least. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart there,\u201d he suggested, the edge more pronounced.</p><p>\u201cI was sitting in my room, drinking plum brandy and trying to justify killing myself, if you must know,\u201d I said, with an edge of my own. I stared at him, daring him to say something, but he merely cocked his head at me in a \u201cGo on, then\u201d gesture.</p> <p>\u201cI ran out of brandy and was trying to decide whether I might walk downstairs to look for more without breaking my neck, or whether I\u2019d had enough not to feel guilty about drinking the whole bottle of laudanum instead. And then John came in.\u201d I swallowed, my mouth suddenly dry and sticky, as it had been that night.</p><p>\u201cHe did say there was drink taken,\u201d Jamie observed.</p><p>\u201cLots. He seemed nearly as drunk as I was, save that he was still on his feet.\u201d I could see John\u2019s face in memory, white as bone save for his eyes, which were so red and swollen that they might have been sandpapered. And the expression in those eyes. \u201cHe looked the way a man looks just before he throws himself off a cliff,\u201d I said quietly, eyes on my folded hands. I took another breath.</p><p>\u201cHe had a fresh decanter in his hand. He put it down on the dressing table beside me, glared at me, and said, \u2018I will not mourn him alone tonight.\u2019\u201d A deep quiver ran through me at the memory of those words.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, a little sharply. \u201cI told him to sit down and he did, and he poured out more brandy and we drank it, and I have not one single notion what we said, but we were talking about you. And then he stood up, and I stood up. And . . . I couldn\u2019t bear to be alone and I couldn\u2019t bear for him to be alone and I more or less flung myself at him because I very much needed someone to touch me just then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he obliged ye, I take it.\u201d</p><p>The tone of this was distinctly cynical, and I felt a flush rise in my cheeks, not of embarrassment but of anger.</p><p>\u201cDid he bugger you?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him for a good long minute. He meant it.</p><p>\u201cYou absolute bastard,\u201d I said, as much in astonishment as anger. Then a thought occurred to me. \u201cYou said he desired you to kill him,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cYou . . . didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d</p><p>He held my eyes, his own steady as a rifle barrel.</p><p>\u201cWould ye mind if I did?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody well would,\u201d I said, with what spirit I could summon up amongst the growing confusion of my feelings. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t\u2014I know you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, even more softly. \u201cYe don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Despite my conviction that he was bluffing, a small chill prickled the hairs on my forearms.</p><p>\u201cI should have been within my rights,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou would not,\u201d I said, chill fading into crossness. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any rights. You were bloody dead.\u201d Despite the crossness, my voice broke a bit on the word \u201cdead,\u201d and his face changed at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, turning my own face away. \u201cDid you think it didn\u2019t matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and took my mud-stained hand in his. \u201cBut I didna ken it mattered quite that much.\u201d His own voice was husky now, and when I turned back to him, I saw that tears stood in his eyes. With an incoherent noise, I flung myself into his arms and clung to him, making foolish hiccuping sobs.</p><p>He held me tight, his breath warm on the top of my head, and when I stopped at last, he put me away a little and cupped my face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cI have loved ye since I saw you, Sassenach,\u201d he said very quietly, holding my eyes with his own, bloodshot and lined with tiredness but very blue. \u201cI will love ye forever. It doesna matter if ye sleep with the whole English army\u2014well, no,\u201d he corrected himself, \u201cit would matter, but it wouldna stop me loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would.\u201d I sniffed and he pulled a handkerchief from his sleeve and handed it to me. It was worn white cambric and had the initial \u201cP\u201d embroidered awkwardly in one corner in blue thread. I couldn\u2019t imagine where he\u2019d got such a thing but didn\u2019t bother asking, under the circumstances.</p><p>The bench was not very large, and his knee was within an inch or two of mine. He didn\u2019t touch me again, though, and my heart rate was beginning to speed up noticeably. He meant it, about loving me, but that didn\u2019t mean the next while was going to be pleasant.</p><p>\u201cIt was my impression that he told me because he was sure that you would tell me,\u201d he said carefully.</p><p>\u201cSo I would have,\u201d I said promptly, wiping my nose. \u201cThough I might possibly have waited \u2019til you\u2019d got home, had a bath, and been fed supper. If there\u2019s one thing I know about men, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t break things like this to them on an empty stomach. When did you last eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning. Sausages. Dinna be changing the subject.\u201d His voice was level, but there was a good deal of feeling bubbling under it; he might as well have been a pan of simmering milk. One extra degree of heat and there\u2019d be an eruption and scorched milk all over the stove. \u201cI understand, but I want\u2014I need\u2014to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou understand?\u201d I echoed, sounding surprised even to my own ears. I hoped he did understand, but his manner was more than a little at odds with his words. My hands were no longer cold; they were starting to sweat, and I gripped the skirt over my knees, heedless of mud stains.</p><p>\u201cWell, I dinna like it,\u201d he said, not quite between clenched teeth. \u201cBut I understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, eyeing me. \u201cYe both thought I was dead. And I ken what ye\u2019re like when you\u2019re drunk, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I slapped him, so fast and so hard that he hadn\u2019t time to duck and lurched back from the impact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014\u201d I said, unable to articulate anything bad enough to suit the violence of my feelings. \u201cHow bloody dare you!\u201d</p><p>He touched his cheek gingerly. His mouth was twitching.</p><p>\u201cI . . . uh . . . didna quite mean that the way it sounded, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, am I no the aggrieved party here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you bloody aren\u2019t!\u201d I snapped. \u201cYou go off and get\u2014get drowned, and leave me all alone in the m-midst of spies and s-soldiers and with children\u2014you and Fergus both, you bastards! Leave me and Marsali to-to\u2014\u201d I was so choked with emotion that I couldn\u2019t go on. I was damned if I\u2019d cry, though, damned if I\u2019d cry any more in front of him.</p><p>He reached out carefully and took my hand again. I let him, and let him draw me closer, close enough to see the faint dusting of his beard stubble, to smell the road dust and dried sweat in his clothes, to feel the radiant heat from his body.</p><p>I sat quivering, making small huffing sounds in lieu of speech. He ignored this, spreading my fingers out between his own, gently stroking the palm of my hand with a large, callused thumb.</p><p>\u201cI didna mean to imply that I think ye a drunkard, Sassenach,\u201d he said, making an obvious effort to be conciliatory. \u201cIt\u2019s only that ye think wi\u2019 your body, Claire; ye always have.\u201d</p><p>With a tremendous effort of my own, I found words.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a\u2014a\u2014what are you calling me now? A loose woman? A trollop? A strumpet? And you think that\u2019s better than calling me a drunkard?!?\u201d</p><p>He gave a small snort of what might have been amusement. I yanked at my hand, but he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cI said what I meant, Sassenach,\u201d he said, tightening his grip on my hand, and augmenting it with another hand on my forearm, preventing me from rising. \u201cYe think wi\u2019 your body. It\u2019s what makes ye a surgeon, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014oh.\u201d Overcoming my dudgeon momentarily, I was obliged to admit that there was something in this observation.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d I said stiffly, looking away from him. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely, no.\u201d There was a very slight edge to his voice again, but I wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cListen to me.\u201d</p><p>I sat stubbornly silent for a moment, but he simply held on, and I knew that he was more stubborn by nature than I could be if I worked at it for a hundred years. I was going to hear what he had to say\u2014and I was going to tell him what he wanted to hear\u2014whether I liked it or not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said. He drew breath and relaxed a little but didn\u2019t lessen his grip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken ye to bed a thousand times at least, Sassenach,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cDid ye think I wasna paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo or three thousand at least,\u201d I said, in the interests of strict accuracy, staring at the digging knife I\u2019d dropped on the ground. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I ken what ye\u2019re like in bed. And I see\u2014all too well,\u201d he added, his mouth compressing momentarily, \u201c\u2014how this likely was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you bloody don\u2019t,\u201d I said warmly.</p><p>He made another Scottish noise, this one indicating hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, but carefully. \u201cWhen I lost ye, after Culloden\u2014I kent ye weren\u2019t dead, but that made it all the worse, if ye ask me . . . eh?\u201d</p><p>I had made a noise of my own but gestured briefly at him to go on.</p><p>\u201cI told ye about Mary MacNab, aye? How she came to me, in the cave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral years after the fact,\u201d I said rather coldly. \u201cBut, yes, you did get round to it eventually.\u201d I gave him a look. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t blame you for that\u2014and I didn\u2019t ask you for the gory details, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ye didn\u2019t,\u201d he admitted. He rubbed the bridge of his nose with a knuckle. \u201cMaybe ye weren\u2019t jealous. I am.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d tell ye, though\u2014how it was\u2014if ye wanted to know.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, biting my lip dubiously. Did I want to know? If I didn\u2019t\u2014and I wasn\u2019t at all sure whether I did or not\u2014would he take that as evidence that I didn\u2019t care? And I was quite conscious of that brief \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, accepting the implied bargain.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said. \u201cHow it was.\u201d</p><p>Now he did look away, and I saw his throat move as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIt . . . was tender,\u201d he said quietly, after a moment. \u201cSad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSad,\u201d I echoed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look up but kept his eyes fixed on the flowers, following the movements of a big black bumblebee among the furled blooms.</p><p>\u201cBoth of us mourning things that were lost,\u201d he said slowly, brows drawn down in thought. \u201cShe said she meant to keep ye alive for me, to let me . . . to let me imagine it was you, I suppose she meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t work quite that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked up then, straight on, and his eyes went through me like a rapier through a scarecrow. \u201cThere couldna be anyone like you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t said with an air of compliment, more one of flat finality\u2014or, even, of resentment.</p><p>I lifted a shoulder briefly. There wasn\u2019t much response I could make.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked back at his knotted hands. He was squeezing the fingers of his narrowed right hand with his left, as though to remind himself of the missing finger.</p><p>\u201cIt was quiet,\u201d he said to his thumb. \u201cWe didna talk, really, not once we\u2019d . . . begun.\u201d He closed his eyes, and I wondered, with a small twinge of curiosity, just what he saw. I was surprised to realize that curiosity was all I felt\u2014with, perhaps, pity for them. I\u2019d seen the cave in which they\u2019d made love, a cold granite tomb, and I knew how desperate the state of things had been in the Highlands then. Just the promise of a little human warmth . . . \u201cBoth of us mourning things that were lost,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cIt was just the once. It didna last very long; I\u2014it had been a long time,\u201d he said, and a faint flush showed across his cheekbones. \u201cBut . . . I needed it, verra much. She held me after, and . . . I needed that more. I fell asleep in her arms; she was gone when I woke. But I carried the warmth of her with me. For a long time,\u201d he said very softly.</p><p>That gave me a quite unexpected stab of jealousy, and I straightened a little, fighting it back with clenched hands. He sensed it and turned his head toward me. He\u2019d felt that flame ignite\u2014and had one to match it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d he said, giving me a hard, direct look.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t tender,\u201d I said with an edge. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t sad. It should have been. When he came into my room and said he wouldn\u2019t mourn you alone, and we talked, then I got up and went to him, expecting\u2014if I had so much as an expectation; I don\u2019t think I had any conscious thoughts. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He matched my edge with his own. \u201cBlind drunk, were ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody was, and so was he.\u201d I knew what he was thinking; he wasn\u2019t making any effort to hide it, and I had a sudden, vivid recollection of sitting with him in the corner of a tavern in Cross Creek, his taking my face suddenly between his hands and kissing me, and the warm sweetness of wine passing from his mouth to mine. I sprang to my feet and slapped my hand on the bench. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I bloody was!\u201d I said again, furious. \u201cI was drunk every damned day since I heard you were dead.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep, deep breath, and I saw his eyes fix on his hands, clenched on his knees. He let it out very slowly.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he give ye, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to hit,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least to begin with.\u201d</p> <p>He looked up at me, startled.</p><p>\u201cYe hit him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I hit you,\u201d I snapped. My fist had curled, without my realization, clenched against my thigh. I remembered that first blow, a blind, frenzied punch into unwary flesh, all the force of my grief behind it. The flex of recoil that took away the sensation of warmth for an instant, brought it back with a smash that flung me onto the dressing table, borne down by a man\u2019s weight, his grip tight on my wrists, and me screaming in fury. I didn\u2019t remember the specifics of what came next\u2014or, rather, I recalled certain things very vividly but had no idea of the order in which they happened.</p><p>\u201cIt was a blur,\u201d people say. What they really mean is the impossibility of anyone truly entering such an experience from outside, the futility of explanation.</p><p>\u201cMary MacNab,\u201d I said abruptly. \u201cShe gave you . . . tenderness, you said. There should be a word for what this was, what John gave me, but I haven\u2019t thought of it yet.\u201d I needed a word that might convey, encapsulate.</p> <p>\u201cViolence,\u201d I said. \u201cThat was part of it.\u201d Jamie stiffened and gave me a narrow look. I knew what he was thinking and shook my head. \u201cNot that. I was numb\u2014deliberately numb, because I couldn\u2019t bear to feel. He could; he had more courage than I did. And he made me feel it, too. That\u2019s why I hit him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been numb, and John had ripped off the dressing of denial, the wrappings of the small daily necessities that kept me upright and functioning; his physical presence had torn away the bandages of grief and showed what lay below: myself, bloody and unhealed.</p><p>I felt the air thick in my throat, damp and hot and itching on my skin. And finally I found the word.</p><p>\u201cTriage,\u201d I said abruptly. \u201cUnder the numbness, I was . . . raw. Bloody. Skinned. You do triage, you . . . stop the bleeding first. You stop it. You stop it, or the patient dies. He stopped it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stopped it by slapping his own grief, his own fury, over the welling blood of mine. Two wounds, pressed together, blood still flowing freely\u2014but no longer lost and draining, flowing instead into another body, and the other\u2019s blood into mine, hot, searing, not welcome\u2014but life.</p><p>Jamie said something under his breath in Gaelic. I didn\u2019t catch most of the words. He sat with his head bent, elbows on his knees and head in his hands, and breathed audibly.</p> <p>After a moment, I sat back down beside him and breathed, too. The cicadas grew louder, an urgent buzz that drowned out the rush of water and the rustling of leaves, humming in my bones.</p><p>\u201cDamn him,\u201d Jamie muttered at last, and sat up. He looked disturbed, angry\u2014but not angry at me.</p><p>\u201cJohn, um, is all right, isn\u2019t he?\u201d I asked hesitantly. To my surprise\u2014and my slight unease\u2014Jamie\u2019s lips twisted a little.</p><p>\u201cAye. Well. I\u2019m sure he is,\u201d he said, in a tone admitting of a certain doubt, which I found alarming.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell did you do to him?\u201d I said, sitting up straight.</p><p>His lips compressed for an instant.</p><p>\u201cI hit him,\u201d he said. \u201cTwice,\u201d he added, glancing away.</p><p>\u201cTwice?\u201d I echoed, in some shock. \u201cDid he fight you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d I rocked back a bit, looking him over. Now that I had calmed down enough to take notice, I thought he was displaying . . . what? Concern? Guilt?</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hit him?\u201d I asked, striving for a tone of mild curiosity, rather than one of accusation. Evidently I was less than successful with this, as he turned on me like a bear stung in the rump by a bee.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Ye dare to ask me why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly I do,\u201d I said, discarding the mild tone. \u201cWhat did he do to make you hit him? And twice?\u201d Jamie had no problem with mayhem, but he normally did require a reason.</p><p>He made a deeply disgruntled Scottish noise, but he\u2019d promised me honesty a long time ago and hadn\u2019t seen fit to break that promise yet. He squared his shoulders and looked at me straight.</p><p>\u201cThe first was between him and me; it was a blow I\u2019ve owed him for a good while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just seized the opportunity to punch him, because it was convenient?\u201d I asked, a bit wary of asking directly what the devil he meant by \u201cbetween him and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldna help it,\u201d he said testily. \u201cHe said something and I hit him.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything but inhaled through my nose, meaning him to hear it. There was a long moment of silence, weighted with expectation and broken only by the shush of the river.</p><p>\u201cHe said the two of ye hadna been making love to each other,\u201d he finally muttered, looking down.</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t,\u201d I said, somewhat surprised. \u201cI told you. We were both\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>He did look up at me then, glaring.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, the word dripping with sarcasm. \u201cYe were both f**king me, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d I murmured. \u201cWell. Um. Yes, that\u2019s quite true.\u201d I rubbed the bridge of my nose. \u201cI see,\u201d I said again, and thought I probably did. There was a deep friendship of long standing between Jamie and John, but I was aware that one of the pillars it rested on was a strict avoidance of any reference to John\u2019s sexual attraction toward Jamie. If John had lost his composure sufficiently as to kick that pillar out from under the two of them . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd the second time?\u201d I asked, choosing not to ask him to elaborate any further on the first.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, that one was on your account,\u201d he said, both voice and face relaxing a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d I said, as dryly as possible. \u201cBut you really shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I ken that now,\u201d he admitted, flushing. \u201cBut I\u2019d lost my temper already and hadna got it back again. Ifrinn,\u201d he muttered, and, stooping, picked up the discarded digging knife and jammed it hard into the bench beside him.</p><p>He closed his eyes then, pressed his lips tight, and sat tapping the fingers of his right hand against his leg. He hadn\u2019t done that since I\u2019d amputated the remains of his frozen fourth finger, and I was taken aback to see him do it now. For the first time, I began to appreciate the true complexities of the situation.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I said, in a voice not much louder than the cicadas. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout John Grey. About Helwater.\u201d He drew a deep, exasperated breath and opened his eyes, though he didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI managed there. Staying numb, as ye said. I suppose I might have stayed drunk, too, had I been able to afford it.\u201d His mouth twisted, and he folded his right hand into a fist, then looked down at it in surprise; he hadn\u2019t been able to do that for thirty years. He opened it and put his hand flat on his knee.</p><p>\u201cI managed,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut then there was Geneva\u2014and I told ye how that was, too, did I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAnd then there was William. When Geneva died and it was my fault, it was a knife in my heart\u2014and then William . . .\u201d His mouth softened. \u201cThe bairn cut me wide open, Sassenach. He spilled my guts out into my hands.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on his, and he turned it, his fingers curling over mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd that bloody English sodomite bandaged me,\u201d he said, so low I could scarcely hear him above the sound of the river. \u201cWith his friendship.\u201d</p><p>He drew breath again and let it out explosively. \u201cNo, I didna kill him. I dinna ken if I\u2019m glad of it or not\u2014but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I let out my own breath in a deep sigh and leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cI knew that. I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>The haze had thickened into steel-gray clouds, coming purposefully up the river, muttering with thunder. I took a deep, lung-filling whiff of ozone and then another, of his skin. I detected the basic male animal, very appetizing in itself, but he seemed to have acquired a rather unusual\u2014though savory\u2014bouquet in addition: a faint whiff of sausage, the strong bitter scent of cabbage, and . . . yes, mustard, underlaid with something oddly spicy. I sniffed again, repressing the urge to lick him.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smell like a large plate of choucroute garnie,\u201d he interrupted, with a slight grimace. \u201cGive me a moment; I\u2019ll have a wash.\u201d He made as though to get up and go toward the river, and I reached out and seized him by the arm.</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, then drew a deep breath and, reaching slowly out in turn, pulled me against him. I didn\u2019t resist. In fact, my own arms went round him in reflex, and we both sighed in unison, in the sheer relief of embrace.</p><p>I would have been quite content to sit there forever, breathing the musky, dusty, cabbage-laced smell of him and listening to the thump of his heart under my ear. All the things we\u2019d said\u2014all the things that had happened\u2014hovered in the air around us like the cloud of troubles from Pandora\u2019s box,\u2014but for this one moment, there was nothing but each other.</p><p>After a bit, his hand moved, smoothing the loose, damp curls behind my ear. He cleared his throat and shifted a little, drawing himself up, and I reluctantly let go of him, though I left my hand on his thigh.</p><p>\u201cI wish to say something,\u201d he said, in the tone of one making a formal statement before a court. My heart had quieted while he held me; now it fluttered in renewed agitation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sounded so apprehensive that he laughed. Only a breath, but he did laugh, and I was able to breathe again. He took my hand firmly and held it, looking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t say that I dinna mind this, because I do. And I don\u2019t say that I\u2019ll no make a fuss about it later, because I likely will. But what I do say is that there is nothing in this world or the next that can take ye from me\u2014or me from you.\u201d He raised one brow. \u201cD\u2019ye disagree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said fervently.</p><p>He breathed again, and his shoulders came down a fraction of an inch.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, because it wouldna do ye any good if ye did. Just the one question,\u201d he said. \u201cAre ye my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am,\u201d I said, in utter astonishment. \u201cHow could I not be?\u201d</p><p>His face changed then; he drew a huge breath and took me into his arms. I embraced him, hard, and together we let out a great sigh, settling with it, his head bending over mine, kissing my hair, my face turned into his shoulder, openmouthed at the neck of his open shirt, our knees slowly giving way in mutual relief, so that we knelt in the fresh-turned earth, clinging together, rooted like a tree, leaf-tossed and multi-limbed but sharing one single solid trunk.</p><p>The first drops of rain began to fall.</p><p>HIS FACE WAS open now and his eyes clear blue and free of trouble\u2014for the moment, at least. \u201cWhere is there a bed? I need to be naked with ye.\u201d</p><p>I was entirely in sympathy with this proposition, but the question took me momentarily aback. Of course we couldn\u2019t go to John\u2019s house\u2014or at least not in order to go to bed together. Even if John himself was in no position to object, the thought of what Mrs. Figg would say if I walked into the house with a large Scotsman and immediately ascended the stairs to my bedroom with him . . . and then there was Jenny . . . On the other hand, eager as I was, I really didn\u2019t want to be naked with him among the ranunculus, where we might be interrupted at any moment by Bartrams, bumblebees, or rain.</p><p>\u201cAn inn?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cIs there one where folk wouldna ken ye? A decent one, I mean?\u201d</p><p>I knit my brows, trying to think of one. Not the King\u2019s Arms, definitely not that. Otherwise . . . I was familiar only with the two or three ordinaries where Marsali bought ale or bread\u2014and people most assuredly knew me there\u2014as Lady John Grey.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that Jamie by himself needed to avoid notice anymore\u2014but his supposed death and my marriage to John had been the subject of a tremendous amount of public interest, by reason of its tragedy. For it to become widely known that the presumably deceased Colonel Fraser had suddenly reappeared from the dead to reclaim his wife would be a subject of conversation that would dwarf the withdrawal of the British army from the city. I had a quick flash of memory\u2014our wedding night, witnessed at close quarters by a crowd of raucously drunk Highland clansmen\u2014and imagined a reprise of this experience, with interested commentary by the ordinary\u2019s patrons.</p><p>I glanced at the river, wondering whether, after all, a nice, sheltering bush\u2014but it was late in the afternoon, cloudy, and the gnats and mosquitoes were hanging in small carnivorous clouds of their own beneath the trees. Jamie stooped suddenly and swept me up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a place.\u201d</p><p>THERE WAS A wooden thump as he kicked open the door of the new potting shed, and suddenly we were in a light-streaked darkness smelling of sun-warmed boards, earth, water, damp clay, and plants.</p><p>\u201cWhat, here?\u201d</p><p>It was abundantly clear that he wasn\u2019t seeking privacy for the purpose of further inquiry, discussion, or reproach. For that matter, my own question was largely rhetorical.</p><p>He stood me on my feet, turned me about, and began undoing my laces. I could feel his breath on the bare skin of my neck, and the tiny hairs there shivered.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d I began, only to be interrupted by a terse \u201cHush.\u201d I hushed. I could hear then what he\u2019d heard: the Bartrams, in conversation with each other. They were some distance away, though\u2014on the back porch of the house, I thought, screened from the river path by a thick hedge of English yew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they can hear us,\u201d I said, though I lowered my voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done wi\u2019 talking,\u201d he whispered, and, leaning forward, closed his teeth gently on the nape of my exposed neck.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said again, though mildly. I hadn\u2019t actually said anything, and the sound I\u2019d made was too high-pitched to draw the attention of anything save a passing bat. I exhaled strongly through my nose and heard him chuckle deep in his throat.</p><p>My stays came loose, and cool air flooded through the damp muslin of my shift. He paused, one hand on the tapes of my petticoats, to reach round with the other and gently lift one breast, heavy and free, thumb rubbing the nipple, hard and round as a cherry stone. I made another sound, this one lower-pitched.</p> <p>I thought vaguely how fortunate it was that he was left-handed, as that was the hand nimbly engaged in undoing the tapes of my skirts. These fell in a swishing heap round my feet, and I had a sudden vision\u2014as his hand left my breast and the shift whiffed up round my ears\u2014of Young Mr. Bartram suddenly realizing a dire need to pot up a batch of rosemary seedlings. The shock probably wouldn\u2019t kill him, but . . .</p><p>\u201cMay as well be hung for sheep as lambs,\u201d Jamie said, having evidently divined my thought from the fact that I\u2019d turned round and was shielding my more private bits in the manner of Botticelli\u2019s Venus. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have ye naked.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me, whipped off his own dirt-streaked shirt\u2014he\u2019d thrown off his coat when he set me down\u2014and yanked down his breeks without pausing to undo the flies. He was thin enough to make this possible; the breeches hung on his hipbones, barely staying up by themselves, and I saw the shadow of his ribs beneath his skin as he bent to shed his stockings.</p><p>He straightened and I put a hand on his chest. It was damp and warm, and the ruddy hairs prickled into gooseflesh at my touch. I could smell the hot, eager scent of him, even over the agricultural fug of the shed and the lingering smell of cabbage.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>He made a Scottish sound of interrogation, reaching for me, and I dug my fingers into the muscle of his breast.</p><p>\u201cI want a kiss first.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth against my ear and both hands firmly on my bottom.</p><p>\u201cAre ye in a position to make demands, d\u2019ye think?\u201d he whispered, tightening his grasp. I caught the faint barb in that.</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody am,\u201d I said, and adjusted my own grip somewhat lower. He wouldn\u2019t be attracting any bats, I thought.</p><p>We were eyeball-to-eyeball, clasped and breathing each other\u2019s breath, close enough to see the smallest nuance of expression, even in the dimness. I saw the seriousness that underlay the laughter\u2014and the doubt beneath the bravado.</p> <p>\u201cI am your wife,\u201d I whispered, my lips brushing his.</p><p>\u201cI ken that,\u201d he said, very softly, and kissed me. Softly. Then closed his eyes and brushed his lips across my face, not so much kissing as feeling the contours of cheekbone and brow, of jaw and the tender skin below the ear, seeking to know me again past skin and breath, to know me to the blood and bone, to the heart that beat beneath.</p><p>I made a small sound and tried to find his mouth with my own, pressing against him, bare bodies cool and damp, hair rasping sweetly, and the lovely firmness of him rolling between us. He wouldn\u2019t let me kiss him, though. His hand gripped the tail of my hair at the base of my neck, cupping my head, the other hand pursuing the same game of blind man\u2019s buff.</p><p>There was a rattling thump; I had backed into a potting bench, setting a tray of tiny seedling pots to vibrating, the spicy leaves of sweet basil trembling in agitation. Jamie pushed the tray aside with one hand, then grasped me by the elbows and lifted me onto the bench.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, half breathless. \u201cI must have ye now.\u201d</p><p>He did, and I ceased caring whether there were splinters in the bench or not.</p><p>I wrapped my legs round him and he laid me flat and leaned over me, hands braced on the bench, with a sound halfway between bliss and pain. He moved slowly in me and I gasped.</p><p>The rain had grown from a patter to a ringing din on the tin roof of the shed, covering any sounds I might make, and a good thing, too, I thought dimly. The air had cooled but was full of moisture; our skins were slick, and heat sprang up where flesh touched flesh. He was slow, deliberate, and I arched my back, urging him. In response, he took me by the shoulders, bent lower, and kissed me lightly, barely moving.</p> <p>\u201cI willna do it,\u201d he whispered, and held tight when I struggled against him, trying vainly to goad him into the violent response I wished\u2014I needed.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t do what?\u201d I was gasping.</p><p>\u201cI willna punish ye for it,\u201d he said, so softly I could barely hear him, close as he was. \u201cI\u2019ll not do that, d\u2019ye hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t frigging want you to punish me, you bastard.\u201d I grunted with effort, my shoulder joints creaking as I tried to break free of his grasp. \u201cI want you to . . . God, you know what I want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do.\u201d His hand left my shoulder and cupped beneath my buttock, touching the flesh of our joining, stretched and slippery. I made a small sound of surrender, and my knees loosened.</p><p>He pulled back, then came back into me, strongly enough that I gave a small, high-pitched cry of relief.</p><p>\u201cAsk me to your bed,\u201d he said, breathless, hands on my arms. \u201cI shall come to ye. For that matter\u2014I shall come, whether ye ask it or no. But remember, Sassenach\u2014I am your man; I serve ye as I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease do. Jamie, I want you so!\u201d</p><p>He seized my arse in both hands, hard enough to leave bruises, and I arched up into him, grasping, hands sliding on his sweat-slick skin.</p><p>\u201cGod, Claire, I need ye!\u201d</p><p>Rain was roaring on the tin roof now, and lightning struck close by, blue-white and sharp with ozone. We rode it together, forked and light-blind, breathless, and the thunder rolled through our bones.</p><p>GIVE ME LIBERTY . . .</p><p>AND AS THE SUN set on the third day since he had left his home, Lord John William Bertram Amstrong Grey found himself once more a free man, with a full belly, a swimming head, a badly mended musket, and severely chafed wrists, standing before the Reverend Peleg Woodsworth, right hand uplifted, reciting as prompted:</p><p>\u201cI, Bertram Armstrong, swear to be true to the United States of America, and to serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies and opposers whatsoever, and to observe and obey the orders of the Continental Congress and the orders of the generals and officers set over me by them.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell, he thought. What next?</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch . . .</p><p>A STEP INTO THE DARK</p><p>October 30, 1980</p><p>Craigh na Dun</p><p>A BLOTCH OF SWEAT darkened the shirt between William Buccleigh\u2019s shoulder blades; the day was cool, but it was a steep climb to the top of Craigh na Dun\u2014and the thought of what awaited them at the top was enough to make anybody sweat.</p><p>\u201cYe haven\u2019t got to come,\u201d Roger said to Buccleigh\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cGet stuffed,\u201d his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather replied briefly. Buck spoke absentmindedly, though, all his attention, like Roger\u2019s, focused on the distant crest of the hill.</p><p>Roger could hear the stones from here. A low, sullen buzz, like a hive of hostile bees. He felt the sound move, crawling under his skin, and scratched viciously at his elbow, as though he could root it out.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve got the stones, aye?\u201d Buck stopped, clinging one-handed to a birch sapling as he looked back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Roger said shortly. \u201cD\u2019ye want yours now?\u201d</p><p>Buck shook his head and wiped shaggy fair hair off his brow with the back of his free hand.</p><p>\u201cTime enough,\u201d he said, and began to climb again.</p><p>Roger knew the diamonds were there\u2014he knew Buck knew, too\u2014but put a hand into his jacket pocket anyway. Two rough pieces of metal clinked together, the halves of an old brooch Brianna had cut apart with the poultry shears, each half with a scatter of tiny diamonds, barely more than chips. He hoped to God they\u2019d be enough. If not\u2014</p><p>The day was only cool, but a bone-deep shudder ran through him. He\u2019d done it twice\u2014three times, if he counted the first attempt, the one that had almost killed him. It got worse each time. He\u2019d thought he wouldn\u2019t make it the last time, coming back on Ocracoke, mind and body shredding in that place that was neither place nor passage. It had only been the feel of Jem in his arms that made him hold on, come through. And it was only the need to find Jem now that would make him do it again.</p><p>A hydroelectric tunnel</p><p>under the Loch Errochty dam</p><p>HE MUST BE getting near the end of the tunnel. Jem could tell by the way the air pushed back against his face. All he could see was the red light on the service train\u2019s dashboard\u2014did you call it a dashboard on a train? he wondered. He didn\u2019t want to stop, because that meant he\u2019d have to get out of the train, into the dark. But the train was running out of track, so there wasn\u2019t much else he could do.</p><p>He pulled back a bit on the lever that made the train go, and it slowed down. More. Just a little more, and the lever clicked into a kind of slot and the train stopped with a small jerk that made him stumble and grab the edge of the cab.</p><p>An electric train didn\u2019t make any engine noise, but the wheels rattled on the track and the train made squeaks and clunks as it moved. When it stopped, the noise stopped, too. It was really quiet.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he said out loud, because he didn\u2019t want to listen to his heart beating. The sound echoed, and he looked up, startled. Mam had said the tunnel was really high, more than thirty feet, but he\u2019d forgotten that. The idea that there was a lot of empty space hanging over him that he couldn\u2019t see bothered him a lot. He swallowed and stepped out of the tiny engine, holding on to the frame with one hand.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he shouted at the invisible ceiling. \u201cAre there any bats up there?\u201d</p><p>Silence. He\u2019d kind of been hoping there were bats. He wasn\u2019t afraid of them\u2014there were bats in the old broch, and he liked to sit and watch them come out to hunt in the summer evenings. But he was alone. Except for the dark.</p><p>His hands were sweating. He let go of the metal cab and scrubbed both hands on his jeans. Now he could hear himself breathing, too.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d he whispered under his breath. That made him feel better, so he said it again. Maybe he ought to be praying, instead, but he didn\u2019t feel like that, not yet.</p><p>There was a door, Mam said. At the end of the tunnel. It led into the service chamber, where the big turbines could be lifted up from the dam if they needed fixing. Would the door be locked?</p><p>Suddenly he realized that he\u2019d stepped away from the train and he didn\u2019t know whether he was facing the end of the tunnel or back the way he\u2019d come. In a panic, he blundered to and fro, hands out, looking for the train. He tripped over part of the track and fell, sprawling. He lay there for a second, saying, \u201cCrap-crap-crap-crap-crap!\u201d because he\u2019d skinned both knees and the palm of his hand, but he was okay, really, and now he knew where the track was, so he could follow it and not get lost.</p><p>He got up, wiped his nose, and shuffled slowly along, kicking the track every few steps to be sure he stayed with it. He thought he was in front of where the train had stopped, so it didn\u2019t really matter which way he was going\u2014either he\u2019d find the train or he\u2019d find the end of the tunnel. And then the door. If it was locked, maybe\u2014</p><p>Something like an electric shock ran right through him. He gasped and fell over backward. The only thing in his mind was the idea that somebody had hit him with a lightsaber like Luke Skywalker\u2019s, and for a minute he thought maybe whoever it was had cut off his head.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel his body, but he could see in his mind his body lying bleeding in the dark and his head sitting right there on the train tracks in the dark, and his head couldn\u2019t see his body or even know it wasn\u2019t attached anymore. He made a breathless kind of a noise that was trying to be a scream, but it made his stomach move and he felt that, he felt it, and suddenly he felt a lot more like praying.</p><p>\u201cDeo . . . gratias!\u201d he managed to gasp. It was what Grandda said when he talked about a fight or killing something, and this wasn\u2019t quite that sort of thing, but it seemed like a good thing to say anyway.</p><p>Now he could feel all of himself again, but he sat up and grabbed his neck, just to be sure his head was still on. His skin was jumping in the weirdest way. Like a horse\u2019s does when a horsefly bites it, but all over. He swallowed and tasted sugared silver and he gasped again, because now he knew what had hit him. Sort of.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t quite like it had been when they\u2019d all walked into the rocks on Ocracoke. One minute he\u2019d been in his father\u2019s arms, and the next minute it was as if he\u2019d been scattered everywhere in little wiggly pieces like the spilled quicksilver in Grannie\u2019s surgery. Then he was back together again, and Da was still holding him tight enough to squeeze his breath out, and he could hear Da sobbing and that scared him, and he had a funny taste in his mouth and little pieces of him were still wiggling around trying to get away but they were trapped inside his skin . . .</p><p>Yeah. That was what was making his skin jump now, and he breathed easier, knowing what it was. That was okay, then; he was okay; it would stop.</p><p>It was stopping already, the twitchy feeling going away. He still felt kind of shaky, but he stood up. Careful, because he didn\u2019t know where it was.</p><p>Wait\u2014he did know. He knew exactly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d he said, out loud without really noticing, because he wasn\u2019t scared by the dark anymore; it wasn\u2019t important.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see it, not with his eyes, not exactly. He squinted, trying to think how he was seeing it, but there wasn\u2019t a word for what he was doing. Kind of like hearing or smelling or touching, but not really any of those. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he knew where it was. It was right there, a kind of . . . shiver . . . in the air, and when he stared at it, he had a feeling in the back of his mind like pretty sparkly things, like sun on the sea and the way a candle flame looked when it shone through a ruby, but he knew he wasn\u2019t really seeing anything like that.</p><p>It went all the way across the tunnel, and up to the high roof, too, he could tell. But it wasn\u2019t thick at all; it was thin as air.</p><p>He guessed that was why it hadn\u2019t swallowed him like the thing in the rocks on Ocracoke had. At least . . . he thought it hadn\u2019t and, for an instant, worried that maybe he\u2019d gone sometime else. But he didn\u2019t think so. The tunnel felt just the same, and so did he, now that his skin had stopped jumping. When they\u2019d done it, on Ocracoke, he\u2019d known right away it was different.</p><p>He stood there for a minute, just looking and thinking, and then shook his head and turned around, feeling with his foot for the track. He wasn\u2019t going back through that, no matter what. He\u2019d just have to hope the door wasn\u2019t locked.</p> <p>The laird\u2019s study,</p><p>Lallybroch estate</p><p>BRIANNA\u2019S HAND closed on the letter opener, but even as she calculated the distance involved, the obstacle of the desk between Rob Cameron and herself, and the flimsiness of the wooden blade, she was reluctantly concluding that she couldn\u2019t kill the bastard. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>She stood up suddenly, and he jerked a little in reflex. His face flushed and he hardened his expression.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d bloody well better be okay,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI said, where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, hen,\u201d he said, rocking back on his heels, affecting nonchalance. \u201cThat\u2019s no how we\u2019re playing it. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>God, why didn\u2019t Roger keep a hammer or a chisel or something useful in his desk drawer? Did he expect her to staple this jerk? She braced herself, both hands flat on the desk, to keep from leaping over it and going for his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing,\u201d she said through her teeth. \u201cAnd neither are you. Where\u2019s Jemmy?\u201d</p><p>He leveled a long finger at her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re no longer the boss lady, Ms. MacKenzie. I call the shots now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you think so, do you?\u201d she asked, as mildly as she could. Her thoughts were slipping past like grains of sand in an hourglass, a slithering cascade of what if, how, shall I, no, yes . . .</p><p>\u201cI do, aye.\u201d His color, already high, rose higher, and he licked his lips. \u201cYe\u2019re gonna find out what it\u2019s like to be on the bottom, hen.\u201d</p><p>Cameron\u2019s eyes were very bright, and his hair was clipped so short that she could see beads of sweat glittering above his ears. Was he high on something? She thought not. He was wearing track pants, and his fingers flicked unconsciously across the front, where a substantial bulge was beginning to show. Her lips tightened at the sight.</p><p>Not on your life, buddy.</p><p>She widened her gaze as much as possible, to take him in without letting his eyes move from hers. She didn\u2019t think he was armed, though the pockets of his jacket had stuff in them. He really thought he could make her have sex with him, without a set of manacles and a sledgehammer?</p><p>He twirled his finger, pointing to the floor in front of him.</p><p>\u201cCome round here, hen,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd take your jeans down. Might do ye good to learn what it\u2019s like to take it up the arse regularly. Ye\u2019ve done it to me for months\u2014fair\u2019s fair, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Very slowly, she came around the desk but stopped well short of him, keeping out of reach. She fumbled cold-fingered at the button of her fly, unwilling to look down, unwilling to take her eyes off him. Her heart was beating so hard in her ears that she could barely hear his heavy breathing.</p><p>The tip of his tongue showed briefly, involuntarily, as she pushed the jeans down over her hips, and he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cThe knickers, too,\u201d he said, half breathless. \u201cTake them off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t rape people very often, do you?\u201d she said rudely, stepping out of the puddled jeans. \u201cWhat\u2019s your rush?\u201d She bent and picked the heavy denim pants up, shook out the legs, and turned as though to lay them on the desk. Then whipped back, clutching the jeans at the ankle, and lashed them as hard as she could at his head.</p><p>The heavy cloth with its zipper and brass fly button struck him full in the face, and he staggered back with a grunt of surprise, clutching at the jeans. She let go of them instantly, leapt onto the desk, and launched herself at him, shoulder-first.</p><p>They fell together with a crash that shook the hardwood floor, but she landed on top, kneed him hard in the belly, and then grabbed him by both ears and thumped his head on the floor as hard as she could. He let out a cry of pain, reached for her wrists, and she promptly let go of his ears, leaned backward, and grabbed for his crotch.</p><p>Had she been able to get a decent grip on his balls through the soft fabric, she would have crushed them. As it was, she managed a glancing squeeze but one hard enough to make him yelp and convulse, nearly dislodging her from her perch.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t win a fistfight. Couldn\u2019t let him hit her. She scrambled to her feet, looking wildly round the office for something heavy to hit him with, seized the wooden letter box, and smashed it over his head as he started to rise. He didn\u2019t fall down but bobbed his head, dazed amongst the cascade of letters, and she kicked him in the jaw as hard as she could, her own teeth clenched. It was a sliding, sweaty impact, but she\u2019d hurt him.</p><p>She\u2019d hurt herself, too, had kicked him with her heel, as much as she could, but she felt a burst of pain in the middle of her foot; she\u2019d torn or broken something, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Cameron shook his head violently, trying to clear it. He was on his hands and knees now, crawling toward her, reaching for her leg, and she backed up against the desk. With a banshee shriek, she kneed him in the face, squirmed out of his grasp, and ran for the hall, limping heavily.</p><p>There were weapons on the walls of the foyer, a few targes and broadswords kept for ornament, but all hung high, to be out of the children\u2019s reach. There was a better one easily to hand, though. She reached behind the coat rack and grabbed Jem\u2019s cricket bat.</p><p>You can\u2019t kill him, she kept thinking, dimly surprised at the fact that her mind was still working. Don\u2019t kill him. Not yet. Not \u2019til he says where Jemmy is.</p><p>\u201cFucking . . . bitch!\u201d He was nearly on her, panting, half blinded by blood running down his forehead, half sobbing through the blood pouring from his nose. \u201cFuck you, split you open, f**k you up the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaisteal DOOON!\u201d she bellowed, and, stepping out from behind the coat rack, swung the bat in a scything arc that caught him in the ribs. He made a gurgling noise and folded, arms across his middle. She took a deep breath, swung the bat as high as she could, and brought it down with all her strength on the crown of his head.</p><p>The shock of it vibrated up her arms to her shoulders and she dropped the bat with a clunk and stood there gasping, trembling and drenched with sweat.</p><p>\u201cMummy?\u201d said a tiny, quavering voice from the foot of the stair. \u201cWhy is you not got pants on, Mummy?\u201d</p><p>THANK GOD FOR instinct was her first coherent thought. She\u2019d crossed the length of the foyer, snatched Mandy up in her arms, and was patting her comfortingly before any sort of conscious decision to move had been made.</p><p>\u201cPants?\u201d she said, eyeing the limp form of Rob Cameron. He hadn\u2019t twitched since he\u2019d fallen, but she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d killed him. She\u2019d have to take more-certain steps to neutralize him, and fast. \u201cOh, pants. I was just getting ready for bed when this naughty man showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mandy leaned out of her arms, peering at Cameron. \u201cIss Mr. Rob! Iss a burglar? Iss a bad man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, both,\u201d Brianna said, deliberately casual. Mandy\u2019s speech showed the sibilance it had when she got excited or upset, but the little girl seemed to be recovering pretty fast from the shock of seeing her mother crown a burglar in the front hall while wearing only a T-shirt and underpants. The thought made her want to stomp on Cameron\u2019s balls, but she choked it back. No time for that.</p><p>Mandy clung to her neck, but Brianna set her firmly on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMummy wants you to stay here, a ghraidh. I have to put Mr. Rob someplace safe, where he can\u2019t do anything bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mandy cried, seeing her mother head toward the crumpled Cameron, but Brianna waved in what she hoped was a reassuring manner, picked up the cricket bat as insurance, and nudged her prisoner in the ribs with a cautious toe. He wobbled but didn\u2019t stir. Just in case, she moved round behind him and prodded him rudely between the bu**ocks with the cricket bat, which made Mandy giggle. He didn\u2019t move, and she drew a deep breath for the first time in what seemed like hours.</p><p>Going back to the stairs, she gave Mandy the bat to hold and smiled at her. She pushed a strand of sweaty hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019re going to put Mr. Rob in the priest\u2019s hole. You go and open the door for Mummy, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hit him?\u201d Mandy asked hopefully, clutching the bat.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you need to do that, darling. Just open the door.\u201d</p><p>Her work tote was hanging from the coat rack, the big roll of duct tape easily to hand. She trussed Cameron\u2019s ankles and wrists, a dozen turns each, then bent and, clutching him by the ankles, dragged him toward the swinging baize door at the far end of the hall, which separated the kitchen from the rest of the house.</p><p>He began to stir as they negotiated the big table in the kitchen, and she dropped his feet.</p><p>\u201cMandy,\u201d she said, keeping her voice as calm as possible. \u201cI need to have a grown-up talk with Mr. Rob. Give me the bat. Then you go right on out to the mudroom and wait for me there, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMummy . . .\u201d Mandy was shrinking back against the sink cabinet, eyes huge and fixed on the moaning Cameron.</p><p>\u201cGo, Mandy. Right now. Mummy will be there before you can count to a hundred. Start counting now. One . . . two . . . three . . .\u201d She moved between Cameron and Mandy, motioning firmly with her free hand.</p><p>Reluctantly, Mandy moved, murmuring, \u201cFour . . . five . . . six . . . seven . . .\u201d and disappeared through the back kitchen door. The kitchen was warm from the Aga, and despite her lack of clothes, Bree was still streaming with sweat. She could smell herself, feral and acrid, and found that it made her feel stronger. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever truly understood the term \u201cbloodthirsty\u201d before, but she did now.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my son?\u201d she said to Cameron, keeping a wary distance in case he tried to roll at her. \u201cAnswer me, you piece of crap, or I\u2019ll beat the shit out of you and then call the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He rolled slowly onto his side, groaning. \u201cAnd tell them what, exactly? That I took your boy? What proof of that d\u2019ye have?\u201d His words were slurred; his lip was puffed out on one side, where she\u2019d kicked him.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll just beat the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, beat a helpless man? Fine example for your wee lassie.\u201d He rolled onto his back with a muffled grunt.</p><p>\u201cAs for the police, I can tell them you broke into my house and assaulted me.\u201d She pointed one foot at him, so he could see the livid scratches on her leg. \u201cYou\u2019ll have my skin cells under your fingernails. And while I\u2019d rather not have Mandy go through it all again, she\u2019d certainly tell them what you were saying in the hallway.\u201d She would, too, Bree thought. Mandy was a very faithful tape recorder, especially where bad language was concerned.</p><p>\u201cNng.\u201d Cameron had closed his eyes, grimacing against the light over the sink, but now opened them again. He was less dazed; she could see the light of calculation back in his eyes. Like most men, she thought, he was probably smarter when he wasn\u2019t sexually aroused\u2014and she\u2019d taken care of that.</p><p>\u201cAye. And I tell them it was just a wee sex game that got out of hand, and you say it wasn\u2019t, and they say, \u2018Aye, fine, missus, and where\u2019s your husband, then?\u2019\u201d The undamaged side of his mouth twisted up. \u201cYou\u2019re not that swift tonight, hen. But, then, ye\u2019re not usually.\u201d</p><p>His mention of Roger made the blood surge in her ears. She didn\u2019t reply but grabbed him by the feet and pulled him roughly through the kitchen and into the back passageway. The grating that covered the priest\u2019s hole was hidden by a bench and several boxes of milk bottles, bits of farm equipment awaiting repair, and other items that didn\u2019t go anywhere else. She dropped Rob\u2019s feet, shoved the bench and boxes aside, and pulled up the grating. There was a ladder leading down into the shadowy space; she pulled this up and slid it behind the bench. That little amenity wouldn\u2019t be needed.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Rob\u2019s eyes widened. Either he hadn\u2019t known there really was a priest\u2019s hole in the house or he hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d do it. Without a word, she seized him under the arms, dragged him to the hole, and shoved him in. Feetfirst, because if he broke his neck, he couldn\u2019t tell her where Jem was.</p><p>He fell with a shriek, which was cut short by a heavy thump. Before she could worry that he\u2019d managed to land on his head after all, she heard him moaning and a rustle as he started to stir. A muttering of very bad language further reassured her that he was in good enough shape to answer questions. She fetched the big flashlight from the kitchen drawer and shone it down into the hole. Cameron\u2019s face, congested and streaked with blood, glared up at her. He curled up and with some difficulty managed to wriggle into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve broken my leg, you f**king bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said coldly, though she doubted it. \u201cOnce I get Jem back, I\u2019ll take you to a doctor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He breathed heavily through his nose, making a nasty snuffling noise, and swiped at his face with his bound hands, smearing the blood across one cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou want him back? You get me out of here, and fast!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been considering\u2014and discarding\u2014different plans of action, shuffling through them like a mental pack of cards, ever since she\u2019d duct-taped him. And letting him out wasn\u2019t one she\u2019d considered. She had thought of fetching the .22 rifle the family used to hunt rats and winging him in a few nonessential places\u2014but there was some risk of either disabling him too badly to be of help or killing him accidentally by hitting something vital if he squirmed.</p><p>\u201cThink fast,\u201d he shouted up at her. \u201cYour wee lass will hit a hundred and be back any second!\u201d</p> <p>Despite the situation, Brianna smiled. Mandy had very recently been introduced to the idea that numbers were infinite and had been enchanted by the concept. She wouldn\u2019t stop counting until she ran out of breath or someone stopped her. Still, she wasn\u2019t going to engage in pointless conversation with her prisoner.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and reached for the grate. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how talkative you are after twenty-four hours without food or water, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bloody bitch!\u201d He tried to surge to his feet but fell over onto his side, writhing impotently. \u201cYou\u2014you just think about this, aye? If I\u2019m without food and water, so\u2019s your wee lad!\u201d</p><p>She froze, the metal edge of the grate digging into her fingers.</p><p>\u201cRob, you\u2019re not bright,\u201d she said. She was amazed that her voice sounded conversational; waves of horror and relief and renewed horror were rippling across her shoulders, and something primitive in the back of her mind was screaming.</p> <p>A sullen silence from below, as he tried to work out what he\u2019d just given away.</p><p>\u201cNow I know you didn\u2019t send Jem back through the stones,\u201d she clarified for him. She carefully didn\u2019t shriek, But you sent Roger back to look for him! And he\u2019ll never find him. You . . . you . . . \u201cHe\u2019s still here, in this time.\u201d</p><p>Another silence.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cOkay, you know that. But you don\u2019t know where he is. And you\u2019re not going to, until you turn me loose. I meant it, hen\u2014he\u2019ll be thirsty by now. And hungry. It\u2019ll be a lot worse for him by morning.\u201d</p><p>Her hand tightened on the grate. \u201cYou had better be lying,\u201d she said evenly. \u201cFor your sake.\u201d She shoved the grate back into place and stepped on it, clicking it down into its frame. The priest\u2019s hole was literally a hole: a space about six feet by eight, and twelve feet deep. Even if Rob Cameron hadn\u2019t been bound hand and foot, he couldn\u2019t jump high enough to get hold of the grate, let alone reach the latch that held it down.</p><p>Ignoring the furious shouts from below, Brianna went to retrieve her daughter and her jeans.</p> <p>THE MUDROOM WAS empty, and for an instant she panicked\u2014but then she saw the tiny bare foot sticking out from under the bench, long toes relaxed as a frog\u2019s, and her heart rate dropped. A little.</p><p>Mandy was curled up under Roger\u2019s old mac, thumb half in her mouth, sound asleep. The impulse was to carry her to her bed, let her sleep \u2019til daylight. Brianna laid a soft hand on her daughter\u2019s black curly hair\u2014black as Roger\u2019s\u2014and her heart squeezed like a lemon. There was another child to consider.</p><p>\u201cWake up, sweetheart,\u201d she said, gently shaking the little girl. \u201cWake up, honey. We need to go and look for Jem.\u201d</p><p>It took no little cajoling and the administration of a glass of Coca-Cola\u2014a rare treat, and absolutely unheard of so late at night, how exciting!\u2014to get Mandy into a state of alertness, but once there she was all eagerness to go and hunt for her brother.</p><p>\u201cMandy,\u201d Bree said as casually as she could, buttoning her daughter\u2019s pink quilted coat, \u201ccan you feel Jem? Right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Mandy replied offhandedly, and Brianna\u2019s heart leapt. Two nights before, the child had waked screaming from a sound sleep, weeping hysterically and insisting that Jem was gone. She had been inconsolable, wailing that her brother had been eaten by \u201cbig wocks!\u201d\u2014an assertion that had terrified her parents, who knew the horrors of those particular rocks all too well.</p><p>But then, a few minutes later, Mandy had suddenly calmed. Jem was there, she said. He was there in her head. And she had gone back to sleep as though nothing had happened.</p><p>In the consternation that had followed this episode\u2014the discovery that Jem had been taken by Rob Cameron, one of Brianna\u2019s fellow employees at the hydroelectric plant, and presumably taken through the stones into the past\u2014there had been no time to recall Mandy\u2019s remark about Jem being back in her head, let alone to make further inquiries. But now Brianna\u2019s mind was moving at the speed of light, bounding from one horrifying realization to the next, making connections that might have taken hours to make in cooler blood.</p> <p>Horrifying Realization Number 1: Jem hadn\u2019t gone into the past, after all. While by itself this was undeniably a good thing, it made Horrifying Realization Number 2 that much worse: Roger and William Buccleigh had undoubtedly gone through the stones, searching for Jemmy. She hoped they were in fact in the past and not dead\u2014traveling through whatever sort of thing the stones were was a bloody dangerous proposition\u2014but, if so, that brought her back to Horrifying Realization Number 1: Jem wasn\u2019t in the past. And if he wasn\u2019t there, Roger wasn\u2019t going to find him. And since Roger would never give up looking . . .</p><p>She pushed Horrifying Realization Number 3 aside with great force, and Mandy blinked, startled.</p><p>\u201cWhy you making faces, Mummy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPracticing for Halloween.\u201d She rose, smiling as best she could, and reached for her own duffel coat.</p><p>Mandy\u2019s brow creased in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Halloween?\u201d</p><p>Cold rippled over Brianna, and not just from the draft through the crack under the back door. Did they make it? They thought the portal was most active on the sun feasts and fire feasts\u2014and Samhain was an important fire feast\u2014but they couldn\u2019t wait the extra day, for fear that Jem would be taken too far from Craigh na Dun after passing through the stones.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said. Her fingers slipped and fumbled on the fastenings, shaky with adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cGoody, goody, goody!\u201d Mandy said, hopping to and fro like a cricket. \u201cCan I wear my mask to look for Jemmy?\u201d</p><p>NOTHING\u2019S SO HARD BUT SEARCH WILL FIND IT OUT</p><p>HE\u2019D FELT THE DIAMONDS explode. For some time, that was the only thought in his mind. Felt it. One instant, briefer than a heartbeat, and a pulse of light and heat in his hand and then the throb of something going through him, surrounding him, and then . . .</p><p>Not \u201cthen,\u201d he thought muzzily. Wasn\u2019t any then. Wasn\u2019t any now. Now there is, though . . .</p><p>He opened his eyes to find that there was a now. He was lying on stones and heather and there was a cow breathing\u2014no, not a cow. He made to rise and managed to turn his head half an inch. It was a man, sitting huddled on the ground. Taking huge, irregular, gasping sobs of breath. Who . . . ?</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said aloud, or almost. \u201c \u2019S you.\u201d The words came out in a mangle that hurt his throat, and he coughed. That hurt, too. \u201cYou . . . okay?\u201d he asked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It came out in a grunt, filled with pain, and alarm got Roger up onto hands and knees, head spinning. He did a bit of gasping himself but crawled as fast as he could toward Buck.</p><p>William Buccleigh was curled over, arms crossed, gripping his left upper arm with his right hand. His face was pale and slicked with sweat, lips pressed so tight together that a ring of white showed round his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHurt?\u201d Roger lifted a hand, not sure where or whether to prod. He couldn\u2019t see any blood.</p><p>\u201cMy . . . chest,\u201d Buck wheezed. \u201cArm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d Roger said, the last remnants of muzziness stripped away by a blast of adrenaline. \u201cAre you having a bloody heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . .\u201d Buck grimaced, then something seemed to ease a little. He gulped air. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014never mind. Lie down, will you?\u201d Roger looked wildly round, though even as he did, he realized the sheer pointlessness of doing so. The area near Craigh na Dun was wild and unpopulated in his own time, let alone this one. And even should someone appear out of the stones and heather, the chances of whoever it was being a doctor were remote.</p><p>He took Buck by the shoulders and eased him gently down, then bent and put his ear to the man\u2019s chest, feeling like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye hear anything?\u201d Buck asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNot with you talking, no. Shut up.\u201d He thought he could make out a heartbeat of some sort but had no idea whether there was anything wrong with it. He stayed bent a moment longer, if only to compose himself.</p><p>Always act as if you know what you\u2019re doing, even if you don\u2019t. He\u2019d been given that bit of advice by a number of people, from performers he\u2019d shared a stage with to academic advisers . . . and, much more recently, by both of his in-laws.</p><p>He put a hand on Buck\u2019s chest and looked into the man\u2019s face. He was still sweating and plainly scared, but there was a little more color in his cheeks. His lips weren\u2019t blue; that seemed a good sign.</p><p>\u201cJust keep breathing,\u201d he advised his ancestor. \u201cSlow, aye?\u201d</p><p>He tried to follow that bit of advice himself; his own heart was hammering and sweat was running down his back, in spite of a cold wind that whined past his ears.</p><p>\u201cWe did it, aye?\u201d Buck\u2019s chest was moving more slowly under his hand. He turned his head to look round. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . different. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d In spite of the current situation and the overwhelming worry for Jem, Roger felt a surge of jubilation and relief. It was different: from here, he could see the road below\u2014now no more than an overgrown drovers\u2019 trace rather than a gray asphalt ribbon. The trees and bushes, they were different, too\u2014there were pines, the big Caledonian pines that looked like giant stalks of broccoli. They had made it.</p><p>He grinned at Buck. \u201cWe made it. Don\u2019t die on me now, you bugger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo my best.\u201d Buck was gruff but maybe starting to look better. \u201cWhat happens if ye die out of your time? D\u2019ye just disappear, like ye never were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe ye explode into bits. I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t want to find out. Not while I\u2019m standing next to you, at least.\u201d Roger got his feet under him and fought down a wave of dizziness. His own heart was still beating hard enough that he felt it in the back of his head. He breathed as deep as he could and stood up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll . . . get ye some water. Stay there, aye?\u201d</p><p>ROGER HAD BROUGHT a small empty canteen, though he\u2019d worried about what might happen to the metal in transit. Evidently whatever it was that vaporized gemstones wasn\u2019t bothered about tin, though; the canteen was intact, and so was the small knife and the silver pocket flask of brandy.</p><p>Buck was sitting up by the time Roger came back from the nearest burn with water, and after mopping his face with the water and drinking half the brandy, he declared himself recovered.</p><p>Roger wasn\u2019t all that sure; the look of the man was a little off-color still\u2014but he was much too anxious about Jem to suggest waiting any longer. They\u2019d talked about it a bit on the drive to Craigh na Dun, agreeing on a basic strategy, at least to start.</p><p>If Cameron and Jem had made it through without mishap\u2014and Roger\u2019s heart misgave him at that thought, recalling Geillis Duncan\u2019s careful collection of news reports involving people found near stone circles, most of them dead\u2014they had to be on foot. And while Jem was a sturdy little boy and capable of walking a good distance, he doubted they could make much more than ten miles in a day over rough country.</p><p>The only road was the drovers\u2019 track that led near the base of the hill. So one of them would take the direction that would intersect with one of General Wade\u2019s good roads that led to Inverness; the other would follow the track west toward the pass that led to Lallybroch and, beyond it, Cranesmuir.</p><p>\u201cI think Inverness is the most likely,\u201d Roger repeated, probably for the sixth time. \u201cIt\u2019s the gold he wants, and he knows that\u2019s in America. He can\u2019t be meaning to walk from the Highlands to Edinburgh to find a ship, not with winter breathing down his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t find a ship anywhere in the winter,\u201d Buck objected. \u201cNo captain would cross the Atlantic in November!\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think he knows that?\u201d Roger asked. \u201cHe\u2019s an amateur archaeologist, not a historian. And most folk in the twentieth century have trouble thinking anything was ever different in the past, save the funny clothes and no indoor plumbing. The notion that the weather could stop them going anywhere they\u2019d a mind to\u2014he may well think ships run all the time, on a regular timetable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, maybe he means to hole up in Inverness with the lad, maybe find work, and wait \u2019til the spring. D\u2019ye want to take Inverness, then?\u201d Buck lifted his chin in the direction of the invisible town.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Roger shook his head and began patting his pockets, checking his supplies. \u201cJem knows this place.\u201d He nodded toward the stones above them. \u201cI brought him here, more than once, to make sure he never came upon it unawares. That means he knows\u2014approximately, at least\u2014how to get home\u2014to Lallybroch, I mean\u2014from here. If he got away from Cameron\u2014and, God, I hope he did!\u2014he\u2019d run for home.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t trouble saying that even if Jem wasn\u2019t there, Brianna\u2019s relatives were, her cousins and her aunt. He\u2019d not met them, but they knew from Jamie\u2019s letters who he was; if Jem wasn\u2019t there\u2014and, Lord, how he hoped he was\u2014they\u2019d help him search. As to how much he might try to tell them . . . that could wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, then.\u201d Buck buttoned his coat and settled the knitted comforter round his neck against the wind. \u201cThree days, maybe, to Inverness and time to search the town, two or three back. I\u2019ll meet ye here in six days\u2019 time. If ye\u2019re not here, I follow on to Lallybroch.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded. \u201cAnd if I\u2019ve not found them but I\u2019ve heard some word of them, I\u2019ll leave a message at Lallybroch. If . . .\u201d He hesitated, but it had to be said. \u201cIf ye find your wife, and things fall out\u2014\u201d</p><p>Buck\u2019s lips tightened.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already fallen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, aye. If. I\u2019ll still come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, right.\u201d Roger hunched his shoulders, anxious to go, and awkward with it. Buck was already turning away but suddenly about-faced and gripped Roger\u2019s hand, hard.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him,\u201d Buck said, and looked into Roger\u2019s eyes, with those bright-moss eyes that were the same as his. \u201cGood luck.\u201d He gave Roger\u2019s hand one sharp, hard shake and then was off, arms outstretched for balance as he picked his way down through the rocks and gorse. He didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>WARMER, COLDER</p><p>\u201cCAN YOU TELL when Jem\u2019s at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He goes on da bus.\u201d Mandy bounced a little on her booster seat, leaning to peer out the window. She was wearing the Halloween mask Bree had helped her make, this being a mouse princess: a mouse face drawn with crayons on a paper plate, with holes pierced for eyes and at either side for pink yarn ties, pink pipe cleaners glued on for whiskers, and a precarious small crown made with cardboard, more glue, and most of a bottle of gold glitter.</p> <p>Scots celebrated Samhain with hollowed-out turnips with candles in them, but Brianna had wanted a slightly more festive tradition for her half-American children. The whole seat sparkled as though the car had been sprinkled with pixie dust.</p><p>She smiled, despite her worry.</p><p>\u201cI meant, if you played warmer, colder with Jem, could you do it if he wasn\u2019t answering you out loud? Would you know if he was closer or farther away?\u201d</p><p>Mandy kicked the back of the seat in meditative fashion.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you try?\u201d They were headed toward Inverness. That was where Jem was supposed to be, spending the night with Rob Cameron\u2019s nephew.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mandy said agreeably. She hadn\u2019t asked where Rob Cameron was. Brianna spared a thought as to the fate of her prisoner. She really would shoot him through the ankles, elbows, knees, or anything else necessary to find out where Jem was\u2014but if there were quieter ways of interrogation, it would be better all round. It wouldn\u2019t be good for Jem and Mandy to have their mother sent to prison for life, particularly if Roger\u2014She choked that thought off and stepped harder on the gas.</p><p>\u201cColder,\u201d Mandy announced, so suddenly that Brianna nearly stalled the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Do you mean we\u2019re getting farther away from where Jemmy is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Brianna took a deep breath and made a U-turn, narrowly avoiding an oncoming panel truck, which hooted at them in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said, gripping the wheel with sweaty hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll go the other way.\u201d</p><p>THE DOOR WASN\u2019T locked. Jem opened it, heart pounding in relief, and then it pounded harder, as he realized the lights weren\u2019t on in the turbine chamber, either.</p><p>There was some light. The little windows up at the top of the huge space, up where the engineers\u2019 room was: there was light coming from there. Just enough so he could see the monsters in the huge room.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just machines,\u201d he muttered, pressing his back hard against the wall beside the open door. \u201cJustmachinesjustmachinesjustmachines!\u201d He knew the names of them, the giant pulley hoists that ran overhead with the big hooks dangling, and the turbines, Mam had told him. But he\u2019d been up there then, where the light was, and it had been daylight.</p><p>The floor under his feet vibrated, and he could feel the knobs on his backbone knocking against the wall as it shook from the weight of the water rushing through the dam under him. Tons of water, Mummy said. Tons and tons and tons of black dark water, all around him, under him . . . If the wall or the floor broke, it\u2014</p><p>\u201cShut up, baby!\u201d he said fiercely to himself, and rubbed his hand hard over his face and wiped it on his jeans. \u201cYou got to move. Go!\u201d</p><p>There were stairs; there had to be stairs. And they were somewhere in here, among the big black humps of the turbines that poked up. They stood higher than the big stones on the hill where Mr. Cameron had taken him. That thought calmed him down some; he was lots more scared of the stones. Even with the deep roaring noise the turbines made\u2014that was making his bones twitch, but it didn\u2019t really get inside his bones.</p><p>The only thing that kept him from going right back into the tunnel and hoping for someone to find him in the morning was the . . . thing in there. He didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near that.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hear his heart anymore. It was too noisy in the turbine chamber to hear anything. He sure couldn\u2019t hear himself think, but the stairs had to be near the windows, and he wobbled that way, keeping as far as he could from the huge black double humps sticking up through the floor.</p><p>It was only when he finally found the door, yanked it open, and fell into the lighted staircase that it occurred to him to wonder whether Mr. Cameron was maybe up there, waiting for him.</p><p>RETURN TO LALLYBROCH</p><p>ROGER HAULED HIS WAY laboriously toward the summit of the mountain pass, muttering under his breath (as he had been doing for the last several miles):</p><p>\u201cIf you had seen this road before it was made,</p><p>You would lift up your hands and bless General Wade.\u201d</p><p>The Irish General Wade had spent twelve years building barracks, bridges, and roads all over Scotland, and if that bit of admiring verse was not in fact carved into a stone on one of the general\u2019s roads, it ought to have been, Roger thought. He had picked up one of the general\u2019s roads near Craigh na Dun, and it had carried him as swiftly as he could walk to within a few miles of Lallybroch.</p><p>These last few miles, though, had not had the benefit of Wade\u2019s attention. A rocky trail, pitted with small mud bogs and thickly overgrown with heather and gorse, led up through the steep pass that overlooked\u2014and protected\u2014Lallybroch. The lower slopes were forested with beeches, alders, and stout Caledonian pines, but up this high there was neither shade nor shelter, and a strong, cold wind battered him as he climbed.</p><p>Could Jem have come this far by himself, if he\u2019d escaped? Roger and Buck had cast round in the vicinity of Craigh na Dun, hoping that perhaps Cameron had stopped to rest after the strain of the passage, but there had been no sign\u2014not so much as the print of a size-4 trainer in a muddy patch of ground. Roger had come on then by himself, as fast as he could, pausing to knock at the door of any croft he came to\u2014and there weren\u2019t many along this way\u2014but he\u2019d made good time.</p><p>His heart was pounding, and not only from the exertion of the climb. Cameron had maybe a two-day lead, at the most. If Jem hadn\u2019t got away and run for home, though . . . Cameron wouldn\u2019t come to Lallybroch, surely. But where would he go? Follow the good road, left now ten miles behind, and head west, maybe, into the MacKenzies\u2019 territory\u2014but why?</p><p>\u201cJem!\u201d He shouted now and then as he went, though the moors and mountains were empty save for the rustling of rabbits and stoats and silent but for the calling of ravens and the occasional shriek of a seagull winging high overhead, evidence of the distant sea.</p><p>\u201cJem!\u201d he called, as though he could compel an answer by sheer need, and in that need imagined sometimes that he heard a faint cry in response. But when he stopped to listen, it was the wind. Only the wind, whining in his ears, numbing him. He could walk within ten feet of Jem and never see him, and he knew that.</p><p>His heart rose, in spite of his anxiety, when he came to the top of the pass and saw Lallybroch below him, its white-harled buildings glowing in the fading light. Everything lay peaceful before him: late cabbages and turnips in orderly rows within the kailyard walls, safe from grazing sheep\u2014there was a small flock in the far meadow, already bedding for the night, like so many woolly eggs in a nest of green grass, like a kid\u2019s Easter basket.</p><p>The thought caught at his throat, with memories of the horrible cellophane grass that got everywhere, Mandy with her face\u2014and everything else within six feet of her\u2014smeared with chocolate, Jem carefully writing Dad on a hard-boiled egg with a white crayon, then frowning over the array of dye cups, trying to decide whether blue or purple was more Dad-like.</p><p>\u201cLord, let him be here!\u201d he muttered under his breath, and hurried down the rutted trail, half sliding on loose rocks.</p><p>The dooryard was tidy, the big yellow rose brier trimmed back for the winter, and the step swept clean. He had the sudden notion that if he were simply to open the door and walk in, he would find himself in his own lobby, Mandy\u2019s tiny red galoshes flung helter-skelter under the hall tree where Brianna\u2019s disreputable duffel coat hung, crusty with dried mud and smelling of its wearer, soap and musk and the faint smell of her motherhood: sour milk, fresh bread, and peanut butter.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbe weeping on the step, next thing.\u201d He hammered at the door, and a huge dog came galloping round the corner of the house, baying like the bloody hound of the Baskervilles. It slid to a stop in front of him but went on barking, weaving its huge head to and fro like a snake, ears cocked in case he might make a false move that would let it devour him with a clear conscience.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t risking any moves; he\u2019d plastered himself against the door when the dog appeared and now shouted, \u201cHelp! Come call your beast!\u201d</p><p>He heard footsteps within, and an instant later the door opened, nearly decanting him into the hall.</p><p>\u201cHauld your wheesht, dog,\u201d a tall, dark man said in a tolerant tone. \u201cCome ben, sir, and dinna be minding him. He wouldna eat you; he\u2019s had his dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear it, sir, and thank ye kindly.\u201d Roger pulled off his hat and followed the man into the shadows of the hall. It was his own familiar hall, the slates of the floor just the same, though not nearly as worn, the dark-wood paneling shining with beeswax and polishing. There was a hall tree in the corner, though of course different to his; this one was a sturdy affair of wrought iron, and a good thing, too, as it was supporting a massive burden of jackets, shawls, cloaks, and hats, which would have crumpled a flimsier piece of furniture.</p><p>He smiled at it, nonetheless, and then stopped dead, feeling as though he\u2019d been punched in the chest.</p><p>The wood paneling behind the hall tree shone serene, unblemished. No sign of the saber slashes left by frustrated redcoat soldiers searching for the outlawed laird of Lallybroch after Culloden. Those slashes had been carefully preserved for centuries, were still there, darkened by age but still distinct, when he had owned\u2014would own, he corrected mechanically\u2014this place.</p><p>\u201cWe keep it so for the children,\u201d Bree had quoted her uncle Ian as saying. \u201cWe tell them, \u2018This is what the English are.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He had no time to deal with the shock; the dark man had shut the door with a firm Gaelic adjuration to the dog and now turned to him, smiling.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, sir. Ye\u2019ll sup wi\u2019 us? The lass has it nearly ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I will, and thanks to ye,\u201d Roger bowed slightly, groping for his eighteenth-century manners. \u201cI\u2014my name is Roger MacKenzie. Of Kyle of Lochalsh,\u201d he added, for no respectable man would omit to note his origins, and Lochalsh was far enough away that the chances of this man\u2014who was he? He hadn\u2019t the bearing of a servant\u2014knowing its inhabitants in any detail was remote.</p><p>He\u2019d hoped that the immediate response would be, \u201cMacKenzie? Why, you must be the father of wee Jem!\u201d It wasn\u2019t, though; the man returned his bow and offered his hand.</p><p>\u201cBrian Fraser of Lallybroch, your servant, sir.\u201d</p><p>ROGER FELT ABSOLUTELY nothing for a moment. There was a faint clicking that reminded him of the noise a car\u2019s starter makes when the battery is dead, and for a disoriented moment he assumed it was being made by his brain. Then his eyes focused on the dog, which, prevented from eating him, had come into the house and was walking down the passage, its toenails clicking on the parquet floor.</p><p>Oh. So that\u2019s what left those scratches on the kitchen door, he thought, dazed, as the beast reared up and heaved its weight at the swinging door at the end of the passage, then shot through as it opened.</p><p>\u201cAre ye quite well, sir?\u201d Brian Fraser was looking at him, thick black brows drawn down in concern. He reached out a hand. \u201cCome into my study and sit. I\u2019ll maybe fetch ye a dram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014thank you,\u201d Roger said abruptly. He thought his knees might give way at any second, but he managed to follow the master of Lallybroch into the speak-a-word room, the laird\u2019s office and study. His own study.</p><p>The shelves were the same, and behind his host\u2019s head was the same row of farm ledgers that he\u2019d often thumbed through, conjuring up from their faded entries the phantom life of an earlier Lallybroch. Now the ledgers were new, and Roger felt himself the phantom. He didn\u2019t like the feeling at all.</p><p>Brian Fraser handed him a small, thick, flat-bottomed glass half full of spirit. Whisky, and very decent whisky, too. The smell of it began to bring him out of his shock, and the warm burn of it down his gullet loosened the tightness in his throat.</p><p>How was he to ask what he so desperately needed to know? When?! He glanced over the desk, but there was no half-finished letter, conveniently dated, no planting almanac that he might glance casually through. None of the books on the shelf were of help; the only one he recognized was Defoe\u2019s THE LIFE AND STRANGE SURPRIZING ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE, OF YORK, MARINER, and that had been published in 1719. He knew he must be later than that; the house itself hadn\u2019t yet been built in 1719. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He forced down the rising tide of panic. It didn\u2019t matter; it didn\u2019t matter if it wasn\u2019t the time he\u2019d expected\u2014not if Jem was here. And he must be. He must be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disturb your family, sir,\u201d he said, clearing his throat as he set down the glass. \u201cBut the fact is that I\u2019ve lost my son and am in search of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost your son!\u201d exclaimed Fraser, eyes widening in surprise. \u201cBride be with ye, sir. How did that come about?\u201d</p><p>Just as well to tell the truth where he could, he thought, and, after all, what else could he say?</p> <p>\u201cHe was kidnapped two days ago and carried away\u2014he\u2019s no but nine years old. I have some reason to think the man who took him comes from this area. Have ye by chance seen a tall man, lean and dark, traveling with a young red-haired lad, about so tall?\u201d He put the edge of his hand against his own arm, about three inches above the elbow; Jem was tall for his age and even taller for this age\u2014but, then, Brian Fraser was a tall man himself, and his son . . .</p><p>A fresh shock went through Roger with the thought: Was Jamie here? In the house? And if he was, how old might he be? How old had he been when Brian Fraser die\u2014</p><p>Fraser was shaking his head, his face troubled.</p><p>\u201cI have not, sir. What\u2019s the name of the man who\u2019s taken your lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRob\u2014Robert Cameron, he\u2019s called. I dinna ken his people,\u201d he added, falling naturally into Fraser\u2019s stronger accent.</p> <p>\u201cCameron . . .\u201d Fraser murmured, tapping his fingers on the desk as he searched his memory. The motion flicked something in Roger\u2019s memory; it was the ghost of one of Jamie\u2019s characteristic gestures when thinking\u2014but Jamie, with his frozen finger, did it with the fingers flat, where his father\u2019s came down in a smooth ripple.</p><p>He picked up the glass again and took another sip, glancing as casually as he might at Fraser\u2019s face, searching for resemblance. It was there but subtle, mostly in the c**k of the head, the set of the shoulders\u2014and the eyes. The face was quite different, square in the jaw, broader of brow, and Brian Fraser\u2019s eyes were a dark hazel, not blue, but the slanted shape of them, the wide mouth\u2014that was Jamie.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019re nay many Camerons nearer than Lochaber.\u201d Fraser was shaking his head. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard nothing of a wanderer in the district.\u201d He gave Roger a direct look, not accusing but definitely questioning. \u201cWhy is it ye think the man came this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014he was seen,\u201d Roger blurted. \u201cNear Craigh na Dun.\u201d</p><p>That startled Fraser.</p><p>\u201cCraigh na Dun,\u201d he repeated, leaning back a little, his eyes gone wary. \u201cAh . . . and where might ye have come from yourself, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom Inverness,\u201d Roger replied promptly. \u201cI followed him from there.\u201d Close enough. He was trying hard not to recall that he\u2019d left on his quest to find Cameron and Jem from the very spot in which he was now sitting. \u201cI\u2014a friend\u2014a kinsman\u2014came with me. I sent him toward Cranesmuir to search.\u201d</p><p>The news that he apparently wasn\u2019t a solitary nutter seemed to reassure Fraser, who pushed back from the desk and stood up, glancing at the window, where a big rose brier curved up gaunt and black against the fading sky.</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, bide for a bit, sir, and ye will. It\u2019s late in the day, and ye\u2019ll make no great distance before dark falls. Sup with us, and we\u2019ll gie ye a bed for the night. Mayhap your friend will catch ye up with good news, or one of my tenants may ha\u2019 seen something. I\u2019ll send round in the morning, to ask.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s legs were quivering with the urge to leap up, rush out, do something. But Fraser was right: it would be pointless\u2014and dangerous\u2014to blunder round the Highland mountains in the dark, losing his way, perhaps be caught in a killing storm this time of year. He could hear the wind picking up; the rose brier beat at the glass of the window. It was going to rain soon. And is Jem out in it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes. I thank you, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s most kind of ye.\u201d</p><p>Fraser patted him on the shoulder, went out into the hallway, and called, \u201cJanet! Janet, we\u2019ve a guest for supper!\u201d</p><p>Janet?</p><p>He\u2019d risen to his feet without thinking and came out of the office as the kitchen door swung open\u2014and a small, slender shape was momentarily silhouetted against the glow of the kitchen, rubbing her hands on her apron.</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter, Janet, sir,\u201d Fraser said, drawing his daughter into the fading light. He smiled fondly at her. \u201cThis is Mr. Roger MacKenzie, Jenny. He\u2019s lost his wee lad somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has?\u201d The girl paused, halfway through a curtsy, and her eyes went wide. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, sir?\u201d</p><p>Roger explained again briefly about Rob Cameron and Craigh na Dun, but all the time was consumed by the desire to ask the young woman how old she was. Fifteen? Seventeen? Twenty-one? She was remarkably beautiful, with clear white skin that bloomed from the heat of cooking, soft curly black hair tied back from her face, and a trim figure that he tried hard not to stare at\u2014but what was most disturbing was that, despite her obvious femininity, she bore a startling resemblance to Jamie Fraser. She might be his daughter, he thought, and then brought himself up short, realizing afresh\u2014and remembering, with a stab of the heart that nearly dropped him to his knees\u2014who Jamie Fraser\u2019s daughter really was.</p><p>Oh, God. Bree. Oh, Jesus, help me. Will I ever see her again?</p><p>He realized that he\u2019d fallen silent and was staring at Janet Fraser with his mouth open. Apparently she was used to this sort of response from men, though; she gave him a demure, slant-eyed smile, said that supper would be on the table in a few moments and maybe Da should show Mr. MacKenzie the way to the necessary? Then she was walking back down the hallway, the big door swung to behind her, and he found he could breathe again.</p><p>THE SUPPER WAS plain but plentiful and well cooked, and Roger found that food restored him amazingly. No wonder\u2014he couldn\u2019t remember when he\u2019d last eaten.</p><p>They ate in the kitchen, with a pair of housemaids called Annie and Senga and a man-of-all-work named Tom McTaggart sharing the table with the family. All of them were interested in Roger and, while giving him great sympathy in the matter of his missing son, were even more interested in where he might come from and what news he might bear.</p><p>Here he was at something of a loss, as he had no firm notion what year it was (Brian died\u2014God, will die\u2014when Jamie was nineteen, and if Jamie was born in May of 1721\u2014or was it 1722?\u2014and he was two years younger than Jenny . . .) and thus no idea what might have been happening in the world of late, but he delayed a bit, explaining his antecedents in some detail\u2014that was good manners, for one thing, and for another, his birthplace in Kyle of Lochalsh was far enough away from Lallybroch that the Frasers were unlikely to have met any of his people.</p><p>Then at last he had a bit of luck, when McTaggart told about taking off his shoe to shake out a stone, then seeing one of the pigs wriggle under the fence and head for the kailyard at a trot. He rushed after the pig, of course, and succeeded in catching it\u2014but had dragged it back to the pen only to find that the other pig had likewise wriggled out and was peacefully eating his shoe.</p><p>\u201cThis was all she left!\u201d he said, pulling half a shredded leather sole out of his pocket and waving it at them reproachfully. \u201cAnd a rare struggle I had to pull it from her jaws!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did ye bother?\u201d Jenny asked, wrinkling her nose at the dank object. \u201cDinna trouble yourself, Taggie. We\u2019ll slaughter the pigs next week, and ye can have a bit o\u2019 the hide to make yourself a new pair of shoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose I\u2019m to go barefoot \u2019til then, am I?\u201d McTaggart asked, disgruntled. \u201cThere\u2019s frost on the ground in the morn, aye? I could take a chill and be dead of the pleurisy before yon pig\u2019s eaten its last bucket o\u2019 slops, let alone been tanned.\u201d</p><p>Brian laughed and lifted his chin toward Jenny. \u201cDid your brother no leave a pair of his outgrown shoon behind when he left for Paris? I mind me he did, and if ye havena given them to the poor, might be as Taggie could manage wi\u2019 them for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Paris. Roger\u2019s mind worked furiously, calculating. Jamie had spent not quite two years in Paris at the universit\u00e9 and had come back . . . when? When he was eighteen, he thought. Jamie would have been\u2014will be\u2014eighteen in May of 1739. So it was now 1737, 1738, or 1739.</p><p>The narrowing of uncertainty calmed him a little, and he managed to put his mind to thinking of historical events that had occurred in that gap that he might offer as current news in conversation: absurdly, the first thing that came to mind was that the bottle opener had been invented in 1738. The second was that there had been an enormous earthquake in Bombay in 1737.</p><p>His audience was initially more interested by the bottle opener, which he was obliged to describe in detail\u2014inventing wildly, as he had no notion what the thing actually looked like, though there were sympathetic murmurs regarding the residents of Bombay and a brief prayer for the souls of those crushed under falling houses and the like.</p><p>\u201cBut where is Bombay?\u201d asked the younger of the housemaids, wrinkling her brow and looking from one face to another.</p><p>\u201cIndia,\u201d said Jenny promptly, and pushed back her chair. \u201cSenga, fetch the cranachan, aye? I\u2019ll show ye where India is.\u201d</p><p>She vanished through the swinging door, and the bustle of removing dishes left Roger with a few moments\u2019 breathing space. He was beginning to feel a little easier, getting his bearings, though still agonized with worry for Jem. He did spare a moment\u2019s thought for William Buccleigh and how Buck might take the news of the date of their arrival.</p><p>Seventeen thirty-something . . . Jesus, Buck himself hadn\u2019t even been born yet! But, after all, what difference did that make? he asked himself. He hadn\u2019t been born yet, either, and had lived quite happily in a time prior to his birth before. . . . Could their proximity to the beginning of Buck\u2019s life have something to do with it, though?</p><p>He did know\u2014or thought he knew\u2014that you couldn\u2019t go back to a time during your own lifetime. Trying to exist physically at the same time as yourself just wasn\u2019t on. It had just about killed him once; maybe they\u2019d got too close to Buck\u2019s original lifeline, and Buck had somehow recoiled, taking Roger with him?</p><p>Before he could explore the implications of that unsettling thought, Jenny returned, carrying a large, thin book. This proved to be a hand-colored atlas, with maps\u2014surprisingly accurate maps, in many cases\u2014and descriptions of \u201cThe Nations of the World.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother sent it to me from Paris,\u201d Jenny told him proudly, opening the book to a double-page spread of the Continent of India, where the starred circle indicating Bombay was surrounded by small drawings of palm trees, elephants, and something that upon close scrutiny turned out to be a tea plant. \u201cHe\u2019s at the universit\u00e9 there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Roger smiled, being sure to look impressed. He was, the more so at realization of the effort and expense involved in going from this remote mountain wilderness to Paris. \u201cHow long has he been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, almost two years now,\u201d Brian answered. He put out a hand and touched the page gently. \u201cWe do miss the lad cruelly, but he writes often. And he sends us books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Jenny said, though with an air of conviction that seemed somewhat forced. \u201cHe said he\u2019d come back.\u201d</p><p>Brian smiled, though this too was a little forced.</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019m sure I hope so, a nighean. But ye ken he may have found opportunities that keep him abroad for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpportunities? Ye mean that de Marillac woman?\u201d Jenny asked, a distinct edge in her voice. \u201cI dinna like the way he writes about her. Not one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could do worse for a wife, lass.\u201d Brian lifted one shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s from a good family.\u201d</p><p>Jenny made a very complicated sound in her throat, indicating sufficient respect for her father as to prevent her expressing a fuller opinion of \u201cthat woman\u201d while still making that opinion plain. Her father laughed.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s no a complete fool,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI doubt he\u2019d marry a simpleton or a\u2014a\u2014\u201d He\u2019d obviously thought better of saying \u201cwhore\u201d\u2014his lips had begun to shape the word\u2014but couldn\u2019t think of a substitute in time.</p><p>\u201cHe would,\u201d Jenny snapped. \u201cHe\u2019d walk straight into a cob\u2019s web wi\u2019 his eyes wide open, if the cob had a pretty face and a round arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanet!\u201d Her father tried to look shocked but failed utterly. McTaggart guffawed openly, and Annie and Senga giggled behind their hands. Jenny glowered at them but then drew herself up with dignity and addressed herself to their guest.</p><p>\u201cSo, then, Mr. MacKenzie. Is your own wife living, I hope? And is she your wean\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she\u2014\u201d He felt the question like a blow in the chest but then remembered when he was. The odds of a woman surviving childbirth were no more than even in many places. \u201cYes. Yes, she\u2019s\u2014in Inverness, with our daughter.\u201d</p><p>Mandy. Oh, my sweet baby. Mandy. Bree. Jem. All at once, the enormity of it struck him. He\u2019d managed so far to ignore it by concentrating on the need to find Jem, but now a cold wind whistled through the holes in his heart left by hurtling odds. The odds were that he would never see any of them again. And they would never know what had happened to him.</p><p>\u201cOh, sir.\u201d Jenny whispered it, leaning forward to lay a hand on his arm, her eyes wide with horror at what she\u2019d provoked. \u201cOh, sir, I\u2019m sorry! I didna mean to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he managed, forcing the words through his mangled larynx in a croak. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d He waved a hand in blind apology and stumbled out. He went straight out through the mudroom at the back of the house and found himself in the night outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a narrow crack of sullen light just at the tops of the mountains, where the cloud had not quite settled, but the yard about him was deep in shadow, and the wind touched his face with the scent of cold rain. He was shaking, but not from chill, and sat down abruptly on the big stone by the path where they pulled the children\u2019s wellies off when it was muddy.</p><p>He put his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands, overcome for a moment. Not only for his own situation\u2014but for those in the house. Jamie Fraser was coming home soon. And soon after there would come the afternoon when red-coated soldiers marched into the yard at Lallybroch, finding Janet and the servants alone. And the events would be set in train that would end with the death of Brian Fraser, struck down by an apoplexy while watching his only son flogged\u2014he thought\u2014to death.</p><p>Jamie . . . Roger shivered, seeing in mind not his indomitable father-in-law but the lighthearted young man who, among the distractions of Paris, still thought to send books to his sister. Who\u2014</p><p>It had begun to rain, with a quiet thoroughness that slicked his face in seconds. At least no one would know if he wept in despair. I can\u2019t stop it, he thought. I can\u2019t tell them what\u2019s coming.</p> <p>A huge shape loomed out of the darkness, startling him, and the dog leaned heavily against him, nearly pushing him off the stone he sat on. A large, hairy nose was thrust sympathetically into his ear, whoofling and wetter than the rain.</p><p>\u201cJesus, dog,\u201d he said, half-laughing in spite of everything. \u201cGod.\u201d He put his arms round the big, smelly creature and rested his forehead against its massive neck, feeling inchoate comfort.</p><p>He thought of nothing for a little and was inexpressibly relieved. Little by little, though, coherent thought came back. It maybe wasn\u2019t true that things\u2014the past\u2014couldn\u2019t be changed. Not the big things, maybe, not kings and battles. But maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014the small ones could. If he couldn\u2019t come right out and tell the Frasers of Lallybroch what doom was to come upon them, perhaps there was something he could say, some warning that might forestall\u2014</p><p>And if he did? If they listened? Would that good man in the house die of his apoplexy anyway, some weakness in his brain giving way as he came in from the barn one day? But that would leave his son and his daughter safe\u2014and then what?</p><p>Would Jamie stay in Paris and marry the flirtatious Frenchwoman? Would he come home peaceably to live at Lallybroch and mind his estate and his sister?</p> <p>Either way, he wouldn\u2019t be riding near Craigh na Dun in five or six years, pursued by English soldiers, wounded and needing the assistance of a random time traveler who had just stepped out of the stones. And if he didn\u2019t meet Claire Randall. . . . Bree, he thought. Oh, Christ. Bree.</p><p>There was a sound behind him\u2014the door of the house opening\u2014and the beam of a lantern fell onto the path nearby.</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie?\u201d Brian Fraser called into the night. \u201cAre ye all right, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he whispered, clutching the dog. \u201cShow me what to do.\u201d</p><p>LIGHTS, ACTION, SIRENS</p><p>THE DOOR AT THE top of the staircase was locked. Jem pounded on it with his fists, kicked it with his feet, and shouted. He could feel it back down there behind him, in the dark, and the feel of it crawled up his back, as if it were coming to get him, and the thought of that scared him so bad that he shrieked like a ban-s\u00ecdhe and threw himself hard against the door, over and over, and\u2014</p> <p>The door flew open and he fell flat on a dirty lino floor, all footmarks and cigarette butts.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil\u2014who are you, laddie, and what in God\u2019s name were ye doing in there?\u201d</p><p>A big hand grabbed him by the arm and pulled him up. He was out of breath from yelling and almost blubbering from relief, and it took a minute to remember who he was.</p><p>\u201cJem.\u201d He swallowed, blinking in the light, and wiped his face on his sleeve. \u201cJem MacKenzie. My mam\u2019s . . .\u201d He went blank, suddenly unable to remember what Mam\u2019s first name was. \u201cShe works here sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know your mam. No mistaking that hair, laddie.\u201d The man who\u2019d pulled him up was a security guard; the patch on his shirtsleeve said so. He tilted his head to one side and the other, looking Jem over, light flashing off his bald head, off his glasses. The light was coming from those long tube lights in the ceiling Da said were fluorescent; they buzzed and reminded him of the thing in the tunnel, and he turned round fast and shoved the door shut with a bang.</p><p>\u201cIs someone chasin\u2019 ye, lad?\u201d The guard reached a hand toward the doorknob, and Jem put his back hard against the door.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He could feel it back there, behind the door. Waiting. The guard was frowning at him. \u201cI\u2014I just\u2014it\u2019s really dark down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe were down in the dark? However did ye come to be there? And where\u2019s your mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jem started being scared again. Really scared. Because Mr. Cameron had shut him up in the tunnel so he could go somewhere. And he might have gone to Lallybroch.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cameron put me in there,\u201d he blurted. \u201cHe was supposed to take me to spend the night with Bobby, but instead he took me to Craigh na Dun, and then he took me to his house and locked me in a room overnight, and then the next morning he brought me here and shut me up in the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCameron\u2014what, Rob Cameron?\u201d The guard crouched down so he could frown right into Jem\u2019s face. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d Don\u2019t ever tell anyone, Da had said. Jem swallowed hard. Even if he wanted to tell, he didn\u2019t know how to start. He could say Mr. Cameron took him up the hill at Craigh na Dun, to the stones, and pushed him into one. But he couldn\u2019t tell what had happened then, not any more than he could tell Mr. MacLeod\u2014that\u2019s what it said on his badge, JOCK MACLEOD\u2014what the shiny thing in the tunnel was.</p><p>Mr. MacLeod made a thinking noise in his throat, shook his head, and stood up.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d best be calling your parents to come and fetch ye home, aye? They can say if they maybe want to speak to the polis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Jem whispered, feeling his knees turn to water at the thought of Mam and Da coming to get him. \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Mr. MacLeod took him along to a little office where the phone was, gave him a warm can of Coke, and told him to sit down just there and say his parents\u2019 telephone number. He sipped the drink and felt lots better right away, watching Mr. MacLeod\u2019s thick finger whirl the telephone dial. A pause, and then he could hear ringing on the other end. Breep-breep . . . breep-breep . . . breep-breep . . .</p><p>It was warm in the office, but he was starting to feel cold around his face and hands. Nobody was answering the phone.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019re asleep,\u201d he said, stifling a Coke burp. Mr. MacLeod gave him a sideways look and shook his head, pushed down the receiver, and dialed the number again, making Jem say the numbers one at a time.</p><p>Breep-breep. . . . breep-breep . . .</p><p>He was concentrating so hard on willing somebody to pick up the phone that he didn\u2019t notice anything until Mr. MacLeod suddenly turned his head toward the door, looking surprised.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d the guard said, and then there was a blur and a thunking noise like when cousin Ian shot a deer with an arrow, and Mr. MacLeod made an awful noise and fell right out of his chair onto the floor, and the chair shot away and fell over with a crash.</p><p>Jem didn\u2019t remember standing up, but he was pressed against the filing cabinet, squeezing the can so hard that the bubbly Coke blurped out and foamed over his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou come with me, boy,\u201d said the man who\u2019d hit Mr. MacLeod. He was holding what Jem thought must be a cosh, though he\u2019d never seen one. He couldn\u2019t move, even if he\u2019d wanted to.</p><p>The man made an impatient noise, stepped over Mr. MacLeod like he was a bag of rubbish, and grabbed Jem by the hand. Out of sheer terror, Jem bit him, hard. The man yelped and let go, and Jem threw the can of Coke right at his face, and when the man ducked, he tore past him and out of the office and down the long hallway, running for his life.</p><p>IT WAS GETTING late; they passed fewer and fewer cars on the road, and Mandy\u2019s head began to nod. The mouse-princess mask had ridden up on top of her head, its pipe-cleaner whiskers poking up like antennae. Seeing this in the rearview mirror, Brianna had a sudden vision of Mandy as a tiny radar station, scanning the bleak countryside for Jem\u2019s small, pulsing signal.</p><p>Could she? She shook her head, not to dispel the notion but to keep her mind from slipping all the way out of reality. The adrenaline of her earlier rage and terror had all drained away; her hands shook a little on the steering wheel, and the darkness around them seemed vast, a yawning void that would swallow them in an instant if she stopped driving, if the feeble beam of the headlights ceased . . .</p><p>\u201cWarm,\u201d Mandy murmured sleepily.</p><p>\u201cWhat, baby?\u201d She\u2019d heard but was too hypnotized by the effort of keeping her eyes on the road to take it in consciously.</p><p>\u201cWarm . . . er.\u201d Mandy struggled upright, cross. The yarn ties of her mask were stuck in her hair, and she made a high-pitched cranky noise as she yanked at them.</p><p>Brianna pulled carefully onto the verge, set the hand brake, and, reaching back, began to disentangle the mask.</p><p>\u201cYou mean we\u2019re going toward Jem?\u201d she asked, careful to keep her voice from trembling.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Free of the nuisance, Mandy yawned hugely and flung out a hand toward the window. \u201cMmp.\u201d She put her head down on her arms and whined sleepily.</p><p>Bree swallowed, closed her eyes, then opened them, looking carefully in the direction Mandy had pointed. There was no road . . . but there was, and with a trickle of ice water down her spine, she saw the small brown sign that said: SERVICE ROAD. NO PUBLIC ACCESS. NORTH OF SCOTLAND HYDRO ELECTRIC BOARD. Loch Errochty dam. The tunnel.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d said Brianna, and stomped the gas, forgetting the hand brake. The car jumped and stalled, and Mandy sat bolt upright, eyes glazed and wide as a sun-stunned owl\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIss we home yet?\u201d</p><p>JEM PELTED DOWN the hallway and threw himself at the swinging door at the end, so hard that he skidded all the way across the landing on the other side and fell down the stairs beyond, bumping and banging and ending up in a dazed heap at the bottom.</p><p>He heard the footsteps coming fast toward the door above and, with a small, terrified squeak, scrambled on all fours round the second landing and launched himself headfirst down the next flight, tobogganing on his stomach for a few stairs, then tipping arse over teakettle and somersaulting down the rest.</p><p>He was crying with terror, gulping air and trying not to make a noise, stumbling to his feet, and everything hurt, everything\u2014but the door: he had to get outside. He staggered through the half-dark lobby, the only lights shining through the glass window where the receptionist usually sat. The man was coming; he could hear him cursing at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>The main door had a chain looped through the bars. Swiping tears on his sleeve, he ran back in to the reception, looking wildly round. EMERGENCY EXIT\u2014there it was, the red sign over the door at the far end of another small corridor. The man burst into the lobby and saw him.</p><p>\u201cCome back here, you little bugger!\u201d</p><p>He looked round wildly, grabbed the first thing he saw, which was a rolling chair, and pushed it as hard as he could into the lobby. The man cursed and jumped aside, and Jem ran for the door and flung himself against it, bursting into the night with a scream of sirens and the flash of blinding lights.</p><p>\u201cWHASSAT, MUMMY? Mummy, I scared, I SCARED!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I\u2019m not?\u201d Bree said under her breath, heart in her mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d she said aloud, and pressed her foot to the floor. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to get Jem.\u201d</p><p>The car slewed to a stop on the gravel, and she leapt out but dithered for a moment, needing urgently to rush toward the building, where sirens and lights were going off over an open door at the side, but unable to leave Mandy alone in the car. She could hear the rush of water down the spillway.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, sweetheart,\u201d she said, hastily undoing the seat belt. \u201cThat\u2019s right, here, let me carry you . . .\u201d Even as she spoke, she was looking here, there, from the lights into the darkness, every nerve she had screaming that her son was here, he was here, he had to be . . . rushing water . . . her mind filled with horror, thinking of Jem falling into the spillway, or Jem in the service tunnel\u2014God, why hadn\u2019t she gone there first? Of course Rob Cameron would have put him there, he had the keys, he . . . but the lights, the sirens . . .</p><p>She\u2019d almost made it\u2014at a dead run, impeded only slightly by thirty pounds of toddler\u2014when she saw a big man at the edge of the drive, thrashing through the bushes with a stick or something, cursing a blue streak.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she bellowed. Mandy, alarmed anew, let out a screech like a scalded baboon, and the man jumped, whirling to face them, stick raised.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bleedin\u2019 hell are you doing here?\u201d he said, so taken aback that he spoke almost normally. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bree had peeled Mandy off. Setting her daughter down behind her, she prepared to take the man apart with her bare hands, if necessary. Evidently this intent showed, because the man dropped the stick and abruptly vanished into the darkness.</p><p>Then flashing lights washed over the drive and she realized that it wasn\u2019t her own aspect that had frightened him. Mandy was clinging to her leg, too frightened even to wail anymore. Bree picked her up, patting her gently, and turned to face the two police officers who were advancing cautiously toward her, hands on their batons. She felt wobbly-legged and dreamlike, things fading in and out of focus with the strobing lights. The rush of tons of falling water filled her ears.</p><p>\u201cMandy,\u201d she said into her daughter\u2019s warm curly hair, her own voice almost drowned out by the sirens. \u201cCan you feel Jem? Please tell me you can feel him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere I am, Mummy,\u201d said a small voice behind her. Convinced she was hallucinating, she lifted a restraining hand toward the police officers and pivoted slowly round. Jem was standing on the drive six feet away, dripping wet, plastered with dead leaves, and swaying like a drunk.</p><p>Then she was sitting splay-legged on the gravel, a child clutched in each arm, trying hard not to shake, so they wouldn\u2019t notice. She didn\u2019t start to sob, though, until Jemmy lifted a tearstained face from her shoulder and said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Daddy?\u201d</p><p>THE SHINE OF A ROCKING HORSE\u2019S EYES</p><p>FRASER DIDN\u2019T ASK BUT poured them each a dram of whisky, warm-smelling and smoke-tinged. There was something comfortable in drinking whisky in company, no matter how bad the whisky. Or the company, for that matter. This particular bottle was something special, and Roger was grateful, both to the bottle and its giver, for the sense of comfort that rose from the glass, beckoning him, a genie from the bottle.</p> <p>\u201cSl\u00e0inte,\u201d he said, lifting the glass, and saw Fraser glance at him in sudden interest. Lord, what had he said? \u201cSl\u00e0inte\u201d was one of the words that had a distinct pronunciation, depending on where you came from\u2014men from Harris and Lewis said \u201cSl\u00e0n-ya,\u201d while far north it was more like \u201cSl\u00e0nj.\u201d He\u2019d used the form he\u2019d grown up with in Inverness; was it strikingly wrong for where he\u2019d said he came from? He didn\u2019t want Fraser to think him a liar.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it ye do for yourself, a chompanaich?\u201d Fraser asked, having taken a sip, closing his eyes in momentary respect to the drink, then opening them to regard Roger with a kind curiosity\u2014tinged perhaps with a little wariness, lest his visitor be unhinged. \u201cI\u2019m accustomed to know a man\u2019s work at once by his dress and manner\u2014not that ye find many folk truly unusual up here.\u201d He smiled a bit at that. \u201cAnd drovers, tinkers, and gypsies dinna take much effort to descry. Clearly you\u2019re none of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a bit of land,\u201d Roger replied. It was an expected question; he was ready with an answer\u2014but found himself longing to say more. To tell the truth\u2014so far as he himself understood it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left my wife wi\u2019 the running of things whilst I came to search for our lad. Beyond that\u2014\u201d He lifted one shoulder briefly. \u201cI was trained as a minister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d Fraser leaned back, surveying him with interest. \u201cI could see ye\u2019re an educated man. I was thinkin\u2019 maybe a schoolmaster or a clerk\u2014perhaps a lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been both schoolmaster and clerk,\u201d Roger said, smiling. \u201cHavena quite risen\u2014or fallen, maybe\u2014to the practice of law yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a good thing, too.\u201d Fraser sipped, half-smiling.</p><p>Roger shrugged. \u201cLaw\u2019s a corrupt power but one acceptable to men by reason of having arisen from men\u2014it\u2019s a way of getting on wi\u2019 things, is the best ye can say for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not a mean thing to say for it, either,\u201d Fraser agreed. \u201cThe law\u2019s a necessary evil\u2014we canna be doing without it\u2014but do ye not think it a poor substitute for conscience? Speakin\u2019 as a minister, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . aye. I do,\u201d Roger said, somewhat surprised. \u201cIt would be best for men to deal decently with one another in accordance with\u2014well, with God\u2019s principles, if ye\u2019ll pardon my putting it that way. But what are ye to do, first, if ye have men to whom God is of no account, and, second, if ye have men\u2014and you do, always\u2014who own no power greater than their own?\u201d</p><p>Fraser nodded, interested.</p> <p>\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s true that the best conscience willna avail a man who willna mind it. But what d\u2019ye do when conscience speaks differently to men of goodwill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in political disputes, you mean? Supporters of the Stuarts versus those of the . . . the House of Hanover?\u201d It was a reckless thing to say, but it might help him to figure out when he was, and he meant to say nothing that might make it look as though he had a personal stake on either side.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s face underwent a surprising flow of expression, from being taken aback to mild distate, this then ending in a look of half-amused ruefulness.</p><p>\u201cLike that,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI fought for the House of Stuart in my youth, and while I\u2019d not say that conscience didna come into it, it didna come very far onto the field wi\u2019 me.\u201d His mouth quirked at the corner, and Roger felt again the tiny plop! of a stone tossed into his depths, the ripples of recognition spreading through him. Jamie did that. Brianna didn\u2019t. Jem did.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop to think about it, though; the conversation was teetering delicately on the precipice of an invitation to political disclosure, and that, he couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cWas it Sheriffmuir?\u201d he asked, making no effort to disguise his interest.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Fraser said, openly surprised. He eyed Roger dubiously. \u201cYe canna have gone yourself, surely . . . did your faither maybe tell ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Roger, with the momentary twinge that thought of his father always brought. In fact, Fraser was only a few years older than himself, but he knew the other man doubtless took him for a decade younger than he was.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . heard a song about it. \u2019Twas two shepherds met on a hillside, talking about the great fight\u2014and arguing who\u2019d won it.\u201d</p><p>That made Fraser laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell they might! We were arguing that before we finished pickin\u2019 up the wounded.\u201d He took a sip of whisky and washed it meditatively round his mouth, clearly reminiscing. \u201cSo, then, how does the song go?\u201d</p><p>Roger breathed deep, ready to sing, and then remembered. Fraser had seen his rope scar and been tactful enough not to remark on it, but no need to make the damage obvious. Instead, he chanted the first few lines, tapping his fingers on the desk, echoing the rhythm of the big bodhran that was the song\u2019s only accompaniment.</p><p>\u201cO cam ye here the fight to shun,</p><p>Or herd the sheep wi\u2019 me, man?</p><p>Or were ye at the Sherra-moor,</p><p>Or did the battle see, man?\u201d</p><p>I saw the battle, sair and teugh,</p><p>And reekin-red ran mony a sheugh;</p><p>My heart, for fear, gaed sough for sough,</p><p>To hear the thuds, and see the cluds</p><p>O\u2019 clans frae woods, in tartan duds,</p><p>Wha glaum\u2019d at kingdoms three, man.</p><p>It went better than he\u2019d thought; the song really was more chanted than sung, and he managed the whole of it with no more than the odd choke or cough. Fraser was rapt, glass forgotten in his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s braw, man!\u201d Fraser exclaimed. \u201cThough yon poet\u2019s got the devil of an accent. Where\u2019s he come from, d\u2019ye ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . Ayrshire, I think.\u201d</p><p>Fraser shook his head in admiration and sat back.</p><p>\u201cCould ye maybe write it down for me?\u201d he asked, almost shyly. \u201cI wouldna put ye to the trouble of singin\u2019 it again, but I\u2019d dearly love to learn the whole of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014sure,\u201d Roger said, taken aback. Well, what harm could it do to let Robert Burns\u2019s poem loose in the world some years in advance of Burns himself? \u201cKen anyone who can play a bodhran? It\u2019s best wi\u2019 the drum rattlin\u2019 in the background.\u201d He tapped his fingers in illustration.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye.\u201d Fraser was rustling about in the drawer of his desk; he came out with several sheets of foolscap, most with writing on them. Frowning, he flicked through the papers, picked one, and pulled it from the sheaf, placing it facedown in front of Roger, offering him the blank back side.</p><p>There were goose quills, rather tattered from use but well trimmed, in a jar on the desk, and a brass inkstand, which Fraser offered him with a generous sweep of one broad hand.</p><p>\u201cMy son\u2019s friend plays well\u2014he\u2019s gone for a soldier, though, more\u2019s the pity.\u201d A shadow crossed Fraser\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cAch.\u201d Roger clicked his tongue in sympathy; he was trying to make out the writing that showed faintly through the sheet. \u201cJoined a Highland regiment, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Fraser said, sounding a little startled. Christ, were there Highland regiments yet? \u201cHe\u2019s gone to France as a mercenary soldier. Better pay, fewer floggings than the army, he tells his da.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s heart lifted; yes! It was a letter or maybe a journal entry\u2014whatever it was, there was a date on it: 17 . . . was that a 3? Had to be, couldn\u2019t be an 8. 173 . . . it might be a 9 or a 0, couldn\u2019t tell for sure through the paper\u2014no, it had to be a 9, so 1739. He breathed a sigh of relief. Something October, 1739.</p><p>\u201cProbably safer,\u201d he said, only half attending to the conversation as he began to scratch out the lines. It was some time since he\u2019d written with a quill, and he was awkward.</p><p>\u201cSafer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, \u201cfrom the point of view of disease, mostly. Most men that die in the army die of some sickness, ken. Comes from the crowding, having to live in barracks, eat army rations. I\u2019d think mercenaries might have a bit more freedom.\u201d</p><p>Fraser muttered something about \u201cfreedom to starve,\u201d but it was half under his breath. He was tapping his own fingers on the desk, trying to catch the rhythm as Roger wrote. He was surprisingly rather good; by the time the song was finished, he was singing it softly in a pleasant low tenor and had the drumming down pretty well.</p><p>Roger\u2019s mind was divided between the task in front of him and the feel of the letter under his hand. The feel of the paper and the look of the ink reminded him vividly of the wooden box, filled with Jamie\u2019s and Claire\u2019s letters. He had to stop himself from glancing at the shelf where it would be kept when this room was his.</p><p>They\u2019d been rationing the letters, reading them slowly\u2014but when Jem was taken, all bets were off. They\u2019d rushed through the whole of the box, looking for any mention of Jem, any indication that he might have escaped from Cameron and found his way to the safety of his grandparents. Not a word about Jem. Not one.</p><p>They\u2019d been so distraught that they\u2019d scarcely noticed anything else the letters said, but occasional phrases and images floated up in his mind, quite randomly\u2014some of them distinctly disturbing\u2014Brianna\u2019s uncle Ian had died\u2014but scarcely noticeable at the time.</p><p>They weren\u2019t anything he wanted to think about now, either.</p><p>\u201cWill your son be studying the law, then, in Paris?\u201d Roger asked abruptly. He picked up the fresh dram Brian had poured for him and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, he\u2019d maybe make a decent lawyer,\u201d Fraser admitted. \u201cHe could argue ye into the ground, I\u2019ll say that for him. But I think he hasna got the patience for law or politics.\u201d He smiled suddenly. \u201cJamie sees at once what he thinks should be done and canna understand why anyone else should think otherwise. And he\u2019d rather pound someone than persuade them, if it comes to that.\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed ruefully.</p><p>\u201cI understand the urge,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed.\u201d Fraser nodded, leaning back a little in his chair. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll no say as that\u2019s not a necessary thing to do on occasion. Especially in the Highlands.\u201d He grimaced but not without humor.</p><p>\u201cSo, then. Why do ye think this Cameron has stolen your lad?\u201d Fraser asked bluntly.</p><p>Roger wasn\u2019t surprised. As well as they\u2019d been getting on together, he\u2019d known Fraser had to be wondering just how much Roger was telling and how truthful he was. Well, he\u2019d been ready for that question\u2014and the answer was at least a version of the truth.</p><p>\u201cWe lived for a time in America,\u201d he said, and felt a pang with the saying of it. For an instant, their snug cabin on the Ridge was around him, Brianna asleep with her hair loose on the pillow beside him and the children\u2019s breath a sweet fog above them.</p><p>\u201cAmerica!\u201d Fraser exclaimed in astonishment. \u201cWhere, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe colony of North Carolina. A good place,\u201d Roger hastened to add, \u201cbut not without its dangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName me one that is,\u201d Fraser said, but waved that aside. \u201cAnd these dangers made ye come back?\u201d</p><p>Roger shook his head, a tightness in his throat at the memory.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was our wee lass\u2014Mandy, Amanda, she\u2019s called. She was born with a thing wrong with her heart, and there was no physician there who could treat it. So we came . . . back, and while we were in Scotland, my wife inherited some land, and so we stayed. But . . .\u201d He hesitated, thinking how to put the rest, but knowing what he did of Fraser\u2019s antecedents and his history with the MacKenzies of Leoch, the man probably wouldn\u2019t be overly disturbed at his story.</p><p>\u201cMy wife\u2019s father,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cis a good man\u2014a very good man\u2014but the sort who . . . draws attention. A leader of men, and one that other men . . . Well, he told me once that his own father had said to him that, since he was a large man, other men would try him\u2014and they do.\u201d</p><p>He watched Brian Fraser\u2019s face carefully at this, but, beyond the twitch of an eyebrow, there was no apparent response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not go into all the history of it\u201d\u2014since it hasn\u2019t happened yet\u2014\u201cbut the long and the short of it is that my father-in-law was left in possession of a large sum in gold. He doesna regard it as his own property but as something held in trust. Still, there it is. And while it\u2019s been kept secret so far as possible . . .\u201d</p><p>Fraser made a sympathetic sound, acknowledging the difficulties of secrecy in such conditions.</p><p>\u201cSo this Cameron learned of the treasure, did he? And thought to extort it from your father-in-law by taking the bairn captive?\u201d Fraser\u2019s dark brow lowered at the thought.</p><p>\u201cThat may be in his mind. But beyond that\u2014my son kens where the gold is hidden. He was with his grandfather when it was put away safe. Only the two of them ken the whereabouts\u2014but Cameron learned that my son knew the place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Brian sat for a moment staring into his whisky, thinking. Finally he cleared his throat and looked up, meeting Roger\u2019s eyes. \u201cI maybe shouldna say such a thing, but it may be in your own mind already. If he\u2019s taken the boy only because the lad kens where yon treasure is . . . well, was I a wicked man with no scruples, I think I might force the information out of the lad, so soon as I had him alone.\u201d</p><p>Roger felt the cold slide of the suggestion down into the pit of his belly. It was something that had been at the back of his own mind, though he hadn\u2019t admitted it to himself.</p><p>\u201cMake him tell\u2014and then kill him, you mean.\u201d</p><p>Fraser grimaced unhappily.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna want to think it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut without the lad, what is there to mark him out? A man alone\u2014he could travel as he liked, without much notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Roger said, and stopped to breathe. \u201cYes. Well . . . he didn\u2019t. I\u2014I know the man, a little. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do that, mur\u2014\u201d His throat closed suddenly, and he coughed violently. \u201cMurder a child,\u201d he finished hoarsely. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>THEY GAVE HIM a room at the end of the hallway on the second floor. When his family would live here, this would be the children\u2019s playroom. He undressed to his shirt, put out the candle, and got into bed, resolutely ignoring the shadows in the corners that held the ghosts of giant cardboard building blocks, of dollhouses, six-guns, and chalkboards. The fringed skirt of Mandy\u2019s Annie Oakley costume fluttered at the corner of his eye.</p><p>He ached from follicles to toenails, inside and out, but the panic engendered by his arrival had passed. How he felt didn\u2019t matter, though; the question was\u2014what now? They hadn\u2019t gone where they thought, he and Buck, but he had to assume that they had ended up in the right place. The place where Jem was.</p><p>How else could they have come here? Perhaps Rob Cameron knew more now about how the traveling worked, could control it, and had deliberately brought Jem to this time, in order to frustrate pursuit?</p> <p>He was too exhausted to keep hold of his thoughts, let alone string them into coherence. He pushed everything out of his mind, so far as he could, and lay still, staring into the dark, seeing the shine of a rocking horse\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Then he got out of bed, knelt on the cold boards, and prayed.</p><p>\u201cFOR MANY MEN WHO STUMBLE AT THE THRESHOLD ARE WELL FORETOLD THAT DANGER LURKS WITHIN\u201d</p><p>Lallybroch</p><p>October 31, 1980</p><p>BRIANNA COULDN\u2019T open her own front door. She kept trying, rattling the big iron key all over the escutcheon plate, until the WPC took it from her shaking hand and got it into the keyhole. She hadn\u2019t started to shake until the police car turned up the lane to Lallybroch.</p> <p>\u201cRather an old lock,\u201d the police constable observed, giving it a dubious look. \u201cOriginal to the house, is it?\u201d She lifted her head, peering up the white-harled front of the house, pursing her lips at sight of the lintel, with its carved date.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t usually lock the door. We\u2019ve never had burglars.\u201d Brianna\u2019s lips felt numb, but she thought she\u2019d managed a weak smile. Luckily, Mandy was unable to contradict this bald-faced lie, as she\u2019d seen a toad in the grass by the path and was following it, poking at it with the toe of her shoe to make it hop. Jemmy, glued protectively to Brianna\u2019s side, made a low noise in his throat that reminded her startlingly of her father, and she looked down at him, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>He made the noise again and looked away.</p><p>There was a rattle and click as the lock opened, and the constable straightened up with a pleased sound.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s done it. Now, you\u2019re quite sure as you\u2019ll be all right, will you, Mrs. MacKenzie?\u201d the woman said, giving her a dubious look. \u201cOut here by yourself, and your man away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be home soon,\u201d Brianna assured her, though her stomach went hollow at the words.</p><p>The woman eyed her consideringly, then gave a reluctant nod and pushed open the door.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you know best, I expect. I\u2019ll just check to see that your phone\u2019s in order and all the doors and windows locked, shall I, while you have a look round to be sure everything\u2019s as it should be?\u201d</p> <p>The lump of ice that had formed in her middle during the long hours of questioning shot straight up into her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I\u2019m sure everything\u2019s fine.\u201d But the constable had already gone inside and was waiting impatiently for her. \u201cJem! Bring Mandy inside and take her up to the playroom, will you?\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear to leave the kids outside by themselves, exposed. She could scarcely bear to have them out of her sight. But the very last thing she needed was to have Mandy tagging helpfully along, chatting to Constable Laughlin about Mr. Rob in the priest\u2019s hole. Leaving the door open, she hurried after the WPC.</p><p>\u201cThe phone\u2019s in there,\u201d she said, catching up with Constable Laughlin in the hall and gesturing toward Roger\u2019s study. \u201cThere\u2019s an extension in the kitchen. I\u2019ll go and check that and see to the back door.\u201d Not waiting for an answer, she strode down the hall and nearly threw herself through the swinging door that led to the kitchen.</p><p>She didn\u2019t pause to check anything but jerked open the junk drawer and snatched up a big rubber-covered flashlight. Meant to assist farmers lambing at night or searching for lost stock, the thing was a foot long and weighed nearly two pounds.</p><p>The .22 rifle was in the mudroom, and for an instant, as she walked through the house, she debated killing him, in a dispassionate way that would probably scare her if she had time to think about it. She had Jem back, after all\u2014but no. Constable Laughlin would certainly recognize the sound of a shot, in spite of the muffling green baize on the kitchen door. And there was apparently more she needed to learn from Rob Cameron. She\u2019d knock him unconscious and tape his mouth.</p><p>She stepped into the mudroom and quietly closed the kitchen door behind her. There was a deadbolt, but she couldn\u2019t lock it from this side without the key, and her keys were on the table in the foyer, where Constable Laughlin had left them. Instead, she dragged the heavy bench over and jammed it catty-corner between the door and the wall, concentrating on the logistics. Where was the best place to hit someone on the head so as to render them unconscious without fracturing their skull? She had a vague memory of her mother mentioning that once . . . the occiput?</p><p>She\u2019d expected an outcry from Cameron at the sound of her entry, but he didn\u2019t peep. She could hear footsteps above, the confident stride of an adult going down the hall. Constable Laughlin on her tour of inspection, no doubt checking the first-floor windows, ladder-bearing burglars in mind. She closed her eyes for an instant, envisioning the constable sticking her head into the playroom just as Mandy was regaling her brother with the details of her own adventures the night before.</p><p>Nothing to be done about that. She took a deep breath, lifted the grate over the priest\u2019s hole, and shone the light down into the shadows. The empty shadows.</p><p>For a few moments she went on looking, swinging the torch beam from one side of the priest\u2019s hole to the other, then back, then back again . . . her mind simply refusing to believe her eyes.</p><p>The light caught the dull gleam of duct tape\u2014two or three discarded wads, flung into a corner. There was a cold feeling at the back of her neck, and she jerked round, flashlight raised\u2014but it was no more than apprehension; no one was there. The outer door was locked, the mudroom windows secure.</p><p>The door was locked. She made a small, frightened sound and clapped her hand hard over her mouth. Like the door between mudroom and kitchen, the mudroom\u2019s outer door locked with a deadbolt\u2014from the inside. If someone had gone out that way and left the door locked behind him\u2014he had a key to the house. And her rifle was gone.</p><p>THEY\u2019RE TOO LITTLE, she kept thinking. They shouldn\u2019t know about things like this; they shouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s possible. Her hands were shaking; it took three tries to open the sticky drawer in Mandy\u2019s dresser, and after the third failure, she pounded it in fury with the side of her fist, whispering through gritted teeth, \u201cYou goddamned f**king bloody buggering thing! Don\u2019t you dare get in my way!\u201d She crashed her fist on top of the dresser, raised her foot, and smashed the sole of her sneaker into the thing so hard that it rocked back and thumped into the wall with a bang.</p><p>She grabbed the drawer pulls and yanked. The terrorized drawer shot out, and she snatched the whole thing free and flung it into the opposite wall, where it struck and exploded in a rainbow spray of underpants and tiny striped T-shirts.</p><p>She walked over and looked down at the battered drawer, lying upside down on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSo there,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cTeach you to get in my way when I have things to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what, Mam?\u201d said a cautious voice from the doorway. She looked up to see Jemmy hovering there, eyes flicking from her to the mistreated drawer and back.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She thought of trying to explain the drawer but instead cleared her throat and sat down on the bed, holding out a hand to him. \u201cCome here, a bhalaich.\u201d</p><p>His ginger brows flicked up at the Gaelic endearment, but he came willingly, cuddling into her arm. He hugged her hard, burying his head in her shoulder, and she held him as tightly as she could, rocking back and forth and making the sorts of soft noises she\u2019d made to him when he was tiny.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, baby,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cIt will.\u201d</p><p>She heard him swallow and felt his small, square back move under her hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His voice quivered a little and he sniffed hard, then tried again. \u201cYeah. But what\u2019s going to be all right, Mam? What\u2019s going on?\u201d He drew away a little then, looking up at her with eyes that held more questions and more knowledge than any nine-year-old should reasonably have.</p><p>\u201cMandy says you put Mr. Cameron in the priest\u2019s hole. But he\u2019s not there now\u2014I looked.\u201d</p><p>A cold hand stroked her nape as she remembered the shock of the empty hole.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t let him out, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t let him out. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo somebody else did,\u201d he said positively. \u201cWho, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a very logical mind,\u201d she said, smiling a little, despite herself. \u201cYou get it from your Grandda Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I got it from Grannie Claire,\u201d Jem replied, but automatically; he wasn\u2019t to be distracted. \u201cI thought maybe it was the man who chased me at the dam\u2014but he couldn\u2019t have been here letting Mr. Cameron out at the same time he was chasing me. Could he?\u201d A sudden fear showed in his eyes, and she choked back the overwhelming urge to hunt the man down and kill him like a rabid skunk.</p><p>The man had got away at the dam, running off into the dark when the police showed up, but, God help her, she was going to find him one day, and then\u2014but this was not the day. The problem now was to stop him\u2014or Rob Cameron\u2014from getting anywhere near her kids again.</p><p>Then she got what Jemmy was saying and felt the chill she\u2019d carried in her heart spread like hoarfrost through her body.</p><p>\u201cYou mean there has to be another man,\u201d she said, surprised at how calm she sounded. \u201cMr. Cameron, the man at the dam\u2014and whoever let Mr. Cameron out of the priest\u2019s hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be a lady,\u201d Jemmy pointed out. He seemed less scared, talking about it. That was a good thing, because her own skin was rippling with fear.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Grannie called\u2014calls\u2014goose bumps?\u201d She held out her arm, the fine reddish hairs all standing on end. \u201cHorripilation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorripilation,\u201d Jemmy repeated, and gave a small, nervous giggle. \u201cI like that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She took a deep breath and stood up. \u201cGo pick out a change of clothes and your PJs, would you, sweetheart? I have to make a couple of phone calls, and then I think we\u2019re going to go visit Auntie Fiona.\u201d</p><p>IT\u2019S BEST TO SLEEP IN A HALE SKIN</p><p>ROGER WOKE SUDDENLY, but without shock. No sense of abandoned dreams, no half-heard noise, but his eyes were open and he was fully aware. It was perhaps an hour before sunrise. He\u2019d left the shutters open; the room was cold and the clouded sky the color of a black pearl.</p><p>He lay motionless, listening to his heart beat, and realized that for the first time in several days it wasn\u2019t pounding. He wasn\u2019t afraid. The fear and turmoil of the night, the terror of the last few days, had vanished. His body was completely relaxed; so was his mind.</p><p>There was something floating in his mind. Absurdly, it was a line from \u201cJohnny Cope\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s best to sleep in a hale skin; for \u2019twill be a bluidy morning.\u201d Weirder still, he could hear\u2014could almost feel\u2014himself singing it, in his old voice, full of power and enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m ungrateful,\u201d he said to the whitewashed ceiling beams, his morning voice cracked and rough. \u201cBut what the hell?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure whether he was talking to God or to his own unconscious, but the likelihood of getting a straight answer was probably the same in either case. He heard the soft thud of a closing door somewhere below and someone outside whistling through his or her teeth\u2014Annie or Senga, maybe, on the way to the morning milking.</p><p>A knock came on his own door: Jenny Murray, tidy in a white pinny, dark curly hair tied back but not yet capped for the day, with a jug of hot water, a pot of soft soap, and a razor for shaving.</p><p>\u201cDa says can ye ride a horse?\u201d she said without preamble, looking him up and down in an assessing sort of way.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d he replied gruffly, taking the towel-wrapped jug from her. He needed badly to clear the phlegm from his throat and spit but couldn\u2019t bring himself to do that in front of her. Consequently, he just nodded and muttered, \u201cTaing,\u201d as he took the razor, instead of asking why. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBreakfast\u2019ll be in the kitchen when you are,\u201d she said matter-of-factly. \u201cBring the jug down, aye?\u201d</p><p>AN HOUR LATER, filled to bursting with hot tea, parritch, bannocks with honey, and black pudding, he found himself on an autumn-shaggy horse, following Brian Fraser through the rising mist of early morning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go round to the crofts nearby,\u201d Fraser had told him over breakfast, spooning strawberry preserves onto a bannock. \u201cEven if no one\u2019s seen your lad\u2014and to be honest,\u201d his wide mouth twisted in apology, \u201cI think I should ha\u2019 heard already if anyone had seen a stranger in the district\u2014they\u2019ll pass on the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, thanks very much,\u201d he\u2019d said, meaning it. Even in his own time, gossip was the fastest way of spreading news in the Highlands. No matter how fast Rob Cameron might travel, Roger doubted he could outpace the speed of talk, and the thought made him smile. Jenny caught it and smiled back sympathetically, and he thought again what a very pretty lass she was.</p> <p>The sky was still low and threatening, but impending rain had never yet deterred anyone in Scotland from doing anything and wasn\u2019t likely to start now. His throat felt much better for the hot tea, and the odd sense of calm with which he\u2019d waked was still with him.</p><p>Something had changed in the night. Maybe it was sleeping in Lallybroch, among the ghosts of his own future. Perhaps that had settled his mind while he slept.</p><p>Maybe it was answered prayer and a moment of grace. Maybe it was no more than Samuel Beckett\u2019s bloody existential I can\u2019t go on; I\u2019ll go on. If he had a choice\u2014and he did, Beckett be damned\u2014he\u2019d go with grace.</p><p>Whatever had caused it, he wasn\u2019t disoriented any longer, thrown off-balance by what he knew about the futures of the people around him. There was still a deep concern about them\u2014and the need to find Jem still filled him. But now it was a quiet, hard thing in his core. A focus, a weapon. Something to brace his back against.</p><p>He straightened his shoulders as he thought this and, at the same time, saw Brian\u2019s straight, flat back and the broad, firm shoulders under the dark sett of his tartan coat. They were the echo of Jamie\u2019s\u2014and the promise of Jem\u2019s.</p> <p>Life goes on. It was his job above all to rescue Jem, as much for Brian Fraser\u2019s sake as for his own.</p><p>And now he knew what had changed in him and gave thanks to God for what was indeed grace. He\u2019d slept\u2014and waked\u2014in a whole skin. And however bloody the mornings to come, he had direction now, calmness and hope, because the good man who rode before him was on his side.</p><p>THEY VISITED MORE than a dozen crofts in the course of the day and stopped a tinker they met along the way, as well. No one had seen a stranger recently, with or without a red-haired lad, but all promised to spread the word and all without exception offered their prayers for Roger and his quest.</p><p>They stopped for supper and the night with a family named Murray that had a substantial farmhouse, though nothing to rival Lallybroch. The owner, John Murray, turned out in the course of conversation to be Brian Fraser\u2019s factor\u2014the overseer of much of the physical business of Lallybroch\u2019s estate\u2014and he lent his grave attention to Roger\u2019s story.</p><p>An elderly, long-faced man with rawboned, muscular arms, he sucked his teeth consideringly, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll send one of my lads down in the morn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if ye\u2019ve found nay trace o\u2019 this fellow up along the Hieland passes . . . might be as ye should go down to the garrison and tell your tale, Mr. MacKenzie.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Fraser cocked a dark brow, half-frowning at this, but then nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s no a bad thought, John.\u201d He turned to Roger. \u201cIt\u2019s some distance, ken\u2014the garrison\u2019s in Fort William, down by Duncansburgh. But we can ask along our way, and the soldiers send messengers regularly betwixt the garrison, Inverness, and Edinburgh. Should they hear a thing about your man, they could get word to us swiftly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they could maybe arrest the fellow on the spot,\u201d Murray added, his rather melancholy countenance brightening a bit at the idea.</p><p>\u201cMoran taing,\u201d Roger said, bowing a little to them both in acknowledgment, then turning to Fraser. \u201cI\u2019ll do that, and thanks. But, sir\u2014ye needna go with me. You\u2019ve business of your own to tend to, and I wouldna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come, and glad to,\u201d Fraser interrupted him firmly. \u201cThe hay\u2019s long since in and naught to do that John canna take care of for me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at Murray, who made a small noise, halfway between a sigh and a cough, but nodded.</p><p>\u201cFort William\u2019s in the midst of the Camerons\u2019 land, forbye,\u201d Murray observed absently, gazing off toward the dark fields. They had dined with his family but then come out to the dooryard, ostensibly to share a pipe; it smoldered in Murray\u2019s hand, disregarded for the moment.</p><p>Brian made a noncommittal sound in his throat, and Roger wondered just what Murray meant. Was it a warning that Rob Cameron might have relatives or allies to whom he was heading? Or was there some tension or difficulty between some of the Camerons and the Frasers of Lovat\u2014or between the Camerons and the MacKenzies?</p> <p>That presented some difficulty. If there was a feud of any importance going on, Roger ought already to know about it. He gave a small, grave \u201chmp\u201d himself and resolved to approach any Camerons with caution. At the same time . . . was Rob Cameron intending to seek refuge or help with the Camerons of this time? Had he maybe come to the past before and had a hiding place prepared among his own clan? That was an evil thought, and Roger felt his stomach tighten as though to resist a punch.</p><p>But no; there hadn\u2019t been time. If Cameron had only learned about time travel from the guide Roger had written for his children\u2019s eventual use, he wouldn\u2019t have had time to go to the past, find ancient Camerons, and . . . no, ridiculous.</p><p>Roger shook off the tangle of half-formed thoughts as though they were a fishing net thrown over his head. There was nothing more to be done until they reached the garrison tomorrow.</p><p>Murray and Fraser were leaning on the fence now, sharing the pipe and chatting casually in Gaelic.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter bids me ask after your son,\u201d Brian Fraser said, with an air of casualness. \u201cAny word?\u201d</p><p>Murray snorted, smoke purling from his nostrils, and said something very idiomatic about his son. Fraser grimaced in sympathy and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cAt least ye ken he\u2019s alive,\u201d he said, dropping back into English. \u201cLike enough, he\u2019ll come home when he\u2019s had his fill of fighting. We did, aye?\u201d He nudged Murray gently in the ribs, and the taller man snorted again, but with less ferocity.</p><p>\u201cIt wasna boredom that led us here, a dhuine dhubh. Not you, anyway.\u201d He raised one shaggy graying brow, and Fraser laughed, though Roger thought there was a regretful edge in it.</p><p>He remembered the story very well: Brian Fraser, a bastard of old Lord Lovat\u2019s, had stolen Ellen MacKenzie from her brothers Colum and Dougal, the MacKenzies of Castle Leoch, and had ended up at last with her at Lallybroch, the pair of them more or less disowned by both clans but at least left alone by them. He\u2019d seen the portrait of Ellen, too\u2014tall, red-haired, and undeniably a woman worth the effort.</p><p>She\u2019d looked very much like her granddaughter Brianna. By reflex, he closed his eyes, breathed deep of the cold Highland evening, and thought he felt her there at his side. If he opened them again, might he see her standing in the smoke?</p><p>I\u2019ll come back, he thought to her. No matter what, a nighean ruaidh\u2014I\u2019m coming back. With Jem.</p><p>SANCTUARY</p><p>IT WAS NEARLY AN hour\u2019s drive over the narrow, twisting Highland roads from Lallybroch to Fiona Buchan\u2019s new house in Inverness. Plenty of time for Brianna to wonder if she was doing the right thing, if she had any right to involve Fiona and her family in a matter that looked more dangerous by the moment. Plenty of time to get a stiff neck from looking over her shoulder\u2014though if she was being followed, how would she know?</p><p>She\u2019d had to tell the kids where Roger was, as gently and briefly as possible. Mandy had put a thumb in her mouth and stared gravely at her, round-eyed. Jem . . . Jem hadn\u2019t said anything but had gone white under his freckles and looked as though he was about to throw up. She glanced in the rearview mirror. He was hunched in a corner of the backseat now, face turned to the window.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back, honey,\u201d she\u2019d said, trying to hug him in reassurance. He\u2019d let her but stood stiff in her arms, stricken.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he\u2019d said, his voice small and wooden as a puppet\u2019s. \u201cI should have got away sooner. Then Dad wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d she\u2019d said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Cameron\u2019s fault and no one else\u2019s. You were very brave. And Daddy will come back really soon.\u201d</p><p>Jem had swallowed hard but said nothing in reply. When she\u2019d let him go, he swayed for a moment, and Mandy had come up and hugged his legs.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019ll come back,\u201d she said encouragingly. \u201cFor supper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might take a little bit longer than that,\u201d Bree said, smiling in spite of the panic packed like a snowball under her ribs.</p><p>She drew a deep breath of relief as the highway opened out near the airport and she could go faster than 30 mph. Another wary glance in the mirror, but the road was empty behind her. She stepped on the gas.</p><p>Fiona was one of the only two people who knew. The other one was in Boston: her mother\u2019s oldest friend, Joe Abernathy. But she needed sanctuary for Jem and Mandy, right now. She couldn\u2019t stay with them at Lallybroch; the walls were two feet thick in places, yes, but it was a farm manor, not a fortified tower house, and hadn\u2019t been built with any notion that the inhabitants might need to repel invaders or stand off a siege.</p><p>Being in the city gave her a sense of relief. Having people around. Witnesses. Camouflage. Help. She pulled up in the street outside the Craigh na Dun Bed-and-Breakfast (three AA stars) with the sense of an exhausted swimmer crawling up onto shore.</p><p>The timing was good. It was early afternoon; Fiona would have finished the cleaning and it wouldn\u2019t yet be time to check in new guests or start the supper.</p><p>A little painted bell in the shape of a bluebell tinkled when they opened the door, and one of Fiona\u2019s daughters instantly popped an inquiring head out of the lounge.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Bree!\u201d she shouted, and at once the lobby was filled with children, as Fiona\u2019s three girls pushed one another out of the way to hug Bree, pick up Mandy, and tickle Jem, who promptly dropped to all fours and crawled under the bench where folk left their wraps.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014oh, it\u2019s you, hen!\u201d Fiona, coming out of the kitchen in a workmanlike canvas apron that said PIE QUEEN on the front, smiled with delight at sight of Bree and enveloped her in a floury hug.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Fiona murmured in her ear, under cover of the embrace. She drew back a bit, still holding Bree, and looked up at her, squinting in half-playful worry. \u201cRog playing away from home, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . could say that.\u201d Bree managed a smile but evidently not a very good one, because Fiona at once clapped her hands, bringing order out of the chaos in the lobby, and dispatched all the children to the upstairs lounge to watch telly. Jem, looking hunted, was coaxed out from under the bench and reluctantly followed the girls, looking back over his shoulder at his mother. She smiled and made shooing motions at him, then followed Fiona into the kitchen, glancing by reflex over her own shoulder.</p><p>THE TEAKETTLE SCREAMED, interrupting Brianna, but not before she\u2019d got to the most salient point of her story. Fiona warmed and filled the pot, purse-lipped with concentration.</p><p>\u201cYe say he took the rifle. Ye\u2019ve still got your shotgun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s under the front seat of my car at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Fiona nearly dropped the pot. Brianna shot out an arm and grabbed the handle, steadying it. Her hands were freezing, and the warm china felt wonderful.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t going to leave it in a house the bastards have a key to, now, was I?\u201d</p><p>Fiona set down the pot and crossed herself. \u201cDia eadarainn\u2019s an t-olc.\u201d God between us and evil. She sat, giving Brianna a sharp look. \u201cAnd ye\u2019re quite sure as it\u2019s bastards, plural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody am,\u201d Bree said tersely. \u201cEven if Rob Cameron managed to grow wings and fly out of my priest\u2019s hole\u2014let me tell you what happened to Jem at the dam.\u201d</p><p>She did, in a few brief sentences, by the end of which Fiona was glancing over her own shoulder at the closed kitchen door. She looked back at Bree, settling herself. In her early thirties, she was a pleasantly rounded young woman with a lovely face and the calm expression of a mother who normally has the Indian sign on her offspring, but at the moment she had a look that Brianna\u2019s own mother would have described as \u201cblood in her eye.\u201d She said something very bad in English regarding the man who\u2019d chased Jem.</p><p>\u201cSo, then,\u201d she said, picking up a paring knife from the nearby drainboard and examining the edge critically, \u201cwhat shall we do?\u201d</p><p>Bree drew a breath and sipped cautiously at the hot, milky tea. It was sweet, silky, and very comforting\u2014but not nearly as comforting as that \u201cwe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, first\u2014would you let Jem and Mandy stay here while I go do a few things? It might be overnight; I brought their pajamas, just in case.\u201d She nodded at the paper sack that she\u2019d set down on one of the chairs.</p><p>\u201cAye, of course.\u201d A small frown formed between Fiona\u2019s dark brows. \u201cWhat . . . sorts of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d Brianna began, intending to say, \u201cbetter if you don\u2019t know,\u201d but in fact someone had better know where she was going and what she was doing. Just in case she didn\u2019t come back. A little bubble of what might be either fear or anger rose up through the sense of warmth in her middle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to visit Jock MacLeod in hospital. He\u2019s the night watchman who found Jem at the dam. He might know the man who hit him and tried to take Jem. And he does know Rob Cameron. He can maybe tell me who Cameron\u2019s mates are outside of work or in lodge.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed a hand down over her face, thinking.</p><p>\u201cAfter that . . . I\u2019ll talk to Rob\u2019s sister and his nephew. If she\u2019s not involved in whatever he\u2019s up to, she\u2019ll be worried. And if she is involved\u2014then I need to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think ye\u2019ll be able to tell?\u201d Fiona\u2019s frown had eased a bit, but she still looked worried.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Brianna said, with grim determination. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to tell. For one thing, if someone I talk to is involved, they\u2019re probably likely to try to stop me asking questions.\u201d</p><p>Fiona made a small noise that could best be spelled as \u201ceeengh,\u201d indicating deep concern.</p><p>Brianna drank the last of her tea and set down the cup with an explosive sigh.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Lallybroch to meet a locksmith and have him change all the locks and install burglar alarms on the lower windows.\u201d She looked questioningly at Fiona. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it might take. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s why ye brought the kids\u2019 nighties. Nay problem, hen.\u201d She chewed her lower lip, eyeing Brianna.</p> <p>Bree knew what she was thinking, debating whether to ask or not, and saved her the trouble.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do about Roger,\u201d she said steadily.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come back, surely,\u201d Fiona began, but Bree shook her head. Horrifying Realization Number 3 couldn\u2019t be denied any longer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said, though she bit her lip as if to keep the words from escaping. \u201cHe\u2014he can\u2019t know that Jem isn\u2019t there. And he\u2019d never ab-abandon him.\u201d</p><p>Fiona was clasping Brianna\u2019s hand in both of her own.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course he wouldna do that. But if he and the other fellow go on searching and find no trace . . . eventually, surely he\u2019d think . . .\u201d Her voice died away as she tried to imagine what Roger might think under those circumstances.</p> <p>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll be thinking, all right,\u201d Bree said, and managed a small, shaky laugh. The thought of Roger\u2019s determination, the growing sense of fear and desperation that must inevitably eat away at it, his fight to keep going\u2014because he would; he\u2019d never give up and come back to tell her Jem was lost for good. For if he didn\u2019t find any trace of Jem, what could he think? That Cameron had maybe killed Jem, hidden his body, and gone to America in search of the gold? Or that they had both been lost in that horrifying space between one time and another, never to be found?</p><p>\u201cWell, and he\u2019ll be praying, too,\u201d Fiona said with a brisk squeeze of Bree\u2019s hand. \u201cI can help wi\u2019 that.\u201d</p><p>That made tears well, and she blinked hard, scrubbing at her eyes with a paper napkin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t cry now,\u201d she said, in a choked voice. \u201cI can\u2019t. I haven\u2019t got time.\u201d She stood up suddenly, pulling her hand free. She sniffed, blew her nose hard on the napkin, and sniffed again.</p><p>\u201cFiona . . . I\u2014I know you haven\u2019t told anybody about . . . us,\u201d she began, and even she could hear the doubt in her own voice.</p><p>Fiona snorted.</p><p>\u201cI have not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d be taken off to the booby hatch, and what would Ernie do wi\u2019 the girls and all? Why?\u201d she added, giving Brianna a hard look. \u201cWhat are ye thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . the women who\u2014who dance at Craigh na Dun. Do you think any of them know what it is?\u201d</p> <p>Fiona sucked in one cheek, thinking.</p><p>\u201cOne or two o\u2019 the older ones might have an idea,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been callin\u2019 down the sun on Beltane there for as far back as anyone knows. And some things do get passed down, ken. Be strange if nobody ever wondered. But even if someone kent for sure what happens there, they\u2019d not speak\u2014no more than I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I just wondered\u2014could you maybe find out, quietly, if any of the women have ties to Rob Cameron? Or maybe . . . to the Orkneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d Fiona\u2019s eyes went round. \u201cWhy the Orkneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Rob Cameron went on archaeological digs there. And I think that\u2019s what made him interested in stone circles to start with. I know one man named Callahan, a friend of Roger\u2019s\u2014who worked up there with him, and I\u2019ll talk to him, too\u2014maybe tomorrow; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have time today. But if there\u2019s anyone else who might be connected with things like that . . .\u201d It was more than a long shot, but at the moment she was inclined to look under any stone she could lift.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call round,\u201d Fiona said thoughtfully. \u201cAnd speak of calling\u2014telephone me if ye\u2019re not coming back tonight, aye? Just so as I know ye\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Bree nodded, her throat tight, and hugged Fiona, taking one more moment\u2019s strength from her friend.</p><p>Fiona saw her down the hall to the front door, pausing at the foot of the stair, and glanced toward the chatter coming from above. Did Bree want to say goodbye to Jem and Mandy? Wordless, Brianna shook her head. Her feelings were too raw; she couldn\u2019t hide them sufficiently and didn\u2019t want to scare the kids. Instead, she pressed her fingers to her lips and blew a kiss up the stairs, then turned to the door.</p><p>\u201cThat shotgun\u2014\u201d Fiona began behind her, and stopped. Brianna turned and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThey canna get ballistics off buckshot, can they?\u201d</p><p>AN GEARASDAN</p><p>THEY REACHED Fort William in early afternoon of the second day\u2019s travel.</p><p>\u201cHow large is the garrison?\u201d Roger asked, eyeing the stone walls of the fort. It was modest, as forts went, with only a few buildings and a drill yard within the surrounding walls.</p><p>\u201cMaybe forty men, I\u2019d say,\u201d Brian replied, turning sideways to allow a pair of red-coated guards carrying muskets to pass him in the narrow entry passage. \u201cFort Augustus is the only garrison north of it, and that\u2019s got maybe a hundred.\u201d</p><p>That was surprising\u2014or maybe not. If Roger was right about the date, it would be another three years before there was much talk of Jacobites in the Highlands\u2014let alone enough of it to alarm the English crown into sending troops en masse to keep a lid on the situation.</p><p>The fort was open, and any number of civilians appeared to have business with the army, judging from the small crowd near one building. Fraser steered him toward another, smaller one with a tilt of his head, though.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see the commander, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d A worm of curiosity tickled his spine. Surely it was too early for\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him the once. Buncombe, he\u2019s called. Seems a decent fellow, for a Sassenach.\u201d Fraser gave his name to a clerk in the outer room, and within a moment they were ushered into the commander\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cOh . . .\u201d A small, middle-aged man in uniform with tired eyes behind a pair of half spectacles half-rose, half-bowed, and dropped back into his seat as though the effort of recognition had exhausted him. \u201cBroch Tuarach. Your servant, sir.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it had, Roger thought. The man\u2019s face was gaunt and lined, and his breath whistled audibly in his lungs. Claire might have known specifically what was up with Captain Buncombe, but it didn\u2019t take a doctor to know that something was physically amiss.</p><p>Still, Buncombe listened civilly to his story, called in the clerk to make a careful note of Cameron\u2019s description and Jem\u2019s, and promised that these would be circulated to the garrison and that any patrols or messengers would be advised to ask after the fugitives.</p><p>Brian had thoughtfully brought along a couple of bottles in his saddlebags and now produced one, which he set on the desk with a gurgling thump of enticement.</p><p>\u201cWe thank ye, sir, for your help. If ye\u2019d allow us to present a small token of appreciation for your kindness . . .\u201d</p><p>A small but genuine smile appeared on Captain Buncombe\u2019s worn face.</p><p>\u201cI would, sir. But only if you gentlemen will join me . . . ? Ah, yes.\u201d Two worn pewter cups and\u2014after a brief search\u2014a crystal goblet with a chip out of the rim were produced, and the blessed silence of the dram fell upon the tiny office.</p><p>After a few moments\u2019 reverence, Buncombe opened his eyes and sighed.</p><p>\u201cAmazing, sir. Your own manufacture, is it?\u201d</p><p>Brian inclined his head with a modest shake.</p><p>\u201cNay but a few bottles at Hogmanay, just for the family.\u201d</p><p>Roger had himself seen the root cellar from which Brian had chosen the bottle, lined from floor to ceiling with small casks and with an atmosphere to it that would have knocked a moose flat had he stayed to breathe it long. But an instant\u2019s thought told him that it was probably wiser not to let a garrison full of soldiers know that you kept any sort of liquor in large quantities on your premises, no matter what terms you were on with their commander. He caught Brian\u2019s eye, and Fraser looked aside with a small \u201cmmphm\u201d and a tranquil smile.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d Buncombe repeated, and tipped another inch into his glass, offering the bottle round. Roger followed Brian\u2019s lead and refused, nursing his own drink while the other two men fell into a sort of conversation he recognized very well. Not friendly but courteous, a trade of information that might be of advantage to one or both\u2014and a careful avoidance of anything that might give the other too much advantage.</p><p>He\u2019d seen Jamie do it any number of times, in America. It was headman\u2019s talk, and there were rules to it. Of course . . . Jamie must have seen his da do it any number of times himself; it was bred in his bones.</p><p>He thought Jem maybe had it. He had something that made people look at him twice\u2014something beyond the hair, he amended, and smiled to himself.</p><p>While Buncombe occasionally directed a question to him, Roger was for the most part able to leave them to it, and he gradually relaxed. The rain had passed, and a beam of sun from the window rested on his shoulders, warming him from without as the whisky warmed him within. He felt for the first time that he might be accomplishing something in his search, rather than merely flailing desperately round the Highlands.</p><p>\u201cAnd they could maybe arrest the fellow,\u201d John Murray had remarked, anent the soldiers and Rob Cameron. A comforting thought, that.</p><p>The clan angle, though . . . he didn\u2019t think Cameron could have accomplices here, but\u2014he straightened in his chair. He had an accomplice from this time, didn\u2019t he? Buck had the gene, and while it was clearly less frequent to travel forward from one\u2019s original lifeline\u2014well, Roger thought it was less frequent (his own lack of knowledge was an unnerving realization in itself)\u2014Buck had done it. If Cameron was a traveler, he\u2019d got the gene from an ancestor who could also have done it.</p><p>Chill was running through his veins like iced wine, killing the whisky\u2019s warmth, and a sinister tangle of cold worms came writhing into his mind. Could it be a conspiracy, maybe, between Buck and Rob Cameron? Or Buck and some ancient Cameron from his own time?</p><p>He\u2019d never thought Buck was telling the whole truth about himself or his own journey through the stones. Could all this have been a plot to lure Roger away from Lallybroch\u2014away from Bree?</p><p>Now the worms were bloody eating his brain. He picked up his cup and threw back the rest of the whisky at a gulp to kill them. Buncombe and Fraser both glanced at him in surprise but then courteously resumed their conversation.</p><p>In the cold light of his present state of mind, something else now cast new shadows. Brian Fraser. While Roger had taken Fraser\u2019s bringing him to the garrison as purely a helpful gesture toward finding Jem, it had another function, didn\u2019t it? It displayed Roger to Captain Buncombe, in a context that made it clear that he had no claim of clan obligation or personal friendship on Fraser, just in case Roger turned out not to be what he said he was. And it allowed Fraser to see whether Buncombe recognized Roger or not. Just in case he wasn\u2019t what he said he was.</p><p>He took a deep breath and pressed his hands on the desktop, concentrating on the feel of the wood grain under his fingers. All right. Perfectly reasonable. How many times had he seen Jamie do the same sort of thing? For these men, the welfare of their own people always came first; they\u2019d protect Lallybroch, or Fraser\u2019s Ridge, above all, but that didn\u2019t mean they were unwilling to help when help was in their power to give.</p><p>And he did believe that Fraser meant to help him. He clung to the thought and found that it floated.</p><p>Fraser glanced at him again, and something in the man\u2019s face eased at whatever it saw in his own. Brian picked up the bottle and poured another inch into Roger\u2019s glass.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him, man,\u201d he said softly, in Gaelic, before turning to serve Captain Buncombe in turn.</p><p>He drank and put everything out of his mind, concentrating on the trivia of the conversation. It was all right. Everything was going to be all right.</p><p>He was still repeating this mantra to himself when he heard shouts and whistles from outside. He glanced toward the window, but it showed nothing save a view of the fort\u2019s wall. Captain Buncombe looked startled\u2014but Brian Fraser was on his feet, and moving fast.</p><p>Roger followed, emerging into the fort\u2019s drill yard to see a fine-looking young woman mounted on a large, fine-looking horse and glaring down at a small cluster of soldiers who had gathered round her stirrup, pushing one another, snatching at the reins, and shouting remarks up at her. The horse plainly didn\u2019t like it, but she was managing to keep it under control. She was also holding a switch in one hand and, from the look on her face, was plainly choosing a target amongst those presenting themselves.</p><p>\u201cJenny!\u201d Brian roared, and she looked up, startled. The soldiers were startled, too; they turned and, seeing Captain Buncombe come out behind the Scot, instantly melted away, heads down as they hurried off about their business. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger was at Brian\u2019s shoulder when he grabbed the horse\u2019s bridle.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of the Blessed Mother are you\u2014\u201d Brian began, furious, but she interrupted him, looking straight at Roger.</p><p>\u201cYour kinsman,\u201d she said. \u201cWilliam Buccleigh. He sent word to Lallybroch that he\u2019s taken bad and will ye come at once. They said he may not live.\u201d</p><p>IT TOOK A good day and a half to make the journey, even in good weather.

Fraser thumped on the door and shouted in Gaelic, though, identifying himself and saying that he\u2019d brought the sick man\u2019s kinsman to him, and presently the door swung open, framing a squat, bearded gentleman in shirt and nightcap, who peered at them for a long moment before stepping back with a gruff \u201cCome ben.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s first impression was that the house was crammed to the rafters with odorous humanity. These lay in small snuggled heaps on the floor near the hearth or on pallets by the far wall, and here and there tousled heads poked up like prairie dogs, blinking in the glow of the smoored fire to see what was to do.</p><p>Their host\u2014introduced by Fraser as Angus MacLaren\u2014nodded curtly to Roger and gestured toward a bedstead drawn into the center of the room. Two or three small children were sleeping on it, but Roger could just make out the blur of Buck\u2019s face on the pillow. Christ, he hoped Buck didn\u2019t have anything contagious.</p><p>He leaned in close, whispering, \u201cBuck?\u201d so as not to wake anyone who hadn\u2019t waked already. He couldn\u2019t make out much of Buck\u2019s face in the gloom\u2014and it was covered with beard stubble, as well\u2014but his eyes were closed, and he didn\u2019t open them in response to Roger\u2019s saying his name. Nor in response to Roger\u2019s laying a hand on his arm. The arm did feel warm, but given the suffocating atmosphere in the cottage, he thought it likely Buck would feel warm even if he\u2019d been dead for hours.</p> <p>He squeezed the arm, lightly at first, then harder\u2014and at last Buck gave a strangled cough and opened his eyes. He blinked slowly, not seeming to recognize Roger, then closed them again. His chest heaved visibly, though, and he breathed now with a slow, clearly audible gasping note.</p><p>\u201cHe says as there\u2019s something the matter wi\u2019 his heart,\u201d MacLaren told Roger, low-voiced. He was leaning over Roger\u2019s shoulder, watching Buck intently. \u201cIt flutters, like, and when it does, he goes blue and canna breathe or stand up. My second-eldest lad found him out in the heather yesterday afternoon, flat as a squashed toad. We fetched him down and gave him a bit to drink, and he asked would we send someone to Lallybroch to ask after his kinsman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoran taing,\u201d said Roger. \u201cI\u2019m that obliged to ye, sir.\u201d He turned to Brian, who was lurking behind MacLaren, looking at Buck with a small frown.</p><p>\u201cAnd thank ye, too, sir,\u201d Roger said to him. \u201cFor all your help. I can\u2019t thank ye enough.\u201d</p><p>Fraser shrugged, dismissing this.</p><p>\u201cI imagine ye\u2019ll stay with him? Aye. If he\u2019s able to travel in the morn, bring him along to Lallybroch. Or send, if there\u2019s aught we can do.\u201d Fraser nodded to MacLaren in farewell but then paused, squinting through the murk at Buck\u2019s face. He glanced at Roger, as though comparing their features.</p> <p>\u201cIs your kinsman from Lochalsh, as well?\u201d he asked, curious, and looked back at Buck. \u201cHe\u2019s the look of my late wife\u2019s people about him. The MacKenzies of Leoch.\u201d Then he noticed the small squat shape of what must be Mrs. MacLaren\u2014glowering under her cap\u2014and he coughed, bowed, and took his leave without waiting for an answer.</p><p>Mr. MacLaren went to bolt the door, and the lady of the house turned to Roger, yawned cavernously, then motioned toward the bed, scratching her bottom unself-consciously.</p><p>\u201cYe can sleep wi\u2019 him,\u201d she said. \u201cPush him oot the bed if he dies, aye? I dinna want ma quilts all spoilt.\u201d</p><p>HAVING TAKEN OFF his boots, Roger lay down gingerly on the quilt beside Buck\u2014readjusting the position of the small children, who were limp and flexible as cats in sunshine\u2014and spent the remainder of the night listening to his ancestor\u2019s irregular snoring, poking him whenever it seemed to stop. Toward dawn, though, he dozed off, to be waked sometime later by the thick warm smell of porridge.</p><p>Alarmed by the fact that he\u2019d fallen asleep, he raised up on one elbow to find Buck pale-faced and breathing stertorously through his mouth. He seized his ancestor by the shoulder and shook him, causing Buck to start up in bed, glaring wildly round. Spotting Roger, he punched him solidly in the stomach.</p><p>\u201cBugger off wi\u2019 that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to be sure you were alive, you bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye doing here in the first place?\u201d Buck rubbed a hand through his disheveled hair, looking cross and confused.</p> <p>\u201cYe sent for me, fool.\u201d Roger was cross, too. His mouth felt as though he\u2019d been chewing straw all night. \u201cHow are you, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014not that well.\u201d Buck\u2019s face changed abruptly from crossness to a pale apprehension, and he put a hand flat on his chest, pressing hard. \u201cI\u2014it\u2014it doesna feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie down, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Roger squirmed off the bed, narrowly avoiding stepping on a little girl who was sitting on the floor, playing with the buckles of his boots. \u201cI\u2019ll get ye some water.\u201d</p><p>A row of children was watching this byplay with interest, ignored by Mrs. MacLaren and two of the older girls, who were respectively stirring a huge cauldron of parritch and rapidly laying the large table for breakfast, slapping down wooden plates and spoons like cards in a game of old maid.</p><p>\u201cIf ye need the privy,\u201d one of the girls advised him, pausing in her rounds, \u201cye\u2019d best go now. Robbie and Sandy\u2019ve gone to tend the kine, and Stuart\u2019s no got his shoon on yet.\u201d She lifted her chin toward a stripling of twelve or so, who was crawling slowly about on hands and knees, with one worn shoe in one hand, peering under the sparse furniture in search of its mate. \u201cOh\u2014and since your kinsman\u2019s lived the night, Da\u2019s gone for the healer.\u201d</p><p>THE SCENT OF A STRANGER</p><p>SHE\u2019D BROUGHT Jock MacLeod the traditional hospital present of grapes. And a bottle of eighteen-year-old Bunnahabhain, which had brightened his face\u2014or what could be seen of it behind the bandage that wrapped his head and the bruising that narrowed both eyes to bloodshot slits.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m a bit peely-wally,\u201d he\u2019d told her, wrapping the bottle in his dressing gown and handing it to her to stash in his bedside cabinet, \u201cbut no bad, no bad. A wee dunt on the head, is all. I\u2019m only glad the lad got away. D\u2019ye ken how he came to be in the tunnel, lass?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d given him the official version, listened patiently to his speculations, and then asked if he\u2019d maybe recognized the man who hit him?</p><p>\u201cWell, I did, then,\u201d Jock had said, surprising her. He leaned back on his pillows. \u201cWhich is not to say as I know his name. But I\u2019ve seen him, aye, often. He skippers a boat on the canal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? A charter boat, or one of the Jacobite cruise boats?\u201d Her heart beat faster. The Caledonian Canal, he meant. It ran from Inverness to Fort William and carried a huge amount of water traffic, much of it visible from the road.</p><p>\u201cNice wee motor sailer\u2014must be a charter. I only noticed because my wife\u2019s cousin has one like it; we went out wi\u2019 him the once. Ten-meter, I think it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told the police, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, so.\u201d He tapped blunt fingers on the coverlet, glancing sideways at her. \u201cI described the man so well as I could\u2014but, ken, he didna really look unusual. I\u2019d know him again\u2014and maybe your wee lad would\u2014but I don\u2019t know as the polis would pick him out easy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d brought her Swiss Army knife out of her pocket as she talked, playing with it meditatively, flicking the blades open and shut. She opened the corkscrew, testing the sharp end of it with the ball of her thumb.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could maybe describe him to me? I draw a bit; I could make a stab at a picture.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her, eyes disappearing into the bruised flesh.</p><p>\u201cPour me a dram, lass, and we\u2019ll have a go.\u201d</p><p>BRIANNA REACHED Lallybroch again in the late afternoon, just in time for her four o\u2019clock appointment with the locksmith. A scrap of white tacked to the door fluttered in the autumn wind; she yanked it off and fumbled it open with chilled fingers.</p><p>Had an emergency call in Elgin; won\u2019t be back \u2019til late. Will call by in the morning. Apologies, Will Tranter</p><p>She crumpled the note and stuffed it into her jacket pocket, muttering under her breath. Bloody kidnapping ra**st bastards walking in and out of her house like it was the public highway and this wasn\u2019t an emergency?</p><p>She hesitated, fingers wrapped around the big antique key in her pocket, looking up at the white-harled front of the house. The sinking sun flashed in the upper windows, glazing them with red, hiding whatever might be behind them. They had a key. Did she really want to go in there alone?</p><p>She glanced round, self-conscious, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. The home fields lay tranquil, the small flock of sheep already bedding down in the setting sun. She breathed deeply, turning from side to side as she would when hunting with Da in the North Carolina forest, as though she might catch the tang of deer on the breeze.</p><p>What was she looking for now? Exhaust fumes. Rubber, hot metal, unlaid dust in the air, the ghost of a car. Or maybe something else, she thought, remembering the stink of Rob Cameron\u2019s sweat. The scent of a stranger.</p><p>But the cold air brought her only the smell of dead leaves, sheep shit, and a hint of turpentine from the Forestry Commission\u2019s pine plantation to the west.</p><p>Still. She\u2019d heard her father mention a feeling at the back of his neck when something was wrong, and she felt the hairs on her nape prickle now. She turned away, got back into her car, and drove off, glancing automatically behind her every few minutes. There was a petrol station a few miles up the road; she stopped there to call Fiona and say she\u2019d pick the kids up in the morning, then bought a few snacks and drove back, taking the farm track that circled the far edge of Lallybroch\u2019s land and led up into the pine plantation.</p><p>At this time of year, it got dark by 4:30 P.M. Up the hillside, the track was no more than a pair of muddy ruts, but she bumped carefully along until she came to one of the clearings where the foresters piled slash for burning. The air was rough with the smell of wood fire, and a big blackened patch of earth and ember still sent up wisps of smoke, but all the fires were out. She drove the car behind a heap of fresh-cut branches, piled ready for the next day, and cut the ignition.</p><p>As she came down out of the plantation, carrying the shotgun in one hand, something large shot past her head in total silence, and she stumbled, gasping. An owl; it disappeared, a pale blur in the dark. In spite of her pounding heart, she was glad to see it. White animals were harbingers of good luck in Celtic folklore; she could use any luck going.</p><p>\u201cOwls are keepers of the dead, but not just the dead. They\u2019re messengers between worlds.\u201d For an instant Roger was next to her, solid, warm in the cold night, and she put out a hand by impulse, as though to touch him.</p><p>Then he was gone and she was standing alone in the shadow of the pines, looking toward Lallybroch, the shotgun cold in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get you back, Roger,\u201d she whispered under her breath, and curled her left hand into a fist, clenching the copper ring with which he\u2019d married her. \u201cI will.\u201d But first she had to make sure the kids were safe.</p><p>Night rose up around the house and Lallybroch faded slowly out of sight, a paler blotch against the dark. She checked the safety on the gun and moved silently toward home.</p><p>SHE CAME UP the hill behind the broch, as quietly as she could. The wind had come up, and she doubted anyone would hear her steps over the rustling of the gorse and dry broom that grew thick back here.</p><p>If they were waiting for her, wanting to do harm, surely they\u2019d be in the house. But if they just wanted to know where she was . . . they might be watching the house instead, and this was the place to do it from. She paused by the wall of the broch and put a hand on the stones, listening. Faint rustling, punctuated by an occasional dovish coo. The bats would have gone out long since, hunting, but the doves were abed.</p><p>Pressing her back against the stones, she sidled around the broch, pausing near the door, and reached out a hand, groping for the latch. The padlock was cold in her hand; intact and locked. Letting out her breath, she fumbled the bunch of keys out of her pocket and found the right one by touch.</p><p>The sleeping doves erupted in a mad flutter when the wind from the open door whooshed up to the rafters where they roosted, and she stepped hastily back against the wall, out of the way of a pattering rain of panicked incontinence. The doves calmed in a moment, though, and settled down again in a murmurous rustle of indignation at the disturbance.</p><p>The upper floors had long since fallen in and the timbers cleared away; the broch was a shell, but a sturdy shell, its outer stones repaired over the years. The stair was built into the wall itself, the stone steps leading up between the inner and outer walls, and she broke the gun over her shoulder and went up slowly, feeling her way one-handed. There was a torch in her pocket but no need to risk using it.</p><p>A third of the way up, she took up station by a window slit that commanded a view of the house below. It was cold sitting on the stones, but her jacket was down-filled and she wouldn\u2019t freeze. She pulled a bar of Violet Crumble from her pocket and settled down to wait. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d called the Hydro Board and asked for a week\u2019s leave in order to deal with a family emergency. News of what had happened at the Loch Errochty dam last night had spread, so there\u2019d been no difficulty, save in deflecting the flood of sympathetic exclamations and curious questions\u2014all of which she\u2019d claimed not to be able to answer, owing to the ongoing police inquiry.</p><p>The police . . . they might be of help. Jock had told them about the man at the dam; they\u2019d be following that up. She\u2019d had to tell them about Rob Cameron. And, with some reluctance, she\u2019d told them about his coming into the house and threatening her, since Mandy would likely blow the gaff about that. She told them about his open disgruntlement over having a woman supervisor and his harassing her at work\u2014though that seemed like a paltry motive for kidnapping a child. She hadn\u2019t mentioned most of the physical stuff, the priest\u2019s hole, or Cameron\u2019s assisted escape, though. Just said she\u2019d hit him\u2014first with the letter box, and then with the cricket bat\u2014and he\u2019d run away. She\u2019d gone with Mandy to find Jem, that being obviously more urgent than calling the police. The police didn\u2019t agree with that assessment, but they were British and thus polite about their disapproval.</p><p>She\u2019d said Cameron had told her where Jem was. If the police found him, he wasn\u2019t going to be in any position to contradict her. She did hope they picked him up. It might cause complications, but she\u2019d feel safer if he wasn\u2019t wandering around loose. With her rifle. Possibly lurking in her house.</p><p>Her hand curled up in the deep pocket of her jacket, fingering the comforting shapes of a dozen shotgun shells.</p> <p>COGNOSCO TE</p><p>THE HEALER ARRIVED in midafternoon. He was a short man but not slight; he looked like an amateur wrestler, with shoulders nearly as broad as Roger\u2019s own. He didn\u2019t introduce himself but nodded politely to Mrs. MacLaren, his eyes flicking round the room in a brief, all-encompassing glance, then focused on Buck, who had fallen into an uneasy sleep and did not wake even to the disturbance caused by the healer\u2019s entrance.</p><p>\u201cHe says his heart\u2014\u201d Roger began awkwardly. The man glanced sharply sideways at him, then flicked a hand in dismissal and, walking over, peered closely at Buck for a moment. All the MacLarens waited in breathless silence, clearly expecting something spectacular.</p><p>The man nodded to himself, removed his coat, and turned back his shirtsleeves, displaying sun-browned forearms corded with muscle.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said, sitting down by the bed and laying a hand on Buck\u2019s chest. \u201cLet me\u2014\u201d His face went quite blank and he stiffened, his hand jerking back as though he\u2019d received an electric shock. He gave a quick, hard shake of the head and pulled Buck\u2019s shirt open, plunging both hands into the opening and laying them flat on Buck\u2019s laboring chest.</p> <p>\u201cJesu,\u201d he whispered. \u201cCognosco te!\u201d</p><p>Quite suddenly the hairs on Roger\u2019s body lifted, prickling as though a thunderstorm was coming. The man had spoken in Latin, and what he had said was, \u201cI know you!\u201d</p><p>THE MACLARENS ALL watched the healer work, with great respect and not a little awe. Roger, who had learned a good bit about the psychology of healing from Claire, was just as impressed. And, to be frank, scared shitless.</p><p>The healer had stood motionless for a long moment, hands on Buck\u2019s chest, his head thrown back and eyes closed, his face contorted in an expression of the deepest concentration, as though listening to something far, far off. He had murmured what Roger recognized as the Pater Noster\u2014from the looks on the faces of the MacLarens, it might as well have been the Abracadabra. Then, keeping his hands in place, he had raised one thick forefinger and begun to tap, delicately, in a slow, regular rhythm, his finger rebounding each time as though he were striking a piano key.</p><p>Thup . . . thup . . . thup. It went on for a long time, so long that everyone in the room began to draw breath again\u2014even Buck, whose labored gasping began to ease, his lungs filling naturally again. Then it was two fingers, Thup-tup . . . thup-tup . . . thup-tup. Slow. Regular as a metronome. On and on and on and on . . . Soothing. Hypnotic. And Roger realized that the rhythm was that of a beating heart\u2014his own heart. Looking round the room at the wide eyes and slightly open mouths of the adenoidal MacLaren clan, he had the most peculiar sense that all their hearts were beating to precisely the same rhythm.</p><p>He knew they were breathing as one; he could hear the susurrus of indrawn breath and the sea-foam rush of exhalation. He knew it\u2014and was helpless to change his own rhythm, to resist the sense of unity that had formed insensibly among all the people in the cabin, from Angus MacLaren down to little Josephine, round-eyed as the rest in her mother\u2019s arms.</p> <p>All of them were breathing, hearts beating as one\u2014and somehow they were supporting the stricken man, holding him as part of a larger entity, embracing him, bracing him. Buck\u2019s injured heart lay in the palm of Roger\u2019s hand: he realized it quite suddenly and, just as suddenly, realized that it had been there for some time, resting as naturally in the curve of his palm as rounded river rock, smooth and heavy. And . . . beating, in time with the heart in Roger\u2019s chest. What was much stranger was that none of this felt in any way out of the ordinary.</p><p>Odd\u2014and impressive\u2014as it was, Roger could have explained this. Mass suggestion, hypnosis, will and willingness. He\u2019d done much the same thing himself any number of times, singing\u2014when the music caught the audience up with him, when he knew they were with him, would follow him anywhere. He\u2019d done it once or twice, preaching; felt the people warm to him and lift him up as he lifted them. It was impressive to see it done so quickly and thoroughly without any sort of warm-up, though\u2014and much more disquieting to feel the effects in his own flesh. What was scaring him, though, was that the healer\u2019s hands were blue.</p><p>No doubt about it. It wasn\u2019t a trick of the light\u2014there wasn\u2019t any to speak of, bar the dull glow of the smoored fire. It wasn\u2019t a huge thing; no fiery coruscations or neon. But a soft blue tinge had come up between the healer\u2019s fingers, crept over the backs of his hands\u2014and now spread in a faint haze around his hands, seeming to penetrate Buck\u2019s chest.</p><p>Roger glanced to one side, then the other, without moving his head. The MacLarens were paying rapt attention but showed no sign of seeing anything startling. They don\u2019t see it. The hairs on his forearms lifted silently. Why do I see it?</p><p>Thup-tup . . . thup-tup . . . thup-tup . . . Tireless, regular\u2014and yet Roger became aware of some subtle change. Not in the healer\u2019s rhythm\u2014that didn\u2019t vary at all. But something had shifted. He glanced down involuntarily into his palm, where he still imagined that Buck\u2019s heart lay, and was now scarcely surprised to see it there, a ghostly round object, transparent but pulsing gently, regularly. On its own.</p><p>Thup-tup . . . . . . thup-tup . . . . . . thup-tup. The healer now was following, not leading. Not slowing the beats but pausing for a longer period between them, letting Buck\u2019s heart beat alone between them.</p><p>At last, the faint sound stopped, and there was silence in the room for the length of three heartbeats. And then the silence popped like a soap bubble, leaving the onlookers blinking and shaking their heads, as those awakened from dreaming. Roger closed his empty hand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d the healer said to Mrs. MacLaren, in a matter-of-fact manner. \u201cLet him sleep as long as he can, give him something to eat when he wakes up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuch obliged, sir,\u201d Mrs. MacLaren murmured. She patted Josephine, who had fallen asleep with her mouth open, a glimmering trail of saliva falling from the corner of her mouth to her mother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWill I make up a pallet for ye by the fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no,\u201d the healer said, smiling. He shrugged back into his coat, put on his cloak, and reached for his hat. \u201cI\u2019m staying no great distance away.\u201d</p><p>He went out, and Roger waited for a moment, just long enough for people to turn back to their own conversations, and then followed, shutting the door quietly behind him.</p><p>THE HEALER WAS a little way down the road; Roger saw the man\u2019s dark figure kneeling in prayer before a tiny shrine, the ends of his cloak fluttering in the wind. Roger came up to him slowly, hanging back so as not to disturb his devotions\u2014and, on impulse, bowed his own head toward the small statue, so weathered as to be faceless. Take care of them, please, he prayed. Help me get back to them\u2014to Bree. That was all he had time for, before the healer rose to his feet\u2014but that was all he had to say, in any case.</p><p>The healer hadn\u2019t heard him; he rose and turned, surprised at seeing Roger but recognizing him at once. He smiled, a little wearily, clearly expecting some medical question of a private nature.</p><p>Heart thumping, Roger reached out and grasped the healer\u2019s hand. The man\u2019s eyes widened with shock.</p><p>\u201cCognosco te,\u201d Roger said, very softly. I know you.</p><p>\u201cWHO ARE YE, then?\u201d Dr. Hector McEwan stood squinting against the wind, his face wary but excited. \u201cThe two of ye\u2014who are ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think ye maybe ken that better than I do,\u201d Roger told him. \u201cThat\u2014the light in your hands . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could see it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question, and the wary excitement in McEwan\u2019s eyes blazed into life, visible even in the dimming light.</p><p>\u201cAye, I could. Where did ye . . .\u201d Roger groped for the best way to ask, but, after all, how many ways were there? \u201cWhen did ye come from?\u201d</p><p>McEwan glanced involuntarily over his shoulder toward the croft, but the door was shut, smoke pouring from the hole in the roof. It was beginning to rain, a premonitory pattering among the mounded heather near the path. He moved abruptly, taking Roger\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cWe canna be standing out here, dreich as it is; we\u2019ll catch our deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreich\u201d was the word; the rain set to in good earnest and Roger was half soaked in minutes, having come out without hat or cloak. McEwan led the way quickly up a winding path through thickets of dark gorse, emerging onto a stretch of moorland where the remains of a tumbledown croft offered some shelter. The rooftree had been burned, and recently; the smell still lingered. A corner of thatch remained, though, and they huddled inside, close beneath its scanty protection.</p><p>\u201cAnno Domini eighteen hundred and forty-one,\u201d McEwan said matter-of-factly, shaking rain from his cloak. He looked up at Roger, one thick brow raised.</p><p>\u201cNineteen hundred and eighty,\u201d Roger replied, heart hammering. He cleared his throat and repeated the date; the cold had affected his throat, and the words emerged in a strangled croak. McEwan leaned close at the sound, peering at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d the man asked sharply. \u201cYour voice\u2014it\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s noth\u2014\u201d Roger began, but the healer\u2019s fingers were already groping behind his head, undoing his neckcloth in nothing flat. He closed his eyes, not resisting.</p><p>McEwan\u2019s broad fingers were cold on his neck; he felt the icy touch delicate on his skin as it traced the line of the rope scar, then firmer as the healer prodded gently round his damaged larynx\u2014it gave him an involuntary choking sensation, and he coughed. McEwan looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, cough?\u201d Roger said, hoarse as a crow.</p><p>\u201cAye, that.\u201d McEwan fitted his hand snugly round Roger\u2019s neck, just under the chin, and nodded. \u201cOnce, then wait, then do it again.\u201d Roger hacked obligingly, feeling a slight pain with each expulsion of breath where the healer\u2019s hand pressed. The man\u2019s face brightened with interest, and he removed his hand.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what a hyoid bone is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had to guess, it\u2019s something in the throat.\u201d Roger cleared his throat hard and rubbed at it, feeling the roughness of the scar under his palm. \u201cWhy?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure whether to be offended at the personal intrusion or\u2014something else. His skin tingled slightly where McEwan had touched it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just there,\u201d the healer said, pressing with his thumb, high up under Roger\u2019s chin. \u201cAnd if it had been here\u201d\u2014he moved the thumb down an inch\u2014\u201cyou\u2019d have been dead, sir. It\u2019s a fragile wee bone. Easy to strangle someone by breaking it\u2014with your thumbs or a rope.\u201d He drew back a little, eyes intent on Roger\u2019s; the curiosity was still plain on his face, but the wariness had returned. \u201cAre you and your friend fleeing from . . . something? Someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Roger felt at once very tired, the strain of everything catching up to him, and looked round for something to sit on. There was nothing but a few dark chunks of rock that had fallen from the cottage\u2019s wall when the burning thatch had been pulled down. He pushed two blocks together and sat on one, knees up round his ears. \u201cI\u2014this\u2014\u201d He touched his throat briefly. \u201cIt was a long time ago, nothing to do with what we\u2014we\u2014we\u2019re looking for my son. He\u2019s only nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dearie me.\u201d McEwan\u2019s broad face creased in sympathy. \u201cHow\u2014\u201d</p><p>Roger lifted a hand. \u201cYou first,\u201d he said, and cleared his throat again. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ye everything I know, but . . . you first. Please.\u201d</p><p>McEwan pursed his lips and glanced aside, thinking, but then shrugged and lowered himself, grunting, to his own rude seat.</p><p>\u201cI was a doctor,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cIn Edinburgh. I came up to the Highlands to shoot grouse with a friend. Do folk still do that, a hundred years hence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Grouse are still tasty,\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cIt was at Craigh na Dun that ye came through, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d McEwan halted abruptly, realizing what that question implied. \u201cDear Lord in heaven, do ye mean to be telling me there are other places? Where . . . it happens?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d The hairs rippled on Roger\u2019s arms. \u201cFour that I know of; likely there are others. How many stone circles are there in the British Isles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d McEwan was clearly shaken. He got up and went to the doorway, the jamb of it scorched and the lintel burned almost away. Roger hoped none of the stones above it would fall on the man\u2019s head\u2014at least not until he found out more.</p><p>Dr. McEwan stayed for a long time, staring out into the rain, which had gone the silvery gray of cat\u2019s fur. Finally he shook himself and came back, mouth set in firm decision.</p><p>\u201cAye, nothing to be gained from secrecy. And I hope nothing to be lost by honesty.\u201d This last was not quite a question, but Roger nodded and tried to look earnest.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then. Grouse, as I say. We were on the moor, just below that hill where the standing stones are. All of a sudden a fox shot out of the bracken, right by my foot, and one of the dogs lost his head and chased it. Brewer\u2014that was my friend, Joseph Brewer\u2014started after it, but he has\u2014he had,\u201d McEwan corrected, with an expression of mild irritation that made Roger want to smile, because he was so familiar with the feeling that dealing with the phenomenon caused, \u201ca clubfoot. He managed all right with a special boot, but climbing and chasing . . .\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo you went after the dog, and . . .\u201d Roger shuddered involuntarily at the memory, and so did McEwan.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the dog . . . go?\u201d Roger asked suddenly. McEwan looked surprised and vaguely affronted.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? It didn\u2019t turn up where I did, I can tell ye that much.\u201d</p> <p>Roger made a brief gesture of apology.</p><p>\u201cJust curious. We\u2014my wife and I\u2014we\u2019ve been trying to puzzle out as much as we can, for the sake of the children.\u201d \u201cChildren\u201d caught in his throat, coming out in no more than a whisper, and McEwan\u2019s expression softened.</p><p>\u201cAye, of course. Your son, you said?\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded and managed to explain what he could, about Cameron, the letters . . . and, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, about the Spaniard\u2019s gold, for, after all, he\u2019d have to give a reason for Cameron\u2019s taking Jem in the first place, and his sense of Dr. McEwan was one of solid kindness.</p><p>\u201cDearie me,\u201d the doctor murmured, shaking his head in dismay. \u201cI\u2019ll ask among my patients. Perhaps someone . . .\u201d He trailed off, his face still troubled. Roger had the distinct impression that the sense of trouble wasn\u2019t all down to Jem, or even to the staggering discovery that there were other\u2014</p><p>He stopped, seeing plainly in his mind\u2019s eye the soft blue glow surrounding McEwan\u2019s fingers\u2014and the look of surprised delight on his face. Cognosco te. I know you. Delight, not just shock. He and Buck weren\u2019t the first time travelers this man had known. But the doctor hadn\u2019t said as much. Why not?</p> <p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Roger asked, curious.</p><p>McEwan sighed and rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe too long,\u201d he said, but then pushed that away, straightening up. \u201cTwo years, about. Speaking of too long, though . . .\u201d He straightened, pulling the cloak over his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019ll be dark in less than an hour. I\u2019ll need to go, if I\u2019m to reach Cranesmuir by nightfall. I\u2019ll come again tomorrow to tend your friend. We can talk a bit more then.\u201d</p><p>He turned abruptly, but just as suddenly turned back and, reaching out, took Roger\u2019s throat in his hand.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said, as though to himself. \u201cJust maybe.\u201d Then he nodded once, let go, and was gone, his cloak fluttering like bat wings behind him.</p><p>THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST</p><p>AFTER FRAGGLE ROCK, the telly went to the evening news, and Ginger reached to turn it off but stopped abruptly as Jem\u2019s last year\u2019s school picture flashed on the screen. She stared at the television, mouth half open, then looked incredulously at Jem.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you!\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cKen that fine,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cTurn it off, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to see.\u201d She blocked him as he lunged for the screen; Ginger was eleven and bigger than him.</p><p>\u201cTurn it off!\u201d he said, then, with cunning inspiration, \u201cIt\u2019ll scare Mandy and she\u2019ll howl.\u201d</p><p>Ginger shot Mandy a quick glance\u2014she had good lungs, did Mandy\u2014then reluctantly turned the TV off.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d she said, and lowered her voice. \u201cMam told us what happened, but she said we weren\u2019t to trouble ye about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jem said. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d His heart was hammering and he felt sweaty, but his hands were going cold and hot and cold again.</p><p>He\u2019d got away by the skin of his teeth, diving under the bushes planted at the top of the spillway and crawling down the concrete edging \u2019til he found a ladderway that went down into the water. He\u2019d shoggled down it as far as he could and clung on so hard his hands went numb, with the black water rumbling inches under his feet and surging down the spillway past him, drenching him with cold spray. He could still feel his bones shake with it.</p><p>He believed he might throw up if he thought about it anymore, so he turned away and went to look into the wee girls\u2019 toy chest. It was full of girlie toys, of course, but maybe if they had a ball . . . They did. It was pink but one of the good high-bouncy kind.</p><p>\u201cWe could go out to the garden, maybe, and have a bit o\u2019 catch?\u201d he suggested, bouncing the ball on the floor and catching it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dark and rainin\u2019 like the clappers,\u201d Tisha said. \u201cDinna want to get wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch, it\u2019s no but a saft drizzle! What are ye, made of sugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Sheena, with a simper. \u201cSugar and spice \u2019n everything nice, that\u2019s what little girls are made of. Snips and snails and puppy-dog tails\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome play dollies,\u201d suggested Tisha, waggling a naked doll invitingly at him. \u201cYe can have GI Joe if ye want. Or would ye rather Ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019m no playin\u2019 dollies,\u201d Jem said firmly. \u201cCanna be doing wi\u2019 the clothes and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI play dollies!\u201d Mandy muscled her way between Tisha and Sheena, eager hands stretched out for a Barbie in a pink frilly ball gown. Sheena grabbed it away just in time.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye,\u201d she soothed Mandy\u2019s impending screech, \u201cyou can play, sure. Ye have to play nice, though; ye dinna want to spoil her dress. Here, sit down, pet, I\u2019ll give ye this one. See her wee comb and brush? Ye can fix her hair.\u201d</p><p>Jem took the ball and left. The upstairs hall had carpet, but the landing was bare wood. He popped the ball off it and it shot up and hit the ceiling with a smack, just missing the hanging light fixture. It bounced off the floor and he caught it before it could get away, clutching it to his chest.</p><p>He listened for a second, to be sure Mrs. Buchan hadn\u2019t heard. She was back in the kitchen, though; he could hear the sound of her singing along to the radio.</p><p>He was halfway down the stairs when the bell over the front door went, and he looked over the banister to see who it was coming in. Who it was was Rob Cameron, and Jem nearly swallowed his tongue.</p><p>JEM PRESSED himself back against the wall of the landing, his heart pounding so loud he could barely hear Mrs. Buchan come out of the kitchen.</p><p>Should he go get Mandy? There wasn\u2019t any way out of the house but by the stairs; he couldn\u2019t drop Mandy out the lounge window, there wasn\u2019t a tree or anything . . .</p><p>Mrs. Buchan was saying hello and she was sorry if the gentleman was wanting a room, because she was booked full every day this week. Mr. Cameron was being polite, saying, no, thank ye kindly, he was only wondering might he have a wee word . . .</p><p>\u201cIf ye\u2019re selling anything\u2014\u201d she started, and he interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cNo, missus, nothing like that. It\u2019s a few questions I have about the stones at Craigh na Dun.\u201d</p><p>Jem was gasping for air. His lungs were heaving, but he\u2019d pressed a hand over his mouth so Mr. Cameron wouldn\u2019t hear. Mrs. Buchan didn\u2019t gasp, but he could hear her take breath, then stop, deciding what to say.</p><p>\u201cStones?\u201d she said, and even he could tell she was faking puzzlement. \u201cI dinna ken anything about stones.\u201d</p><p>Rob made a polite laugh.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, missus. I should have introduced myself, first. My name\u2019s Rob Cameron\u2014and\u2014is something wrong, missus?\u201d She\u2019d not only gasped really loud, Jem thought she must have stepped back without looking and hit the wee table in the hall, because there was a thump and an \u201cAch!\u201d and the splat of picture frames falling over.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mrs. Buchan said, getting ahold of herself. \u201cNo. Had a wee turn, that\u2019s all\u2014I\u2019ve the high blood pressure, ken. Get that wee bit dizzy. Your name\u2019s Cameron, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Rob Cameron. I\u2019m cousin by marriage to Becky Wemyss. She told me a bit about the dancing up at the stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That \u201coh\u201d meant trouble for Becky Wemyss, thought Jem, who knew a lot about mothers\u2019 voices.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit of a scholar of the auld ways, see. I\u2019m writing a wee book . . . Anyway, I wondered if I could maybe talk to you for a few minutes. Becky said ye\u2019d know more about the stones and the dancing than anybody else.\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s breathing slowed down, once he realized that Mr. Cameron hadn\u2019t come because Mr. Cameron knew Mandy and he were here. Or maybe he did and was trying it on with Mrs. Buchan \u2019til he could make an excuse to use the loo and come poke round in search of them? He looked apprehensively up the half flight of stairs that led from the landing, but the lounge door above was closed, and while he could hear Mandy\u2019s giggling fine through it, probably Mr. Cameron couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Mrs. Buchan was taking Mr. Cameron back to the kitchen. Her voice when she\u2019d said, \u201cCome ben. I\u2019ll tell ye what I can,\u201d hadn\u2019t sounded at all friendly. Jem wondered whether she might be going to put rat poison in Mr. Cameron\u2019s tea.</p><p>Maybe Mrs. Buchan didn\u2019t have any rat poison, though. He took a step one way, then the other, then back. He really, really wanted to run down the stairs and out the door and keep going. But he couldn\u2019t leave Mandy.</p><p>His havering stopped at once when the kitchen door opened, but he could hear it was Mrs. Buchan\u2019s step, and just hers, coming fast and light.</p><p>She turned up the stairs but started back when she saw him on the landing, a hand to her chest. Then she ran up to him and hugged him tight, whispering in his ear.</p><p>\u201cBloody heck, lad. What\u2019re you\u2014well, never mind, I was coming to find you. Ye saw him?\u201d</p><p>Jem nodded, wordless, and Mrs. Buchan\u2019s mouth pressed flat.</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019m going to take ye out the door. Go left out the gate. Two houses down is Mrs. Kelleher. Knock and tell her I sent ye to use the phone. Ye call the polis and tell them the man that kidnapped you is here\u2014ye ken the address here?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He\u2019d seen the number when he visited before with Mam and Dad and remembered it because it was 669; Dad had said it should by rights be 666, but that was the number of the beast. Jem had asked whether it was Mr. or Mrs. Buchan that was the beast, and Mam and Dad both laughed like loons.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Mrs. Buchan, letting go of him. \u201cCome on, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandy\u2014\u201d he started, but she shushed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll mind her. Come!\u201d</p><p>He ran down the stairs after her, trying not to make any noise, and, at the door, she stood on her toes and held the little bell so it wouldn\u2019t ring.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He ran.</p><p>MRS. KELLEHER WAS an old lady and kind of deaf. Jem was out of breath and so scared that he couldn\u2019t put his words together right, so it was a long time before she took him to the telephone, and then the lady at the police station put the phone down on him twice, because she thought he was some bampot wean who\u2019d got hold of the phone and was playing tricks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jeremiah MacKenzie!\u201d he bellowed, next time she answered. \u201cI was kidnapped!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe were?\u201d said Mrs. Kelleher, very startled. She grabbed the phone away from him. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d she demanded of it. Faint squawking\u2014at least the police lady hadn\u2019t hung up again. Mrs. Kelleher turned and squinted through her spectacles at him.</p><p>\u201cWho was it ye were wanting to call, lad? Ye\u2019ve got the polis by mistake.\u201d</p><p>He really wanted to hit something, but he couldn\u2019t hit Mrs. Kelleher. He said something very bad in Gaelic, and her mouth fell open. She\u2019d let the phone fall away from her ear, though, and he grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cThe man that kidnapped me is here,\u201d he said, as slow as he could. \u201cI need somebody to come! Before\u2014\u201d Inspiration struck. \u201cBefore he hurts my little sister! It\u2019s 669 Glenurquhart Road. Come right away!\u201d Then he put the phone down, before the lady could ask him questions.</p><p>Mrs. Kelleher had plenty of those, and he didn\u2019t want to be rude, so he asked could he use the loo and locked the door against her, then hung out the upstairs window, watching for the police.</p><p>Nothing happened for what seemed forever. The raindrops started to drip off his hair and eyelashes, but he was afraid of missing anything. He was rubbing the water out of his eyes when all of a sudden the door of 669 flew open and Rob Cameron came running out, jumped in a car, and drove off with the tires squealing.</p><p>Jem almost fell out the window but then rushed back and barreled out of the bathroom, nearly knocking Mrs. Kelleher over.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Kelleher!\u201d he yelled over his shoulder, taking the stairs three at a time, and shot out the front door.</p><p>There was a lot of screaming and crying going on inside the Buchans\u2019 house, and he felt his chest go so tight he couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cMandy!\u201d He tried to call, but her name came out in a whisper. The front door was hanging open. Inside, there were girls everywhere, but he picked Mandy out of the muddle in the lounge instantly and ran to grab her. She wasn\u2019t crying, but she latched on to him like a leech, burying her black curly head in his stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he told her, squeezing the stuffing out of her in relief. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Man. I gotcha. I gotcha.\u201d</p><p>His heart started to slow down a little, and he saw that Mrs. Buchan was sitting on the sofa, holding a towel full of ice cubes to her face. Some of the ice had fallen out and was lying on the rug at her feet. Tisha and Sheena were holding on to their mother and crying, and Ginger was trying to pat her mam\u2019s hair and comfort her sisters at the same time, but her face was dead white and tears were running silently down it.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Buchan . . . are ye all right?\u201d Jem asked timidly. He had an awful feeling in the bottom of his stomach. Somehow, he was sure this was his fault.</p><p>Mrs. Buchan looked up at him. One side of her face was puffy and the eye on that side was swollen half shut, but the other one had fire in it, and that made him feel a little better.</p> <p>\u201cAye, fine, Jem,\u201d she said. \u201cDinna fash, girls! It\u2019s well enough; no but a black eye. Quit your caterwauling, will ye? I canna hear myself think.\u201d She gave a small, good-natured shake to detach the clinging girls, pushing and patting at them with her free hand. Then there was a knock on the doorjamb, and a man\u2019s voice from the front hall.</p><p>\u201cPolice, here! Anyone to home?\u201d</p><p>Jem could have told Mrs. Buchan what happened once you called the police. Questions, and questions, and more questions. And if there were things you couldn\u2019t tell the police . . . At least Mrs. Buchan wouldn\u2019t let them take Jem or her to the police station to answer questions, insisting that she couldn\u2019t leave the girls on their own. By the time the police gave up, Mandy and Sheena were both asleep on the couch, curled up together like a pair of kittens, and Ginger and Tisha had made everyone tea, then sat yawning in the corner together, blinking now and then to keep awake.</p><p>A few minutes after the police left, Mr. Buchan came home for his supper, and all the explaining was to do all over again. There really wasn\u2019t much to it: Mrs. Buchan had sat Mr. Cameron down in the kitchen and told him a bit about the dancing\u2014it wasn\u2019t secret, most folk who\u2019d lived in Inverness for a long time knew about it\u2014but she\u2019d left the radio playing while they were talking, and all of a sudden the newscaster was saying the name \u201cRobert Cameron\u201d and how Robert Cameron was wanted for questioning in the kidnapping of a local boy, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd then the wee bastard jumps up, and so do I, and he must have thought I meant to stop him\u2014I was betwixt him and the door, anyroad\u2014and he belts me one in the eye, pushes me into the wall, and he\u2019s away off!\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Buchan was giving Jem a hard look now and then and seemed like he wanted to start asking questions, but instead he said they\u2019d all go into the town and have a fish supper as it was so late, and everyone started feeling better at once. Jem could see the looks going back and forth between the Buchans, though, and he kind of wondered whether Mr. Buchan maybe meant to drop him and Mandy off at the police station on the way back. Or maybe just leave them by the side of the road.</p><p>THE GHOST OF A HANGIT MAN</p><p>THE HEAVENS OPENED, and Roger was soaked to the skin by the time he got back to the MacLarens\u2019 cottage. Amid cries of dismay from Mrs. MacLaren and her ancient mother, he was hastily stripped, wrapped up snug in a ragged quilt, and stood to steam before the fire, where his presence greatly impeded the preparations for supper. Buck, propped up on pillows with the two smallest MacLarens curled up in sleep on the bed beside him, lifted a brow at Roger in inquiry.</p><p>Roger moved his hand slightly, in a tell-you-later gesture. He thought Buck looked better; there was color in his face, and he was sitting upright, not slumped into the bedding. For a brief instant, Roger wondered what would happen if he were to lay his own hand on Buck. Would it glow blue?</p><p>The thought sent a shiver through him, and Allie, one of the MacLaren daughters, pushed the trailing edge of his quilt away from the fire with a squeak of alarm.</p><p>\u201cTake care, sir, do!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, do,\u201d said Grannie Wallace, pulling the blackened iron spider\u2014this spitting hot grease\u2014well away from his bare legs and making shooing motions. \u201cTake a spark, and ye\u2019ll go up like tinder.\u201d She was blind in one eye, but the other was sharp as a needle and gave him a piercing look. \u201cTall as ye are, ye\u2019d likely set the rooftree afire, and then where should we all be, I\u2019d like tae know!\u201d</p><p>There was a general titter at that, but he thought the laughter had an uneasy note to it and wondered why.</p><p>\u201cMoran taing,\u201d Roger said in polite thanks for the advice. He moved a foot or so farther from the hearth, fetching up against the settle on which Mr. Angus MacLaren was sitting, mending his pipe stem. \u201cSince ye speak of rooftrees\u2014there\u2019s a wee croft just over the hill that\u2019s been burnt out. Cooking accident, was it?\u201d</p><p>The room went silent, and people froze for an instant, all looking at him.</p><p>\u201cEvidently not,\u201d he said, with an apologetic cough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to make light\u2014were folk killed, then?\u201d</p><p>Mr. MacLaren gave him a brooding sort of look, quite at odds with his earlier geniality, and set the pipe on his knee.</p><p>\u201cNo by the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat led ye up there, man?\u201d</p><p>Roger met MacLaren\u2019s eye directly.</p> <p>\u201cSearching for my lad,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI dinna ken where to look\u2014so I look everywhere. Thinkin\u2019 what if he\u2019s got away, what if he\u2019s wandering about by himself . . . maybe taking shelter where he can find it . . .\u201d</p><p>MacLaren took a deep breath and sat back, nodding a little.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. Ye\u2019ll want to keep well away from that croft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaunted, is it?\u201d Buck asked, and all heads swung round to look at him\u2014then swung back to Mr. MacLaren, waiting for him to give the answer.</p><p>\u201cIt might be,\u201d he said, after a reluctant pause.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cursed,\u201d Allie whispered to Roger under her breath.</p><p>\u201cYe didna go in, sir, did ye?\u201d said Mrs. MacLaren, the permanent worry crease deepening between her brows.</p><p>\u201cOch, no,\u201d he assured her. \u201cWhat was it happened there?\u201d McEwan hadn\u2019t had any hesitation about going into the croft; did he not know whatever they were concerned about?</p><p>Mrs. MacLaren made a small \u201cMmp!\u201d noise and, with a shake of her head, swung the cauldron out on its bracket and began to scoop out boiled neeps with a wooden spoon. Not her place to speak of such goings-on, said her primly sealed mouth.</p><p>Mr. MacLaren made a somewhat louder noise and, leaning forward, got ponderously to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be going to check the beasts before supper, ken,\u201d he said, and gave Roger an eye. \u201cPerhaps ye\u2019d like to come along and be oot the way o\u2019 the lasses and their doings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Roger said, and, with a small bow to Mrs. MacLaren, hitched the quilt up higher over his shoulders and followed his host into the byre. He caught Buck\u2019s eye in passing and gave him a brief shrug.</p><p>In the usual way, the cattle\u2019s quarters were separated from the people\u2019s by no more than a stone wall with a large space at the top, allowing the considerable heat\u2014along with floating bits of straw and a strong scent of piss and manure\u2014generated by several large cows to percolate into the ben. The MacLarens\u2019 was a snug byre, well kept and piled with clean straw at one end, with three fat, shaggy red cows and a diminutive black bull who snorted fiercely at Roger, nostrils red-black in the dim light and the brass ring in his nose agleam.</p><p>The ben of the croft was far from cold\u2014what with nine people crammed into it and a good peat fire on the hearth\u2014but the byre was filled with an encompassing warmth and a sense of peace that made Roger sigh and drop his shoulders, only then realizing that they\u2019d been up round his ears for what seemed hours.</p><p>MacLaren made no more than a cursory check of his beasts, scratching the bull between the ears and administering a comforting slap to a cow\u2019s flank. Then he led Roger to the far end of the byre with a jerk of his head.</p><p>Ever since his conversation with Hector McEwan, Roger had had an uneasy feeling, caused by something he felt he had heard and not understood. And now, as MacLaren turned to speak to him, it was there suddenly, clear in his head. Cranesmuir.</p><p>\u201cTwa strangers built the croft up there,\u201d MacLaren said. \u201cThey came from nowhere seemingly; just one day they were there. A man and a woman, but we couldna tell were they man and wife, or maybe a man and his daughter, for he seemed a good bit older than she did. They said they came from the isles\u2014and I think he maybe did, but her speech wasna like any islander I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she Scots?\u201d</p><p>MacLaren looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, she was. She had the G\u00e0idhlig. I\u2019d have said she came from somewhere up northwest of Inverness\u2014maybe Thurso\u2014but there again . . . it wasna quite . . . right.\u201d</p><p>Not quite right. Like someone out of their proper place, pretending.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she look like?\u201d Roger said. His voice was thick; he had to clear his throat and repeat himself.</p><p>MacLaren\u2019s lips pursed but not in condemnation; it was the sort of soundless whistle of appreciation one gives at sight of something remarkable.</p><p>\u201cBonny,\u201d he said. \u201cVerra bonny, indeed. Tall and straight, but . . . er . . . not so straight in places, if ye take my meaning.\u201d He ducked his head, half embarrassed, and Roger realized that his reluctance to talk in front of the womenfolk perhaps wasn\u2019t due entirely to the scandalous nature of his story.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Roger said, lowering his own voice to MacLaren\u2019s confidential level. \u201cDid they keep to themselves, then?\u201d If they hadn\u2019t, surely the whole district would have known about them and quickly discovered whether they were man and wife.</p><p>MacLaren frowned.</p><p>\u201cAye, they did . . . though he was friendly enough; I met him now and again, out on the moor, and we\u2019d have a word, and I\u2019d always come away thinkin\u2019 as how he was a good wee fellow, and yet when I came to tell my Maggie about it, I couldna just charge my memory wi\u2019 anything he\u2019d said.\u201d</p><p>MacLaren said somehow word got round that the woman was something that wee bit odd\u2014a root doctor, but maybe would give you a bit more than a grass cure, if you found her alone in the house. . . .</p><p>There was no light in the byre save the dull glow from the hearth fire next door, but, even so, Roger could see that MacLaren had grown flushed and discomfited. Roger was beginning to feel uncomfortable himself, but not for the same reason.</p><p>Cranesmuir. He knew the name, had known it when McEwan said it. The MacLarens had said the healer came from Draighhearnach. Cranesmuir was in the opposite direction\u2014and two miles farther on. Why was he going there tonight?</p><p>\u201cThere were stories. Always are, about a woman like that.\u201d MacLaren cleared his own throat. \u201cBut she was good wi\u2019 the grass cures\u2014and wi\u2019 charms, as well. Or so folk said.\u201d</p><p>But then the man had gone, MacLaren said. No one knew where; they just didn\u2019t see him anymore, and the woman went on as before, but now more of her visitors were men. And the women stopped taking their bairns up there, though they\u2019d go sometimes themselves, quietly, in secret.</p><p>And then on the day before Samhain, as the sun was sinking and the great fires being built up for the evening, a woman from nearby had gone up to the lonely croft and run down again, screaming.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d found the door o\u2019 the croft standing wide, the woman and her things all gone\u2014and a man hanging from the rooftree, stone dead wi\u2019 a rope around his neck.\u201d</p><p>The shock tightened Roger\u2019s own throat. He couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>MacLaren sighed, head bent. A cow had come up behind him, nudging gently, and he laid one hand on her back as though seeking support from the animal, who went on placidly chewing her cud.</p><p>\u201cIt was the priest who said we should cleanse the place with fire, for it had the smell of evil about it, and no one kent the man. We couldna tell was it just a poor fellow as took his life by despair\u2014or was it murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . see.\u201d Roger forced the words through the burn in his throat, and MacLaren looked up suddenly at him. He saw the man\u2019s mouth drop open, his eyes bulging, and realized that in the warmth he\u2019d let the quilt slide back on his shoulders. MacLaren was looking straight at his throat, where the livid and unmistakable scar of hanging must show plain in the dim red light.</p><p>MacLaren backed away, or tried to, but there was nowhere to go. He plastered himself against one beast\u2019s shaggy flank, making a low gobbling noise. The cow seemed annoyed by this and brought her hoof down solidly on MacLaren\u2019s foot. The consequent anguish and fury at least brought MacLaren out of his fright, and when he had extricated himself\u2014by means of thumps and curses\u2014he turned bravely on Roger, jaw thrust out.</p><p>\u201cWhy come ye here, a thaibse?\u201d he said, fists clenched but his voice low. \u201cWhatever sin I might have done, I did naught to you. I\u2019d nay part in your death\u2014and I said they must bury your body beneath the hearthstone before they fired the place. The priest wouldna have ye in the kirkyard, aye?\u201d he added, evidently fearing that the ghost of the hangit man had come to complain about the unsancitifed disposal of his mortal remains.</p><p>Roger sighed and rubbed a hand over his face, the stubble rasping against his palm. He could see several curious faces, attracted by MacLaren\u2019s cries, peering into the shadows of the byre from the glow of the room beyond.</p><p>\u201cHave ye got a rosary in the house, sir?\u201d he said.</p><p>IT WAS A long and restless night. Grannie Wallace had snatched the children off Buck\u2019s bed, as though fearing he might devour them the moment her back was turned, and put them to bed with her in the trundle, while the older children slept either with their parents or rolled up in quilts by the hearth. Roger shared the pariah\u2019s bed with Buck, for while his ability to hold the rosary in his hand, kiss the crucifix, and then lead the family in saying the rosary had\u2014barely\u2014kept Angus MacLaren from throwing him out into the night and pissing on the gateposts to keep him from coming back in, it hadn\u2019t made him much more popular. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He doubted Buck had slept much better than himself, for his ancestor had rolled out of bed at first light, declaring an urgent necessity to visit the privy. Roger had as hastily arisen, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll help ye,\u201d and pulled on a still-damp shirt and breeks.</p><p>He was pleased to see that Buck didn\u2019t actually appear to need help. He walked stiffly and limped a little, but his shoulders were square and he wasn\u2019t gasping or turning blue.</p><p>\u201cIf they think ye\u2019re a vengeful ghost, what the devil do they think I am?\u201d Buck inquired, the instant they were clear of the cottage. \u201cAnd surely to goodness ye could ha\u2019 just said the Lord\u2019s Prayer once and not dragged everyone through five decades o\u2019 the rosary and ruined the supper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Buck had a point there, but Roger had been too much upset at the time to think of that. Besides, he\u2019d wanted to give them time to recover from the shock. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ruined,\u201d he said crossly. \u201cOnly the neeps a bit scorched.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly!\u201d Buck echoed. \u201cThe place still reeks. And the women hate ye. They\u2019ll put too much salt in your porridge, see if they don\u2019t. Where d\u2019ye think we\u2019re going? It\u2019s that way.\u201d</p><p>He pointed at a path on the left that did indeed lead to the privy, this sitting in plain sight.</p><p>Roger made another testy sound but followed. He was off-kilter this morning, distracted. No wonder about why, either.</p><p>Now? He wondered, watching the door of the privy close behind Buck. It was a two-seater, but he wasn\u2019t minded to broach what he had to say under conditions of that much intimacy, no matter how private the subject matter was.</p><p>\u201cThe healer,\u201d he said instead through the door, choosing the simplest place to start. \u201cMcEwan. He said he\u2019d come back today to see to ye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need seeing to,\u201d Buck snapped. \u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Roger had known the man long enough to recognize bravado covering fear, and replied accordingly.</p><p>\u201cAye, right. What did it feel like?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cWhen he put his hand on you?\u201d</p><p>Silence from the privy.</p><p>\u201cDid ye feel anything?\u201d he asked, after the silence had lengthened well past any time required for natural functions.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d said Buck\u2019s voice, gruff and reluctant. \u201cMaybe no. I fell asleep whilst he was tapping on my chest like a yaffle after tree grubs. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you understand what it was he said to ye? When he touched you?\u201d Buck had been a lawyer in his own time; he must have studied Latin.</p> <p>\u201cDid you?\u201d A slight creak of wood and a rustling of cloth.</p><p>\u201cI did. And I said it back to him, just before he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asleep,\u201d Buck repeated doggedly. Clearly he didn\u2019t want to talk about the healer, but he wasn\u2019t going to have a choice about that, Roger thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cCome out of there, will ye? The MacLarens are all out in the dooryard, crossing their legs.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder and was surprised to see that in fact the MacLarens were out in the dooryard.</p><p>Not all of them\u2014it was only Angus and a tall boy, plainly a MacLaren, too, from the shape of him. He seemed familiar\u2014had he been at the house the evening before? They were bent close together, talking in evident excitement, and the boy was pointing off toward the distant road.</p><p>\u201cCome out,\u201d Roger repeated, sudden urgency in his voice. \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming. I hear horses.\u201d</p><p>The privy door flew open and Buck sprang out like a jack-in-the-box, stuffing his shirt into his breeks. His hair was matted and dirty, but his eyes were alert, and he looked entirely capable; that was reassuring.</p><p>The horses had come up over the brow of the hill now\u2014six of them: four of the shaggy Highland ponies called garrons, one indifferent rangy bay, and a startlingly fine chestnut with a black mane. Buck seized Roger\u2019s arm with a grip like a horse\u2019s bite.</p> <p>\u201cA Dhia,\u201d Buck said, half under his breath. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>ANGELS UNAWARE</p><p>ROGER HAD NO IDEA who the tall man with the good horse was, but it was crystal clear what he was, both from the deferential manner of the MacLarens and from the way in which his companions fell naturally into place a step behind him. The man in charge.</p><p>A tacksman of the MacKenzies? he wondered. Most of the men wore a hunting tartan with a sett in green, brown, and white, but Roger wasn\u2019t yet familiar enough with the local patterns as to tell whether they came from somewhere close by or not.</p><p>The tall man glanced over his shoulder at MacLaren\u2019s nod, and his eyes rested on Roger and Buck with an air of casual interest. There was nothing threatening in his manner, but Roger felt himself draw up to his own full height and wished for an instant that he wasn\u2019t barefoot and unshaven, breeks flapping unbuckled at his knees.</p><p>At least he did have someone at his own back: Buck had fallen a step behind him. He hadn\u2019t time to be surprised at that before he came within the stranger\u2019s ken.</p><p>The man was an inch or two shorter than himself and close to his own age, dark and good-looking in a faintly familiar sort of . . .</p><p>\u201cGood morn to ye, sir,\u201d the dark man said, with a courteous inclination of the head. \u201cMy name is Dougal MacKenzie, of Castle Leoch. And . . . who might you be?\u201d</p><p>Dear Jesus bloody hell, he thought. The shock rippled through him, and he hoped it didn\u2019t show on his face. He shook hands firmly.</p><p>\u201cI am Roger Jeremiah MacKenzie, of Kyle of Lochalsh,\u201d he said, keeping his voice mild and\u2014he hoped\u2014assured, as some compensation for his shabby appearance. His voice sounded nearly normal this morning; if he didn\u2019t force it, with luck it wouldn\u2019t crack or gurgle.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, sir,\u201d MacKenzie said with a slight bow, surprising Roger with his elegant manners. He had deep-set hazel eyes, which looked Roger over with frank interest\u2014and a faint touch of what appeared to be amusement\u2014before shifting to Buck.</p><p>\u201cMy kinsman,\u201d Roger said hastily. \u201cWilliam Bu\u2014William MacKenzie.\u201d When? he thought in agitation. Was Buck born yet? Would Dougal recognize the name William Buccleigh MacKenzie? But, no, he can\u2019t be born yet; you can\u2019t exist twice in the same time\u2014can you?!?</p><p>A question from Dougal MacKenzie interrupted this stream of confusion, though Roger missed hearing it. Buck answered, though.</p><p>\u201cMy kinsman\u2019s son was taken,\u201d he said, looking Dougal over with exactly\u2014oh, Jesus, exactly\u2014the same attitude of insouciant confidence that the other MacKenzie carried. \u201cAbout a week past, abducted by a man named Cameron. Robert Cameron. Will ye maybe ken such a man?\u201d</p><p>Dougal of course did not\u2014not surprising, as Cameron hadn\u2019t existed here until a week ago. But he conferred with his men, asked intelligent questions, and expressed an open sympathy and concern that at once comforted Roger and made him feel as though he was about to vomit.</p><p>To this point, Dougal MacKenzie had been no more than a name on the historical page, momentarily, if vividly, illustrated by Claire\u2019s disjunct memories. Now he sat solid in the early-morning sun beside Roger on the bench outside the MacLarens\u2019 cottage, his plaid rough and smelling faintly of piss and heather, two days\u2019 stubble rasping as he scratched his jaw in thought.</p><p>I like him, God help me. And, God help me, I know what\u2019s going to happen to him. . . .</p><p>His eyes fixed in helpless fascination on the hollow of Dougal\u2019s throat, sun-brown and strong, framed in the open collar of his crumpled shirt. Roger jerked his eyes away, glancing instead at the russet hairs on Dougal\u2019s wrist, these catching the sunlight as he motioned toward the east, talking of his brother, chieftain of the clan MacKenzie.</p><p>\u201cColum doesna travel, himself, but he\u2019d be glad to welcome the two of ye, should you find yourselves near Leoch in your search.\u201d He smiled at Roger, who smiled back, warmed by it. \u201cWhere d\u2019ye mean to go now?\u201d</p><p>Roger took a deep breath. Where, indeed?</p><p>\u201cSouth, I think. William found no trace of Cameron in Inverness, so I\u2019m thinking that he might be headed toward Edinburgh, meaning to take ship there.\u201d</p><p>Dougal pursed his lips, nodding in thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d He turned to his men, who had sat down on the rocks that lined the path, and called to them. \u201cGeordie, Thomas\u2014we\u2019ll lend your beasts to these men; get your bags. Ye\u2019d have little chance of catching up to the villain on foot,\u201d he said, turning back to Roger. \u201cHe must be mounted himself, and moving fast, or ye\u2019d have found some trace of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014thank you,\u201d Roger managed. He felt a deep chill, in spite of the sun on his face. \u201cYou must\u2014I mean\u2014that\u2019s very kind. We\u2019ll bring them back as soon as we can\u2014or send them, if\u2014if we should be detained anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoran taing,\u201d Buck murmured, nodding to Geordie and Thomas, who nodded back, looking dour but philosophical at the prospect of walking back to wherever they\u2019d come from.</p><p>Where have they come from? Apparently, Angus MacLaren had sent his son off last night before supper, to summon Dougal to come and have a look at his alarming guests. But Dougal and his men had to have been somewhere close at hand . . .</p><p>The chink of metal as Jock dumped an obviously heavy bag on the ground beside Dougal gave him a clue. Quarter Day. Dougal was collecting the rents for his brother\u2014and likely on his way back to Leoch. A lot of the rents would have been paid in kind\u2014hams, chickens, wool, salt fish\u2014probably Dougal\u2019s party was accompanied by one or more wagons, which they\u2019d left behind wherever they\u2019d stayed last night.</p><p>Angus MacLaren and his oldest son stood a little to the side, eyes fixed suspiciously on Roger as though he might sprout wings and fly away. Dougal turned to Angus with a smile and said in G\u00e0idhlig, \u201cDon\u2019t trouble, friend; they\u2019re nay more ghosts than the lads and I are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not forget to entertain strangers,\u201d Buck said in the same language, \u201cfor thereby some have entertained angels unawares.\u201d</p><p>There was a startled pause at that, everyone staring at him. Then Dougal laughed, and his men followed him. Angus merely made a polite noise in his throat but shifted his weight and visibly relaxed. As though this had been a signal\u2014and perhaps it was\u2014the door opened, and Mrs. MacLaren and Allie came out, with a stack of wooden bowls and a steaming pot of parritch. One of the smaller MacLarens came after, carefully bearing a saltcellar in both hands.</p><p>In the general hubbub of serving and eating\u2014the women had oversalted his porridge, though not badly\u2014Roger said quietly to Dougal, \u201cDid MacLaren actually send to have you come and see whether I was a ghost?\u201d</p><p>Dougal looked surprised but then smiled, one side of his mouth turning up. It was the way Brianna smiled when she wanted to acknowledge a joke she didn\u2019t think was funny\u2014or when she saw something funny that she didn\u2019t mean to share with the company. A searing pang followed the jolt of recognition, and Roger was obliged to look down for a moment and clear his throat in order to get control of his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, man,\u201d Dougal said casually, also looking down as he wiped his bowl with a bit of hard journeycake taken from his saddlebag. \u201cHe thought I might be of help to ye in your search.\u201d He looked up then, straight at Roger\u2019s neck, and raised one dark, heavy brow. \u201cNot that the presence of a half-hangit man at your door doesna raise questions, ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least a half-hangit man can answer the questions,\u201d Buck put in. \u201cNot like him from the croft above, aye?\u201d</p><p>That startled Dougal, who put down his spoon and stared at Buck. Who stared back, one fair brow raised.</p><p>Holy Lord . . . do they see it? Either of them? It wasn\u2019t warm, despite the sun, but Roger felt sweat begin to trickle down his spine. It was more a matter of posture and expression than of feature\u2014and yet the echo of similarity between the two faces was plain as the . . . well, as the long, straight nose on both faces.</p><p>Roger could see the thoughts flickering across Dougal\u2019s face: surprise, curiosity, suspicion.</p><p>\u201cAnd what have ye to do with him above?\u201d he asked, with a slight lift of his chin in the direction of the burnt-out croft.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing, so far as I ken,\u201d Buck answered, with a brief shrug. \u201cOnly meaning as how if ye want to know what happened to my kinsman, ye can ask him. We\u2019ve nothing to hide.\u201d</p><p>Thanks a lot, Roger thought, with a sideways look at his ancestor, who smiled blandly back at him and resumed gingerly eating his salty parritch. Why the bloody hell did you say that, of all things?</p><p>\u201cI was hanged in mistake for another man,\u201d he said, as casually as possible, but he heard the voice grate in his throat, tightening, and had to stop to clear it. \u201cIn America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica,\u201d Dougal repeated, in open astonishment. All of them were staring at him now, men-at-arms and MacLarens both. \u201cWhat took ye to America\u2014and what brought ye back, come to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife has kin there,\u201d Roger replied, wondering what the devil Buck was up to. \u201cIn North Carolina, on the Cape Fear River.\u201d He very nearly named Hector and Jocasta Cameron, before remembering that Jocasta was Dougal\u2019s sister. Also that it was Culloden that had sent them to America\u2014and Culloden hadn\u2019t happened yet.</p><p>And he won\u2019t live to see it, he thought, watching Dougal\u2019s face as he spoke, feeling a state of bemused horror. Dougal would die, hours before the battle, in the attics of Culloden House near Inverness, with Jamie Fraser\u2019s dirk sunk in the hollow of his throat.</p><p>He told the story of his hanging and rescue briefly, leaving out the context of the War of the Regulation\u2014and leaving out Buck\u2019s role in getting him hanged, too. He could feel Buck there beside him, leaning forward, intent, but didn\u2019t look at him. Couldn\u2019t look at him without wanting to strangle him. Wanted to strangle him anyway.</p><p>He could barely speak by the time he finished, and his heart was thumping in his ears with suppressed rage. Everyone was looking at him, with a range of emotions from awe to sympathy. Allie MacLaren was openly sniffing, her apron hem at her nose, and even her mother looked as though she somewhat regretted the salt. Angus coughed and handed him a stone bottle of what turned out to be beer, and a very grateful beverage it was, too. He muttered thanks and gulped it, avoiding all eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougal nodded soberly, then turned to Angus.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the man above,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen did that happen\u2014and what d\u2019ye ken about it?\u201d</p><p>MacLaren\u2019s face lost a little of its natural high color, and he looked as though he wanted his beer back.</p><p>\u201cSix days past, a ghoistidh.\u201d He gave a brief, and much less atmospheric, account than he had the night before\u2014but it was the same story.</p> <p>Dougal looked thoughtful, tapping his fingers gently on his knee.</p><p>\u201cThe woman,\u201d he said. \u201cD\u2019ye ken where she\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . uh . . . heard as how she\u2019d gone to Cranesmuir, sir.\u201d MacLaren\u2019s color had all come back, with interest, and he carefully avoided his wife\u2019s hard eye.</p><p>\u201cCranesmuir,\u201d Dougal repeated. \u201cAye, well. Perhaps I\u2019ll seek her out, then, and just have a word. What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsbister,\u201d MacLaren blurted. \u201cGeillis Isbister.\u201d</p> <p>Roger didn\u2019t actually feel the earth shake under his feet but was surprised that it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIsbister?\u201d Dougal\u2019s brows went up. \u201cFrom the northern isles, is she?\u201d</p><p>MacLaren shrugged in elaborate pantomime of ignorance\u2014and unconcern. He looked as though someone had made a serious attempt to boil his head, and Roger saw Dougal\u2019s mouth twitch again.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cWell, an Orkneywoman maybe won\u2019t be hard to find, then, in a place the size of Cranesmuir.\u201d He lifted his chin in the direction of his men, and they all rose as one when he stood. So did Roger and Buck.</p><p>\u201cGodspeed to ye, gentlemen,\u201d he said, bowing to them. \u201cI\u2019ll have word put about regarding your wee lad. If I hear anything, where shall I send?\u201d</p><p>Roger exchanged glances with Buck, nonplussed. He couldn\u2019t ask for word to be sent to Lallybroch, knowing what he knew of the relations between Brian Fraser and his brothers-in-law.</p> <p>\u201cDo ye ken a place called Sheriffmuir?\u201d he asked, groping for some other place he knew that existed at the present time. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine coaching inn there\u2014though not much else.\u201d</p><p>Dougal looked surprised but nodded.</p><p>\u201cI do, sir. I fought at Sheriffmuir with the Earl of Mar, and we supped there with him one night, my father and brother and I. Aye, I\u2019ll send word there, if there is any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The words came half choked but clear enough. Dougal gave him a sympathetic nod, then turned to take leave of the MacLarens. Stopped by a sudden thought, though, he turned back.</p><p>\u201cI dinna suppose ye really are an angel, are ye?\u201d he asked, quite seriously.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said, smiling as best he could, despite the coldness in his belly. And it isn\u2019t you that\u2019s talking to a ghost.</p><p>He stood with Buck, watching the MacKenzies depart, Geordie and Thomas keeping up with little effort, as the horses went slowly on the steep, rocky path.</p><p>The phrase \u201cBlessed are those who have not seen but have believed\u201d floated through his head. It was maybe not the believing that was the blessing; it was the not having to look. Seeing, sometimes, was bloody awful.</p> <p>ROGER DELAYED their own departure as long as he decently could, hoping for the return of Dr. McEwan, but as the sun rose high in the sky, it was plain that the MacLarens wanted them gone\u2014and Buck wanted to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said crossly, and thumped his chest with a fist. \u201cSound as a drum.\u201d</p><p>Roger made a skeptical noise in his throat\u2014and was surprised. It hadn\u2019t hurt. He stopped himself putting a hand to his own throat; no need to draw attention to it, even if they were leaving.</p><p>\u201cAye, all right.\u201d He turned to Angus MacLaren and Stuart, who\u2019d helpfully filled Roger\u2019s canteen in the hope of hurrying them on their way and was standing with it dripping in his hands. \u201cI thank ye for your hospitality, sir, and your kindness to my kinsman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d said MacLaren, a distinct look of relief coming over his face at what was plainly farewell. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Nay bother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\u2014if the healer should come along, would ye thank him for us? And say I\u2019ll try to come and see him on our way back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your way back,\u201d MacLaren repeated, with less enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cAye. We\u2019re bound into Lochaber, to the Cameron lands. If we find nay trace of my son there, though, we\u2019ll likely come back this way\u2014perhaps we\u2019ll call at Castle Leoch for news.\u201d</p><p>MacLaren\u2019s face cleared at that.</p><p>\u201cOch, aye,\u201d he said heartily. \u201cGood thought. Godspeed!\u201d</p><p>IN WHICH THINGS CONVERGE</p><p>\u201cNOW, IT\u2019S NOT that I dinna want to be helping your mam,\u201d Mr. Buchan said, for the third time. \u201cBut I canna be having ructions going on in my house, and criminals coming and goin,\u2019 not with my girls there, now, can I?\u201d</p><p>Jem shook his head obediently, though Mr. Buchan wasn\u2019t looking at him; he was peering into his rearview mirror and looking over his shoulder now and then, like he thought somebody might be following them. It made Jem want to look, too, but he couldn\u2019t see behind without getting up on his knees and turning round, and Mandy was passed out asleep, half on his lap.</p><p>It was late, and he yawned, forgetting to cover his mouth. He thought of saying, \u201cExcuse me,\u201d but he didn\u2019t think Mr. Buchan had noticed. He felt a burp coming and did cover his mouth this time, tasting vinegar from the fish and chips. Mr. Buchan had bought an extra fish supper for Mam; it was in a brown-paper bag on the floor by Jem\u2019s feet, so as not to get grease on the seat.</p><p>\u201cKen when your da\u2019s expected back?\u201d Mr. Buchan asked abruptly, glancing down at him. Jem shook his head, feeling the fish and chips rise up in a queasy ball.</p><p>Mr. Buchan\u2019s mouth pressed tight, like he wanted to say something he thought he shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDaddy . . .\u201d Mandy murmured, then pushed her head into his ribs, snorted, and went back to sleep. He felt terrible. Mandy didn\u2019t even know where Da was; she probably thought he was just at lodge or something.</p><p>Mam said Da would come back, as soon as he figured out that Jem wasn\u2019t there with Grandda. But how? he thought, and had to bite his lip hard not to cry. How would he know? It was dark, but there was a glow from the dashboard. If he cried, Mr. Buchan would maybe see.</p><p>Headlights flashed in the rearview mirror and he looked up, brushing his sleeve furtively under his nose. He could see a white panel truck coming up behind them. Mr. Buchan said something under his breath and stepped on the gas pedal harder.</p><p>BRIANNA HAD SETTLED into the hunter\u2019s wait: a state of physical detachment and mental abeyance, mind and body each minding its own business but able to spring into unified action the moment something worth eating showed up. Her mind was on the Ridge, reliving a possum hunt with her cousin Ian. The pungent stickiness and eye-watering smoke of pine-knot torches, a glimpse of glowing eyes in a tree, and a sudden bristling possum like a nightmare in the branches, needle-toothed and gaping threats, hissing and growling like a flatulent motorboat . . .</p><p>And then the phone rang. In an instant she was standing, gun in hand, every sense trained on the house. It came again, the short double brr! muffled by distance but unmistakable. It was the phone in Roger\u2019s study, and even as she thought this, she saw the brief glow of a light inside as the study door was opened, and the ringing phone abruptly stopped.</p><p>Her scalp contracted, and she felt a brief kinship with the treed possum. But the possum hadn\u2019t had a shotgun.</p><p>Her immediate impulse was to go and flush out whoever was in her house and demand to know the meaning of this. Her money was on Rob Cameron, and the thought of flushing him like a grouse and marching him out at the point of a gun made her hand tighten on said gun with anticipation. She had Jem back; Cameron would know she didn\u2019t need to keep him alive.</p><p>But. She hesitated in the door of the broch, looking down.</p><p>But whoever was in the house had answered the phone. If I was a burglar, I wouldn\u2019t be answering the phone in the house I was burgling. Not unless I thought it would wake up the people inside.</p><p>Whoever was in her house already knew no one was home.</p><p>\u201cQuod erat demonstrandum,\u201d her father\u2019s voice said in her mind, with a grim satisfaction. Someone in the house was expecting a call.</p><p>She stepped outside, with a deep breath of the fresh cold scent of gorse replacing the dank musk of the broch, her heart beating fast and her mind working faster. Who would be calling him\u2014them? To say what?</p><p>Maybe someone had been watching earlier, seen her coming down the forestry road. Maybe they were calling to tell Rob she was outside, in the broch. No, that didn\u2019t make sense. Whoever was in the house, they\u2019d been in there when she arrived. If someone had seen her come, they\u2019d have called the house then.</p><p>\u201cIta sequitur . . .\u201d she murmured. Thus it follows: if the call wasn\u2019t about her, it must be either a warning that someone\u2014the police, and why?\u2014was coming toward Lallybroch\u2014or news that whoever was on the outside had found the kids.</p><p>The metal of the barrel was slick under her sweating palm, and it took a noticeable effort to keep a firm grip on the gun. Even more of an effort not to run toward the house.</p><p>Aggravating as it was, she had to wait. If someone had found the kids, she couldn\u2019t reach Fiona\u2019s house in time to protect them; she\u2019d have to depend on Fiona and Ernie and the City of Inverness police. But if that was the case, whoever was in the house would surely be coming out right away. Unless that bastard Rob means to hang around in hopes of catching me unawares, and . . . Despite the gun in her hand, that thought gave her an unpleasant squirm deep inside\u2014one she recognized as the ghostly touch of Stephen Bonnet\u2019s penis.</p><p>\u201cI killed you, Stephen,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you\u2019re dead. You may have company in hell pretty soon. Make sure the fire\u2019s lit for him, okay?\u201d</p><p>That restored her nerve, and dropping to her haunches, she duckwalked through the gorse, coming down the hillside at an angle that would bring her out near the kailyard, not by the path, which was visible from the house. Even in the dark, she was taking no chances; there was a rising half-moon, though it showed erratically through scudding cloud.</p><p>The sound of a car coming made her lift her head, peering over a tuft of dry broom. She put a hand in her pocket, thumbing through the loose shotgun shells. Fourteen. That should be enough.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s remark about ballistics flitted through her mind, along with a faint reminder of the possibility of going to prison for wholesale manslaughter. She might risk it, for the satisfaction of killing Rob Cameron\u2014but the unwelcome thought occurred to her that while she didn\u2019t need him to locate Jem anymore, she did need to find out what the hell was going on. And while the police might track down the man from the dam, if there was some sort of gang involved, Rob was likely the only way of finding out who the others were\u2014and what they wanted.</p><p>The headlights jounced down the lane and into the dooryard, and she stood up abruptly. The motion-detecting light had come on, showing her Ernie\u2019s white panel truck, unmistakable, with BUCHAN ELECTRICS/FOR ALL YOUR CURRENT NEEDS, CALL 01463 775 4432 on the side, with a drawing of a severed cable, spitting sparks.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d she said. \u201cBloody, bloody hell!\u201d</p><p>The truck\u2019s door opened and Jem tumbled out, then turned round to help Mandy, who was no more than a short dark blot in the recesses of the truck.</p><p>\u201cGET BACK IN THE TRUCK!\u201d Brianna bellowed, leaping down the slope, skittering on rolling stones and bending her ankles in spongy patches of heather. \u201cJEMMY! GET BACK!\u201d</p><p>She saw Jem turn, his face white in the glare of the light, but it was too late. The front door flew open and two dark figures rushed out, running for the truck.</p><p>She wasted no more breath but ran for all she was worth. A shotgun was useless at any distance\u2014or maybe not. She skidded to a halt, shouldered the gun, and fired. Buckshot flew into the gorse with a whizzing sound like tiny arrows, but the bang had halted the intruders in their tracks.</p><p>\u201cBACK IN THE TRUCK!\u201d she roared, and fired again. The intruders galloped toward the house, and Jem, bless his heart, leapt into the truck like a startled frog and slammed the door. Ernie, who had just got out, stood for a moment gawking up the slope, but then, realizing what had happened, came suddenly to life and dived for his own door.</p><p>She reloaded in the glow of the spotlight. How long would the light stay on with no one moving in its range? She racked a fresh shell and ran for Ernie\u2019s truck. More headlights jerked her attention toward the lane. Holy Mary, Mother of God, who was this? Please, God, let it be the police . . .</p><p>The light winked out, then on again almost at once, as the second vehicle roared into the dooryard, moving fast. The people inside the house were hanging out of the drawing room casement, yelling something at the new truck\u2014yes, it was another panel truck, much like Ernie\u2019s, save that it said POULTNEY\u2019S, PURVEYOR OF FINE GAME and had a picture of a wild boar.</p><p>\u201cHoly Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . . .\u201d She had to get to Ernie\u2019s truck before\u2014too late. The FINE GAME truck revved up and rammed Ernie\u2019s truck in the side, shunting it several yards. She could hear Mandy\u2019s scream above everything, sharp as an augur through her heart.</p><p>\u201cBloody Mother of . . . Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d She couldn\u2019t take time to circle the dooryard. She ran straight across it, took close aim, and shredded the front tire of the FINE GAME truck with a blast of buckshot.</p><p>\u201cSTAY IN THE TRUCK!\u201d she shouted, chambering the second shell and pointing the gun at the windshield in the same motion. A blur of white as at least two people ducked down out of sight below the dash.</p><p>The men\u2014yes, both men\u2014inside the house were yelling at each other, and at the people in the truck, and at her. Useless adjurations and insults, mostly, but one of them was now pointing out to the others that her weapon was a shotgun. Useless except at short range, and only two shots. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t cover us all, hen!\u201d</p><p>That was Rob Cameron, shouting from the Poultney\u2019s truck. She didn\u2019t bother replying but ran to get in range of the house, and the drawing room window dissolved in a shower of glass.</p><p>Sweat was running down her sides, tickling. She broke the gun and thumbed two more shells into place. She felt as though she were moving in slow motion\u2014but the rest of the world was moving slower. With no sense of hurry, she walked to Ernie\u2019s truck and put her back against the door behind which Jem and Mandy were sheltering. A strong waft of fish and malt vinegar floated out as the window cranked down a few inches.</p><p>\u201cMam\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMummy! Mummy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, Brianna! What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bunch of nutters are trying to kill me and take my kids, Ernie,\u201d she said, raising her voice over Mandy\u2019s wailing. \u201cWhat does it look like? How about you start the engine, hmm?\u201d</p><p>The other truck was out of effective shotgun range from here, and she could see only one side of it. She heard its door open on the other side and saw a flicker of movement inside the shattered window of the house.</p><p>\u201cNow would be a good time, Ernie.\u201d She wasn\u2019t forgetting that one of the bastards had her rifle. She could only hope they didn\u2019t know how to use it.</p> <p>Ernie was frantically turning the key and stomping the gas. She could hear him praying under his breath, but he\u2019d flooded the engine; the starter whirred uselessly. Lower lip tucked under her teeth, she strode round the front of the truck in time to catch one of the people from the FINE GAME truck\u2014to her surprise, this one was a woman, a short, dumpy shape in a balaclava and an old Barbour. She raised the shotgun to her shoulder, and the woman tried to run backward, tripped, and fell on her backside with an audible \u201cOof!\u201d</p><p>She wanted to laugh but then saw Cameron climbing out of the truck, her rifle in hand, and the urge left her.</p><p>\u201cDrop it!\u201d She strode toward him, gun at her shoulder. He didn\u2019t know how to use the rifle; he glanced wildly from her to the gun, as though hoping it would aim itself, then changed his mind and dropped it.</p><p>The front door of the house slammed open, and she heard running feet coming fast. She whirled on her heel and ran, too, reaching Ernie\u2019s truck barely in time to hold off the two men from the house. One immediately began to sidle round, clearly meaning to circle the other truck and collect his idiot comrades. Rob Cameron was now advancing on her slowly, hands held up to show his non-offensive\u2014ha\u2014intent.</p><p>\u201cLook, Brianna, we don\u2019t mean ye any harm,\u201d he said.</p><p>She racked a fresh shell in answer to that, and he took a step back.</p> <p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he said, an edge in his voice. \u201cWe want to talk to you, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, pull the other one,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s got bells on. Ernie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare open that door until I say so, Jemmy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet down on the floor, Jem, right now! Take Mandy!\u201d One of the men from the house and the dumpy woman were moving again; she could hear them. And the second man from the house had disappeared into the dark outside the circle of light. \u201cERNIE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mam, somebody\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>Everyone froze for an instant, and the sound of an engine advancing down the farm track came clearly through the night. She turned and grabbed the door handle, jerking it open just as Ernie\u2019s engine finally coughed into full-throated life. She hurled herself into the seat, her feet narrowly missing Jem\u2019s head as he peered up from the footwell, eyes huge in the dim light.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ernie,\u201d she said, very calmly under the circumstance. \u201cKids, you stay down there.\u201d</p><p>A rifle butt struck the window near Ernie\u2019s head, starring the glass, and he yelped but didn\u2019t, God bless him, flood the engine again. Another blow and the glass broke in a cascade of glittering fragments. Brianna dropped her own gun and lunged across Ernie, reaching for the rifle. She got a hand on it, but the man holding it wrenched it free. Grabbing wildly, she scrabbled at the balaclava\u2019d shape, and the woolly helmet came off in her hand, leaving the man beneath openmouthed with shock.</p><p>The spotlight went off, plunging the yard into darkness, and bright spots danced in front of her eyes. It popped back on again as the new vehicle roared into the yard, horn blaring. Brianna lifted herself out of Ernie\u2019s lap, trying to see out through the windshield, then flung herself toward the other side of the truck.</p><p>It was an ordinary car, a dark-blue Fiat, looking like a toy as it circled the yard, horn blatting like a sow in heat.</p><p>\u201cFriend, d\u2019ye think?\u201d Ernie asked, his voice strained but not panicked. \u201cOr foe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend,\u201d she said, breathless, as the Fiat charged three of the intruders who were standing together: the unmasked rifle-wielder, the woman in the Barbour jacket, and whoever the guy who wasn\u2019t Rob Cameron was. They scattered like cockroaches into the grass, and Ernie slammed a fist on the dash in exultation.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll show the buggers!\u201d</p><p>Bree would have liked to stay and watch the rest of the show, but wherever Cameron was, he was undoubtedly too close.</p><p>\u201cGo, Ernie!\u201d</p><p>He went, with a terrible crunching and screeching of metal. The van lurched badly; the back axle must be damaged. She could only hope a wheel didn\u2019t come off.</p><p>The blue Fiat was prowling the dooryard; it honked and flashed its lights at Ernie\u2019s truck, and a hand waved from the driver\u2019s window. Brianna stuck her head out cautiously and returned the wave, then dropped back into her seat, panting. Black spots were swimming in her field of vision and her hair stuck to her face, lank with sweat.</p><p>They limped down the lane in first gear, with a horrible grinding noise; from the sound of it, the back wheel well had caved in.</p><p>\u201cMam.\u201d Jemmy stuck his head up over the edge of the seat like a prairie dog. \u201cCan I come up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She took a deep breath and helped Mandy scramble up after him. The little girl plastered herself at once to Brianna\u2019s chest, whimpering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d she whispered into Mandy\u2019s hair, clinging to the solid small body as much as Mandy clung to her. \u201cEverything will be fine.\u201d She glanced down at Jem, riding between Ernie and herself. He was hunched into himself and shivering visibly in his checked wool jacket, even though it was warm in the cab. She reached out a hand and took him by the back of the neck, shaking him gently. \u201cOkay there, pal?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but without saying anything. She folded her hand over his, clenched into a small fist on his knee, and held it tight\u2014both in reassurance and to stop her own hand shaking.</p><p>Ernie cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brianna,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI didna ken that\u2014I mean, I thought it would be okay to bring the bairns back, and after yon Cameron came to the house and hit Fiona, I\u2014\u201d A trickle of sweat gleamed as it ran down behind his ear.</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d After the events of the last hour, this news registered only as a blip on her personal seismograph, obscured by the bigger shock waves that were only now dying down. But she asked questions, and Jem began to come out of his own shell shock, telling about his part, gradually becoming indignant about Mrs. Kelleher and the police dispatcher. She felt a quiver in the pit of her stomach that wasn\u2019t quite laughter but close enough.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Ernie.\u201d She brushed off his renewed attempts at apology. Her voice rasped, her throat sore from shouting. \u201cI\u2019d have done the same, I expect. And we\u2019d never have got away without you.\u201d They\u2019d never have been there without him in the first place, but he knew that as well as she did; no point in rubbing it in.</p><p>\u201cAye, mmphm.\u201d He drove in silence for a moment, then remarked conversationally, looking in the rearview mirror, \u201cYon wee blue motor\u2019s following us, ken.\u201d His throat moved as he swallowed.</p><p>Brianna rubbed a hand over her face, then looked. Sure enough, the Fiat was trundling after them at a discreet distance.</p><p>Ernie coughed. \u201cEhm . . . where d\u2019ye want to go, Bree? Only, I\u2019m none sae sure we\u2019ll make it all the way into the town. But there\u2019s a petrol station with a garridge bay on the main road\u2014if I was to stop there, they\u2019d have a phone. Ye could call the polis while I deal wi\u2019 the van.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call the polis, Mam,\u201d Jemmy said, his nostrils flaring with disgust. \u201cThey\u2019re no help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d she said noncommittally, and raised an eyebrow at Ernie, who nodded and set his jaw.</p><p>She was inclined against calling the police herself\u2014but out of concern lest they be too inquisitively helpful. She\u2019d managed to deflect them from the touchy question of just where her husband was last night, telling them he was in London to visit the British Museum Reading Room and that she\u2019d call him as soon as they got home. If the police found out about the shoot-out at the O.K. Corral, there was going to be a lot more scrutiny of her private affairs. And it took no stretch of imagination at all to conclude that the police might really suspect her of having something to do with Roger\u2019s disappearance, since she couldn\u2019t produce him and couldn\u2019t tell them where he was. Might never be able to. She swallowed, hard.</p><p>The only recourse would be to claim that they\u2019d had a fight and he\u2019d walked out on her\u2014but that would sound pretty flimsy, in light of recent events. And she wouldn\u2019t say something like that in front of the kids, regardless.</p><p>But stopping at the petrol station was the only thing she could see to do at the moment. If the blue Fiat followed them there, at least she might discover an ally. And if it was the police, incognito . . . well, she\u2019d cross that bridge when she came to it. Adrenaline and shock had both left her now; she felt detached, dreamy, and very, very tired. Jemmy\u2019s hand had relaxed in hers, but his fingers were still curled around her thumb.</p><p>She leaned back, closing her eyes, and slowly traced the curve of Mandy\u2019s spine with her free hand. Her little girl had relaxed into sleep against her chest, her son with his head on her shoulder, the weight of her children\u2019s trust heavy on her heart.</p><p>THE PETROL STATION was next to a Little Chef caf\u00e9. She left Ernie to talk to the garageman while she extracted the kids. She didn\u2019t bother looking over her shoulder; the blue Fiat had fallen back to a respectful distance, not crowding them as they crawled clanking and grinding down the motorway at 20 mph. If the driver didn\u2019t mean to talk to her, he\u2019d have driven off and disappeared. Maybe she\u2019d manage a cup of tea before she had to deal with him.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d she muttered. \u201cGet the door, please, Jem?\u201d</p><p>Mandy was inert as a bag of cement in her arms but began to stir at the smell of food. Bree gagged at the reek of stale frying oil, burnt chips, and synthetic pancake syrup, but ordered ice cream for Jem and Mandy, with a cup of tea for herself. Surely even this place couldn\u2019t ruin tea?</p><p>A cup of barely warm water and a PG Tips tea bag convinced her otherwise. It didn\u2019t matter; her throat was so tight that she doubted she could swallow even water.</p><p>The blessed numbness of shock was lifting, much as she would have preferred to keep it wrapped blanket-like around her. The caf\u00e9 seemed too bright, with acres of foot-marked white lino; she felt exposed, like a bug on a grimy kitchen floor. Prickles of apprehension sparked unpleasantly over her scalp, and she kept her eyes fixed on the door, wishing she\u2019d been able to bring the shotgun inside.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize that Jem had also been watching the door until he stiffened to attention beside her in the booth.</p><p>\u201cMam! It\u2019s Mr. Menzies!\u201d</p><p>For a moment, neither the words nor the sight of the man who had just entered the caf\u00e9 made any sense. She blinked several times, but he was still there, striding toward them with an anxious face. Jem\u2019s school principal.</p><p>\u201cMrs. MacKenzie,\u201d he said, and, reaching across the table, shook her hand fervently. \u201cThank God you\u2019re all right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . thanks,\u201d she said feebly. \u201cYou\u2014was that you? In the blue Fiat?\u201d It was like being keyed up to confront Darth Vader and coming face-to-face with Mickey Mouse.</p><p>He actually blushed behind his glasses.</p><p>\u201cEhm . . . well, aye. I\u2014er . . .\u201d He caught Jem\u2019s eye and smiled awkwardly. \u201cYou\u2019re taking good care of your mother, then, Jem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d Jem was quite obviously about to burst with questions. Bree forestalled him with a quelling look and gestured to Lionel Menzies to sit down. He did and took a deep breath, about to say something, but was interrupted by the waitress, a solid, middle-aged woman with thick stockings and a cardigan and an air that indicated that she didn\u2019t care whether they were space aliens or cockroaches, so long as they didn\u2019t complicate her life.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t order the tea,\u201d Bree said, with a nod toward her cup.</p><p>\u201cAye, thanks. I\u2019ll have . . . a bacon butty and an Irn-Bru?\u201d he asked tentatively, looking up at the waitress. \u201cWith tomato sauce?\u201d She scorned to reply but flipped her pad shut and trundled off.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Menzies said, squaring his shoulders like one about to face a firing squad. \u201cTell me the one thing, would you? Was it Rob Cameron there at your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Bree spoke tersely, recalling belatedly that Cameron was related to Menzies in some way\u2014a cousin or something? \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He looked unhappy. A pale-faced man with slightly receding curly brown hair and glasses, he wasn\u2019t remarkable in any way and yet usually had a presence, a friendliness and quiet air of authority about him that drew the eye and made one feel reassured in his company. This was notably lacking tonight.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid that it might be. I heard\u2014on the evening news. That Rob was being looked for by the police\u201d\u2014he lowered his voice, though there was no one within earshot\u2014\u201cin connection with . . . well, with\u201d\u2014he nodded discreetly toward Jem\u2014\u201ctaking Jeremiah, here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe did!\u201d Jem said, dropping his spoon and sitting up straight. \u201cHe did, Mr. Menzies! He said he was going to take me to spend the night with Bobby, only he didn\u2019t, he took me up to the rocks and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem.\u201d Brianna spoke quietly, but it was her Shut Up Right Now voice, and he did, though with an audible snort and a glare at her.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d she said levelly. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d</p><p>He blinked in surprise.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014why, nothing. I can\u2019t imagine why he\u2014\u201d He broke off, coughed, and taking his glasses off, pulled a pocket handkerchief out and polished them. By the time he put them back on, he\u2019d pulled himself together.</p><p>\u201cYou may remember, Rob Cameron\u2019s my cousin. And he\u2019s in lodge, of course. I was knocked off my perch to hear this about him. So I thought I\u2019d maybe come out to Lallybroch, have a word with you and your husband\u201d\u2014he lifted an eyebrow, but she didn\u2019t respond to this obvious hint about Roger, and he went on\u2014\u201csee that Jem was all right\u2014are ye all right, Jem?\u201d he broke off to ask seriously, glancing at the boy.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, fine,\u201d Jem replied airily, though he seemed tense. \u201cSir,\u201d he added belatedly, and licked a smear of chocolate ice cream off his upper lip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Menzies smiled at Jem, and Brianna saw a little of his usual warmth light up behind the glasses. The warmth was still in his eyes, though he was serious when he looked at her. \u201cI wanted to ask if there\u2019d maybe been a mistake, but I\u2019m thinking that there likely wasn\u2019t? In light of . . . all that.\u201d He tilted his head in the direction of Lallybroch and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYes, there was,\u201d she said grimly, shifting Mandy\u2019s weight on her lap, \u201cand Rob Cameron made it.\u201d</p> <p>He grimaced, drew a deep breath, but nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to help,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cYou definitely did,\u201d she assured him, wondering what on earth to do with him now. \u201cIck! Mandy, you\u2019re dribbling all over everywhere! Use a napkin, for heaven\u2019s sake.\u201d She swabbed Mandy\u2019s face briskly, ignoring her daughter\u2019s cranky whine. Could he help? She wanted badly to believe him; she was still shaking internally and all too ready to grab at any offer of assistance.</p><p>But he was Rob Cameron\u2019s relative. And maybe he\u2019d come out to the house to talk, and maybe he\u2019d come for some other reason. He might, after all, have intervened to keep her from blasting Rob into bloody shreds, rather than to save her and the kids from Rob and his masked sidekicks.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Ernie Buchan,\u201d Menzies said, nodding toward the plate-glass window. \u201cHe, um, seemed to think that you might not want the police involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bree\u2019s mouth was dry; she sipped the lukewarm tea, trying to think. It was getting harder by the moment; her thoughts scattered like drops of quicksilver, wobbling away in a dozen directions. \u201cNot\u2014not just yet. We were at the police station half of last night. I really can\u2019t deal with any more questions tonight.\u201d She took a deep breath and stared at him directly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Rob Cameron should have kidnapped Jemmy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you d\u2014\u201d Jem started, and she whipped her head round and glared at him. He glared back, red-eyed and clench-fisted, and with a jolt of alarm she recognized the Fraser temper, about to go off with a bang.</p><p>\u201cYou do so know!\u201d he said, loudly enough that a couple of truckers at the counter turned round to look at him. \u201cI told you! He wanted me to\u2014\u201d Mandy, who had started to drop off again, jerked awake and started to wail.</p><p>\u201cI want Daddeeeee!\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s face was bright red with fury. At this, it went white.</p><p>\u201cShut up, shut up, shut up!\u201d he shrieked at Mandy, who yelped in terror and screamed louder, trying to scramble up Brianna\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cDADDEEE!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem!\u201d Lionel Menzies was on his feet, reaching for the boy, but Jem was absolutely beside himself, literally hopping up and down with rage. The entire restaurant was gaping at them.</p> <p>\u201cGo AWAY!\u201d Jem roared at Menzies. \u201cDAMMIT! Don\u2019t you touch me! Don\u2019t touch my mam!\u201d And, in an excess of passion, he kicked Menzies hard on the shin.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem!\u201d Bree had a grip on the struggling, bawling Mandy but couldn\u2019t reach Jem before he picked up his dish of ice cream, flung it at the wall, and then ran out of the caf\u00e9, crashing the door open so hard that a man and woman on the verge of entering were forced to leap aside to avoid being knocked over as he rocketed past.</p><p>Brianna sat down quite suddenly, as all the blood left her head. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us . . .</p><p>The room was silent, save for Mandy\u2019s sobbing, though this was dying down as her panic subsided. She burrowed into Brianna\u2019s chest, burying her face in the padded coat.</p><p>\u201cHush, sweetie,\u201d Bree whispered, bending her head so that Mandy\u2019s curls brushed her lips. \u201cHush, now. It\u2019s all right. Everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>A muffled mumble ended with a tearful \u201c. . . Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bree said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll see Daddy soon.\u201d</p><p>Lionel Menzies cleared his throat. He\u2019d sat down to massage his shin but left off doing this to gesture toward the door.</p><p>\u201cHad I . . . better go after Jem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s all right . . . I mean . . . he\u2019s with Ernie. I can see him.\u201d They were in the parking lot, just visible in the glow of light from the neon sign. Jem had cannoned into Ernie, who was coming toward the restaurant, and was clinging to him like a limpet. As Brianna watched, Ernie, an experienced father, knelt down and hugged Jem to him, patting his back and smoothing his hair, talking earnestly to him.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d It was the waitress with Menzie\u2019s butty, her stolid face melted into sympathy. \u201cThe wee lassie\u2019s tired, nay doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Bree said feebly, and nodded at the shattered dish and splotch of chocolate ice cream on the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll, um, pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, dinna fash, lass,\u201d the waitress said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ve had weans. I can see ye\u2019ve got enough trouble to be goin\u2019 on with. Let me fetch ye oot a nice cup o\u2019 tea.\u201d</p><p>She trundled off. Without speaking, Lionel Menzies popped the tab on his can of Irn-Bru and shoved it in her direction. She picked it up and gulped it. The advertising implied that the stuff was made from rusty iron girders salvaged from Glasgow shipyards. Only in Scotland would this have been considered a good selling point, she reflected. But it was about half sugar, and the glucose hit her bloodstream like the elixir of life.</p><p>Menzies nodded, seeing her straighten up like a wilting flower revived.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Roger?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, just as softly; Mandy had given a final hiccuping sigh and fallen heavily asleep, face still buried in Brianna\u2019s coat. She twitched the quilted fabric aside so Mandy wouldn\u2019t suffocate. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know when he\u2019s coming back.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, looking unhappy and strangely embarrassed; he was having trouble meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI see. Mmphm. Was it\u2014I mean, did he . . . leave because of what Rob . . . er . . . did to Jem?\u201d His voice dropped even lower and she blinked at him. Rising blood sugar had brought her thoughts back into focus, though, and suddenly the penny dropped, and the blood rushed into her face.</p><p>He thought Rob had abducted Jemmy in order to\u2014and Jemmy had said, \u201cYou know what he did,\u201d and she\u2019d shut him up sharp . . . and she\u2019d said she didn\u2019t want the police involved . . . oh, dear Lord. She took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over her face, wondering whether it was better to let him think Rob had molested Jemmy\u2014and was now trying to murder her in order to cover that up\u2014or to tell him some halfway believable version of some part of the truth.</p><p>\u201cRob came to my house last night and tried to rape me,\u201d she said, leaning over Mandy\u2019s head in order to keep her voice low enough to escape the flapping ears of the truckers sitting at the counter, who were glancing covertly over their shoulders at her. \u201cHe\u2019d already taken Jem, and Roger had left to try to find him. We thought he\u2019d taken Jem away to . . . to Orkney.\u201d That seems far enough. \u201cI . . . left messages; I expect Roger\u2019ll be back any time now\u2014as soon as he hears that Jemmy\u2019s been found.\u201d She crossed her fingers under the table.</p><p>Menzies\u2019s face went blank, all his previous assumptions colliding with new ones.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014he\u2014oh.\u201d He paused for a moment, mechanically took a swallow of her cold tea, and made a face. \u201cYou mean,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cthat you think Rob took Jem in order to lure your husband away, so that he . . . ehm . . . could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She seized on this suggestion gratefully.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . those other people. With the\u2014\u201d He passed a hand vaguely over his head, indicating the balaclavas. \u201cWhat on earth . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said firmly. She wasn\u2019t going to mention the Spanish gold unless or until she had to. The fewer people who knew about that, the better. And as for the other thing . . .</p><p>But the mention of \u201cthose other people\u201d reminded her of something, and she groped in her capacious pocket, drawing out the balaclava that she\u2019d snatched off the man who\u2019d broken the window with the rifle. She\u2019d caught the barest glimpse of his face amidst the shifting light and shadow and had had no time to think about it. But now she did, and a fresh qualm went through her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a man named Michael Callahan?\u201d she asked, trying to keep her voice casual. Menzies glanced at the balaclava, then at her, eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. He\u2019s an archaeologist, something to do with ORCA\u2014Orkney Research Centre, I mean. Orkney . . . You\u2019re no telling me he was with the people who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty sure. I saw his face for just a second when I pulled this off him. And\u201d\u2014she grimaced in distaste, plucking a tuft of sandy hair from the inside of the balaclava\u2014\u201capparently that\u2019s not all I pulled off him. Rob knows him. He came out to Lallybroch to give us an opinion on some ruins up behind the house, and stayed to supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dearie me,\u201d Menzies murmured, seeming to sink back into his seat. He took off his glasses and massaged his forehead for a bit. She watched him think, feeling increasingly remote.</p><p>The waitress hove to and put down a fresh cup of hot, milky tea, already sugared and stirred. Brianna thanked her and sat sipping it, watching the night outside. Ernie had taken Jem off in the direction of the garage, doubtless to check on his van.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you don\u2019t want trouble,\u201d Menzies said carefully at last. He\u2019d eaten half his butty; the rest of it lay on the plate, oozing ketchup in a queasy sort of way. \u201cBut really, Mrs.\u2014may I call you Brianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d she said. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d he said, nodding, and one corner of his mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know what it means in Scots,\u201d she said dryly, seeing the thought cross his face. A bree was a storm or a great disturbance.</p><p>Lionel\u2019s face broke into a half smile.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well . . . what I\u2019m thinking, Bree\u2014I hate to suggest it, but what if Rob\u2019s done some harm to Roger? Would it not be worth the questions to get the police to look for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t.\u201d She felt unutterably tired and wanted only to go home. \u201cBelieve me, he hasn\u2019t. Roger went with his\u2014his cousin, Buck. And if Rob had managed to hurt them somehow, he\u2019d certainly have gloated about that when he . . . well.\u201d She took a breath that went all the way down to her aching feet and shifted her weight, getting a solid hold on Mandy.</p><p>\u201cLionel. Tell you what. Drive us home, will you? If that lot\u2019s still lurking around, then we\u2019ll go to the police right away. If not\u2014it can wait \u2019til the morning.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it, but he was suffering from the aftereffects of shock and fatigue, too, and after more argument finally agreed, done in by her implacable stubbornness.</p><p>Ernie had telephoned for a ride, after being assured that Lionel would see them home. Lionel was tense on the way back to Lallybroch, hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel, but the Fiat\u2019s headlights showed the dooryard empty, save for a discarded tire lying in the gravel, shredded rubber spraying out like the wings of some gigantic vulture shot out of the sky.</p><p>Both the kids were sound asleep; Lionel carried Jem in, then insisted on searching the house with Bree, nailing up laths across the shattered window in the parlor while she combed the rooms\u2014again\u2014suffering d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>\u201cHad I not better spend the night?\u201d Lionel asked, hesitating at the door. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to sit up and keep watch, you know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though it took a lot of effort.</p><p>\u201cYour wife will already be wondering where you are. No, you\u2019ve done enough\u2014more than enough for us. Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll . . . take steps in the morning. I just want the kids to be able to have a good night\u2019s sleep in their own beds.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, lips drawn in in worry, and glanced round the foyer, its gleaming walnut paneling serene in the lamplight, even the English saber slashes somehow grown homely and peaceful with age.</p><p>\u201cDo you maybe have family\u2014friends\u2014in America?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cI mean, it might not be a bad idea to get right away for a bit, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking that myself. Thanks, Lionel. Good night.\u201d</p><p>ALL MY LOVE</p><p>SHE WAS SHAKING. Had been shaking ever since Lionel Menzies left. With a faint sense of abstraction, she held out her hand, fingers spread, and watched it vibrate like a tuning fork. Then, irritated, made a fist and smacked it hard into the palm of her other hand. Smacked it again and again, clenching her teeth in fury, until she had to stop, gasping for breath, her palm tingling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said under her breath, teeth still clenched. \u201cOkay.\u201d The red haze had lifted like a cloud, leaving a pile of cold, icy little thoughts under it.</p><p>We have to go.</p><p>Where?</p><p>And when?</p> <p>And the coldest of all:</p><p>What about Roger?</p><p>She was sitting in the study, the wood paneling glowing softly in the candlelight. There was a perfectly good reading lamp, as well as the ceiling fixture, but she\u2019d lit the big candle instead. Roger liked to use that when he wrote late at night, writing down the songs and poems he\u2019d memorized, sometimes with a goose quill. He said it helped him recall the words, bringing back an echo of the time where he\u2019d learned them.</p><p>The candle\u2019s smell of hot wax brought back an echo of him. If she closed her eyes, she could hear him, humming low in his throat as he worked, stopping now and then to cough or clear his damaged throat. Her fingers rubbed softly over the wooden desk, summoning the touch of the rope scar on his throat, passing round to cup the back of his head, bury her fingers in the thick black warmth of his hair, bury her face in his chest . . .</p><p>She was shaking again, this time with silent sobs. She curled her fist again, but this time just breathed until it stopped.</p> <p>\u201cThis will not do,\u201d she said out loud, sniffed deeply, and, clicking on the light, she blew out the candle and reached for a sheet of paper and a ballpoint pen.</p><p>WIPING THE TEARS off her face with the back of her hand, she folded the letter carefully. Envelope? No. If anybody found this, an envelope wouldn\u2019t stop them. She turned the letter over and, sniffing, wrote Roger, in her best parochial-school penmanship.</p><p>She groped in her pocket for a Kleenex and blew her nose, feeling obscurely that she should do something more . . . ceremonial? . . . with the letter, but other than putting it in the fireplace and touching a match to it so the north wind would carry it, as her parents had done with her childhood letters to Santa, nothing occurred to her.</p><p>In her present state of mind, she found it comforting that Santa had always come through.</p><p>She opened the big drawer and was groping at the back for the catch that released the secret hiding place when something else did occur to her. She slammed the big drawer shut and yanked open the wide shallow one in the center, which held pens and paper clips and rubber bands\u2014and a lipstick left in the downstairs powder room by some random dinner guest.</p><p>It was pink but a dark pink, and it didn\u2019t matter that it clashed with her hair. She applied it hastily by feel, then pressed her lips carefully over the word Roger.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, and, touching the pink kiss with one fingertip, opened the big drawer again and pushed the spot that unlocked the hiding place. It wasn\u2019t a secret drawer but a space built into the underside of the desk. A sliding panel let you reach up into a shallow hole about six inches by eight.</p><p>When Roger discovered it, it had three stamps printed with the head of Queen Victoria in it\u2014unfortunately, all run-of-the-mill late-Victorian postage rather than a helpfully valuable One-Penny Black\u2014and a wispy curl of a child\u2019s fine blond hair, faded with age, tied with white thread and a tiny scrap of heather. They\u2019d left the stamps there\u2014who knew, maybe they would be valuable by the time another few generations inherited the desk\u2014but she\u2019d put the lock of hair between the pages of her Bible and said a small prayer for the child and his\u2014her?\u2014parents, whenever she came across it.</p><p>The letter fit easily into the heart of the old desk. A moment of panic: should she have included locks of the kids\u2019 hair? No, she thought fiercely. Don\u2019t be morbid. Sentimental, yes. Morbid, no.</p><p>\u201cLord, let us all be together again,\u201d she whispered, pushing down the fear, and, closing her eyes, shut the panel with a little click.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t opened her eyes right as she withdrew her hand, she\u2019d never have seen it. Just the edge of something hanging down at the back of the big drawer, barely visible. She reached up and found an envelope, far back, attached to the underside of the desk with Scotch tape. This had dried with age; her earlier slamming of the drawer had probably loosened it.</p><p>She turned the envelope over with a sense of something happening in a dream and was, dreamlike, not surprised to see the initials B.E.R. written on the yellowed envelope. Very slowly, she opened it.</p><p>Dearest Deadeye, she read, and felt each tiny hair on her body rise slow and silent, one at a time.</p><p>Dearest Deadeye,</p> <p>You\u2019ve just left me, after our wonderful afternoon among the clay pigeons. My ears are still ringing. Whenever we shoot, I\u2019m torn between immense pride in your ability, envy of it\u2014and fear that you may someday need it.</p><p>What a queer feeling it is, writing this. I know that you\u2019ll eventually learn who\u2014and perhaps, what\u2014you are. But I have no idea how you\u2019ll come to that knowledge. Am I about to reveal you to yourself, or will this be old news when you find it? If we\u2019re both lucky, I may be able to tell you in person, when you\u2019re a little older. And if we\u2019re very lucky, it will come to nothing. But I daren\u2019t risk your life in that hope, and you\u2019re not yet old enough that I could tell you.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, sweetheart, that\u2019s terribly melodramatic. And the last thing I want to do is alarm you. I have all the confidence in the world in you. But I am your father and thus prey to the fears that afflict all parents\u2014that something dreadful and unpreventable will happen to one\u2019s child, and you powerless to protect her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Daddy?\u201d She rubbed hard at the back of her neck to ease the prickling there.</p><p>Men who\u2019ve lived through war usually don\u2019t talk about it, save to other soldiers. Men from my part of the Service don\u2019t talk to anyone, and not only because of the Official Secrets Act. But silence eats at the soul. I had to talk to someone, and my old friend Reggie Wakefield became my confessor.</p><p>(That\u2019s the Reverend Reginald Wakefield, a Church of Scotland minister who lives in Inverness. If you\u2019re reading this letter, I\u2019ll very likely be dead. If Reggie is still alive and you are of age, go to see him; he has my permission to tell you anything he knows at that point.)</p><p>\u201cOf age?\u201d Hastily, she tried to calculate when this had been written. Clay pigeons. Sherman\u2019s\u2014the shooting range where he\u2019d taught her to use a shotgun. The shotgun had been a present for her fifteenth birthday. And her father had died soon after her seventeenth birthday.</p><p>The Service has nothing directly to do with this; don\u2019t go looking in that direction for information. I mention it only because that\u2019s where I learned what a conspiracy looks like. I also met a great many people in the war, many of them in high places, and many of them strange; the two overlap more often than one might wish.</p><p>Why is this so hard to say? If I\u2019m dead, your mother may have told you already the story of your birth. She promised me that she would never speak of it, so long as I lived, and I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t. If I\u2019m dead, though, she might\u2014</p><p>Forgive me, darling. It\u2019s hard to say, because I love your mother and I love you. And you are my daughter forever, but you were sired by another man.</p><p>All right, that\u2019s out. Seeing it in black and white, my impulse is to rip this paper to bits and burn them, but I won\u2019t. You have to know.</p><p>Shortly after the war ended, your mother and I came to Scotland. Something of a second honeymoon. She went out one afternoon to pick flowers\u2014and never came back. I searched\u2014everyone searched\u2014for months, but there was no sign, and eventually the police stopped\u2014well, in fact they didn\u2019t stop suspecting me of murdering her, damn them, but they grew tired of harassing me. I had begun to put my life back together, made up my mind to move on, perhaps leave Britain\u2014and then Claire came back. Three years after her disappearance, she showed up in the Highlands, filthy, starved, battered\u2014and pregnant.</p><p>Pregnant, she said, by a Jacobite Highlander from 1743 named James Fraser. I won\u2019t go into all that was said between us; it was a long time ago and it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014save for the fact that IF your mother was telling the truth, and did indeed travel back in time, then you may have the ability to do it, too. I hope you don\u2019t. But if you should\u2014Lord, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m writing this in all seriousness. But I look at you, darling, with the sun on your ruddy hair, and I see him. I can\u2019t deny that.</p><p>Well. It took a long time. A very long time. But your mother never changed her story, and though we didn\u2019t speak about it after a while, it became obvious that she wasn\u2019t mentally deranged (which I had rather naturally assumed to be the case, initially). And I began . . . to look for him.</p><p>Now I must digress for a moment; forgive me. I think you won\u2019t have heard of the Brahan Seer. Colorful as he was\u2014if, in fact, he existed\u2014he\u2019s not really known much beyond those circles with a taste for the more outlandish aspects of Scottish history. Reggie, though, is a man of immense curiosity, as well as immense learning, and was fascinated by the Seer\u2014one Kenneth MacKenzie, who lived in the seventeenth century (maybe), and who made a great number of prophecies about this and that, sometimes at the behest of the Earl of Seaforth.</p><p>Naturally, the only prophecies mentioned in connection with this man are the ones that appeared to come true: he predicted, for instance, that when there were five bridges over the River Ness, the world would fall into chaos. In August 1939 the fifth bridge over the Ness was opened, and in September, Hitler invaded Poland. Quite enough chaos for anyone.</p><p>The Seer came to a sticky end, as prophets often do (do please remember that, darling, will you?), burnt to death in a spiked barrel of tar at the instigation of Lady Seaforth\u2014to whom he had unwisely prophesied that her husband was having affairs with various ladies while away in Paris. (That one was likely true, in my opinion.)</p><p>Amongst his lesser-known prophecies, though, was one called the Fraser Prophecy. There isn\u2019t a great deal known about this, and what there is is rambling and vague, as prophecies usually are, the Old Testament notwithstanding. The only relevant bit, I think, is this: \u201cThe last of Lovat\u2019s line will rule Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Pause if you will, now, dear, and look at the paper I am enclosing with this letter.</p><p>Fumbling and clumsy with shock, she dropped the sheets altogether and had to retrieve them from the floor. It was easy to tell which paper he meant; the paper was flimsier, a photocopy of a handwritten chart\u2014some sort of family tree\u2014the writing not her father\u2019s.</p><p>Yes. Well. This bit of disturbing information came into my hands from Reggie, who\u2019d had it from the wife of a fellow named Stuart Lachlan. Lachlan had died suddenly, and as his widow was clearing out his desk, she found this and decided to pass it on to Reggie, knowing that he and Lachlan had shared an interest in history and in the Lovat family, they being local to Inverness; the clan seat is in Beauly. Reggie, of course, recognized the names.</p><p>You likely know nothing about the Scottish aristocracy, but I knew Simon Lovat, Lord Lovat that is, in the war\u2014he was Commandos, then Special Forces. We weren\u2019t close friends but knew each other casually, in the way of business, you might say.</p><p>\u201cWhose business?\u201d she said aloud, suspicious. \u201cHis, or yours?\u201d She could just see her father\u2019s face, with the hidden smile in the corner of his mouth, keeping something back but letting you know it was there.</p><p>The Frasers of Lovat have a fairly straightforward line of descent, until we come to Old Simon\u2014well, they\u2019re all called Simon\u2014the one they call the Old Fox, who was executed for treason after the Jacobite Rebellion\u2014the \u201945, they call it. (There\u2019s quite a bit about him in my book on the Jacobites; don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever read that, but it\u2019s there, should you feel curious.)</p><p>\u201cShould I feel curious,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHa.\u201d Brianna sensed a definite, if muted, note of accusation there and pressed her lips together, as much annoyed at herself for not having read her father\u2019s books yet as at him for mentioning it.</p><p>Simon was one of the more colorful Frasers, in assorted ways. He had three wives but was not famous for fidelity. He did have a few legitimate children, and God knows how many illegitimate ones (though two illegitimate sons were acknowledged), but his heir was Young Simon, known as the Young Fox. Young Simon survived the Rising, though attainted and stripped of his property. He eventually got most of it back through the courts, but the struggle took him most of a long life, and while he married, he did so at a very advanced age and had no children. His younger brother, Archibald, inherited, but then died childless, as well.</p><p>So Archibald was the \u201clast of Lovat\u2019s line\u201d\u2014there\u2019s a direct line of descent between him and the Fraser of Lovat who would have been concurrent with the Brahan Seer\u2014but clearly he wasn\u2019t the Scottish ruler foreseen.</p><p>You see the chart, though. Whoever made it has listed the two illegitimate sons, as well as Young Simon and his brother. Alexander and Brian, born to different mothers. Alexander entered the priesthood and became the abbot of a monastery in France. No known children. But Brian\u2014</p><p>She tasted bile and thought she might throw up. But Brian\u2014She closed her eyes in reflex, but it didn\u2019t matter. The chart was burned on the inside of her eyelids.</p><p>She stood up, pushing back the chair with a screak, and lurched out into the hallway, heart thundering in her ears. Swallowing repeatedly, she went to the lobby and got the shotgun from its place behind the coat rack. She felt a little better with it in hand.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t right.\u201d She hadn\u2019t realized that she\u2019d spoken aloud; her own voice startled her. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d she repeated, in a low, fierce voice. \u201cThey left people out. What about Aunt Jenny? She had six kids! What about them?\u201d</p><p>She was stomping down the hallway, gun in hand, swinging the barrel from side to side as though she expected Rob Cameron\u2014or somebody, and the thought made her shudder\u2014to jump out of the parlor or the kitchen or come sliding down the banister. That thought made her look up the stairs\u2014she\u2019d left all the lights on when she came down from tucking in the kids\u2014but the landing was empty and no noise came from above. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A little calmer, she searched the ground floor carefully, testing every door and window. And the priest\u2019s hole, whose empty blackness gaped mockingly up at her.</p><p>Jem and Mandy were all right. She knew they were. But she still went upstairs, soft-footed, and stood by their beds for a long time, watching the pale glow of the Snow White night-light on their faces.</p><p>The longcase clock in the hall below struck the hour, and then a single bong! She drew a deep breath and went down to finish reading her father\u2019s letter.</p><p>The current line of Fraser of Lovat is descended from a collateral branch; presumably the Fraser Prophecy isn\u2019t referring to one of them\u2014though there are plenty of heirs in that line.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know who drew this chart, but I do intend to find out. This letter is in case I don\u2019t. In case of a number of things.</p><p>One of those things being the possibility that your mother\u2019s story is true\u2014I still have difficulty believing it, when I wake in the morning beside her and everything is so normal. But late at night, when I\u2019m alone with the documents . . . Well, why not admit it? I found the record of their marriage. James Alexander Malcolm MacKenzie Fraser and Claire Elizabeth Beauchamp. I\u2019m not sure whether to be grateful or outraged that she didn\u2019t marry him using my name.</p><p>Forgive me, I\u2019m rambling. It\u2019s hard to keep emotion out of it, but I\u2019ll try. The essence of what I\u2019m saying is this: if you can indeed go back in time (and possibly return), you are a person of very great interest to a number of people, for assorted reasons. Should anyone in the more shadowed realm of government be halfway convinced that you are what you may be, you would be watched. Possibly approached. (In earlier centuries, the British government pressed men into service. They still do, if less obviously.)</p><p>That\u2019s a very remote contingency, but it is a real one; I must mention it.</p><p>There are private parties who would also have a deep interest in you for this reason\u2014and evidently there is someone who has spotted you and is watching. The chart showing your line of descent, with dates, indicates that much. It also suggests that this person\u2019s or persons\u2019 interest may be a concern with the Fraser Prophecy. What could be more intriguing to that sort of person than the prospect of someone who is \u201cthe last of Lovat\u2019s line\u201d and is also a time traveler? These sorts of people\u2014I know them well\u2014invariably believe in mystic powers of all sorts\u2014nothing would draw them more powerfully than the conviction that you hold such power.</p> <p>Such people are usually harmless. But they can be very dangerous indeed.</p><p>If I find whoever drew this chart, I will question them and do my best to neutralize any possible threat to you. But as I say\u2014I know the look of a conspiracy. Nutters of this sort thrive in company. I might miss one.</p><p>\u201cNeutralize them,\u201d she murmured, the chill in her hands spreading through her arms and chest, crystallizing around her heart. She had no doubt at all what he\u2019d meant by that, the bland matter-of-factness of the term notwithstanding. And had he found him\u2014them?</p><p>Don\u2019t\u2014I repeat, don\u2019t\u2014go anywhere near the Service or anyone connected with it. At best, they\u2019d think you insane. But if you are indeed what you may be, the last people who should ever know it are the funny buggers, as we used to be known during the war.</p><p>And if worse should come to worst\u2014and you can do it\u2014then the past may be your best avenue of escape. I have no idea how it works; neither does your mother, or at least she says so. I hope I may have given you a few tools to help, if that should be necessary.</p><p>And . . . there\u2019s him. Your mother said that Fraser sent her back to me, knowing that I would protect her\u2014and you. She thought that he died immediately afterward. He did not. I looked for him, and I found him. And, like him, perhaps I send you back, knowing\u2014as he knew of me\u2014that he will protect you with his life.</p> <p>I will love you forever, Brianna. And I know whose child you truly are.</p><p>With all my love,</p><p>Dad</p><p>APPARITION</p><p>THE LOCHABER DISTRICT, according to the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board (as interpreted by Brianna), is a \u201chigh glaciated landscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means it goes up and down a lot,\u201d Roger explained to Buck, as they fought their way through what he thought was part of the Locheil Forest, looking for the edge of Loch Lochy.</p><p>\u201cYe don\u2019t say?\u201d Buck glanced bleakly over his shoulder at the distant hump of Ben Nevis, then back at Roger. \u201cI\u2019d not noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheer up, it\u2019s all downhill for a bit now. And the midgies are all dead wi\u2019 the cold. Count your blessings.\u201d Roger felt unaccountably cheerful this morning\u2014perhaps only because the walking was downhill, after a strenuous week of combing the Cameron clan lands, a bewildering network of corries, tarns, moraines, and Munros, those deceptive summits with their gently rounded tops and their unspeakable slopes. Thank God no one lived on top of them.</p> <p>Perhaps also because, while they hadn\u2019t found Jem or any trace of him, it was progress, of a sort. The Camerons on the whole had been hospitable, after the initial surprise, and they\u2019d had the luck to find a tacksman of Lochiel, the clan chieftain, who\u2019d sent a man to Tor Castle for them. Word had come back a day later: no word of a stranger matching Rob Cameron\u2019s description\u2014though, in fact, Rob looked like half the people Roger had met in the last few days\u2014or Jem\u2019s, he being a lot more noticeable.</p><p>They\u2019d worked their way back along the shores of Loch Arkaig\u2014the fastest way for someone to travel from the Great Glen, if heading for the ocean. But no word of a boat stolen or hired, and Roger began to feel that Cameron had not, after all, sought refuge or help among his ancient clan\u2014a relief, on the whole.</p><p>\u201cBlessings, is it?\u201d Buck rubbed a hand over his face. Neither of them had shaved in a week, and he looked as red-eyed and grubby as Roger felt. He scratched his jaw consideringly. \u201cAye, well. A fox took a shit next to me last night, but I didna step in it this morning. I suppose that\u2019ll do, for a start.\u201d</p><p>The next day and night dampened Roger\u2019s mood of optimism somewhat: it rained incessantly, and they spent the night under heaps of half-dry bracken on the edge of a black tarn, emerging at dawn chilled and frowsty, to the shrieks of plovers and killdeer.</p><p>He hesitated momentarily as they rode past the place where they might turn toward Cranesmuir; he wanted badly to talk again with Dr. McEwan. His hand found his throat, thumb stroking the scar. \u201cMaybe,\u201d the healer had said. \u201cJust maybe.\u201d But McEwan couldn\u2019t aid them in looking for Jem; that visit would have to wait.</p><p>Still, he felt his heart rise as they came over the pass and saw Lallybroch below. It was bittersweet, coming home to a home that was not his and might never be again. But it promised refuge and succor, if only temporarily\u2014and it promised hope, at least in these last few minutes before they reached the door.</p><p>\u201cOch, it\u2019s you!\u201d It was Jenny Fraser who opened the door, her look of wariness changing to one of pleased welcome. Roger heard Buck behind him making a small humming noise of approval at sight of her, and, despite his determination not to hope too much, Roger felt his own spirits rise.</p><p>\u201cAnd this will be your kinsman?\u201d She curtsied to Buck. \u201cWelcome to ye, sir. Come ben; I\u2019ll call Taggie to mind the horses.\u201d She turned in a flicker of white apron and petticoats, beckoning them to follow. \u201cDa\u2019s in the speak-a-word,\u201d she called over her shoulder as she headed for the kitchen. \u201cHe\u2019s something for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie and . . . this would be also Mr. MacKenzie, aye?\u201d Brian Fraser came out of the study, smiling, and offered Buck his hand. Roger could see him looking Buck over with close attention, a slight frown between his dark brows. Not disapproval\u2014puzzlement, as though he knew Buck from somewhere and was trying to think where.</p><p>Roger knew exactly where and felt again that peculiar quiver he\u2019d felt on meeting Dougal MacKenzie. The resemblance between father and son was by no means instantly striking\u2014their coloring was very different, and Roger thought most of Buck\u2019s features came from his mother\u2014but there was a fugitive similarity, nonetheless, something in their manner. Men cocksure of their charm\u2014and no less charming for knowing it.</p><p>Buck was smiling, making commonplace courtesies, complimenting the house and its estate. . . . The puzzlement faded from Brian\u2019s eyes, and he invited them to sit, calling down the hall to the kitchen for someone to bring them a bite and a dram.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Brian said, pulling out the chair from behind his desk in order to sit with them. \u201cAs ye havena got the lad with ye, I see he\u2019s not found yet. Have ye heard any news of him, though?\u201d He looked from Buck to Roger, worried but hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger said, and cleared his throat. \u201cNot a word. But\u2014your daughter said that you . . . might have heard something?\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s face changed at once, lighting a little.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nay so much heard anything, but . . .\u201d He rose and went to rummage in the desk, still talking.</p><p>\u201cA captain from the garrison came by here twa, three days ago, wi\u2019 a small party of soldiers. The new man in charge\u2014what was his name, Jenny?\u201d For Jenny had come in with a tray, this holding a teapot, cups, a small bottle of whisky, and a plate of cake. The smell made Roger\u2019s stomach rumble.</p><p>\u201cWho? Oh, the new redcoat captain? Randall, he said. Jonathan Randall.\u201d Her color rose a little, and her father smiled to see it. Roger felt the smile freeze on his own face.</p><p>\u201cAye, he took to you, lass. Wouldna be surprised if he came back one of these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious little good it will do him if he does,\u201d Jenny snapped. \u201cHave ye lost that thing, an athair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sure I put . . .\u201d Brian\u2019s voice trailed off as he scrabbled in the drawer. \u201cOh. Erm, aye.\u201d He coughed, hand in the drawer, and, through his shock, Roger realized what the trouble was. The desk had a secret compartment. Evidently Brian had put the \u201cthing,\u201d whatever it was, in the hiding place and was now wondering how to get it out again without revealing the secret to his visitors.</p><p>Roger rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWill ye pardon me, mistress?\u201d he asked, bowing to Jenny. \u201cI\u2019d forgot something in my saddlebag. Come with me, aye?\u201d he added to Buck. \u201cIt\u2019s maybe in with your things.\u201d</p><p>Jenny looked surprised but nodded, and Roger blundered out, Buck making little grunts of annoyance at his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil\u2019s wrong wi\u2019 you?\u201d Buck said, the minute they were out the door. \u201cYe went white as a sheet in there, and ye still look like a fish that\u2019s been dead a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like one,\u201d Roger said tersely. \u201cI know Captain Randall\u2014or, rather, I know a lot of things about him. Leave it that he\u2019s the last person I\u2019d want to have any knowledge of Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Buck\u2019s face went blank, then firmed. \u201cAye, well. We\u2019ll see what it is he brought, and then we\u2019ll go and have it out with him if we think he might have the lad.\u201d</p><p>What it is he brought. Roger fought back all the horrible things that phrase conjured\u2014Jem\u2019s ear, a finger, a lock of his hair\u2014because if it had been anything like that, surely the Frasers wouldn\u2019t be calm about it. But if Randall had brought some hideous token in a box?</p><p>\u201cWhy, though?\u201d Buck was frowning, plainly trying to read Roger\u2019s expression, which, judging from Buck\u2019s own, must be appalling. \u201cWhy would this man mean you and the lad ill? He\u2019s never met ye, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Roger said, choking down his feelings, \u201cis an excellent question. But the man is a\u2014do you know what a sadist is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s plainly something ye dinna want close to your wean. Here, sir! We\u2019ll be taking those in, thank ye kindly.\u201d They\u2019d come right round the house by now, and McTaggart the hired man was coming down the path from the stable, their saddlebags in either hand.</p><p>McTaggart looked surprised but surrendered the heavy bags gladly and went back to his work.</p><p>\u201cI ken ye just wanted to get us out of there so to give your man a bit of privacy to work the secret drawer,\u201d Buck remarked. \u201cAnd he kens that fine. Do we need to take in something, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about\u2014\u201d Buck grinned at him, and Roger dismissed the question with an irritable gesture. \u201cYes. We\u2019ll give Miss Fraser the cheese I bought yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Mrs. Jenny.\u201d Buck made the humming noise again. \u201cI wouldna blame Captain Randall. That skin! And those bubs, come to that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up right this minute!\u201d</p><p>Buck did, shocked out of his jocularity.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, in quite a different tone. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Roger unclenched his fist, with an effort.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bloody long story; I haven\u2019t time to tell it to ye now. But it\u2019s\u2014something I know from the other end. From my time. In a year or so, Randall\u2019s coming back here. And he\u2019s going to do something terrible. And, God help me, I don\u2019t think I can stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething terrible,\u201d Buck repeated slowly. His eyes were boring into Roger\u2019s own, dark as serpentine. \u201cTo that bonnie wee lass? And ye think ye can\u2019t stop it? Why, man, how can ye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up,\u201d Roger repeated doggedly. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later, aye?\u201d</p><p>Buck puffed out his cheeks, still staring at Roger, then blew out his breath with a sound of disgust and shook his head, but he picked up his saddlebag and followed without further argument.</p><p>The cheese\u2014a thing the size of Roger\u2019s outstretched hand, wrapped in fading leaves\u2014was received with pleasure and taken off to the kitchen, leaving Roger and Buck alone once more with Brian Fraser. Fraser had regained his own composure and, picking up a tiny cloth-wrapped parcel from his desk, put it gently in Roger\u2019s hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too light to be a finger . . .</p><p>\u201cCaptain Randall said that Captain Buncombe sent word out wi\u2019 all the patrols, and one of them came across this wee bawbee and sent it back to Fort William. None of them ever saw such a thing before, but because of the name, they were thinking it might have to do wi\u2019 your lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name?\u201d Roger untied the cord and the cloth fell open. For an instant, he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was seeing. He picked it up; it was light as a feather, dangling from his fingers.</p><p>Two disks, made of something like pressed cardboard, threaded onto a bit of light woven cord. One round, colored red\u2014the other was green and octagonal.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, Christ Jesus.\u201d</p><p>J. W. MacKenzie was printed on both disks, along with a number and two letters. He turned the red disk gently over with a shaking fingertip and read what he already knew was stamped there.</p><p>RAF</p><p>He was holding the dog tags of a Royal Air Force flier. Circa World War II.</p><p>AMPHISBAENA</p> <p>\u201cYE CANNA BE SURE those things name your father.\u201d Buck nodded at the dog tags, their cord still wrapped round Roger\u2019s hand, the tiny disks themselves folded tight in his palm. \u201cHow many MacKenzies are there, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots.\u201d Roger sat down on a big lichen-covered boulder. They were at the top of the hill that rose behind Lallybroch; the broch itself stood on the slope just below them, its conical roof a broad black whorl of slates. \u201cBut not so bloody many who flew for the Royal Air Force in World War Two. And even fewer who disappeared without a trace. As for those who might be time travelers . . .\u201d</p><p>Roger couldn\u2019t remember what he\u2019d said when he saw the dog tags or what Brian Fraser had said to him. When he\u2019d started to notice things again, he was sitting in Brian\u2019s big wheel-backed chair with a stoneware mug of hot tea cupped between his hands and the entire household crammed into the doorway, regarding him with looks ranging from compassion to curiosity. Buck was squatting in front of him, frowning in what might have been concern or simply curiosity.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Roger had said, cleared his throat, and set the tea undrunk on the desk. His hands throbbed from the heat of the cup. \u201cRather a shock. I\u2014thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it something to do wi\u2019 your wee boy, then?\u201d Jenny Fraser had asked, deep-blue eyes dark with concern.</p><p>\u201cI think so, yes.\u201d He\u2019d got his wits back now and rose stiffly, nodding to Brian. \u201cThank ye, sir. I canna thank ye enough for all ye\u2019ve done for me\u2014for us. I . . . need to think a bit what\u2019s to do now. If ye\u2019ll excuse me, Mistress Fraser?\u201d</p> <p>Jenny nodded, not taking her eyes from his face but shooing the maids and the cook away from the door so he could pass through it. Buck had followed him, murmuring reassuring things to the multitude, and come along with him, not speaking until they reached the solitude of the craggy hilltop. Where Roger had explained just what the dog tags were and to whom they had belonged.</p><p>\u201cWhy two?\u201d Buck asked, reaching out a tentative finger to touch the tags. \u201cAnd why are they different colors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo in case one was destroyed by whatever killed you,\u201d Roger said, taking a deep breath. \u201cThe colors\u2014they\u2019re made of pressed cardboard treated with different chemicals\u2014substances, I mean. One resists water and the other resists fire, but I couldn\u2019t tell ye which is which.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of technicalities made it just barely possible to speak. Buck, with unaccustomed delicacy, was waiting for Roger to bring up the unspeakable.</p><p>How did the tags turn up here? And when\u2014and under what circumstances\u2014had they become detached from J(eremiah) W(alter)MacKenzie, Roman Catholic, serial number 448397651, RAF?</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2014my mother-in-law\u2014I told ye about her, did I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bit, aye. A seer, was she?\u201d</p><p>Roger laughed shortly. \u201cAye, like I am. Like you are. Easy to be a seer if what you see has already happened.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s already happened . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said out loud, and curled over, pressing the fist that held the dog tags hard against his forehead.</p><p>\u201cAll right, there?\u201d Buck asked after a moment. Roger straightened up with a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cKnow the expression \u2018damned if ye do, damned if ye don\u2019t\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, though I wouldna think it was one a minister would use.\u201d Buck\u2019s mouth twitched into a half smile. \u201cAre ye not dedicated to the notion that there\u2019s always one sure way out o\u2019 damnation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minister. Aye.\u201d Roger breathed deep again. There was a lot of oxygen on a Scottish hilltop, but somehow there didn\u2019t seem quite enough just this minute. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that religion was constructed with time travelers in mind.\u201d</p><p>Buck\u2019s brows rose at that.</p><p>\u201cConstructed?\u201d he echoed, surprised. \u201cWho builds God?\u201d</p><p>That actually made Roger laugh, which made him feel a little better, if only momentarily.</p><p>\u201cWe all do,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cIf God makes man in His image, we all return the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Buck thought that one over, then nodded slowly. \u201cWouldna just say ye\u2019re wrong about that. But God\u2019s there, nonetheless, whether we ken quite what He is or not. Isn\u2019t He?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Roger wiped his knuckles under his nose, which had begun to run with the cold wind. \u201cEver hear of Saint Teresa of Avila?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Buck gave him a look. \u201cNor have I heard of a Protestant minister who has to do wi\u2019 saints.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take advice where I can get it. But St. Teresa once remarked to God, \u2018If this is how you treat your friends, no wonder you have so few of them.\u2019 God\u2019s got his own ways.\u201d</p><p>Buck smiled; it was one of his rare, unwary smiles, and it heartened Roger enough to try to come to grips with the situation.</p><p>\u201cWell, Claire\u2014my mother-in-law\u2014she told Brianna and me a good bit. About the things that happened when she went through the stones in 1743, and about things that had happened before that. Things about Captain Randall.\u201d And in sentences as brief and unemotional as he could make them, he told the story: Randall\u2019s raid on Lallybroch while Brian Fraser was away, his attack on Jenny Murray, and how Jamie Fraser\u2014newly returned from Paris and wondering what to do with his life\u2014had fought for his home and his sister\u2019s honor, been arrested and taken to Fort William, where he had been flogged nearly to death.</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d Roger said, pausing for air. He swallowed. \u201cThe second time . . . Brian was there. He thought Jamie was dead, and he had a stroke\u2014an apoplexy\u2014on the spot. He . . . died.\u201d He swallowed again. \u201cWill die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mary, and Bride.\u201d Buck crossed himself. His face had gone pale. \u201cYour man in the house? He\u2019ll be dead in a year or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Roger looked down at Lallybroch, pale and peaceful as the sheep that browsed its pastures. \u201cAnd . . . there\u2019s more. What happened later, just before the Rising.\u201d</p><p>Buck raised a hand.</p><p>\u201cI say that\u2019s more than enough. I say we go down to Fort William and do for the wicked bugger now. Preemptive action, ye might say. That\u2019s a legal term,\u201d he explained, with an air of kindly condescension.</p><p>\u201cAn appealing notion,\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cBut if we did\u2014what would happen four years from now?\u201d</p><p>Buck frowned, not comprehending.</p><p>\u201cWhen Claire came through the stones in 1743, she met\u2014will meet\u2014Jamie Fraser, an outlaw with a price on his head, coming home from France. But if what happened with Captain Randall doesn\u2019t happen\u2014Jamie won\u2019t be there. And if he isn\u2019t . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The frown grew deeper, comprehension dawning. \u201cOh, aye. I see. No Jamie, no Brianna . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Jem or Mandy,\u201d Roger finished. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Buck bent his head and massaged the flesh between his brows with two fingers. \u201cDamned if ye do, damned if ye don\u2019t, did ye say? Enough to make your head spin like a top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. But I have to do something, nonetheless.\u201d He rubbed a thumb gently over the dog tags\u2019 surfaces. \u201cI\u2019m going down to Fort William to talk to Captain Randall. I have to know where these came from.\u201d</p><p>BUCK LOOKED squiggle-eyed at the tags, lips pressed together, then switched the look to Roger.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think your lad\u2019s with your father, somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That particular thought hadn\u2019t occurred to Roger, and it shook him for a moment. He shrugged it away, though.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated more firmly. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think that maybe . . . maybe Jem\u2019s not here at all.\u201d The statement hung there in the air, revolving slowly. He glanced at Buck, who seemed to be glowering at it.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d his kinsman asked abruptly.</p><p>\u201cA, because we\u2019ve found no hint of him. And B, because now there\u2019s these.\u201d He raised the tags, the light cardboard disks lifting in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cYe sound like your wife,\u201d Buck said, half amused. \u201cShe does that, aye? Layin\u2019 things out, A, B, C, and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how Brianna\u2019s mind works,\u201d Roger said, feeling a brief surge of affection for her. \u201cShe\u2019s very logical.\u201d</p><p>And if I\u2019m right, and Jem\u2019s not here\u2014where is he? Has he gone to another time\u2014or did he not travel at all? As though the word \u201clogical\u201d had triggered it, a whole array of horrifying possibilities opened out before him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m thinking\u2014we were both concentrating on the name \u2018Jeremiah\u2019 when we came through, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d He twirled the cord between his fingers, making the disks spin slowly. \u201cWhat if we got the wrong Jeremiah? That was my father\u2019s name, too. And\u2014and if Rob Cameron didn\u2019t take Jem through the stones\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he not?\u201d Buck interrupted sharply. He transferred the glower to Roger. \u201cHis truck was there at Craigh na Dun. He wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlainly he wanted us to think he\u2019d gone through. As to why\u2014\u201d He choked on the thought. Before he could clear his throat, Buck finished it for him.</p><p>\u201cTo get us away, so he\u2019d have your missus to himself.\u201d His face darkened with anger\u2014part of it aimed at Roger. \u201cI told her yon man had a hot eye for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he does,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cBut think, aye? Beyond whatever he may have had in mind with regard to Brianna\u2014\u201d The mere words conjured up pictures that made the blood shoot up into his head. \u201cWhatever he had in mind,\u201d he repeated, as calmly as he could, \u201che likely also wanted to see whether it was true. About the stones. About whether we\u2014or anyone\u2014really could go through. Seeing\u2019s believing, after all.\u201d</p><p>Buck blew out his cheeks, considering.</p><p>\u201cYe think he was there, maybe? Watching to see if we disappeared?\u201d</p><p>Roger shrugged, momentarily unable to speak for the thoughts clotting his brain.</p><p>Buck\u2019s fists were clenched on his knees. He looked down at the house, then behind him at the rising mountains, and Roger knew exactly what he was thinking. He cleared his throat with a hacking growl.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been gone for two weeks,\u201d Roger said. \u201cIf he meant Brianna harm . . . he\u2019ll have tried.\u201d Jesus. If he\u2014no. \u201cShe\u2019ll not have let him harm her or the kids,\u201d he went on, as steadily as he could. \u201cIf he tried anything, he\u2019ll either be in jail or buried under the broch.\u201d He lifted his chin toward the tower below, and Buck snorted in reluctant amusement.</p><p>\u201cSo, then. Aye, I want to rush straight back to Craigh na Dun, too. But think, man. We ken Cameron went to the stones after he took Jem. Would he not make Jem touch them, to see? And if he did . . . what if Cameron can\u2019t travel but Jem did\u2014to get away from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Buck thought that one over and gave a reluctant nod. \u201cSo ye\u2019re maybe thinkin\u2019 that if the lad was scairt of Cameron and popped through accidental, he maybe wouldn\u2019t try to come straight back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe maybe couldn\u2019t.\u201d Roger was dry-mouthed and swallowed hard to generate enough saliva to speak. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a gemstone. And even with one . . .\u201d He nodded at Buck. \u201cKen what happened to you, even with one. It does get worse each time. Jemmy might have been too scared to try.\u201d And he might have tried, not made it, and now he\u2019s lost for good . . . NO!</p><p>Buck nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo. Ye think he\u2019s maybe with your da, after all?\u201d He sounded dubious in the extreme.</p><p>Roger couldn\u2019t bear sitting any longer. He stood up abruptly, thrusting the dog tags into the breast pocket of his coat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But this is the only solid bit of evidence we have. I have to go and see.\u201d</p><p>THE CURE OF SOULS</p><p>\u201cYE\u2019RE OUT OF YOUR wee pink mind, ye ken that, aye?\u201d Roger looked at Buck in amazement.</p><p>\u201cWhere the devil did you get that expression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your wife,\u201d Buck replied. \u201cWho\u2019s a verra bonnie lass and a well-spoken one, forbye. And if ye mean to get back to her bed one of these days, ye\u2019ll think better of what ye mean to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought,\u201d Roger said briefly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m doing it.\u201d The entrance to Fort William looked much as it had when he\u2019d come here with Brian Fraser nearly two weeks earlier, but this time with only a few people hastening in, shawls over their heads, and hats pulled down against the rain. The fort itself now seemed to have a sinister aspect, the gray stones bleak and streaked black with wet.</p><p>Buck reined up, grimacing as the horse shook its head and sprayed him with drops from its soaking mane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, fine. I\u2019m no going in there. If we have to kill him, it\u2019s best if he doesna ken me, so I can get behind him. I\u2019ll wait at yonder tavern.\u201d He lifted his chin, indicating an establishment called the Peartree, a few hundred feet down the road from the fort, then kicked his horse into motion. Ten feet on, he turned and called over his shoulder, \u201cOne hour! If ye\u2019re not with me by then, I\u2019m comin\u2019 in after ye!\u201d</p><p>Roger smiled, despite his apprehension. He waved briefly to Buck and swung off his horse.</p><p>Bless me, Lord, he prayed. Help me to do the right thing\u2014for everyone. Including Buck. And him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t actually stopped praying at any time since Jem had disappeared, though most of it was just the frantic, reflexive Dear Lord, let it be all right of everyone facing crisis. Over time, either the crisis or the petitioner wears down, and prayer either ceases or . . . the person praying starts to listen.</p> <p>He knew that. And he was listening. But he was still taken aback to get an answer.</p><p>He had enough experience in the business of prayer to recognize an answer when it showed up, though, however unwelcome. And the pointed reminder, arriving as a random thought in the middle of their mud-spattered, rain-sodden journey\u2014that Jack Randall\u2019s soul was in as much danger as Brian Fraser\u2019s life\u2014was damned unwelcome.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Buck had said, brightening under the soggy brim of his hat when Roger had shared his disturbance at this insight. \u201cAll the more reason to kill him now. Save yon Frasers, and keep the wicked wee sod from going to hell\u2014if he hasn\u2019t done something already as would send him there,\u201d he\u2019d added as an afterthought. \u201cTwo birds wi\u2019 one stone, aye?\u201d</p><p>Roger had squelched along for a moment before replying.</p><p>\u201cOut of sheer curiosity\u2014were you a solicitor or a barrister, when ye did law?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSolicitor. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you failed at it. All your talents lie in the other direction. Can ye not have a conversation without arguing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wi\u2019 you,\u201d Buck had said pointedly, and kicked his horse into a trot, sending up thumping clods of mud in his wake.</p><p>Roger gave his name and asked the army clerk if he might have a word with Captain Randall, then stood by the peat fire, shaking off as much water as he could before the man came back to lead him to Randall\u2019s office.</p><p>To his surprise, it was the same office where he and Brian Fraser had had their audience with Captain Buncombe almost two weeks before. Randall was seated behind the desk, quill in hand, but looked up with a courteous expression at Roger\u2019s entrance and half rose, with a small bow.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, sir. Mr. MacKenzie, is that right? You\u2019ve come from Lallybroch, I collect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour most obedient, sir,\u201d Roger replied, adjusting his accent back to his normal Scots-tinged Oxbridge. \u201cMr. Brian Fraser was good enough to give me the object that you brought. I wanted both to thank you for your kind assistance\u2014and to ask whether you might be able to tell me where the object was discovered.\u201d</p><p>He knew about the banality of evil; human monsters came in human shapes. Even so, he was surprised. Randall was a handsome man, rather elegant in bearing, with a lively, interested expression, a humorous curve to his mouth, and warm dark eyes.</p><p>Well, he is human. And perhaps he\u2019s not a monster yet.</p><p>\u201cOne of my messengers brought it in,\u201d Randall replied, wiping his quill and dropping it into a stoneware jar full of such objects. \u201cMy predecessor, Captain Buncombe, had sent dispatches to Fort George and Fort Augustus about your son\u2014I am very sorry for your situation,\u201d he added rather formally. \u201cA patrol from Ruthven Barracks had brought the ornament in. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know where they discovered it, but perhaps the messenger who brought it from Ruthven does. I\u2019ll send for him.\u201d</p><p>Randall went to the door and spoke to the sentry outside. Coming back, he paused to open a cupboard, which revealed a wig stand, a powdering shaker, a pair of hairbrushes, a looking glass, and a small tray with a cut-glass decanter and glasses.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to offer you refreshment, sir.\u201d Randall poured a cautious inch into each glass and offered one to Roger. He picked up his own, his nostrils flaring slightly at the scent of the whisky. \u201cThe nectar of the country, I\u2019m given to understand,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cI am told I must develop a taste for it.\u201d He took a wary sip, looking as though he expected imminent death to result.</p><p>\u201cIf I might suggest . . . a bit of water mixed with it is customary,\u201d Roger said, carefully keeping all trace of amusement out of his voice. \u201cSome say it opens the flavor, makes it smoother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d Randall put down his glass, looking relieved. \u201cThat seems sensible. The stuff tastes as though it\u2019s flammable. Sanders!\u201d he shouted toward the door. \u201cBring some water!\u201d</p> <p>There was a slight pause, neither man knowing quite what to say next.</p><p>\u201cThe, um, thing,\u201d Randall said. \u201cMight I see it again? It\u2019s quite remarkable. Is it a jewel of some kind? An ornament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a . . . sort of charm,\u201d Roger said, fishing the dog tags out of his pocket. He felt an ache in his chest at thought of the small personal rituals that the fliers did\u2014a lucky stone in the pocket, a special scarf, the name of a woman painted on the nose of a plane. Charms. Tiny bits of hopeful magic, protection against a vast sky filled with fire and death. \u201cTo preserve the soul.\u201d In memory, at least.</p><p>Randall frowned a little, glancing from the dog tags to Roger\u2019s face, then back. He was clearly thinking the same thing Roger was: And if the charm is detached from the person it was meant to protect . . . But he didn\u2019t say anything, merely touched the green tag gently.</p><p>\u201cJ. W. Your son\u2019s name is Jeremiah, I understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Jeremiah\u2019s an old family name. It was my father\u2019s name. I\u2014\u201d He was interrupted by the entrance of Private MacDonald, a very young soldier, dripping wet and slightly blue with cold, who saluted Captain Randall smartly, then gave way to a rattling cough that shook his spindly frame.</p><p>Once recovered, he complied at once with Randall\u2019s order to tell Roger all he knew about the dog tags\u2014but he didn\u2019t know much. One of the soldiers stationed at Ruthven Barracks had won them in a dice game at a local pub. He did recall the name of the pub\u2014the Fatted Grouse; he\u2019d drunk there himself\u2014and he thought the soldier had said he\u2019d won the bawbee from a farmer come back from the market in Perth.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall the name of the soldier who won them?\u201d Roger asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, sir. \u2019Twas Sergeant McLehose. And now I think\u2014\u201d A broad grin at the recollection showed crooked teeth. \u201cI mind me of the farmer\u2019s name, too! \u2019Twas Mr. Anthony Cumberpatch. It did tickle Sergeant McLehose, bein\u2019 foreign and soundin\u2019 like \u2018cucumber patch.\u2019\u201d He sniggered, and Roger smiled himself. Captain Randall cleared his throat, and the sniggering stopped abruptly, Private MacDonald snapping to a sober attention.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mr. MacDonald,\u201d Randall said dryly. \u201cThat will be all.\u201d</p><p>Private MacDonald, abashed, saluted and left. There was a moment\u2019s silence, during which Roger became aware of the rain, grown harder now, clattering like gravel on the large casement window. A chilly draft leaked around its frame and touched his face. Glancing at the window, he saw the drill yard below, and the whipping post, a grim crucifix stark and solitary, black in the rain.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Carefully, he folded up the dog tags again and put them away in his pocket. Then met Captain Randall\u2019s dark eyes directly.</p><p>\u201cDid Captain Buncombe tell you, sir, that I am a minister?\u201d</p><p>Randall\u2019s brows rose in brief surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Randall was plainly wondering why Roger should mention this, but he was courteous. \u201cMy younger brother is a clergyman. Ah . . . Church of England, of course.\u201d There was the faintest implied question there, and Roger answered it with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI am a minister of the Church of Scotland myself, sir. But if I might . . . will ye allow me to offer a blessing? For the success of my kinsman and myself\u2014and in thanks for your kind help to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Randall blinked, clearly discomfited. \u201cI\u2014suppose so. Er . . . all right.\u201d He leaned back a little, looking wary, hands on his blotter. He was completely taken aback when Roger leaned forward and grasped both his hands firmly. Randall gave a start, but Roger held tight, eyes on the captain\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d he said, \u201cwe ask thy blessing on our works. Guide me and my kinsman in our quest, and guide this man in his new office. May your light and presence be with us and with him, and your judgment and compassion ever on us. I commend him to your care. Amen.\u201d</p><p>His voice cracked on the last word, and he let go Randall\u2019s hands and coughed, looking away as he cleared his throat.</p><p>Randall cleared his throat, too, in embarrassment, but kept his poise.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your . . . er . . . good wishes, Mr. MacKenzie. And I wish you good luck. And good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same to you, Captain,\u201d Roger said, rising. \u201cGod be with you.\u201d</p><p>BABY JESUS, TELL ME . . .</p><p>Boston, November 15, 1980</p><p>DR. JOSEPH ABERNATHY pulled into his driveway, looking forward to a cold beer and a hot supper. The mailbox was full; he pulled out a handful of circulars and envelopes and went inside, tidily sorting them as he went.</p><p>\u201cBill, bill, occupant, junk, junk, more junk, charity appeal, bill, idiot, bill, invitation . . . hi, sweetie\u2014\u201d He paused for a fragrant kiss from his wife, followed by a second sniff of her hair. \u201cOh, man, are we having brats and sauerkraut for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d his wife told him, neatly snagging her jacket from the hall tree with one hand and squeezing his buttock with the other. \u201cI\u2019m going to a meeting with Marilyn. Be back by nine, if the rain doesn\u2019t make the traffic too bad. Anything good in the mail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Have fun!\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him and left before he could ask if she\u2019d bought Bud. He tossed the half-sorted mail on the kitchen counter and opened the refrigerator to check. A gleaming red-and-white six-pack beckoned cheerily, and the warm air was so tangy with the smells of fried sausage and vinegar that he could taste it without even taking the lid off the pan sitting on the stove.</p><p>\u201cA good woman is prized above rubies,\u201d he said, inhaling blissfully and pulling a can loose from its plastic ring.</p><p>He was halfway through the first plate of food and two-thirds of the way into his second beer when he put down the sports section of the Globe and saw the letter on top of the spilled pile of mail. He recognized Bree\u2019s handwriting at once; it was big and round, with a determined rightward slant\u2014but there was something wrong with the letter.</p><p>He picked it up, frowning a little, wondering why it looked strange . . . and then realized that the stamp was wrong. She wrote at least once a month, sending photos of the kids, telling him about her job, the farm\u2014and the letters all had British stamps, purple and blue heads of Queen Elizabeth. This one had an American stamp.</p><p>He slowly set down the letter as though it might explode and swallowed the rest of the beer in one gulp. Fortified, he set his jaw and picked it up.</p><p>\u201cTell me you and Rog took the kids to Disneyland, Bree,\u201d he murmured, licking mustard off his knife before using it to slit the envelope. She\u2019d talked about doing that someday. \u201cBaby Jesus, tell me this is a photo of Jem shaking hands with Mickey Mouse.\u201d</p><p>Much to his relief, it was a photo of both children at Disneyland, beaming at the camera from Mickey Mouse\u2019s embrace, and he laughed out loud. Then he saw the tiny key that had fallen out of the envelope\u2014the key to a bank\u2019s safe-deposit box. He set down the photo, went and got another beer, and sat down deliberately to read the brief note enclosed with the photo.</p><p>Dear Uncle Joe,</p><p>I\u2019m taking the kids to see Grandma and Grandpa. I don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll be back; could you please see to things while we\u2019re gone? (Instructions in the box.)</p><p>Thank you for everything, always. I\u2019ll miss you. I love you.</p><p>Bree</p><p>He sat for a long time next to the cold grease congealing on his plate, looking at the bright, happy photo.</p><p>\u201cJesus, girl,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? And what do you mean you\u2019re taking the kids? Where the hell\u2019s Roger?\u201d</p><p>PART THREE</p><p>A Blade New-Made from</p><p>the Ashes of the Forge</p><p>SOMETHING SUITABLE IN WHICH TO GO TO WAR</p><p>June 19, 1778</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>I WOKE COMPLETELY disoriented, to the splat of water dripping into a wooden bucket, the sharp smells of wood pulp and printer\u2019s ink, the softer musk of Jamie\u2019s body and frying bacon, the clank of pewter plates, and the loud braying of a mule. The latter noise brought back memory at once, and I sat up, sheet clutched to my bosom.</p><p>I was naked, and I was in the loft of Fergus\u2019s printshop. When we had left Kingsessing the day before, during a brief pause in the rain, we had found Fergus patiently sheltering in a toolshed near the gates, Clarence the mule and two horses tethered under its eaves.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been out here all this time!\u201d I\u2019d blurted upon seeing him.</p><p>\u201cDid it take that long?\u201d he inquired, cocking a dark brow at Jamie and giving him the sort of knowing look that Frenchmen appear to be born with.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Jamie replied ambiguously, and took my arm. \u201cI rode Clarence out, Sassenach, but I asked Fergus to come on a wee bit later wi\u2019 a horse for you. The mule canna carry us both, and my back willna stand walking that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with your back?\u201d I asked, suspicious.</p><p>\u201cNothing that a night\u2019s sleep in a good bed willna cure,\u201d he replied, and, stooping so I could put a foot in his hands, tossed me up into the saddle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had been past dark when we made it back to the printshop. I\u2019d sent Germain at once to Jenny at Number 17 with word where I was but had gone to bed with Jamie before he came back. I wondered vaguely who else was at the house on Chestnut Street and what they were doing: was Hal still a captive, or had Young Ian decided to release him? If not, had Hal assassinated Denny Hunter, or had Mrs. Figg shot him?</p><p>Jamie had told me he\u2019d left Ian in charge of the situation\u2014or situations; there seemed to have been a great deal going on the day before. All of it seemed unreal and dreamlike, both the events I\u2019d participated in and the ones Jamie had told me about on the ride back. The only vividly real recollection I had was of our conversation in the garden\u2014and what followed it, in the potting shed. My flesh still felt the echoes.</p><p>Breakfast was plainly preparing below; besides the delectable scent of frying bacon, I could smell toasted yeast bread and fresh honey. My stomach gave a loud gurgle at this, and as though the sound had caused it, the ladder leading up into the loft began to shake. Someone was coming up, moving slowly, and in case it wasn\u2019t Jamie, I seized my shift and pulled it hastily over my head.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. A pewter tray rose slowly into sight, laid with a plate piled with food, a bowl of porridge, and a pottery mug of something steaming; it couldn\u2019t be tea and didn\u2019t smell like coffee. As the tray levitated, Henri-Christian\u2019s beaming face appeared below it; he was balancing the thing on his head.</p> <p>I held my breath until he\u2019d stepped off the ladder, and then, as he removed the tray from his head and presented it to me with a ceremonious little bow, applauded.</p><p>\u201cMerveilleux!\u201d I told him, and he grinned from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cF\u00e9licit\u00e9 wanted to try,\u201d he told me proudly, \u201cbut she can\u2019t do it with a full tray yet. She spills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t have that. Thank you, sweetheart.\u201d I leaned forward to kiss him\u2014his dark wavy hair smelled of woodsmoke and ink\u2014and took the mug. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>He looked at it dubiously and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo it is.\u201d I cradled the mug in my hands. The loft had been warm the night before, the day\u2019s heat trapped under the roof, but it had rained most of the night, and the chilly damp had come through the holes in the roof\u2014four or five vessels placed under the leaks made a symphony of plinking sounds. \u201cWhere\u2019s Grand-p\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>Henri-Christian\u2019s face at once went bright red, his lips pressed tight together, and he shook his head vigorously.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cIs it a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell her!\u201d Joanie\u2019s shrill voice floated up from the shop below. \u201cGrand-p\u00e8re said not to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a surprise, is it?\u201d I asked, smiling. \u201cWell, perhaps you\u2019d best go down and help your mama, then, so you don\u2019t give it away by mistake.\u201d</p><p>He giggled, hands pressed over his mouth, then reached up over his head, gave a convulsive leap, and flipped over backward, landing adroitly on his hands. He walked on them to the ladder, stocky little legs splayed to keep his balance, and for an instant my heart was in my mouth as he reached the edge and I thought he might try to go down the ladder upside down. He flipped over again, though, landing neatly on the top rung, and scampered out of sight like a squirrel, giggling all the way down.</p> <p>Smiling, I plumped up the sparse bedding\u2014we had slept on a flattened pallet of worn straw from the stable, which smelled rather strongly of Clarence, and on our half-dried cloaks, covered with a spare sheet and a ragged blanket, though Joanie and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 had given us one of their feather pillows, they sharing the other\u2014and sat back against the wall, the tray perched on a keg of ink powder. I was surrounded by stacks of paper, these shielded by oilcloth from the leaks. Some of it was blank reams awaiting the press, some of it pamphlets, circulars, posters, or the guts of unbound books, awaiting delivery to customers or to the bookbinder.</p><p>I could hear Marsali\u2019s voice below, back in the living quarters behind the shop, raised in maternal command. No male voices but Henri-Christian\u2019s, though; Fergus and Germain must have gone out with Clarence the mule to make the morning deliveries of L\u2019Oignon, the satirical newspaper started by Fergus and Marsali in North Carolina.</p><p>Normally, L\u2019Oignon was a weekly paper, but there was a copy on my tray of the special edition for today, with a large cartoon on the first page, showing the British army as a horde of cockroaches, fleeing Philadelphia with tattered flags dragging behind them and trailing ribbon banners filled with speeches of futile threat. A large buckled shoe labeled General Washington was squashing some of the more laggard roaches.</p><p>There was a large glob of opaque yellow-white honey melting slowly in the middle of the porridge; I stirred it in, poured a bit of cream over it, and settled down to enjoy breakfast in bed, along with an article noting the imminent entrance into Philadelphia of General Arnold, who was taking office as the military governor of the city, welcoming him and praising his military record and gallant exploits at Saratoga.</p><p>How long? I thought then, setting down the paper with a small shiver. When? I had the feeling that it had been\u2014would be\u2014much later in the war, when circumstance turned Benedict Arnold from patriot to traitor. But I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, I told myself firmly. I couldn\u2019t change it. And long before that happened, we would be safely back on the Ridge, rebuilding our house and our lives. Jamie was alive. Everything would be all right.</p><p>The bell over the shop door below rang, and there was an excited gabble as the children stampeded out of the kitchen. The soft rumble of Jamie\u2019s voice floated up over the confusion of shrill greetings, and I caught Marsali\u2019s voice among them, stunned.</p><p>\u201cDa! What have ye done?\u201d</p> <p>Alarmed, I scrambled out of my nest and went on hands and knees to the edge of the loft to look down. Jamie stood in the middle of the shop, surrounded by admiring children, his loose hair spangled with raindrops, cloak folded over his arm\u2014dressed in the dark blue and buff of a Continental officer.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d I exclaimed. He looked up and his eyes met mine like those of a guilty puppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sassenach,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cI had to.\u201d</p><p>HE\u2019D COME UP to the loft and pulled the ladder up behind him, to prevent the children coming up. I was dressing quickly\u2014or trying to\u2014as he told me about Dan Morgan, about Washington and the other Continental generals. About the coming battle.</p><p>\u201cSassenach, I had to,\u201d he said again, softly. \u201cI\u2019m that sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you did.\u201d My lips were stiff. \u201cI\u2014you\u2014I\u2019m sorry, too.\u201d</p><p>I was trying to fasten the dozen tiny buttons that closed the bodice of my gown, but my hands shook so badly that I couldn\u2019t even grasp them. I stopped trying and dug my hairbrush out of the bag he\u2019d brought me from the Chestnut Street house.</p><p>He made a small sound in his throat and took it out of my hand. He threw it onto our makeshift couch and put his arms around me, holding me tight with my face buried in his chest. The cloth of his new uniform smelled of fresh indigo, walnut hulls, and fuller\u2019s earth; it felt strange and stiff against my face. I couldn\u2019t stop shaking.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, a nighean,\u201d he whispered into my tangled hair. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, and I dinna want to feel so verra much alone just now. Speak to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy has it always got to be you?\u201d I blurted into his chest.</p><p>That made him laugh, a little shakily, and I realized that all the trembling wasn\u2019t coming from me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no just me,\u201d he said, and stroked my hair. \u201cThere are a thousand other men readying themselves today\u2014more\u2014who dinna want to do it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said again. My breathing was a little steadier. \u201cI know.\u201d I turned my face to the side in order to breathe, and all of a sudden began to cry, quite without warning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I gasped. \u201cI don\u2019t mean\u2014I don\u2019t want t-to make it h-harder for you. I\u2014I\u2014oh, Jamie, when I knew you were alive\u2014I wanted so much to go home. To go home with you.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened hard round me. He didn\u2019t speak, and I knew it was because he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d he whispered at last. \u201cAnd we will, a nighean. I promise ye.\u201d</p><p>The sounds from below floated up around us: the sounds of children running back and forth between the shop and the kitchen, Marsali singing to herself in Gaelic as she made fresh ink for the press from varnish and lamp-black. The door opened, and cool, rainy air blew in with Fergus and Germain, adding their voices to the cheerful confusion.</p><p>We stood wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, taking comfort from our family below, yearning for the others we might never see again, at once at home and homeless, balanced on a knife edge of danger and uncertainty. But together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going off to war without me,\u201d I said firmly, straightening up and sniffing. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna dream of it,\u201d he assured me gravely, went to wipe his nose on his uniform sleeve, thought better of it, and stopped, looking at me helplessly. I laughed\u2014tremulous, but it was a laugh nonetheless\u2014and gave him the handkerchief I\u2019d tucked automatically into my bosom when I fastened my stays. Like Jenny, I always had one.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I said, swallowing as I picked up the hairbrush. \u201cI\u2019ll plait your hair for you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d washed it this morning; it was clean and damp, the soft red strands cool in my hands and smelling\u2014oddly\u2014of French soap, scented with bergamot. I rather missed the scent of sweat and cabbage that had surrounded me all night.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you bathe?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cAt the house on Chestnut Street,\u201d he answered, a little tersely. \u201cMy sister made me. She said I couldna turn up to be a general smelling like a stale dinner, and there was a tub and hot water to spare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she?\u201d I murmured. \u201cUm . . . speaking of Chestnut Street . . . how is His Grace, the Duke of Pardloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone before dawn, Jenny said,\u201d he said, bending his head to aid in the plaiting. His neck was warm under my fingers. \u201cAccording to Ian, Denny Hunter said he was well enough to go, provided that he took along a flask of your magic potion. So Mrs. Figg gave him back his breeches\u2014wi\u2019 some reluctance, I understand\u2014and he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent where?\u201d I asked. His hair was more heavily traced with silver than it had been. I didn\u2019t mind that; I minded that I hadn\u2019t been there to see it slowly change, day by day.</p><p>\u201cIan didna ask him. But he said Mrs. Figg told the duke the names of some friends of Lord John\u2019s\u2014Loyalists that might be still in the city. And his son\u2019s staying in a house here, no? Dinna be worrit on his account, Sassenach.\u201d He turned his head to smile sideways at me. \u201cHis Grace is a man who\u2019s hard to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it takes one to know one,\u201d I said tartly. I didn\u2019t ask why Jamie had gone to Chestnut Street; Hal, Jenny, and all other concerns notwithstanding, I knew he wanted to know whether John had reappeared. Apparently not, and a small chill frosted my heart.</p><p>I was groping in my pocket for a ribbon with which to club his queue, when a fresh draft swept through the loft, lifting the oilcloth and fluttering the papers beneath. I turned to see the source of the breeze and beheld Germain, swinging off the pulley rope to come in by the shuttered doors through which bales and kegs could be lowered from the loft to wagons below.</p><p>\u201cBonjour, Grand-p\u00e8re,\u201d he said, wiping a cobweb off his face as he landed and bowing to Jamie with great formality. He turned and bowed to me, as well. \u201cComment \u00e7a va, Grand-m\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFi\u2014\u201d I began automatically, but was interrupted by Jamie.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said definitely. \u201cYe\u2019re not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Grandda!\u201d Germain\u2019s formality disappeared in an instant, replaced by pleading. \u201cI could be a help to ye!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jamie said dryly. \u201cAnd your parents would never forgive me if ye were. I dinna even want to know what your notion of help involves, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could carry messages! I can ride, ye ken that, ye taught me yourself! And I\u2019m nearly twelve!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe ken how dangerous that is? If a British sharpshooter didna take ye out of the saddle, someone from the militia would club ye over the head to steal the horse. And I can count, ken? Ye\u2019re no even eleven yet, so dinna be tryin\u2019 it on with me.\u201d</p><p>Obviously, danger held no fears whatever for Germain. He shrugged, impatient.</p><p>\u201cWell, I could be an orderly, then. I can find food anywhere,\u201d he added, cunning. He was in fact a very accomplished scrounger, and I looked at him thoughtfully. Jamie intercepted my glance and glowered at me.</p><p>\u201cDinna even think about it, Sassenach. He\u2019d be taken up for theft and hanged or flogged within an inch of his life, and I couldna do a thing to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s ever caught me!\u201d Germain said, his professional pride outraged. \u201cNot once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re not going to,\u201d his grandfather assured him, fixing him with a steely eye. \u201cWhen ye\u2019re sixteen, maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye? Grannie Janet says ye were eight when ye first went raiding with your da!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLifting cattle\u2019s no the same as war, and I wasna anywhere near the fighting,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAnd your Grannie Janet should keep her mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ll tell her ye said so,\u201d Germain retorted, disgruntled. \u201cShe says ye got bashed on the head with a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. And with luck ye\u2019ll live to be an auld man with your brains unscrambled, unlike your grandsire. Leave us, lad, your grannie needs to put her stockings on.\u201d He stood up and, lifting the ladder, slid it down from the loft and pushed Germain firmly onto it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood looking sternly down until Germain had reached the floor below, marking his displeasure by skipping the last few rungs and landing with a loud thud.</p><p>Jamie sighed, straightened up, and stretched himself gingerly, groaning a little.</p><p>\u201cGod knows where we\u2019ll sleep tonight, Sassenach,\u201d he remarked, glancing at our rude couch as he sat down for me to finish clubbing his hair. \u201cFor the sake of my back, I hope it\u2019s a bit softer than this.\u201d He grinned at me suddenly. \u201cDid ye sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better,\u201d I assured him, smoothing out the ribbon. In fact, I ached in almost every place it was possible to ache, save perhaps the top of my head. For that matter, I\u2019d barely slept, and neither had he; we\u2019d passed the hours of darkness in slow and wordless exploration, finding again each other\u2019s body . . . and, toward dawn, had touched each other\u2019s soul again. I touched the back of his neck now, gently, and his hand rose to mine. I felt simultaneously wonderful and wretched, and didn\u2019t know from moment to moment which feeling was uppermost.</p> <p>\u201cWhen will we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as ye put your stockings on, Sassenach. And tidy your hair. And do up your buttons,\u201d he added, turning and catching sight of my excessive d\u00e9colletage. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need my medicine box,\u201d I said, going cross-eyed as I watched his nimble fingers flicking down my chest.</p><p>\u201cI brought it,\u201d he assured me, and frowned a bit, eyes intent on a recalcitrant button. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonny bit of furniture. I expect his lordship bought it for ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d I hesitated a moment, rather wishing he had said \u201cJohn\u201d rather than \u201chis lordship.\u201d I also wished I knew where John was\u2014and that he was all right. But this didn\u2019t seem the moment to say any of those things.</p> <p>Jamie leaned forward and kissed the top of my breast, his breath warm on my skin.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken whether I\u2019ll have a bed at all tonight,\u201d he said, straightening up. \u201cBut whether it\u2019s feathers or straw, promise ye\u2019ll share it with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I said, and, picking up my cloak, shook it out, swirled it round my shoulders, and smiled bravely at him. \u201cLet\u2019s go, then.\u201d</p><p>JENNY HAD SENT my medicine chest from Chestnut Street and with it the large parcel of herbs from Kingsessing, which had been delivered there the night before. With the forethought of a Scottish housewife, she\u2019d also included a pound of oatmeal, a twist of salt, a package of bacon, four apples, and six clean handkerchiefs. Also a neat roll of fabric with a brief note, which read:</p><p>Dear Sister Claire,</p><p>You appear to own nothing suitable in which to go to war. I suggest you borrow Marsali\u2019s printing apron for the time being, and here are two of my flannel petticoats and the simplest things Mrs. Figg could find amongst your wardrobe.</p> <p>Take care of my brother, and tell him his stockings need darning, because he won\u2019t notice until he\u2019s worn holes in the heel and given himself blisters.</p><p>Your Good-sister,</p><p>Janet Murray</p><p>\u201cAnd just how is it that you own something suitable in which to go to war?\u201d I asked, eyeing Jamie in his indigo splendor. His uniform appeared to be complete, from coat with epaulets and a brigadier general\u2019s insignia to buff waistcoat and cream silk stockings. Tall and straight, with auburn hair neatly clubbed and ribboned in black, he distinctly drew the eye.</p><p>He drew his chin back and looked down his nose at himself.</p><p>\u201cWell, the sark and smallclothes were mine already; I had them when I came from Scotland. But when I came back to Philadelphia to find ye yesterday, I found Jenny first, and I told her about General Washington and asked her would she see to it. So she took my measurements and found a tailor and his son who do uniforms and browbeat them into working all night to make the coat and waistcoat\u2014poor wretches,\u201d he added, gingerly pulling a loose thread from the edge of his cuff. \u201cHow is it that ye don\u2019t, Sassenach? Did his lordship think it unseemly for ye to doctor folk and make ye burn your working clothes?\u201d</p><p>This was said with the sort of jesting tone that\u2019s meant to suggest perfect innocence on the part of the speaker while making it perfectly apparent that malice is intended. \u201cI don\u2019t say that I\u2019ll no make a fuss about it later.\u201d I looked pointedly at the medical chest John had given me, then back at him, narrowing my eyes ever so slightly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, with great casualness. \u201cI spilled vitriol on them, making\u2014 making ether.\u201d The memory made my hands shake slightly, and I had to set down the cup of nettle tea I was drinking.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Sassenach.\u201d Jamie spoke under his breath\u2014F\u00e9licit\u00e9 and Joan were kneeling at his feet, arguing with each other as they busily burnished his brass shoe buckles\u2014but he met my eyes over their heads, appalled. \u201cTell me ye werena doing that drunk.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, at once reliving the experience and trying not to. Standing in the hot, semi-dark shed behind the house, the rounded glass slick in my sweating hands . . . then the flying liquid\u2014it had barely missed my face\u2014and the sickly smell and magically widening, smoking holes that burned straight through my heavy canvas apron and the skirt beneath. I hadn\u2019t really cared at the time whether I lived or died\u2014until it looked as though I was going to die in the next few seconds. That made rather a difference. It hadn\u2019t convinced me not to commit suicide\u2014but the shock of the near accident did make me think more carefully about how. Slitting one\u2019s wrists was one thing; dying in slow, disfiguring agony was another.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and, taking up the cup, managed a deliberate mouthful. \u201cI\u2014it was a hot day. My hands were sweating, and the flask slipped.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, all too clearly envisioning the scene himself, then reached across F\u00e9licit\u00e9\u2019s sleek dark head to cup my cheek.</p><p>\u201cDinna be doing that again, aye?\u201d he said softly. \u201cDon\u2019t make it anymore.\u201d</p><p>To be honest, the thought of making ether again made my palms sweat. It wasn\u2019t chemically difficult, but it was terribly dangerous. One wrong move, a little too much vitriol, a few degrees of heat too much . . . And Jamie knew as well as I did just how explosive the stuff was. I could see the memory of flames in his eyes, the Big House going up around us. I swallowed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d I said honestly. \u201cBut\u2014without it, Jamie, I can\u2019t do things that I can do with it. If I hadn\u2019t had it, Aidan would be dead\u2014so would John\u2019s nephew Henry.\u201d</p><p>He compressed his lips and looked as though he considered that Henry Grey might be disposable\u2014but he was fond of little Aidan McCallum Higgins, whose appendix I\u2019d removed on the Ridge with the assistance of my first batch of ether.</p><p>\u201cGrannie has to help people feel better, Grand-p\u00e8re,\u201d Joanie said reproachfully, rising from her spot at Jamie\u2019s feet and frowning up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s her callin\u2019, Mam says. She can\u2019t just not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken that fine,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBut she needna blow herself to kingdom come doing it. After all, who\u2019s going to look after all the sick folk, if your grannie\u2019s lying about in pieces?\u201d</p><p>F\u00e9licit\u00e9 and Joanie both thought that image hilarious; I was less amused, but didn\u2019t say anything further until they\u2019d taken their rags and vinegar back to the kitchen. We were left in the sleeping part of the living quarters, assembling our bags and bundles for departure, and momentarily alone.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were afraid,\u201d I said quietly, eyes on the spools of coarse thread and twists of silk floss I was stowing in a wooden box with several suture needles. \u201cBut that won\u2019t stop you doing what you think you have to do, will it? I\u2019m afraid for you\u2014and that certainly won\u2019t stop you, either.\u201d I was careful to speak without bitterness, but he was as sensitive to tones of voice this morning as I was.</p><p>He paused for a moment, regarding his shining shoe buckles, then lifted his head and looked at me straight.</p><p>\u201cDo ye think that because ye\u2019ve told me the Rebels will win, I am free to walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014no.\u201d I slid the box lid shut with a snick, not looking at it. I couldn\u2019t look away from him. His face was still, but his eyes held mine, intent. \u201cI know you have to. I know it\u2019s part of what you are. You can\u2019t stand aside and still be what you are. That was more or less my point, about\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted me, stepping forward and seizing me by the wrist.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it that ye think I am, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bloody man, that\u2019s what!\u201d I pulled loose and turned away, but he put a hand on my shoulder and turned me back to face him.</p><p>\u201cAye, I am a bloody man,\u201d he said, and the faintest trace of rue touched his mouth, but his eyes were blue and steady.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve made your peace with what I am, ye think\u2014but I think ye dinna ken what that means. To be what I am doesna mean only that I\u2019ll spill my own blood when I must. It means I must sacrifice other men to the ends of my own cause\u2014not only those I kill as enemies, but those I hold as friends . . . or as kin.\u201d</p><p>His hand dropped away, and the tension left his shoulders. He turned toward the door, saying, \u201cCome when ye\u2019re ready, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I STOOD THERE for an instant, blinking, then ran after him, leaving my half-packed bag behind.</p><p>\u201cJamie!\u201d He was standing in the printshop, Henri-Christian in his arms, bidding goodbye to the girls and Marsali. Germain was nowhere in sight, doubtless sulking. Jamie looked up, startled, then smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cI wasna going to leave ye behind, Sassenach. And I didna mean to hurry ye, either. Do ye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I just\u2014I have to tell you something.\u201d</p><p>All the little heads turned toward me like a nestful of baby birds, soft pink mouths open in curiosity. It occurred to me that I might better have waited until we were on the road, but it had seemed urgent that I tell him now\u2014not only to relieve his anxieties, but to make him know I did understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s William,\u201d I blurted, and Jamie\u2019s face clouded for an instant, like a breathed-on mirror. Yes, I had understood.</p><p>\u201cCome to me, a bhalaich,\u201d Marsali said, taking Henri-Christian from Jamie and setting him on the floor. \u201cOof! Ye weigh more than I do, wee man! Come away now, lassies, Grandda isn\u2019t going just yet. Help me fetch out Grannie\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>The children obediently scampered off behind her, though still looking back at us in frustrated curiosity. Children hate secrets, unless they\u2019re the ones keeping them. I glanced after them, then turned back to Jamie.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if they knew about William. I suppose Marsali and Fergus do, since\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Jenny told them. Aye, they do.\u201d He rolled his eyes in brief resignation, then fixed them on my face. \u201cWhat is it, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t fight,\u201d I said, letting out a half-held breath. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the British army is about to do. William was paroled after Saratoga\u2014he\u2019s a conventioner. You know about the Convention army?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He took my hand and squeezed it. \u201cYe mean he\u2019s not allowed to take up arms unless he\u2019s been exchanged\u2014and he hasn\u2019t been, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Nobody can be exchanged, until the King and the Congress come to some agreement about it.\u201d</p><p>His face was suddenly vivid with relief, and I was relieved to see it.</p><p>\u201cJohn\u2019s been trying to have him exchanged for months, but there isn\u2019t any way of doing it.\u201d I dismissed Congress and the King with a wave of my free hand and smiled up at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to face him on a battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaing do Dhia,\u201d he said, closing his eyes for an instant. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking for days\u2014when I wasna fretting about you, Sassenach\u2014\u201d he added, opening his eyes and looking down his nose at me, \u201c\u2014the third time\u2019s the charm. And that would be an evil charm indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird time?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you\u2014would you let go my fingers? They\u2019ve gone numb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. He kissed them gently and let go. \u201cAye, sorry, Sassenach. I meant\u2014I\u2019ve shot at the lad twice in his life so far and missed him by no more than an inch each time. If it should happen again\u2014ye canna always tell, in battle, and accidents do happen. I was dreaming, during the night, and . . . och, nay matter.\u201d He waved off the dreams and turned away, but I put a hand on his arm to stop him. I knew his dreams\u2014and I\u2019d heard him moan the night before, fighting them.</p><p>\u201cCulloden?\u201d I said softly. \u201cHas it come back again?\u201d I actually hoped it was Culloden\u2014and not Wentworth. He woke from the Wentworth dreams sweating and rigid and couldn\u2019t bear to be touched. Last night, he hadn\u2019t waked, but had jerked and moaned until I\u2019d got my arms around him and he quieted, trembling in his sleep, head butted hard into my chest.</p><p>He shrugged a little and touched my face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never left, Sassenach,\u201d he said, just as softly. \u201cIt never will. But I sleep easier by your side.\u201d</p><p>JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT</p><p>IT WAS A PERFECTLY ordinary red-brick building. Modest\u2014no pediments, no carved stone lintels\u2014but solid. Ian looked at it warily. The home of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, the weightiest meeting of the Society of Friends in the Americas. Aye, very solid.</p><p>\u201cWill this be like the Vatican?\u201d he asked Rachel. \u201cOr more like an archbishop\u2019s palace?\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like any sort of palace to thee?\u201d She spoke normally, but he could see the pulse beat quick in the soft spot just beneath her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a bank,\u201d he said, and that made her laugh. She cut it short, though, glancing over her shoulder as though afraid someone might come out and scold her for it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do they do in there?\u201d he asked, curious. \u201cIs it a great meetinghouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there is also business to be done, thee knows. The yearly meetings deal with matters of . . . I suppose thee would call it principle. We call it Faith and Practice; there are books, rewritten every so often, to reflect the present sense of the meeting. And queries.\u201d She smiled suddenly, and his heart gave a small extra thump. \u201cI think thee would recognize the queries\u2014they\u2019re much like thee has described the examination of conscience before thy confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, aye,\u201d he said agreeably, but declined to pursue the subject. He hadn\u2019t been to confession in some years and didn\u2019t feel sufficiently wicked at present to trouble about it. \u201cThis Faith and Practice\u2014is that where they say ye mustn\u2019t join the Continental army, even if ye dinna take up arms?\u201d</p><p>He was immediately sorry he\u2019d asked; the question dimmed the light in her eyes, but only momentarily. She drew a deep breath through her nose and looked up at him.</p> <p>\u201cNo, that would be an opinion\u2014a formal opinion. Friends talk over every possible point of consideration before they give an opinion\u2014whether it\u2019s a positive one or not.\u201d There was the barest hesitation before \u201cnot,\u201d but he heard it and, reaching out, pulled out her hatpin, gently straightened her straw hat, which had slid a little askew, and pushed the pin back in.</p><p>\u201cAnd if in the end it\u2019s not, and we canna find a meeting that will have us, lass\u2014what will we do?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together, but she met his eyes straight on.</p><p>\u201cFriends are not married by their meeting. Or by priest or preacher. They marry each other. And we will marry each other.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cSomehow.\u201d</p><p>The small bubbles of misgiving that had been rising through his wame all morning began to pop, and he put a hand over his mouth to stifle a belch. Being nervous took him in the innards; he\u2019d not been able to eat breakfast. He turned a little away, from politeness, and spied two figures coming round the far corner. \u201cOch! There\u2019s your brother now, and lookin\u2019 gey fine for a Quaker, too.\u201d</p> <p>Denzell was dressed in the uniform of a Continental soldier and looked self-conscious as a hunting dog with a bow tied round its neck. Ian suppressed his amusement, though, merely nodding as his future brother-in-law drew to a stop before them. Denny\u2019s betrothed had no such compunctions.</p><p>\u201cIs he not beautiful?\u201d Dottie crowed, standing back a little to admire him. Denzell coughed and pushed his spectacles up his nose. He was a tidy man, not over-tall, but broad in the shoulder and strong in the forearm. He did look fine in the uniform, Ian thought, and said so.</p><p>\u201cI will try not to let my appearance engorge my vanity,\u201d Denzell said dryly. \u201cIs thee not also to be a soldier, Ian?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head, smiling.</p><p>\u201cNay, Denny. I shouldna be any kind of soldier\u2014but I\u2019m a decent scout.\u201d He saw Denzell\u2019s eyes fix on his face, tracing the double line of tattooed dots that looped across both cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cI expect thee would be.\u201d A certain tenseness in Denny\u2019s shoulders relaxed. \u201cScouts are not required to kill the enemy, are they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ve our choice about it,\u201d Ian assured him, straight-faced. \u201cWe can kill them if we like\u2014but just for the fun of it, ken. It doesna really count.\u201d</p><p>Denzell blinked for an instant at that, but Rachel and Dottie both laughed, and he reluctantly smiled.</p><p>\u201cThee is late, Denny,\u201d Rachel said, as the public clock struck ten. \u201cWas Henry in difficulty?\u201d For Denzell and Dottie had gone to take farewell of Dottie\u2019s brother, Henry, still convalescent from the surgery Denny and Ian\u2019s auntie Claire had done.</p><p>\u201cThee might say so,\u201d Dottie said, \u201cbut not from any physical ill.\u201d The look of amusement faded from her face, though a faint gleam still lingered in her eyes. \u201cHe is in love with Mercy Woodcock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis landlady? Love\u2019s no usually a fatal condition, is it?\u201d Ian asked, raising one brow.</p><p>\u201cNot if thy name is neither Montague nor Capulet,\u201d Denny said. \u201cThe difficulty is that while Mercy loves him in return, she may or may not still have a husband living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd until she finds out he\u2019s dead . . .\u201d Dottie added, lifting one slim shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOr alive,\u201d Denny said, giving her a look. \u201cThere is always the possibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot much of one,\u201d Dottie replied bluntly. \u201cAuntie\u2014I mean Friend\u2014Claire doctored a man called Walter Woodcock who\u2019d been badly wounded at Ticonderoga, and she said he was near death then and taken p-prisoner.\u201d She stumbled slightly on the last word, and Ian was reminded suddenly that her eldest brother, Benjamin, was a prisoner of war.</p><p>Denzell saw the cloud cross her face and gently took her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cBoth thy brothers will survive their trials,\u201d he said, and warmth touched his eyes behind the glass. \u201cSo will we, Dorothea. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them\u2014but not for love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d said Dottie, but gave him a small, grudging smile. \u201cAll right, then\u2014go ahead. There\u2019s such a lot to do before we go.\u201d</p><p>To Ian\u2019s surprise, Denzell nodded, took a folded sheaf of papers from his bosom, and, turning, went up the step to the door of the meetinghouse.</p><p>Ian had supposed the place was only a convenient spot to meet\u2014he would be catching up his uncle and Auntie Claire on the road to Coryell\u2019s Ferry but had lingered to help with the loading, for Denny, Dottie, and Rachel were driving a wagon filled with medical supplies\u2014but evidently Denny had business with Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.</p><p>Was he seeking advice in how to be married as a Quaker even while flouting their . . . what would you call it, edict\u2014no, Rachel had said it was an opinion, but a \u201cweighty\u201d opinion\u2014regarding support of the rebellion?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s giving them his witness\u2014his testimony,\u201d Dottie said matter-of-factly, seeing the puzzlement in Ian\u2019s face. \u201cHe wrote it all out. Why he thinks it\u2019s right to do what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s going to give it to the clerk of the yearly meeting and request that his views be mentioned and discussed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think they will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cThey may disagree with him, but they won\u2019t stifle him. And good luck to them if they thought to try,\u201d she added, half under her breath. She pulled a handkerchief out of her bosom, very white against the soft brown of her skin, and patted tiny droplets of sweat away from her temples.</p><p>Ian felt a sudden and profound longing for her and glanced involuntarily toward the clock tower. He\u2019d need to be on the road soon and hoped there\u2019d be time for a precious hour alone with Rachel first.</p><p>Dorothea\u2019s eyes were still fixed on the door through which Denny had passed.</p><p>\u201cHe is so lovely,\u201d she said softly, as though to herself. Then glanced self-consciously at Rachel. \u201cHe felt badly for wearing his uniform to see Henry,\u201d she said, a tone of apology in her voice. \u201cBut the time was so short . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas thy brother upset?\u201d Rachel asked sympathetically. Dottie\u2019s brows drew down.</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t like it,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as though he didn\u2019t know that we\u2019re Rebels; I told him some time ago.\u201d Her expression relaxed a little. \u201cAnd he is my brother. He won\u2019t disown me.\u201d</p><p>Ian wondered whether the same was true of her father, but didn\u2019t ask. She hadn\u2019t mentioned the duke. He wasn\u2019t really attending to Dottie\u2019s family concerns, though\u2014his mind was busy with thought of the coming battle and all that needed to be done immediately. Ian caught Rachel\u2019s eye and smiled, and she smiled back, all worry melting from her face as she met his gaze.</p><p>He had concerns himself, certainly, annoyances and worries. At the bottom of his soul, though, was the solid weight of Rachel\u2019s love and what she had said, the words gleaming like a gold coin at the bottom of a murky well. \u201cWe will marry each other.\u201d</p><p>UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE</p><p>AS JAMIE EXPLAINED to me on the way out of Philadelphia, the problem lay not in finding the British but in catching up to them with enough men and mat\u00e9riel to do some good.</p><p>\u201cThey left with several hundred wagons and a verra large number of Loyalists who didna feel quite safe in Philadelphia. Clinton canna be protecting them and fighting at the same time. He must make all the speed he can\u2014which means he must travel by the most direct road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose he can\u2019t very well be legging it cross-country,\u201d I agreed. \u201cHave you\u2014meaning General Washington\u2014got any idea how big a force he has?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder and waved off a large horsefly with his hat.</p><p>\u201cMaybe ten thousand men. Maybe more. Fergus and Germain watched them assemble to march out, but ye ken it\u2019s not easy to judge numbers when they\u2019re crawlin\u2019 out of the side streets and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. And . . . um . . . how many men do we have?\u201d Saying \u201cwe\u201d gave me an odd sensation that rippled through my lower body. Something between tail-curling apprehension and an excitement that was startlingly close to sexual.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that I\u2019d never felt the strange euphoria of war before. But it had been a very long time; I\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>\u201cFewer than the British,\u201d Jamie said, matter-of-fact. \u201cBut we willna ken how many until the militia have gathered\u2014and pray it\u2019s not too late when we do.\u201d</p><p>He glanced aside at me, and I could see him wondering whether to say something further. He didn\u2019t speak, though, just gave a little shrug and settled himself in the saddle, putting on his hat again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, tilting my head to peer up at him from under the brim of my own broad straw. \u201cYou were about to ask me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Aye, well . . . I was, but then I realized that if ye did know anything about . . . what might happen in the next few days, ye\u2019d surely have told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d In fact, I didn\u2019t know whether to regret my lack of knowledge or not. Looking back at those instances where I\u2019d thought I knew the future, I hadn\u2019t known nearly enough. Out of nowhere, I thought of Frank . . . and Black Jack Randall, and my hands gripped the reins so strongly that my mare jerked her head with a startled snort.</p><p>Jamie looked round, startled, too, but I waved a hand and leaned forward to pat the horse\u2019s neck in apology.</p><p>\u201cHorsefly,\u201d I said, in explanation. My heart was thumping noticeably against the placket of my stays, but I took several deep breaths to quiet it. I wasn\u2019t about to mention my sudden thought to Jamie, but it hadn\u2019t left me.</p><p>I\u2019d thought I knew that Jack Randall was Frank\u2019s five-times-great-grandfather. His name was right there, on the genealogical chart that Frank had shown me many times. And, in fact, he was Frank\u2019s ancestor\u2014on paper. It was Jack\u2019s younger brother, though, who had sired Frank\u2019s bloodline but then had died before being able to marry his pregnant lover. Jack had married Mary Hawkins at his brother\u2019s request and thus given his name and legitimacy to her child.</p><p>So many gory details didn\u2019t show up on those tidy genealogical charts, I thought. Brianna was Frank\u2019s daughter, on paper\u2014and by love. But the long, knife-blade nose and glowing hair of the man beside me showed whose blood ran through her veins.</p><p>But I\u2019d thought I knew. And because of that false knowledge, I\u2019d prevented Jamie killing Jack Randall in Paris, fearing that if he did, Frank might never be born. What if he had killed Randall then? I wondered, looking at Jamie sidelong. He sat tall, straight in the saddle, deep in thought, but with an air now of anticipation; the dread of the morning that had gripped us both had gone.</p><p>Anything might have happened; a number of things might not. Randall wouldn\u2019t have abused Fergus; Jamie wouldn\u2019t have fought a duel with him in the Bois de Boulogne . . . perhaps I would not have miscarried our first child, our daughter Faith. Likely I would have\u2014miscarriage was usually physiological in basis, not emotional, however romantic novels painted it. But the memory of loss was forever linked to that duel in the Bois de Boulogne.</p><p>I shoved the memories firmly aside, turning my mind away from the half-known past to the complete mystery of the waiting future. But just before the images blinked out, I caught the edge of a flying thought.</p><p>What about the child? The child born to Mary Hawkins and Alexander Randall\u2014Frank\u2019s true ancestor. He was, in all probability, alive now. Right now.</p><p>The ripple I\u2019d experienced before came back, this time running from my tailbone up my spine. Denys. The name floated up from the parchment of a genealogical chart, calligraphic letters that purported to capture a fact, while hiding nearly everything.</p><p>I knew his name was Denys\u2014and he was, so far as I knew, actually Frank\u2019s four-times great-grandfather. And that was all I knew\u2014likely all I ever would know. I fervently hoped so. I wished Denys Randall silently well and turned my mind to other things.</p><p>THE GOOD SHEPHERD</p><p>TWELVE. BLOODY. MILES! The train of baggage wagons stretched as far as the eye could see in either direction and raised a cloud of dust that nearly obscured the mules negotiating a bend in the road a half mile away. The people trudging beside the wagons on either side were coated with the fine brown stuff\u2014and so was William, though he kept as much distance as he could from the slow-moving cavalcade.</p><p>It was mid-afternoon of a hot day, and they\u2019d been on the march since before dawn.</p><p>He paused to slap dust from the skirts of his coat and take a mouthful of tin-tasting water from his canteen. Hundreds of refugees, thousands of camp followers, all with packs and bundles and handcarts, with here and there a laden horse or mule that had somehow escaped the army teamsters\u2019 rapacity, were strung over the twelve miles between the two main bodies of the army. They spread out in a straggling mass that reminded him of the plague of locusts from the Bible. Was that the book of Exodus? Couldn\u2019t recall, but it seemed apposite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some of them looked over their shoulders now and then. He wondered if it was fear of pursuit or thoughts of what they\u2019d left behind\u2014the city itself was long out of sight.</p><p>Well, if there was any danger of turning to a pillar of salt, it would be owing to sweat, not yearning, he thought, wiping his sleeve across his face for the dozenth time. He was himself eager to shake the dust of Philadelphia from his boots and never think of it again.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for Arabella\u2013Jane, he\u2019d likely have forgotten it already. He certainly wanted to forget everything else that had happened in the last few days. He twitched his reins and nudged his horse back toward the trudging horde.</p><p>It could be worse; nearly had been much worse. He\u2019d come close to being dispatched back to England or sent north to join the other conventioners in Massachusetts. Thank Christ that Papa\u2014that is, Lord John, he corrected himself firmly\u2014had made him learn German, along with French, Italian, Latin, and Greek. Besides the divisions commanded by Sir Henry and Lord Cornwallis, the army included a huge body of mercenary troops under General von Knyphausen\u2014nearly all of them from Hesse-Kassel, whose dialect William could manage with no trouble.</p> <p>It had still taken a good deal of persuasion, but in the end he\u2019d landed up as one of Clinton\u2019s dozen aides-de-camp, charged with the tedious chore of riding up and down the ponderously moving column, collecting reports, delivering dispatches, and dealing with any small difficulties that developed en route\u2014a more or less hourly occurrence. He kept a running mental note of where the various surgeons and hospital orderlies were; he lived in horror of having to attend the delivery of one of the camp followers\u2019 babies\u2014there were at least fifty very pregnant women with the column.</p><p>Maybe it was the proximity of these ladies, gravid and pale, their swollen bellies borne like burdens, balanced with the ones on their backs, that made him think of . . .</p><p>Surely whores knew how to avoid pregnancy? He didn\u2019t recall Arabella\u2013Jane doing anything . . . but he wouldn\u2019t have noticed, drunk as he was.</p><p>William thought of her whenever he touched the spot on his breast where his gorget should be. If asked, he would have said he put the thing on with his uniform and forgot about it\u2014but from the number of times he found Arabella\u2013Jane in his mind, he was apparently in the habit of fiddling with it constantly.</p><p>The loss of the gorget had cost him an unpleasant five-minute analysis of his character, dress, hygiene, and personal failings from Clinton\u2019s chief aide, Captain Duncan Drummond, and a ten-shilling fine for being out of proper uniform. He didn\u2019t grudge her the cost.</p> <p>He did find himself keeping an eye out for Captain Harkness. He couldn\u2019t recall enough of their encounter to have any idea of Harkness\u2019s regiment, but there weren\u2019t that many dragoon companies with the present army. He was working his way back along the column now, doing his daily round on Visigoth, a big bay gelding with good wind. The horse wasn\u2019t pleased with the slow pace and kept twitching under him, wanting to break into a gallop, but William held him to a steady trot, nodding as he passed each company, looking to the corporals and sergeants to see if any were in difficulty or needed assistance.</p><p>\u201cWater\u2019s coming!\u201d he called to a particularly wilted-looking group of Loyalist refugees who had stopped on the verge of the road, taking pause in the scant shade provided by a scatter of oak saplings and a handcart precariously piled with their belongings.</p><p>This reassurance made the women look up hopefully from under their bonnets, and the gentleman rose to his feet, waving William down.</p><p>He reined in and recognized Mr. Endicott, a well-to-do Philadelphia merchant, and his family. He\u2019d been to dinner at their house and had danced with the two older Misses Endicott at several parties.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, sir,\u201d he said, sweeping off his hat with a bow and nodding in turn to the ladies. \u201cAnd yours, Mrs. Endicott. Miss Endicott, Miss Sally . . . and your most humble and obedient, Miss Peggy.\u201d Miss Peggy Endicott, aged nine, went pink as a young strawberry at being singled out, and her elder sisters exchanged raised brows over her head.</p><p>\u201cIs it true, Lord Ellesmere,\u201d Endicott said, \u201cthat we are closely pursued by the Rebels?\u201d He was holding a large red-flannel handkerchief, with which he wiped a perspiring round face. \u201cThe . . . er . . . the ladies find themselves summat worried by the prospect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ladies have no cause for concern, sir,\u201d William assured him. \u201cYou are under the protection of His Majesty\u2019s army, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, we do know that,\u201d Mr. Endicott said, rather testily. \u201cOr so we hope, at least; certainly wouldn\u2019t be here else, I can tell you. But have you any news of Washington\u2019s whereabouts, is what I\u2019d like to know?\u201d</p><p>Visigoth shifted his weight and danced a little, eager to be off, but William pulled his head round, clicking his tongue in rebuke.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes, sir,\u201d he said respectfully. \u201cWe have had several deserters from the Rebel camp, come in last night. They say that Washington is gathering his troops, no doubt in hopes of catching up to us\u2014but he has no more than two thousand regulars, with a few scrubby militia companies.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Endicott looked somewhat reassured at this, but the girls and their mother didn\u2019t. Mrs. Endicott plucked at her husband\u2019s sleeve and murmured something. He flushed more deeply.</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019ll deal with it, madam!\u201d he snapped. He had taken off his wig because of the heat and wore a spotted silk handkerchief tied over his head against the sun; his grizzled hair was cropped short, and tiny bristles stuck out from the edge of the kerchief like the feelers of angry insects.</p><p>Mrs. Endicott\u2019s lips pressed tight, but she stepped back, jerking her head in a small nod. Miss Peggy, though, emboldened by Captain Ellesmere\u2019s particularity, scampered forward and seized hold of his stirrup. Visigoth, startled by the flying scrap of calico at the corner of his vision, shied violently; Peggy shrieked, stumbled back, and went flying. All of the Endicott ladies were shrieking, but William could do nothing about that; he fought the horse\u2019s head round and held on grimly while Goth crow-hopped and whirled, then settled down gradually, snorting and jerking at the bit. He could hear passing infantrymen being profanely amused as their column swerved to go round him.</p><p>\u201cIs Miss Peggy quite all right?\u201d he inquired, breathing heavily as he finally brought the horse back to the verge. Miss Anne Endicott was standing near the edge of the road, waiting for him; the rest of her family had retreated, and he heard a loud howling coming from behind the handcart.</p> <p>\u201cAside from being spanked by Papa for nearly being killed, yes,\u201d Miss Endicott replied, looking amused. She drew a little closer, keeping a wary eye on Goth, but the horse was calm enough now, stretching his neck to grab a mouthful of grass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have been the cause of her distress,\u201d William said politely, and groped in his pocket, coming out with nothing but a crumpled handkerchief and a stray sixpence. He handed the coin down to Anne, smiling. \u201cGive her that, will you, with my apologies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will be fine,\u201d Anne said, but took the coin. She glanced over her shoulder, then drew a step closer and spoke rapidly, lowering her voice. \u201cI . . . hesitate to ask, Lord Ellesmere . . . but, you see, the cart has broken a wheel, my father cannot fix it, he won\u2019t abandon our belongings\u2014and my mother is terrified that we will be overtaken and captured by Washington\u2019s men.\u201d Her dark eyes\u2014very fine dark eyes\u2014fixed on his with a brilliant intensity. \u201cCan you help? Please? That was what my little sister meant to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. What exactly is the trouble with\u2014never mind. Let me have a look.\u201d It would do Goth no harm to settle for a few minutes. He swung down and tied the horse to one of the saplings, then followed Miss Endicott to the handcart.</p><p>It was overflowing with the same higgledy-piggledy assortment of goods he\u2019d seen on the docks two days ago\u2014a tall clock stuck out of heaped clothing and linens, and a homely earthenware chamber pot was stuffed with handkerchiefs, stockings, and what was probably Mrs. Endicott\u2019s jewel case. The sight of this particular mess gave him a sudden pang, though.</p><p>These were remnants of a real home, one he\u2019d been a guest in\u2014the rubbish and treasures of people he knew . . . and liked. He\u2019d heard that very clock, with its pierced-work crown, strike midnight just before he\u2019d stolen a kiss from Anne Endicott in the shadows of her father\u2019s hallway. He felt the mellow bong, bong now, deep in his vitals.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you go?\u201d he asked quietly, a hand on her arm. She turned to him, flushed and harried, her dark hair coming out of her cap\u2014but still with dignity.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, just as quietly. \u201cMy aunt Platt lives in a small village near New York, but I don\u2019t know that we can travel so far, as we are . . .\u201d She nodded at the unwieldy cart, surrounded by bags and half-wrapped bundles. \u201cPerhaps we can find a safe place closer and wait there while my father goes to make . . . arrangements.\u201d Her lips pressed suddenly tight, and he realized that she was holding on to her composure by dint of great effort. And that it was unshed tears that made her eyes so bright. He took her hand and kissed it, gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d he said.</p><p>Easier said than done. While the axle of the cart was intact, one wheel had struck a jagged rock and not merely popped off but had in the process lost the flat-iron tire that encircled the felloes\u2014which in consequence had come apart, being badly glued. The wheel lay in pieces in the grass, and a gaudy orange-and-black butterfly perched on the disjunct hub, lazily fanning its wings.</p><p>Mrs. Endicott\u2019s fears weren\u2019t unfounded. Neither was Mr. Endicott\u2019s anxiety\u2014which he was attempting with little success to disguise as irritability. If they were stranded for too long, and left behind . . . even if Washington\u2019s regular troops were moving too fast for looting, there were always scavengers on the outskirts of an army\u2014any army.</p><p>A respectful period of inspection allowed Mr. Endicott, still red-faced but more settled, to emerge from his domestic imbroglio, followed by Peggy, also red-faced and downcast. William nodded to the merchant and gestured, summoning him to join in contemplation of the wreckage, out of hearing of the women.</p><p>\u201cAre you armed, sir?\u201d William asked quietly. Endicott\u2019s face paled noticeably, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbed above his dirt-grimed stock.</p><p>\u201cI have a fowling piece that belonged to my father,\u201d he said, in a voice so low as to be scarcely audible. \u201cI\u2014it\u2019s\u2014not been fired in twenty years.\u201d God, William thought, appalled. William felt himself naked and edgy without weapons. Endicott had to be fifty, at least, and alone here with four women to protect?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find you help, sir,\u201d William said firmly. Mr. Endicott drew a deep, deep breath. William thought the man might sob if obliged to speak, and turned without haste toward the women, talking as he went.</p><p>\u201cThere will be a cooper or wainwright somewhere along the column. Ah, and here\u2019s the water carrier coming!\u201d He extended a hand to Peggy. \u201cWill you come with me to catch him, Miss Margaret? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll stop for a pretty face.\u201d She didn\u2019t smile, but she sniffed, wiped her nose on her sleeve, drew herself up, and took his hand. The Endicott ladies were nothing if not courageous.</p><p>A bored-looking mule pulled a cart with several barrels of water, passing slowly down the column, the driver pausing when hailed. William waded determinedly into the fray, lifting Peggy in his arms for safety\u2014to her evident delight\u2014and deflected the carrier to the Endicotts\u2019 service. Then, with a sweep of his hat to the ladies, he mounted again and made his way down the road in search of a cooper.</p><p>The army traveled with the equivalent of several villages\u2019 worth of artisans and those men called \u201csupportives\u201d: coopers, carpenters, cooks, smiths, farriers, wainwrights, drovers, hauliers, orderlies. To say nothing of the vast swarm of laundresses and sempstresses among the camp followers. It wouldn\u2019t take long to find a cooper or a wainwright and persuade him to deal with the Endicotts\u2019 trouble. William glanced at the sun; nearly three.</p><p>The army was proceeding briskly, but that didn\u2019t mean it was moving at any great rate of speed. Clinton had given orders to march an additional two hours per day, though, a strain in the increasing heat. Another two hours before they made camp; with luck, the Endicotts might be whole again by then and able to keep up tomorrow.</p><p>A rumble of hooves and catcalls from the infantry caught his attention and made him glance over his shoulder, heart speeding up. Dragoons, plumes fluttering. He reined up and rode Goth straight at them, glancing from face to face as he passed down their double line. Several of them stared at him, and an officer made irritated motions at him, but he ignored that. A small voice in the back of his mind inquired what he meant to do if he found Harkness among them, but he ignored that, too.</p><p>He passed the end of the company, circled to the rear, and rode up the other side of the column, looking back over his shoulder at the rank of puzzled faces staring at him, some affronted, some amused. No . . . no . . . no . . . maybe? Would he even recognize the fellow? he wondered. He\u2019d been very drunk. Still, he thought Harkness would recognize him. . . .</p><p>They were all staring at him by this time, but none with an aspect either of alarm or violence. Their colonel reined up a little and called to him.</p><p>\u201cHo, Ellesmere! Lost something, have you?\u201d</p><p>He squinted against the sun and made out the vivid face of Ban Tarleton, red-cheeked and grinning under his flamboyant plumed helmet. He jerked his chin up in invitation, and William wheeled his horse and fell in beside him.</p><p>\u201cNot lost, exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cJust looking for a dragoon I met in Philadelphia\u2014named Harkness; you know him?\u201d</p><p>Ban pulled a face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s with the Twenty-sixth. Randy bugger, always after women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you aren\u2019t?\u201d Ban wasn\u2019t a close friend, but William had been out on the randan with him once or twice in London. He didn\u2019t drink much, but he didn\u2019t need to; he was the sort of man who always seemed a little intoxicated.</p><p>Tarleton laughed, face flushed with the heat and red-lipped as a girl.</p><p>\u201cYes. But Harkness doesn\u2019t care about anything but women. Known him to have three at once, in a brothel.\u201d</p> <p>William considered that one for a moment.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I can see a use for two, maybe . . . but what\u2019s the third one for?\u201d</p><p>Ban, who was maybe four years older than William, gave him the sort of pitying look reserved for virgins and confirmed bachelors, then ducked back, laughing, when William punched him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d William said. \u201cThat aside, I\u2019m looking for a wainwright or a cooper. Any close by?\u201d</p><p>Tarleton straightened his helmet and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cNo, but there\u2019s bound to be one or two in that mess.\u201d He gestured negligently at the train of baggage wagons. \u201cWhich regiment are you with, these days?\u201d He frowned at William, seeming to realize that something was amiss with his dress. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sword? And your gorget?\u201d</p><p>William gritted his teeth\u2014and they really did grit, there being so much coarse dust in the air\u2014and apprised Tarleton of his situation in the minimum number of words. He didn\u2019t mention where or under what circumstances he had lost his gorget, and with a brief salute of farewell to the colonel, reined round and went down the column again. He was breathing as though he\u2019d run the length of London Bridge, and pulses of electricity were running down his arms and legs, jolting at the base of his spine.</p><p>His anger over his situation had been rekindled by his conversation with Tarleton and\u2014unable to do any bloody thing about any of it\u2014turned his mind to what he wanted to do to Harkness, should he meet the 26th Light Dragoons. He touched his chest by reflex, and his sudden urge to do violence changed at once to an equally sudden rush of desire that made him light-headed.</p><p>Then he recalled his original errand, and hot blood washed through his face. He rode more slowly, calming his mind. Harkness could wait. The Endicotts couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Thought of the family pained him\u2014and not only because he was ashamed of letting himself be distracted from their difficulty. But in recollecting them now, he realized that for those few moments with the Endicotts, concerned with their troubles, he\u2019d forgotten. Forgotten the burden he\u2019d been carrying like a pound of lead in his chest. Forgotten who he really was.</p><p>What would Anne Endicott have done, if she knew? Her parents? Even . . . well, no. He smiled, despite his disquiet. He didn\u2019t think Peggy Endicott would mind if he told her he was secretly a cutpurse or a cannibal, let alone a\u2014</p> <p>Everyone else he knew, though . . . The Endicotts were only one Loyalist family who\u2019d welcomed him into their home, and he\u2019d not taken proper leave of any of those who chose to stay in Philadelphia, too ashamed to see them, knowing the truth.</p><p>He looked back over his shoulder; the Endicotts were barely visible, now sitting in the grass in a companionable circle, sharing food of some kind. He felt a keen pang at the sight of their companionability. He\u2019d never be part of a decent family, couldn\u2019t ever marry a woman even of such modest origins as Anne Endicott.</p><p>Her father might well be ruined, might have lost his wealth and business, the family might descend into poverty\u2014but they would remain who they were, firm in their courage and the pride of their name. Not him. His name didn\u2019t belong to him.</p><p>Well . . . he could marry, he grudgingly admitted to himself, making his way gingerly through a group of camp followers. But only a woman who wanted nothing but his title and money would have him, and to wed under such circumstances, knowing that your wife despised you . . . and to know that you passed the taint of your blood to your sons . . .</p><p>This morbid train of thought stopped abruptly with the appearance of a small group of artisans, trudging beside a large wagon that undoubtedly held their tools.</p><p>He came down on them like a wolf on a flock of startled sheep and ruthlessly cut out a fine, fat wainwright, whom he persuaded by threats and bribery to mount behind him and thus carried his prey back to the Endicotts.</p><p>With his spirit soothed by their gratitude, he turned northward again, toward the head of the army, camp, and his supper. Absorbed in thoughts of roast chicken and gravy\u2014he ate with Clinton\u2019s staff, and thus ate very well\u2014he didn\u2019t notice at once that another horseman had come up alongside him, matching his pace.</p><p>\u201cPenny for your thoughts?\u201d said a pleasant, half-familiar voice, and he turned to find himself looking into the smiling face of Denys Randall-Isaacs.</p> <p>WILLIAM REGARDED Randall-Isaacs with something between annoyance and curiosity. The man had to all effects abandoned him in Quebec City a year and a half before and vanished, leaving him to spend the winter snowbound with nuns and voyageurs. The experience had improved both his French and his hunting abilities, but not his temper.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Randall-Isaacs,\u201d he said in acknowledgment, rather coldly. The captain smiled sunnily at him, not at all put off by his tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, just Randall these days,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father\u2019s name, you know. The other bit was a courtesy to my stepfather, but as the old man\u2019s passed on now . . .\u201d He lifted one shoulder, leaving William to draw the obvious conclusion: that a Jewish-sounding surname couldn\u2019t be an asset to an ambitious officer.</p><p>\u201cSurprised to see you here,\u201d Randall went on, chummy, as though they\u2019d seen each other at a ball last month. \u201cYou were at Saratoga with Burgoyne, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s hand tightened on the reins, but he patiently explained his peculiar status. For possibly the twentieth time.</p><p>Randall nodded, respectful.</p><p>\u201cCertainly better than cutting hay in Massachusetts,\u201d he said, with a glance at the marching columns they were passing. \u201cThought of going back to England, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d William said, somewhat startled. \u201cWhy? For one thing, I doubt I can, by the terms of parole. For another\u2014why should I?\u201d Why, indeed? he thought, with a fresh stab. He\u2019d not even begun to think about what awaited him in England, at Helwater, at Ellesmere. In London, for that matter . . . oh, Jesus . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy, indeed?\u201d Randall said, unconsciously echoing him. The man sounded thoughtful. \u201cWell . . . not much opportunity for distinguishing yourself here, is there?\u201d He glanced very briefly at William\u2019s belt, bare of weapons, and away again directly, as though the sight was somehow shameful\u2014which it was.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it you think I could do there?\u201d William demanded, keeping his temper with some difficulty.</p><p>\u201cWell, you are an earl,\u201d Randall pointed out. William felt the blood rise up his neck, but couldn\u2019t say anything. \u201cYou have a seat in the House of Lords. Why not use it to accomplish something? Take up politics. Doubt your parole says anything about that\u2014and as long as you weren\u2019t going back to rejoin the army, I shouldn\u2019t think the travel itself would be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never thought of it,\u201d William said, striving for politeness. He couldn\u2019t think of anything he\u2019d less rather do than be political\u2014unless it was be political while acting a sham.</p><p>Randall tilted his head amiably to and fro, still smiling. He was much as he\u2019d been when William had seen him last: dark hair tied back without powder, good-looking rather than handsome, slender without being slight, graceful in movement, with a constant expression of sympathetic geniality. He hadn\u2019t changed much\u2014but William had. He was two years older now, much more experienced, and was both surprised and a little gratified to discover that he realized that Randall was playing him like a hand of bezique. Or trying to.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are other possibilities,\u201d he said, guiding his horse around an enormous puddle of muddy urine that had collected in a dip in the road.</p><p>Randall\u2019s horse had paused to add to it. Randall sat as composedly as one can in such a situation, but didn\u2019t try to raise his voice over the noise. He picked his way out of the mud and caught William up before continuing the conversation.</p><p>\u201cPossibilities?\u201d He sounded genuinely interested, and probably was, William thought\u2014but why? \u201cWhat were you thinking of doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou recall Captain Richardson, of course?\u201d William asked casually, but with an eye on Randall\u2019s face. One dark brow rose a bit, but otherwise he showed no particular emotion at hearing the name.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Randall replied, as casual as William. \u201cHave you seen the good captain recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a couple of days ago.\u201d William\u2019s temper had abated, and he waited with interest to see what Randall might have to say to this.</p><p>The captain didn\u2019t look taken aback, exactly, but his air of pleasant inconsequence had definitely sharpened into something else. William could actually see him wondering whether to ask bluntly what Richardson had wanted or to take another tack, and the perception gave him a small thrill.</p><p>\u201cIs Lord John with Sir Henry?\u201d Randall asked. That was enough of a non sequitur to make William blink, but there was no reason not to answer.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why should he be?\u201d</p><p>The brow lifted again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? The Duke of Pardloe\u2019s regiment is in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d William was more than startled by that, but hastened to collect himself. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Randall waved a well-manicured hand, as though the answer to this was irrelevant\u2014as perhaps it was.</p><p>\u201cPardloe left Philadelphia this morning with Sir Henry,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs the duke has recalled Lord John to duty, I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d William\u2019s horse jerked his head and snorted at the exclamation, and William stroked the big neck, using the gesture to avert his face for a moment. His father was here?</p><p>\u201cI stopped at his lordship\u2019s house in Philadelphia yesterday,\u201d Randall explained, \u201cand a rather odd Scotchwoman\u2014she must be his lordship\u2019s housekeeper, I collect?\u2014told me that his lordship had been gone for several days. But if you haven\u2019t seen him . . .\u201d</p><p>Randall raised his head, looking ahead. A haze of woodsmoke was already showing above the trees, cook fires, wash fires, and watch fires all marking the growing camp, their tang a pleasant spice in the nostrils. It made William\u2019s stomach growl.</p><p>\u201cHup! Hup! At the double, quick . . . march!\u201d A sergeant\u2019s bellow came from behind them, and they pulled aside for a double column of infantry, who hadn\u2019t needed the exhortation; they were eager for their dinner and the chance to lay down their arms for the night.</p><p>The pause gave William room for a moment\u2019s thought: ought he to ask Randall to sup with him later, try to draw him out? Or get the hell away from the man as quickly as possible, using his need to wait on Sir Henry as excuse? But what if Lord John really was with Sir Henry right this moment? And bloody Uncle Hal\u2014all he needed in the present circumstance!</p><p>Randall had evidently used the pause for thought, as well, and come to his own decision. He came up close beside William, and after a quick glance to be sure no one was near them, leaned close and spoke in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI say this as a friend, Ellesmere\u2014though I grant you\u2019ve no reason to trust me, I hope you\u2019ll listen. Don\u2019t, for God\u2019s sake, engage in any enterprise that Richardson suggests. Don\u2019t go with him anywhere, no matter what the circumstances. If you can avoid it, don\u2019t even talk to him again.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he reined his horse\u2019s head around, spurred up abruptly, and was off down the road at a gallop, heading away from the camp.</p><p>SCROUNGING</p><p>GREY WOULDN\u2019T MIND, if it weren\u2019t for the headaches. The ache in his side had faded to something tolerable; he thought a rib might be cracked, but as long as he didn\u2019t have to run, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. The eye, though . . .</p><p>The injured eye stubbornly refused to move but jerked in its socket, pulling against whatever obstruction held it\u2014an orbicularis muscle? Was that what Dr. Hunter had called it?\u2014in an attempt to focus with its fellow. This was painful and exhausting in itself but also led to double vision and crushing headaches, and he found himself often unable to eat when they halted, wanting only to lie down in darkness and wait for the throbbing to cease.</p><p>By the time they stopped to make camp on the evening of the second day of march, he could barely see out of his good eye, and his stomach was heaving with nausea.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, thrusting his hot journeycake at one of his fellows, a tailor from Morristown named Phillipson. \u201cYou take it. I can\u2019t, not just . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t go on, but pressed the heel of his hand hard against his closed eye. Green and yellow pinwheels and brilliant flashes of light erupted behind his eyelid, but the pressure eased the pain for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYou save it for later, Bert,\u201d Phillipson said, tucking the journeycake into Grey\u2019s rucksack. He bent close and peered at Grey\u2019s face in the firelight. \u201cYou need a patch for that eye,\u201d he declared. \u201cKeep you from rubbing at it, at least; it\u2019s red as a whore\u2019s stocking. Here.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he took off his own battered felt hat and, whipping a small pair of scissors from his bosom, cut a neat round patch from the brim, rubbed a bit of spruce gum round the edge to make it stick, and then bound it carefully in place over the injured orb with a spotted handkerchief contributed by one of the other militiamen. All of them clustered round to watch, with the kindest expressions of concern, offers of food and drink, suggestions as to which company had a surgeon that might come to let his blood, and so on. Grey, in the weakness of pain and exhaustion, thought he might weep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He managed to thank them all for their concern, but at last they left off, and after a swig of something unidentifiable but strongly alcoholic from Jacobs\u2019s canteen, he sat on the ground, shut his good eye, leaned his head back against a log, and waited for the throbbing in his temples to lessen.</p><p>Despite his bodily discomfort, he felt comforted in spirit. The men with him weren\u2019t soldiers, and God knew they weren\u2019t an army\u2014but they were men, engaged in common purpose and mindful of one another, and that was a thing he knew and loved.</p><p>\u201c. . . and we bring our needs and desires before thee, O great Lord, and implore thy blessing upon our deeds . . .\u201d</p><p>The Reverend Woodsworth was conducting a brief service of prayers. He did this every evening; those who wished might join him; those who didn\u2019t occupied themselves in quiet conversation or small tasks of mending or whittling.</p> <p>Grey had no real idea where they were, save somewhere to the northeast of Philadelphia. Messengers on horseback met them now and then, and confused bits of news and speculation spread like fleas through the group. He gathered that the British army was heading north\u2014clearly to New York\u2014and that Washington had left Valley Forge with his troops and was intending to attack Clinton somewhere en route, but no one knew where. The troops were to muster at a place called Coryell\u2019s Ferry, at which point they might, possibly, be told where they were going.</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste energy on thinking about his own position. He could escape easily enough in the darkness, but there was no point in doing so. Wandering around the countryside in the midst of converging militia companies and regular troops, he ran more risk of ending up back in the custody of Colonel Smith, who would probably hang him out of hand, than he did in remaining with Woodsworth\u2019s militia.</p><p>The danger might increase when they did join Washington\u2019s troops\u2014but large armies really couldn\u2019t hide from each other, nor did they try to avoid notice. If Washington got anywhere near Clinton, Grey could at that point easily desert\u2014if one considered it desertion\u2014and cross the lines into British hands, risking only being shot by an overenthusiastic sentry before he could surrender and make himself known.</p><p>Gratitude, he thought, hearing Mr. Woodsworth\u2019s prayer through a haze of growing drowsiness and fading pain. Well, yes, there were a few more things he could count on his list of blessings.</p><p>William was still on parole and thus a noncombatant. Jamie Fraser had been released from the Continental army to escort Brigadier Fraser\u2019s body back to Scotland. Though he\u2019d returned, he was no longer in the army; he wouldn\u2019t be in this fight, either. His nephew Henry was healing, but in no way fit for combat. There was no one likely to be involved in the coming battle\u2014if there was one\u2014over whom he need worry. Though come to think. . . . His hand found the empty pocket of his breeches. Hal. Where the bloody hell was Hal?</p> <p>He sighed, but then relaxed, breathing in the scents of woodsmoke, pine needles, and roasted corn. Wherever Hal was, he\u2019d be safe enough. His brother could take care of himself.</p><p>The prayers over, one of his companions had started to sing. It was a song he knew, but the words were quite different. His version, picked up from an army surgeon who\u2019d fought with the Colonials during the French and Indian war, went:</p><p>Brother Ephraim sold his Cow</p><p>And bought him a Commission;</p><p>And then he went to Canada</p><p>To fight for the Nation;</p> <p>But when Ephraim he came home</p><p>He proved an arrant Coward,</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t fight the Frenchmen there</p><p>For fear of being devour\u2019d.</p><p>Dr. Shuckburgh hadn\u2019t had much opinion of the colonials, and neither had the composer of the newer version, used as a marching song. He\u2019d heard that one in Philadelphia and hummed along under his breath.</p><p>Yankee Doodle came to town,</p><p>For to buy a firelock,</p><p>We will tar and feather him,</p> <p>And so we will John Hancock!</p><p>His present companions were now singing\u2014with gusto\u2014the latest evolution:</p><p>Yankee Doodle went to town</p><p>A-riding on a pony,</p><p>Stuck a feather in his cap</p><p>And called it Macaroni!</p><p>He wondered, yawning, whether any of them knew that the word dudel meant \u201csimpleton\u201d in German. He doubted Morristown, New Jersey, had ever seen a macaroni, those affected young men who went in for pink wigs and a dozen face patches.</p><p>As his headache eased, he began to appreciate the simple pleasure of reclining. The shoes with their makeshift laces fit him badly and, as well as rubbing his heels raw, gave him shooting pains in the shins from the effort of constantly clenching his toes in order to keep the bloody things on. He stretched his legs gingerly, almost enjoying the tenderness in his muscles, so near bliss by contrast with walking.</p><p>He was distracted from his catalog of meager blessings by a small, hungry gulp near his ear, followed by a young, low voice.</p><p>\u201cMister . . . if ye\u2019re not meanin\u2019 to eat that journeycake yourself . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh . . . yes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>He struggled to sit up, one hand pressed protectively over his bad eye, and turned his head to see a boy of eleven or twelve sitting on the log just beside him. He had his hand inside his sack, rummaging for the food, when the boy let out a gasp, and he looked up, vision wavering in the firelight, to discover himself face-to-face with Claire\u2019s grandson, fair hair in a tousled halo round his head and a look of horror on his face.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d he said in a whisper, and grabbed the child\u2019s knee in such a sudden grip that the boy gave a small yelp.</p><p>\u201cWhy, what\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Bert? Caught you a thief?\u201d Abe Shaffstall, distracted from a desultory game of knucklebones, looked over his shoulder, peering shortsightedly at the boy\u2014Christ, what was his name? His father was French; was it Claude? Henri? No, that was the younger boy, the dwarf. . . .</p><p>\u201cTais-toi!\u201d he said under his breath to the boy, and turned to his companions. \u201cNo, no\u2014this is a neighbor\u2019s son from Philadelphia\u2014er . . . Bobby. Bobby Higgins,\u201d he added, grabbing at the first name that offered itself. \u201cWhat\u2019s brought you out here, son?\u201d he asked, hoping that the boy was as quick-witted as his grandmother.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 for my grandda,\u201d the boy replied promptly, though his eyes shifted uneasily round the circle of faces, now all aimed in his direction as the singing died away.</p><p>\u201cMy mam sent me with some clothes and food for him, but some wicked fellows in the wood pulled me off my mule and . . . and t-took everything.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice trembled realistically, and Grey noticed that, in fact, his dirty cheeks showed the tracks of tears.</p><p>This provoked a rumble of concern round the circle and the immediate production from pokes and pockets of hard bread, apples, dried meat, and dirty handkerchiefs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your grandpa\u2019s name, son?\u201d Joe Buckman inquired. \u201cWhat company is he with?\u201d</p><p>The boy looked nonplussed at this and shot a quick glance at Grey, who answered for him.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser,\u201d he said, with a reassuring nod that made his head throb. \u201cHe\u2019d be with one of the Pennsylvania companies, wouldn\u2019t he, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d The boy wiped his nose on the proffered handkerchief and gratefully accepted an apple. \u201cMer\u2014\u201d He interrupted himself with an artful coughing fit and amended this to \u201cThank ye kindly, sir. And you, sir.\u201d He handed back the handkerchief and set himself to ravenous consumption, this limiting his replies to nods and shakes of the head. Indistinct mumbles indicated that he had forgotten the number of his grandfather\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cNo matter, boy,\u201d Reverend Woodsworth said comfortingly. \u201cWe\u2019re all a-going to the same place to muster. You\u2019ll find your grandpa with the troops there, surely. You think you can keep up with us, though, a-foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, sir,\u201d Germain\u2014that was it! Germain!\u2014said, nodding fast. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Grey said hastily, and that seemed to settle it.</p><p>He waited impatiently until everyone had forgotten the boy\u2019s presence and begun to ready themselves for sleep, then rose, muscles protesting, and jerked his head at Germain to follow him, muffling an exclamation of pain at the movement.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said in a low voice, as soon as they were out of earshot. \u201cWhat the devil are you doing out here? And where is your bloody grandfather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lookin\u2019 for him,\u201d Germain replied, unbuttoning his flies to piss. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to\u2014\u201d He paused, obviously unsure what his relationship with Grey now was. \u201cBeg pardon, my lord, but I dinna ken should I tell ye that or not. I mean . . .\u201d The boy was no more than a silhouette against the darker black of the undergrowth, but even the outline of his body expressed an eloquent wariness. \u201cComment se fait-il que vous soyez ici?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I come to be here,\u201d Grey repeated under his breath. \u201cComment, indeed. Never mind. I\u2019ll tell you where we\u2019re going, shall I? I gather we\u2019re bound for a place called Coryell\u2019s Ferry to join General Washington. Does that ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>Germain\u2019s slender shoulders relaxed, and a soft pattering on the earth indicated that apparently it did. Grey joined him, and, finished, they turned back toward the glow of the campfire.</p><p>Still in the shelter of the woods, Grey put his hand on Germain\u2019s shoulder and squeezed. The boy stopped dead.</p><p>\u201cAttendez, monsieur,\u201d Grey said, low-voiced. \u201cIf the militia learn who I am, they\u2019ll hang me. Instantly. My life is in your hands from this moment. Comprenez-vous?\u201d</p><p>There was silence for an unnerving moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you a spy, my lord?\u201d Germain asked softly, not turning round.</p><p>Grey paused before answering, wavering between expediency and honesty. He could hardly forget what he\u2019d seen and heard, and when he made it back to his own lines, duty would compel him to pass on such information as he had.</p><p>\u201cNot by choice,\u201d he said at last, just as softly.</p><p>A cool breeze had risen with the setting of the sun, and the forest murmured all around them.</p><p>\u201cBien,\u201d Germain said at last. \u201cAnd thank ye for the food.\u201d He turned then, and Grey could see the glint of firelight on one fair brow, arched in inquisitiveness.</p><p>\u201cSo I am Bobby Higgins. Who are you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBert Armstrong,\u201d Grey replied shortly. \u201cCall me Bert.\u201d</p><p>He led the way then toward the fire and the blanket-humped rolls of sleeping men. He couldn\u2019t quite tell, above the rustling of the trees and the snoring of his fellows, but he thought the little bugger was laughing.</p><p>MORPHIA DREAMS</p><p>WE SLEPT THAT NIGHT in the public room of an ordinary in Langhorne. Bodies were sprawled on tables and benches, curled under the tables, and laid in haphazard arrangements on pallets, folded cloaks, and saddlebags, as far away from the hearth as they could get. The fire was banked, but it still radiated considerable heat. The room was filled with the bitter scents of burning wood and boiling bodies. I estimated the temperature in the room at something like ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit, and the slumbering bodies on display were largely unclad, pale haunches, shoulders, and bosoms glimmering in the sullen glow of the embers.</p><p>Jamie had been traveling in shirt and breeches, his new uniform and its dazzling smallclothes carefully folded into a portmanteau until we got within range of the army, so his disrobing was a simple matter of unbuttoning his flies and pulling off his stockings. Mine was complicated by the fact that my traveling stays had leather laces, and over the course of a sweat-drenched day, the knot had tightened into a stubborn nodule that resisted all attempts.</p><p>\u201cAre ye no coming to bed, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie was already lying down, having found a remote corner behind the bar counter and spread out our cloaks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve broken a fingernail trying to get this bloody thing loose, and I can\u2019t bloody reach it with my teeth!\u201d I said, on the verge of breaking into tears of frustration. I was swaying with weariness, but couldn\u2019t bring myself to sleep in the clammy confines of my stays.</p><p>Jamie reached up an arm out of the darkness, beckoning.</p><p>\u201cCome lie down wi\u2019 me, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>The simple relief of lying down, after twelve hours in the saddle, was so exquisite that I nearly changed my mind about sleeping in my stays, but he\u2019d meant it. He squirmed down and bent his head to nuzzle at my laces, an arm round my back to steady me.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash,\u201d he murmured into my midsection, voice somewhat muffled. \u201cIf I canna nibble it loose, I\u2019ll prise it wi\u2019 my dirk.\u201d</p><p>He looked up with an inquiring noise, as I\u2019d uttered a strangled laugh at the prospect.</p><p>\u201cJust trying to decide whether being accidentally disemboweled would be worse than sleeping in my stays,\u201d I whispered, cupping his head. It was warm, the soft hair at his nape damp to the touch.</p><p>\u201cMy aim\u2019s no that bad, Sassenach,\u201d he said, pausing in his labors for an instant. \u201cI\u2019d only risk stabbin\u2019 ye in the heart.\u201d</p><p>As it was, he accomplished his goal without recourse to weapons, gently jerking the knot loose with his teeth until he could finish the job with his fingers, opening the heavy seamed canvas stays like a clamshell to expose the whiteness of my shift. I sighed like a grateful mollusk opening at high tide, plucking the fabric out of the creases the stays had made in my flesh. Jamie pushed away the discarded stays but remained where he was, his face near my br**sts, rubbing his hands gently over my sides.</p><p>I sighed again at his touch; he\u2019d done it by habit, but it was a habit I\u2019d missed for the last four months, and a touch I\u2019d thought never to feel again.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re too thin, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can feel every rib. I\u2019ll find ye food tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I had been too much preoccupied in the last few days to think about food, and was much too tired at the moment to be hungry, but made an agreeable sound in response and stroked his hair, tracing the curve of his skull. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, a nighean,\u201d he said, very softly, his breath warm on my skin.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I answered just as softly, taking the ribbon from his hair and loosening his plait between my fingers. I pressed his head closer to me, not in invitation, but out of the sudden urgent need to keep him close to me, to protect him.</p><p>He kissed my breast and turned his head, laying it in the hollow of my shoulder. He took one deep breath, one more, and then was asleep, the relaxing weight of his body against me both protection and trust.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said, almost soundless, my arms wrapped tight about him. \u201cOh, dear God, I love you.\u201d</p> <p>IT MIGHT HAVE been the sense of overwhelming fatigue, or the smell, the mingling of alcohol and unwashed bodies, that made me dream of the hospital.</p><p>I was walking down the little hall beyond the men\u2019s ward at the hospital where I\u2019d done my nurse\u2019s training, the tiny bottle of morphia grains in my hand. The walls were dingy gray; so was the air. At the end of the hall was the alcohol bath where the syringes were kept.</p><p>I lifted one out, cold and slippery, careful not to drop it. But I did drop it; it slid from my hand and shattered on the floor, spraying glass shards that cut my legs.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t worry about that; I had to get back with the morphine injection\u2014men were calling out behind me, desperate, and somehow it was the sound of the operating tent in France back there, men moaning, screams and hopeless sobbing, and my fingers shook with urgency, groping in the cold steel bath among glass syringes that rattled like bones.</p><p>I pulled one out, gripping it so tightly that it, too, broke in my hand, and blood ran down my wrist, but I wasn\u2019t conscious of pain. Another, I must have another; they were in dreadful pain and I could stop it, if only . . .</p> <p>Somehow I had a clean syringe and had got the top off the tiny bottle of morphia grains, but my hand was shaking, the grains spilling like salt; Sister Amos would be furious. I needed tweezers, forceps; I couldn\u2019t grasp the tiny pellets with my fingers and, in a panic, shook several of them into the syringe, a whole grain, not the quarter grain called for, but I had to get to the men, had to stop their pain.</p><p>Then I was running back down the endless gray hall toward the cries, shards of glass glinting among the red blood drops on the floor, both as bright as dragonfly wings. But my hand was growing numb, and the last syringe fell from my fingers before I reached the door.</p><p>And I woke up with a jolt that seemed to stop my heart. I gulped smoke and the fug of beer and bodies, not knowing where I was.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Sassenach, are ye all right?\u201d Jamie, startled out of sleep, rolled up onto his elbow above me, and I came back into the present with as much of a jolt as my awakening had been. My left arm was numb from the shoulder down, and there were tears on my cheeks; I felt the coolness on my skin.</p><p>\u201cI . . . yes. Just a . . . a bad dream.\u201d I felt ashamed to confess it, as though it were his privilege alone to suffer nightmares.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He lowered himself beside me with a sigh and gathered me to him with one arm. He ran a thumb over my face and, finding wetness, blotted it matter-of-factly with his shirt. \u201cAll right now?\u201d he whispered, and I nodded, thankful that I needn\u2019t talk about it.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He stroked the hair off my face and rubbed my back gently, the circles of his hand growing gradually slower until he fell asleep again.</p><p>It was deep night, and a deep sleep lay upon the room. The whole of it seemed to breathe in unison, snores and gasps and grunts all fading into something like the waves of a receding tide, rising and falling and bearing me with them, safely back into the depths of sleep.</p><p>Only the pins and needles of feeling returning to my dead arm kept me from it, and that only momentarily.</p><p>I could still see the blood and the shards of glass and heard against the susurrus of snores the crash of falling crystal, saw the bloody smudges on the wallpaper at Number 17.</p><p>Dear Lord, I prayed, listening to Jamie\u2019s heart under my ear, slow and steady. Whatever happens, let him have a chance to talk to William.</p><p>TAKEN AT A DISADVANTAGE</p><p>WILLIAM LED HIS HORSE down among the rocks to a level place where both of them could drink. It was midafternoon, and after a day spent riding to and fro along the column in the blazing sun, he was parched as a piece of last year\u2019s venison jerky.</p><p>His present horse was Madras, a cob with a deep chest and a steady, stolid disposition. The horse waded purposefully into the stream, hock-deep, and sank his nose into the water with a blissful snort, shivering his coat against the cloud of flies that appeared instantly out of nowhere whenever they stopped.</p> <p>William waved a couple of insects away from his own face and took off his coat for a moment\u2019s relief from the heat. He was tempted to wade in, too\u2014up to his neck, if the creek was deep enough\u2014but . . . well . . . He looked cautiously over his shoulder, but he was well out of sight, though he could hear the sounds of the baggage train on the distant road. Why not? Just for a moment. It wasn\u2019t as though the dispatch he was carrying was urgent; he\u2019d seen it written, and it contained nothing more than an invitation for General von Knyphausen to join General Clinton for supper at an inn with a reputation for good pork. Everyone was wringing with sweat; dampness would be no telltale.</p><p>He hastily shucked shoes, shirt, stockings, breeches, and smalls, and walked naked into the purling water, which barely reached his waist but was wet and cool. He closed his eyes in blissful relief\u2014and opened them abruptly a half second later.</p><p>\u201cWilliam!\u201d</p><p>Madras flung up his head with a startled snort, showering William with droplets, but he barely noticed in the shock of seeing two young women standing on the opposite bank.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing here?\u201d He tried to squat a little lower in the water without being conspicuous about it. Though a dim voice in the back of his mind wondered aloud why he bothered: Arabella\u2013Jane had already seen anything he had. \u201cAnd who\u2019s that?\u201d he demanded, jerking his chin at the other girl. Both of them were flushed as summer roses, but he thought\u2014he hoped\u2014it was the result of the heat.</p><p>\u201cThis is my sister, Frances,\u201d Jane said, with the elegance of a Philadelphia matron, and gestured to the younger girl. \u201cCurtsy to his lordship, now, Fanny.\u201d</p><p>Fanny, a very lovely young girl with dark curls peeping out under her cap\u2014what was she, eleven, twelve?\u2014bobbed him a sweet curtsy, blue-and- red-calico petticoats outspread, and dropped long lashes modestly over the big, soft eyes of a young doe.</p><p>\u201cYour most humble servant, mademoiselle,\u201d he said, bowing with as much grace as possible, which, judging from the expressions on the girls\u2019 faces, was probably a mistake. Fanny clapped a hand over her mouth and went much redder from the effort not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI am charmed to meet your sister,\u201d he said to Jane, rather coldly. \u201cBut I fear you take me at something of a disadvantage, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s a piece of luck,\u201d Jane agreed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think how we were to find you in that moil, and when we saw you ride past like the fiend was after you\u2014we\u2019d got a ride on a baggage wagon\u2014I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d ever catch you. But we took the chance, and . . . voil\u00e0! Fortuna favet audax, you know.\u201d She wasn\u2019t even trying to pretend she wasn\u2019t laughing at him!</p><p>He scrabbled for some cutting rejoinder in Greek, but the only thing that came to his inflamed mind was a humiliating echo from his past, something his father had said to him on the occasion when he\u2019d accidentally fallen into a privy: \u201cWhat news from the underworld, Persephone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn your backs,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cI\u2019m getting out.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t. Gritting his teeth, he turned his own back on them and deliberately climbed the bank, feeling the itch of four interested eyes focused on his dripping backside. He grabbed his shirt and wrestled his way into it, feeling that even that much shelter would enable him to carry on the conversation in a more dignified manner. Or maybe he\u2019d just tuck his breeches and boots under his arm and leave without further chat.</p><p>The sound of heavy splashing whilst he was still enveloped in the folds of his shirt made him whirl round, head popping free just in time to see Madras lunge up out of the creek on the girls\u2019 side, lips already reaching for the apple Jane was holding out to him.</p><p>\u201cCome back here, sir!\u201d he shouted. But the girls had more apples, and the horse paid no attention whatever\u2014nor did he object when Arabella\u2013Jane took his reins and looped them casually round the trunk of a young willow.</p><p>\u201cI noticed that you didn\u2019t ask how we came to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cDoubtless surprise has deprived you of your usual exquisite manners.\u201d She dimpled at him and he eyed her severely.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cI distinctly recall saying, \u2018What. The. Devil. Are. You. Doing. Here.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you did,\u201d she said, without a blush. \u201cWell, not to put too fine a point on the matter, Captain Harkness came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, in a slightly different tone. \u201cI see. You, um, ran away, then?\u201d</p><p>Frances nodded solemnly.</p><p>William cleared his throat. \u201cWhy? Captain Harkness is doubtless with the army. Why would you come here, of all places, instead of staying safe in Philadelphia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t,\u201d Jane said. \u201cHe was detained on business in Philadelphia. So we came away. Besides,\u201d she added carelessly, \u201cthere are thousands of women with the army. He\u2019d never find us, even if he was looking\u2014and why should he be?\u201d</p><p>That was reasonable. Still . . . he knew what the life of an army whore was like. He also had a strong suspicion that the girls had run out on their contract with the brothel; very few saved enough from their wages to buy their way out, and both of these girls were much too young to have made much money. To abandon the reasonable comfort of clean beds and regular meals in Philadelphia in order to accommodate filthy, sweating soldiers amidst mud and flies, paid in blows as often as in coin . . . Yet he was obliged to admit that he\u2019d never been buggered by a vicious sod like Harkness and thus had no true basis for comparison.</p><p>\u201cI expect you want money, to assist in your escape?\u201d he said, an edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps,\u201d said Jane. Reaching into her pocket, she held up something shiny. \u201cMostly, I wanted to give this back to you.\u201d</p><p>His gorget! He took an involuntary step toward her, toes squelching in the mud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014thank you,\u201d he said abruptly. He\u2019d felt its lack every time he dressed, and felt even more the weight of his fellow officers\u2019 eyes on the empty spot where it should rest. He\u2019d been obliged to explain to Colonel Desplains what had happened\u2014more or less\u2014saying that he\u2019d been robbed in a bawdy house. Desplains had chewed him bloody, but then had given him reluctant leave to appear without a gorget until he might get another in New York.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2014we, I mean\u2014really want is your protection,\u201d Jane said, doing her best to look winsomely earnest, and doing it damned well.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should have any difficulty in making a living with the army,\u201d she said frankly, \u201cbut \u2019tisn\u2019t really what I want for my dear sister, that sort of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . no. I imagine not,\u201d William said warily. \u201cWhat else did you have in mind?\u201d \u201cLady\u2019s maid?\u201d he wanted to suggest sarcastically, but in light of the return of his gorget, he refrained.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t quite made up my mind,\u201d she said, fastening her gaze on the ripples where the creek ran over rocks. \u201cBut if you could help us to get safely to New York\u2014and maybe find us a place there . . .\u201d</p><p>William ran a hand down his face, wiping away a layer of fresh sweat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want much, do you?\u201d he said. On the one hand, if he didn\u2019t give her some assurance of help, he wouldn\u2019t put it past her to fling his gorget into the water in a fit of pique. And on the other . . . Frances was a lovely child, delicate and pale as a morning-glory blossom. And on the third hand, he hadn\u2019t any more time to spare in argument.</p><p>\u201cGet on the horse and come across,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI\u2019ll find you a new place with the baggage train. I have to ride a dispatch to von Knyphausen just now, but I\u2019ll meet you in General Clinton\u2019s camp this evening\u2014no, not this evening, I won\u2019t be back until tomorrow. . . .\u201d He fumbled for a moment, wondering where to tell her to find him; he could not have two young whores asking for him at General Clinton\u2019s headquarters. \u201cGo to the surgeons\u2019 tent at sundown tomorrow. I\u2019ll\u2014think of something.\u201d</p><p>IN WHICH I MEET A TURNIP</p><p>DURING THE NEXT DAY\u2019S ride, we encountered a messenger, sent back from Washington\u2019s command with a note for Jamie. He read this leaning against a tree, while I made an unobtrusive visit to a nearby clump of brush.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he say?\u201d I asked, straightening my clothes as I emerged. I was still rather awed that Jamie had actually spoken with George Washington, and the fact that he was frowning at a letter presumably written by the future Father of the Country . . .</p><p>\u201cTwo or three things,\u201d he replied with a shrug, and, refolding the note, stuffed it into his pocket. \u201cThe only important bit o\u2019 news is that my brigade is to be under the command of Charles Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Charles Lee?\u201d I got my foot into the stirrup and heaved myself into the saddle.</p><p>\u201cI know of him.\u201d What he knew appeared to be rather problematic, judging from the line between his brows. I raised my own; he glanced at me and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI met him, ken, when I first met General Washington. I made it my business to learn a bit more about him since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you didn\u2019t like him,\u201d I observed, and he gave me a small snort.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, nudging his horse into a walk. \u201cHe\u2019s loud and unmannerly and a sloven\u2014I could see that much for myself\u2014but from what I\u2019ve heard since, he\u2019s also jealous to the bone and doesna trouble to hide it verra well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJealous? Of whom?\u201d Not Jamie, I hoped.</p><p>\u201cOf Washington,\u201d he answered matter-of-factly, surprising me. \u201cHe thought he should have command o\u2019 the Continental army and doesna like playin\u2019 second fiddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019d never once heard of General Charles Lee, which seemed odd, if he had such prominence as to have made that a reasonable expectation. \u201cWhy does he think that, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. He feels he has a good deal more in the way of military experience than Washington\u2014and that\u2019s maybe true: he was in the British army for some time and fought a number of successful campaigns. Still\u2014\u201d He lifted one shoulder and dropped it, dismissing General Lee for the moment. \u201cI wouldna have agreed to do this, had it been Lee who asked me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to do it, regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d He considered for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s true I didna want to do this\u2014I don\u2019t now.\u201d He looked at me, apologetic. \u201cAnd I truly dinna want you to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be where you are for the rest of our lives,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cIf that\u2019s a week or another forty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger,\u201d he said, and smiled.</p><p>We rode for a time in silence, but deeply aware of each other. We had been, since that conversation in the gardens at Kingsessing.</p> <p>\u201cI will love ye forever. It doesna matter if ye sleep with the whole English army\u2014well, no, it would matter, but it wouldna stop me loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken ye to bed a thousand times at least, Sassenach. Did ye think I wasna paying attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere couldna be anyone like you.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t forgotten a word we\u2019d said\u2014and neither had he, though neither one of us had spoken of it again. We weren\u2019t walking on tiptoe with each other, but we were feeling our way . . . finding our way into each other, as we\u2019d done twice before. Once, when I\u2019d returned to find him in Edinburgh\u2014and at the beginning, when we\u2019d found ourselves wed by force and joined by circumstance. Only later, by choice.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have wanted to be?\u201d I asked, on impulse. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been born the laird of Lallybroch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. If my elder brother hadna died, ye mean,\u201d he said. A small shadow of regret crossed his face, but didn\u2019t linger. He still mourned the boy who had died at eleven, leaving a small brother to pick up the burden of leadership and struggle to grow into it\u2014but he had been accustomed to that burden for a very long time.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe that,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what if you\u2019d been born elsewhere, maybe to a different family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldna be who I am, then, would I?\u201d he said logically, and smiled at me. \u201cI may quibble wi\u2019 what the Lord\u2019s called me to do now and then, Sassenach\u2014but I\u2019ve nay argument wi\u2019 how he made me.\u201d</p><p>I looked at what he was\u2014the strong, straight body and capable hands, the face so full of everything he was\u2014and had no argument, either.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he said, and tilted his head consideringly, \u201cif it had been different, I wouldna have you, would I? Or have had Brianna and her weans?\u201d</p><p>If it had been different . . . I didn\u2019t ask whether he thought his life as it was had been worth the cost.</p><p>He leaned over and touched my cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth it, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat.</p> <p>\u201cFor me, too.\u201d</p><p>IAN AND ROLLO caught us up a few miles from Coryell\u2019s Ferry. Darkness had fallen, but the glow of the camp was faintly visible against the sky, and we made our way cautiously in, being stopped every quarter mile or so by sentries who popped unnervingly out of the dark, muskets at the ready.</p><p>\u201cFriend or foe?\u201d the sixth of these demanded dramatically, peering at us in the beam of a dark lantern held high.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Fraser and his lady,\u201d Jamie said, shielding his eyes with his hand and glaring down at the sentry. \u201cIs that friendly enough for ye?\u201d</p><p>I muffled a smile in my shawl; he\u2019d refused to stop to find food along the way, and I\u2019d refused to let him consume uncooked bacon, no matter how well smoked. Jenny\u2019s four apples hadn\u2019t gone far, we\u2019d found no food since the night before, and he was starving. An empty stomach generally woke the fiend that slept within, and this was clearly in evidence at the moment.</p><p>\u201cEr . . . yes, sir, General, I only\u2014\u201d The lantern\u2019s beam of light shifted to rest on Rollo, catching him full in the face and turning his eyes to an eerie green flash. The sentry made a strangled noise, and Ian leaned down from his horse, his own face\u2014Mohawk tattoos and all\u2014appearing suddenly in the beam.</p><p>\u201cDinna mind us,\u201d he said genially to the sentry. \u201cWe\u2019re friendly, too.\u201d</p><p>TO MY SURPRISE, there was actually a good-sized settlement at the Ferry, with several inns and substantial houses perched on the bank of the Delaware.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why Washington chose this as the rendezvous point?\u201d I asked Jamie. \u201cGood staging, I mean, and some supply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, there\u2019s that,\u201d he said, though he spoke abstractedly. He\u2019d risen a little in his stirrups, looking over the scene. Every window in every house was lit, but a large American flag, with its circle of stars, flapped above the door of the largest inn. Washington\u2019s headquarters, then.</p><p>My chief concern was to get some food into Jamie before he met with General Lee, if the aforementioned indeed had a reputation for arrogance and short temper. I didn\u2019t know what it was about red hair, but many years\u2019 experience with Jamie, Brianna, and Jemmy had taught me that while most people became irritable when hungry, a redheaded person with an empty stomach was a walking time bomb.</p><p>I sent Ian and Rollo with Jamie to find the quartermaster, discover what we might have in the way of accommodation, and unload the pack mule, then followed my nose toward the nearest scent of food.</p><p>The dug-in camp kitchens would long since have banked their fires, but I\u2019d been in many army camps and knew how they worked; small kettles would be simmering all night, filled with stew and porridge for the morning\u2014the more so as the army was in hot pursuit of General Clinton. Amazing to think that I had met him socially only a few days before\u2014</p><p>I\u2019d been so focused on my quest that I hadn\u2019t seen a man come out of the half dark and nearly ran into him. He seized me by the arms and we waltzed a dizzy half-turn before coming to rest.</p><p>\u201cPardon, madame! I am afraid I have stepped upon your foot!\u201d said a young French voice, very concerned, and I looked straight into the very concerned face of a very young man. He was in shirtsleeves and breeches, but I could see that his shirtsleeves sported deep, lace-trimmed cuffs. An officer, then, in spite of his youth.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, you have,\u201d I said mildly, \u201cbut don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m not damaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe suis tellement d\u00e9sol\u00e9, je suis un navet!\u201d he exclaimed, striking himself in the forehead. He wore no wig, and I saw that despite his age, his hair was receding at a rapid pace. What was left of it was red and inclined to stand on end\u2014possibly owing to his apparent habit of thrusting his fingers through it, which he was now doing.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d I said in French, laughing. \u201cYou aren\u2019t a turnip at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, switching to English. He smiled charmingly at me. \u201cI once stepped on the foot of the Queen of France. She was much less gracious, sa Majest\u00e9,\u201d he added ruefully. \u201cShe called me a turnip. Still, if it hadn\u2019t happened\u2014I was obliged to leave the court, you know\u2014perhaps I would never have come to America, so we cannot bemoan my clumsiness altogether, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d</p><p>He was exceedingly cheerful and smelled of wine\u2014not that that was in any way unusual. But given his exceeding Frenchness, his evident wealth, and his tender age, I was beginning to think\u2014</p><p>\u201cHave I the, um, honor of addressing\u2014\u201d Bloody hell, what was his actual title? Assuming that he really was\u2014</p><p>\u201cPardon, madame!\u201d he exclaimed, and, seizing my hand, bowed low over it and kissed it. \u201cMarie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, a votre service!\u201d</p><p>I managed to pick \u201cLa Fayette\u201d out of this torrent of Gallic syllables and felt the odd little thump of excitement that happened whenever I met someone I knew of from historical accounts\u2014though cold sober realism told me that these people were usually no more remarkable than the people who were cautious or lucky enough not to end up decorating historical accounts with their blood and entrails.</p><p>I gathered sufficient composure to inform him that I was Madame General Fraser and that I was sure my husband would shortly be along to pay his respects, directly I had located some supper.</p><p>\u201cBut you must come and dine with me, madame!\u201d he said, and, having not let go of my hand, was in a position to tuck it cozily into his elbow and tow me off toward a large building that looked like an inn of some sort. An inn was precisely what it was, but an inn that had been commandeered by the Rebel forces and was now General Washington\u2019s headquarters\u2014as I discovered when le marquis led me under a fluttering banner, through the taproom, and into a large back room where a number of officers were sitting at table, presided over by a large man who did not look precisely like the image on a dollar bill, but close enough.</p><p>\u201cMon G\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\u201d the marquis said, bowing to Washington and then gesturing to me. \u201cI have the honor to present to you Madame General Fraser, the personification of grace and loveliness!\u201d</p><p>The table rose as one, with a screeching of wooden benches, and the men\u2014in fact, there were only six of them\u2014rose and bowed to me in turn, murmuring, \u201cYour servant,\u201d and \u201cYour most obedient, ma\u2019am.\u201d Washington himself stood up at the head of the table\u2014My God, he\u2019s as tall as Jamie, I thought\u2014and gave me a very graceful bow, hand on his bosom.</p><p>\u201cI am honored by your presence, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, in a soft Virginia drawl. \u201cDare I hope that your husband accompanies you?\u201d</p><p>I had a moment\u2019s insane impulse to reply, \u201cNo, he sent me to fight instead,\u201d but managed not to say it.</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d I replied instead. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . er . . .\u201d I gestured helplessly toward the doorway, where\u2014with remarkably good timing\u2014Jamie himself now appeared, brushing pine needles off his sleeve and saying something to Young Ian, behind him.</p><p>\u201cThere ye are!\u201d he exclaimed, spotting me. \u201cSomeone told me ye\u2019d gone off with a strange Frenchman. What\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly, having suddenly realized that I wasn\u2019t merely in the company of a strange Frenchman.</p><p>The table fell about laughing, and La Fayette rushed up to Jamie and seized his hand, beaming.</p><p>\u201cMon fr\u00e8re d\u2019armes!\u201d He clicked his heels together, doubtless by reflex, and bowed. \u201cI must apologize for having stolen your lovely wife, sir. Allow me, please, to make recompense by inviting you to dinner!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d met Anthony Wayne before, at Ticonderoga, and was pleased to see him again. I was also delighted to see Dan Morgan, who gave me a hearty buss on both cheeks, and I admitted to a certain thrill at having my hand kissed by George Washington, though noticing the halitosis that accompanied his notorious dental problems. I wondered how I might make an opportunity to inspect his teeth, but gave such speculations up immediately with the arrival of a procession of servants with trays of fried fish, roast chicken, buttermilk biscuits with honey, and an amazing selection of ripe cheeses, these having been\u2014he told me\u2014brought by the marquis himself from France.</p><p>\u201cTry this one,\u201d he urged me, cutting a slab of an extremely fragrant Roquefort, green-veined and crumbly. Nathanael Greene, who sat on the other side of the marquis, pinched his nose unobtrusively and gave me a small private smile. I smiled back\u2014but in fact I quite liked strong cheese.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t the only one. Rollo, who had come in\u2014naturally\u2014with Young Ian and was sitting behind him, across the table from me, lifted his head and poked a long, hairy snout between Ian and General Lee, sniffing interestedly at the cheese.</p><p>\u201cGood Christ!\u201d Lee apparently hadn\u2019t noticed the dog before this and flung himself to one side, nearly ending in Jamie\u2019s lap. This action distracted Rollo, who turned to Lee, sniffing him with close attention.</p><p>I didn\u2019t blame the dog. Charles Lee was a tall, thin man with a long, thin nose and the most revolting eating habits I\u2019d seen since Jemmy had learned to feed himself with a spoon. He not only talked while he ate and chewed with his mouth open, but was given to wild gestures while holding things in his hand, with the result that the front of his uniform was streaked with egg, soup, jelly, and a number of less identifiable substances.</p><p>Despite this, he was an amusing, witty man\u2014and the others seemed to give him a certain deference. I wondered why; unlike some of the gentlemen at the table, Charles Lee never attained renown as a Revolutionary figure. He treated them with a certain . . . well, it wasn\u2019t scorn, certainly\u2014condescension, perhaps?</p><p>I was taken up in conversation\u2014mostly with the marquis, who was putting himself out to be charming to me, telling me how much he missed his wife (Good Lord, how old was he? I wondered. He didn\u2019t look more than twenty, if that), who had been responsible for the cheese. No, no, not making it herself, but it came from their estate at Chavaniac, which his wife ran most ably in his absence\u2014but now and then caught a glimpse of Jamie. He took part in the conversation, but I could see his eyes flick round the table, appraising, judging. And they rested most often on General Lee, beside him.</p><p>Of course, he knew Wayne and Morgan quite well\u2014and he knew what I\u2019d been able to tell him about Washington and La Fayette. God, I hoped what I thought I knew about them was halfway accurate\u2014but we\u2019d find out soon enough if it wasn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Port wine was brought\u2014evidently the meal was being hosted by the marquis; I had the distinct feeling that the high command of the Continental army didn\u2019t always eat this well. The men had largely avoided talking about the impending battle during the meal, but I could feel the subject looming like an approaching thunderstorm, bright-rimmed black clouds, excitingly shot with flickers of lightning. I began to rearrange my skirts and make gestures of incipient leave-taking, and saw Jamie, seated next to Lee across the table, notice and smile at me.</p><p>Lee noticed, too\u2014he\u2019d been gazing in an absent way at my d\u00e9colletage\u2014and broke off the anecdote he\u2019d been telling Ian, seated on his other side.</p><p>\u201cSuch a pleasure to make your acquaintance, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said cordially. \u201cYour husband obliges us extremely by allowing us the delight of your company. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lee stopped abruptly in mid-sentence\u2014and mid-bite, staring at Rollo, who had unobtrusively moved closer and was now standing no more than a couple of feet from the general. Given the low bench on which Lee was sitting and Rollo\u2019s size, this proximity placed them roughly eye-to-eye.</p> <p>\u201cWhy is that dog looking at me like that?\u201d Lee demanded, swinging round to glare at Ian.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waitin\u2019 to see what ye drop next, I expect,\u201d Ian said, chewing placidly.</p><p>\u201cIf I were you, sir,\u201d Jamie put in politely, \u201cI\u2019d drop something quickly.\u201d</p><p>IAN, ROLLO, AND I took our leave of the generals and went out into the dark to find our beds, escorted by an orderly with a lantern. Fires burned high all up and down the bank of the Delaware, and many of the boats on the river had lanterns or open fires as well, the lights reflecting in the water like shoals of glimmering fish.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about the man who ate beside you?\u201d I asked Ian, in my hesitant Gaelic. He laughed\u2014he and Jamie always laughed when I spoke Gaelic\u2014but lifted one shoulder in a negative shrug.</p> <p>\u201cI do not, but I will find out,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is an Englishman, I can tell you that much.\u201d</p><p>He used the word \u201cSassenach,\u201d which gave me a mild shock. It had been a long time since I\u2019d heard a Scot use that word in the way it was meant.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. Do you think it makes a difference?\u201d Technically, they were all still Englishmen\u2014well, bar La Fayette, von Steuben, Kosciuszko, and similar oddities\u2014but it was true that most of the Continental officers had been born and spent their lives in America. Lee hadn\u2019t. Ian made a derisory Scottish noise, indicating that it did.</p><p>\u201cBut I hear that he was adopted into the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka, too,\u201d I objected.</p><p>Ian was silent for a moment, then took my arm, leaning close to speak in my ear.</p><p>\u201cAuntie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cD\u2019ye think I ever stopped bein\u2019 a Scot?\u201d</p> <p>VESTAL VIRGINS</p><p>JAMIE AND I WERE billeted at the home of the Chenowyths, a pleasant\u2014if understandably somewhat anxious\u2014family whose home stood at the end of the single road that ran through Coryell\u2019s Ferry. Mrs. Chenowyth was in her wrapper, but greeted me kindly with a candlestick and took me to a small bedroom at the back of the house\u2014this showing the evidence of hasty evacuation by a number of young Chenowyths, these presumably now sharing their parents\u2019 room, judging from the sounds of mixed heavy breathing.</p><p>The single bed was fairly large, though Jamie\u2019s feet would still stick out by a good six inches. There was a washbasin and ewer full of fresh water; I picked this up carefully and drank from it; my throat was dry from too much French wine. I replaced the ewer and sat down on the bed, feeling rather strange.</p><p>Possibly it was the wine. Possibly it was the fact that the room had no windows, and Mrs. Chenowyth had thoughtfully closed the door behind her. It was a small room, perhaps ten feet by eight. The air was still and the candle\u2019s flame burned high and steady, pure against the bricks of the wall. Perhaps it was the candle that brought to mind Uncle Lamb and the day he\u2019d told me about vestal virgins, showing me a blue chalcedony carving from the temple of Vesta.</p><p>\u201cShould a virgin betray her vows,\u201d he\u2019d said, waggling his eyebrows at me, \u201cshe\u2019d be whipped, then sealed up alive in a small underground tomb, equipped with a table and chair, some water, and a single candle. And there she would die, when the air ran out.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d considered that with a sort of morbid relish\u2014I might have been ten\u2014and then asked with interest just how a vestal might betray her vows. Which is how I learned what used to be called \u201cthe facts of life,\u201d Uncle Lamb not being one to shirk any fact that wandered across his path, or mine. And while Uncle Lamb had assured me that the cult of Vesta had long since ceased operations, I had at that point resolved not to be a virgin, just in case. On the whole, a good resolution, though sleeping with men did have the most peculiar side effects.</p><p>Ian had brought along my saddlebags, which he\u2019d dumped in the corner of the room before going off with Rollo to find his own sleeping place. I got up and fumbled for my toothbrush and tooth powder, though it seemed quite surreal to be brushing my teeth on what might be the eve of battle. Not quite rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic . . . or at least I hoped not.</p><p>I knew that Washington and the marquis were going to survive whatever happened\u2014and spared a thought for the strangeness of now thinking of them as men and not names. The large pores on George Washington\u2019s nose as he\u2019d bent over my hand, and the shadowed pits of old smallpox scars across his lower cheeks; the smell of him, starch and sweat, wine and wig powder\u2014for he wore his wig, hot as it was\u2014the sweetly nasty smell of dental decay . . . I picked up my toothbrush, reminded, and set to work with some vigor. He\u2019d smelled of blood, too; I wondered why\u2014bleeding gums, perhaps?</p> <p>I wriggled my way out of gown, jacket, and stays and stood for a bit flapping my shift, in hopes of admitting a little air. It made the candle flicker but didn\u2019t have much effect beyond that, so I blew the candle out and lay down.</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect to sleep. Adrenaline had been jolting through me like the current in a faulty circuit ever since we\u2019d left Philadelphia, but now it was settling down to a steady humming in my blood. The conversation over dinner had been fairly general, but the atmosphere had been electric with anticipation. Clearly, once Ian and I had left and the plates had been removed . . . It was as close as I had ever been to a council of war, and the vibrations of it were still tingling through me.</p><p>There was anxiety tingling, too, to be sure\u2014there had been amongst the men, as well. But given a suitable outlet, anxiety can be transformed into very effective action, and that\u2019s plainly what Washington and his generals were now doing, hammering out plans, assigning troops, drawing up strategies . . . I wished I was amongst them. It would be much easier than lying in the pitch dark, staring up into a boring infinity\u2014nasty way to die, that.</p><p>I sat up, gulping air, and went hastily to the door. No sounds, no light seeping under the door. I patted round on the floor \u2019til I located my shoes and the puddle of my cloak and, swinging this over my shoulders, slipped out and made my way silently through the half-dark house, past the smoldering hearth and out.</p><p>The door was unbolted and on the latch; perhaps Mr. Chenowyth was out and expected back. I supposed there was some danger of my being locked out, but at this point spending the night in the midst of a military camp in my shift seemed preferable to sleeping\u2014or, rather, not sleeping\u2014in a tomb. Besides, I was sure that one of the small Chenowyths had wee\u2019d in the bed fairly recently.</p><p>No one took any notice of me as I walked back along the road. The taverns and ordinaries were crammed full and spilling customers all over the road. Continental regulars in their blue and buff, swaggering about, the envy\u2014they hoped\u2014of the militiamen. Any number of women, too, and not all whores, by any means. But above all . . . air.</p><p>The heat of the day had largely gone, and while the air wasn\u2019t cold by any means, it wasn\u2019t stifling, either. Having escaped entombment, I reveled in the feeling of freedom\u2014and what amounted to invisibility, for tall as I was, with my cloak on and my hair tied back in a plait for bed, I looked much like many of the militiamen in the dark; no one glanced twice at me.</p><p>The street and the camp beyond were electric; I recognized the feeling, and it gave me the oddest sense of dislocation\u2014for I recognized it in its various forms from half of the battlefields I\u2019d served near, from France in 1944 to Prestonpans and Saratoga. It wasn\u2019t always this way; often the sense of the occasion was one of dread\u2014or worse. I remembered the night before Culloden and felt a wave of cold wash through me so strongly that I staggered and nearly fell against the wall of a building.</p><p>\u201cFriend Claire?\u201d said a voice, in amazement.</p><p>\u201cDenzell?\u201d Half-blinded by a number of torches being borne past, I blinked at the shape that had manifested before me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is thee doing out here?\u201d he said, alarmed. \u201cIs anything wrong? Is it Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could say it\u2019s Jamie,\u201d I said, getting back my composure. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing wrong, no. I was just getting a bit of air. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was fetching a pitcher of beer,\u201d he said, and took me firmly by the arm, steering me down the street. \u201cCome with me. Thee ought not be in the street with the fighting men. Those that aren\u2019t drunk now will be shortly.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t argue. His hand on my arm felt good, steadying me against the strange currents of the night that seemed to carry me willy-nilly into the past\u2014and the future\u2014and back again without warning.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Rachel and Dottie?\u201d I asked, as we turned right at the end of the street and began to thread our way through the campfires and rows of tents.</p><p>\u201cRachel\u2019s gone somewhere with Ian; I didn\u2019t inquire. Dottie\u2019s in our medical tent, dealing with a case of acute indigestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear. What did she eat?\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cThe indigestion isn\u2019t hers. A woman named Peabody, who came in complaining of colic pains. Dorothea said she would administer something appropriate, if I would go and fetch her some beer\u2014it being not safe for her to venture to the ordinary alone.\u201d</p><p>I thought I detected a small note of reproach in his voice, but I made an indeterminate \u201chmm\u201d in response and he said no more about my wandering the streets en d\u00e9shabill\u00e9. Possibly because he hadn\u2019t noticed that I was en d\u00e9shabill\u00e9, until we entered the Hunters\u2019 big medical tent and I took my cloak off.</p><p>Denny gave me one brief, shocked look, coughed, and, picking up a canvas apron, managed to hand it to me without looking directly at me. Dottie, who was massaging the massive back of a very large woman seated hunched over on a stool in front of her, grinned at me over the woman\u2019s capped head.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Auntie. Restless tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I replied frankly, putting on the apron. \u201cThis is Mrs. Peabody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dottie smothered a yawn with her shoulder. \u201cThe indigestion seems to be better\u2014I gave her gripe water and peppermint,\u201d she added, to Denny. \u201cBut she\u2019s complaining of pains in her back, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I came over and squatted down in front of the woman, who appeared to be half asleep\u2014until I caught a whiff of her breath, which was eighty proof, at least. I put my hand on her belly to see if I could feel the location of the trouble, when she coughed thickly in a way I\u2019d heard all too often before, choked\u2014and I leapt back just in time.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the apron, Denny,\u201d I said mildly, brushing off some of the higher flecks of mud and vomit that had spattered on me. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you brought a birthing stool with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA birthing stool. To a battle?\u201d he said faintly, his eyes bulging slightly behind his spectacles as he looked at the woman, now swaying ponderously to and fro, like a large bell making up its mind whether to ring or not.</p><p>\u201cI rather think it may be one,\u201d I said, glancing round. \u201cIf she\u2019s in labor. Can you find a blanket, Dottie? I think we\u2019ll have to lay her on the ground; she\u2019ll collapse the cot.\u201d</p><p>It took all three of us to wrestle Mrs. Peabody\u2014who relapsed comfortably into unconsciousness the moment we touched her\u2014onto a blanket spread on the ground under the lantern. There was an almost instant insurgence of moths, as they came fluttering in, attracted not only by the light but by the assorted smells thickening the air.</p><p>Mrs. Peabody had lapsed not merely into unconsciousness but into what appeared to be an alcoholic coma. After a certain amount of discussion, we\u2019d turned her onto one side, in case she should vomit again, and the position had allowed her belly to flow away from the rest of her corpulent body, so that it lay on the ground in front of her, gravid and sac-like. She looked like the queen of some order of social insect, ready to deliver in the thousands, but I refrained from mentioning this, as Dottie was still pale.</p><p>Denzell had recovered from the shock and was keeping an eye\u2014or rather a hand\u2014on her wrist, keeping track of her pulse. \u201cAmazingly strong,\u201d he said at last, letting go, and looked up at me. \u201cDoes thee think she is near her time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really hope not,\u201d I said, looking down. \u201cBut there\u2019s no telling without . . . er . . . closer examination.\u201d I took a deep breath and a grip on my more generous instincts. \u201cWould you like me to . . . er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and find clean water,\u201d he said, springing to his feet and seizing a bucket.</p><p>Given that Dottie was engaged to Denny, I refrained from calling him a coward in her presence and merely waved him off in a reserved manner. Mrs. Peabody made me uneasy on a number of scores. I had no idea whether she might be about to go into labor, or, if she did, how her comatose state might affect it. The level of alcohol in her blood was certainly affecting the child\u2019s; would a drunken newborn be able to breathe? It wouldn\u2019t vomit, as there wasn\u2019t anything in its stomach to vomit, but might it void its bowels in utero and aspirate the material? That was a remarkably dangerous thing to happen even in a modern hospital with a full delivery-suite staff attending\u2014most of the babies who did that died of suffocation, lung injury, or infection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was very much ashamed to admit to myself that my chief fear, though, was that something would happen during delivery that would require me to remain with mother and/or child for a prolonged period. I could not, by my oath as a physician\u2014and what I conceived my responsibilities to be\u2014abandon a patient in dire need of me.</p><p>But I would not abandon Jamie. I knew beyond all doubt that he was going into battle, and soon. He wasn\u2019t going without me.</p><p>A slight noise jerked me out of my hypothetical moral quandary. Dottie had started unpacking and had dropped an amputation saw. She stooped to pick it up and said something under her breath in German that I thought was probably a bad word\u2014John always swore in German; perhaps it was a family habit.</p><p>Thought of John added another layer of guilt to my complicated feelings\u2014though the logical part of my brain firmly rejected this as undeserved. Still, the worry for him couldn\u2019t be rejected so easily, though I did my best to tuck it away for the present.</p> <p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t stay up, Dottie,\u201d I said. \u201cI can take care of matters here. Nothing\u2019s going to happen immediately, regardless\u2014I can make up the surgical kits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, and then yawned involuntarily, gaping so widely that she startled herself and clapped a hand belatedly over her mouth. \u201cOh, dear. I do beg your pardon, Mrs. Fraser.\u201d That made me smile; she had John\u2019s elegant manners\u2014perhaps Hal did, too, when he wasn\u2019t engaging in undiluted bastardliness.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she said, fixing me directly with her striking gaze, \u201cI\u2019m pleased to have a chance to talk with you in privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I said, squatting to put a hand on Mrs. Peabody\u2019s belly. I wasn\u2019t feeling any movement from the baby, but they usually did go quiet if labor was impending. I could have used my stethoscope to listen for a fetal heartbeat, but it was in one of the boxes or bags that Ian and the orderly had carried off somewhere. Besides, whatever I heard or didn\u2019t would make no difference to the immediate protocol.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dottie sat down on a packing case as though it were a throne\u2014like all the Greys I\u2019d met, she had excellent posture. \u201cI want to know the correct way of performing sexual intercourse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. Erm . . .\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at Mrs. Peabody.</p><p>\u201cAnd whether there is any way of preventing . . . er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnancy. To be sure.\u201d I cleared my throat. I rather thought the sight of Mrs. Peabody would have put most young women off the idea of childbearing\u2014if not sex\u2014altogether. Dorothea Grey, though, was plainly a young woman of blood and iron.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mistake me, Auntie,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cOr do I mean Friend Claire? I do want children\u2014want them terribly. But if there is any choice about giving birth on a battlefield or a moving ship, say\u2014\u201d</p><p>I seized on this last, in part to give myself time to compose something coherent in the way of advice. I\u2019d rather thought Rachel might want to talk about such things at some point, having no mother, but . . .</p> <p>\u201cA ship? Are you thinking of going home to England, then?\u201d</p><p>She grimaced in a way that brought her father vividly before me, and I nearly laughed but fortunately didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I dearly want to see Mama again, of course, and Adam . . . and my . . . well, actually, I doubt I should see any of my friends again.\u201d She waved a hand, dismissing the friends. \u201cNot that there aren\u2019t any Quakers in society, but they\u2019re all very rich, and we won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, but in a way indicating calculation rather than chagrin.</p><p>\u201cIf I can contrive to make Denny marry me here, so that we arrived in England as husband and wife already, it would be a simple matter to find a London meeting that would welcome us. Whereas here\u2014\u201d She flung out a hand toward the hum of the camp around us. \u201cHis involvement in the war would always stand in his way, you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven after the war is over?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a patient look, too old for her face.</p><p>\u201cPapa says that wars take three generations to fade from the ground where they\u2019re fought. And from what I\u2019ve seen, Friends have quite long memories, as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe might just have a point.\u201d Mrs. Peabody had begun to snore wetly, but I felt no sense of contraction. I rubbed a hand through my hair and braced my back more comfortably against one of the packing crates set against the wall. \u201cAll right. Perhaps . . . a little basic anatomy, to begin with.\u201d</p><p>I really had no idea how much\u2014if anything\u2014a nobly born young woman might have been told, or found out by other means, so began with female reproductive anatomy, starting with the womb\u2014for surely she knew what that was\u2014and leading outward, part by part.</p><p>\u201cYou mean it has a name?\u201d she exclaimed, charmed, when I got to the clitoris. \u201cI\u2019d always thought of it as just, you know . . . that bit.\u201d Her tone of voice made it abundantly clear that I needn\u2019t explain what that bit did, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it\u2019s the only structure of the human body that appears to have no function whatever save the pleasure of the owner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut men . . . don\u2019t they . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, they do,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd very pleasurable they find theirs, too. But a penis is extremely functional, as well. You, er . . . do know how it . . . works? In terms of intercourse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenzell won\u2019t let me touch his naked member, and I\u2019m longing to see it at my leisure\u2014not just the odd glimpse when he, well, you know.\u201d Her eyes sparkled at the thought. \u201cBut I know what it feels like through his breeches. I was amazed, the first time it went stiff under my hand! However does it do that?\u201d</p><p>I explained the concept of hydrostatic pressure as simply as possible, already seeing what was coming next. I cleared my throat and rose to my knees.</p><p>\u201cI need to examine Mrs. Peabody for any sign of labor. And while we must be respectful of her privacy\u2014so far as such a thing exists under these conditions\u201d\u2014for Dottie had snorted loudly\u2014\u201csince you\u2019re assisting me here, there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t observe what I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019ll explain it to you as we go. How things . . . work.\u201d</p><p>She hummed with interest as I gingerly unveiled Mrs. Peabody\u2019s nether regions, which were thickly forested but still identifiably\u2014very identifiably\u2014feminine.</p><p>\u201cWhen the cervix\u2014that\u2019s the opening to the womb\u2014when it begins to open in order for the baby to come out, there\u2019s often some blood and mucus released, but it\u2019s quite harmless. I don\u2019t see any sign of it yet, though.\u201d That heartened me.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Dottie, rather faintly. But she leaned intently over my shoulder as I carefully inserted my freshly washed hand. \u201cOh!\u201d Dottie said, in tones of extreme revelation. \u201cThat\u2019s where it goes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, it is,\u201d I said, trying not to laugh\u2014and failing. \u201cDenzell would have told you, I expect. Did you ask him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, sitting back a little on her heels but still watching closely as I put a hand on Mrs. Peabody\u2019s abdomen and felt the cervix. Softened, but still firm. I began to breathe again.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I said, only half-attending.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She drew herself up. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to seem ignorant. Denny\u2019s so\u2014I mean, he\u2019s educated. I can read, of course, and write, but only letters, and play music, but that\u2019s useless. I bustle round after him and help where I can, of course, and he\u2019s always so good about explaining things . . . but . . . well, I kept having this vision of our wedding night and him explaining it to me in just the same way he\u2019d tell me how to suck the snot out of a child\u2019s nose with a tube or hold the skin together so he could stitch a wound. And . . .\u201d She made a graceful little moue, which had to be her mother\u2019s legacy. \u201cAnd I made up my mind it wasn\u2019t going to be that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery . . . um . . . commendable.\u201d I withdrew my hand and wiped it, re-covered Mrs. Peabody, and checked her pulse again\u2014slow, but strong as a tympani; the woman must have the heart of an ox. \u201cHow\u2014er\u2014how do you want it to be? Bearing in mind,\u201d I hastened to add, \u201cthat this sort of thing is rather variable.\u201d Another thought occurred to me. \u201cHas Denzell ever . . . ? Though I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>Her soft white brow wrinkled in thought.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I never thought of asking him. I just assumed\u2014well, I have brothers. I know they have, because they talk about it\u2014whores, I mean\u2014with their friends. I suppose I thought all men . . . but, come to think, perhaps Denny wouldn\u2019t go to a prostitute. Do you think he might have?\u201d Her brow furrowed a little, but she didn\u2019t seem upset at the thought. Of course, it was probably commonly accepted in the Greys\u2019 social circle that men, or soldiers at least, naturally would.</p><p>With very vivid memories of my own wedding night\u2014and my stupefaction upon being informed that my bridegroom was a virgin\u2014I temporized a bit.</p><p>\u201cPossibly not. Now, being a medical man, plainly he must know the essential mechanics. But there is more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew brighter and she leaned forward, hands on her knees.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRATHER LIKE EGG white mixed with a drop or two of civet. Theoretically good for the skin, though frankly\u2014\u201d I was saying, when I heard the sound of voices just outside the tent.</p><p>Rachel and Ian had returned, looking cheerful, flushed, and quite like young people who had just passed the last hour or two doing the sorts of things in which I\u2019d been instructing Dottie. I saw her glance sideways at Rachel, then\u2014very briefly\u2014at Ian\u2019s breeches. Her color went up a notch.</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t notice, her attention having fixed at once on Mrs. Peabody\u2014well, everyone\u2019s attention was fixed on Mrs. Peabody; it was really impossible to look at anything else. She frowned at the supine woman on the ground and then looked at me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Denzell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent question. He left a quarter of an hour ago to find water. There\u2019s beer, though, if you\u2019re thirsty.\u201d I nodded at the neglected pitcher.</p><p>Ian poured a cup for Rachel, waited while she drank it, then refilled it for himself, eyes still fixed on Mrs. Peabody, who was emitting a remarkable variety of noises, though still out cold.</p><p>\u201cDoes Uncle Jamie ken where ye are, Auntie?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe was lookin\u2019 for ye just now. He said he\u2019d put ye somewhere safe to sleep, but ye\u2019d escaped. Again,\u201d he added with a broad grin.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s finished with the generals for the night, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he went to make the acquaintance o\u2019 some of the militia captains under him, but most had gone to sleep by then, so he went to join ye at the Chenowyths. Mrs. Chenowyth was a bit taken aback to find ye gone,\u201d he added delicately.</p><p>\u201cI just came out for a little air,\u201d I said, defensive. \u201cAnd then\u2014\u201d I gestured at the patient on the floor, who had now settled down to a rhythmic snore. Her color was looking better; that was heartening. \u201cEr . . . is Jamie put out, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Ian and Rachel both laughed at that.</p><p>\u201cNo, Auntie,\u201d Ian said. \u201cBut he\u2019s dead tired, and he wants ye bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in precisely those words,\u201d Rachel said, \u201cbut his meaning was plain.\u201d She turned to Ian, with a quick squeeze of his arm. \u201cWould thee go and find Denny, Ian? Claire can\u2019t leave this woman alone\u2014I think?\u201d she asked, arching a brow at me.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem to be going into labor immediately\u201d\u2014I crossed my fingers against the possibility\u2014\u201cbut she oughtn\u2019t to be left alone in this state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course.\u201d Ian yawned suddenly, widely, but then shook himself back into alertness. \u201cIf I come across Uncle Jamie, I\u2019ll tell him where ye are, Auntie.\u201d</p><p>He left, and Rachel poured another cup of beer, which she offered me. It was room temperature\u2014and a warm room, at that\u2014but refreshingly sour and strong. I hadn\u2019t really thought I was tired, but the beer revivified me astonishingly.</p><p>Dottie, having checked Mrs. Peabody\u2019s pulse and breathing, laid a ginger hand on the distended bulge of pregnancy. \u201cHas thee attended a birth before, good-sister?\u201d Dottie asked Rachel, being careful of her plain speech.</p><p>\u201cSeveral,\u201d Rachel replied, squatting down by Mrs. Peabody. \u201cThis looks somewhat different, though. Has she suffered some injur\u2014oh!\u201d The brewery reek hit her, and she reared back and coughed. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Peabody uttered a loud moan and everyone stiffened. I wiped my hands on my apron, just in case. She relaxed again, though, and after a few moments\u2019 contemplative silence to see if Mrs. Peabody would do it again, Dottie took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cMrs.\u2014I mean, Friend Claire was just telling me some very interesting things. Regarding . . . er . . . what to expect on one\u2019s wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked up with interest.</p><p>\u201cI should welcome any such instruction myself. I know where the . . . um . . . parts go, because I\u2019ve seen them go there fairly frequently, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?!?\u201d Dottie gawked at her, and Rachel laughed.</p><p>\u201cI have. But Ian assures me that he has more skill than the average bull or billy goat, and my observations are limited to the animal world, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d A small line showed between her brows. \u201cThe woman who cared for me after the death of my parents was . . . very dutiful in informing me of my womanly obligations, but her instructions consisted largely of \u2018Spread thy legs, grit thy teeth, girl, and let him.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat down on the packing case and stretched to ease my back, suppressing a groan. God knew how long it might take Ian to find Jamie among the teeming hordes. And I did hope that Denny hadn\u2019t been knocked on the head or trampled by a mule.</p><p>\u201cPour me another cup of beer, will you? And have some more yourselves. I suspect we may need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . and if he says, \u2018Oh, God, oh, God,\u2019 at some point,\u201d I advised, \u201ctake note of what you were just doing, so you can do it again next time.\u201d</p><p>Rachel laughed, but Dottie frowned a little, looking slightly cross-eyed.</p> <p>\u201cDo you\u2014does thee\u2014think Denny would take the Lord\u2019s name in vain, even under those circumstances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard him do it on much less provocation than that,\u201d Rachel assured her, stifling a burp with the back of her hand. \u201cHe tries to be perfect in thy company, thee knows, for fear thee will change thy mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d Dottie looked surprised but rather pleased. \u201cOh. I wouldn\u2019t, thee knows. Ought I to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until he says, \u2018Oh, God, oh, God,\u2019 for thee,\u201d Rachel said, succumbing to a giggle.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cIf a man says, \u2018Oh, God,\u2019 in that situation, he nearly always means it as a prayer.\u201d</p> <p>Dottie\u2019s fair brows drew together in concentration.</p><p>\u201cA prayer of desperation? Or gratitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . that\u2019s up to you,\u201d I said, and stifled a small belch of my own.</p><p>Approaching male voices outside the tent made us all glance self-consciously at the empty beer pitcher and sit up straight, poking at our slightly disheveled hair, but none of the gentlemen who came in were in any condition to cast stones.</p><p>Ian had found Denzell and Jamie, and somewhere along the way they had acquired a small, stout companion in a cocked hat, with his hair in a stumpy pigtail. All of them were flushed and, while certainly not staggering, were surrounded by a distinct haze of fermented barleycorn.</p><p>\u201cThere ye are, Sassenach!\u201d Jamie brightened still further at seeing me, and I felt a small rush of delight at it. \u201cAre ye\u2014who\u2019s this?\u201d He had been advancing toward me, hand outstretched, but stopped abruptly at sight of Mrs. Peabody, who was lying with her arms flung out, mouth wide open.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the lady I told ye about, Uncle Jamie.\u201d Ian wasn\u2019t staggering, either, but was distinctly swaying and took hold of the tent pole to steady himself. \u201cThe one that\u2019s . . . ehm . . .\u201d He gestured with his free hand to the gentleman in the cocked hat. \u201cShe\u2019s his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Aye, I see.\u201d He edged gingerly around Mrs. Peabody\u2019s recumbent form. \u201cShe\u2019s no dead, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cI think I would have noticed.\u201d He might have been somewhat inebriated, but still caught the faint dubious emphasis I\u2019d placed on \u201cthink.\u201d He knelt down carefully and put a hand in front of her open mouth.</p><p>\u201cNay, only drunk,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cShall we lend ye a hand to take her home, Mr. Peabody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter lend him a wheelbarrow,\u201d Dottie whispered to Rachel, beside me, but luckily no one noticed.</p><p>\u201cThat would be kindly of you, sir.\u201d Surprisingly, Mr. Peabody appeared to be the only sober one of the lot. He knelt and smoothed the damp hair tenderly off his wife\u2019s brow. \u201cLulu? Wake up, darling. Time to be going now.\u201d</p><p>To my surprise, she opened her eyes and, after blinking several times in confusion, appeared to fix her gaze on her husband.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Simon!\u201d she said, and, with a rapturous smile, fell soundly back asleep.</p> <p>Jamie rose slowly, and I could hear the small bones in his back pop as he eased himself. He was still flushed and smiling, but Ian had been right\u2014he was dead tired. I could see the deep lines of weariness in his face and the hollows under his bones.</p><p>Ian saw them, too.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Claire\u2019s in need of her bed, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said, squeezing Jamie\u2019s shoulder and giving me a meaning look. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long night for her. Take her along, aye? Denny and I can help Mr. Peabody.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave his nephew a sharp look and then turned the same look on me, but I obligingly yawned widely enough to make my jaw crack\u2014no great effort\u2014and with a final quick look at Mrs. Peabody to be sure she was neither dying nor going into labor, I took his arm and towed him determinedly outside, waving briefly in farewell.</p><p>Outside, we both drew deep breaths of fresh air, sighed in unison, and laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt has been rather a long night, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d I put my forehead against his chest and my arms around him, slowly rubbing the knobs of his vertebrae through his coat. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He sighed again and kissed the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve command of ten companies of mixed militia from Pennyslvania and New Jersey; the marquis has command of a thousand men\u2014including mine\u2014and is in charge of a plan to go and bite the British army in the arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d The racket of the camp had died down considerably, but the thick air still held the vibrations of many men, awake or uneasily asleep. I thought I could feel that same expectant vibration pass through Jamie, in spite of his obvious tiredness. \u201cYou need sleep, then.\u201d</p><p>His arm tightened round me and his free hand traveled slowly down my back. I\u2019d left Denny\u2019s apron in the tent, and my cloak was over my arm; the thin muslin of my shift might as well have not existed.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, and his big, warm hand cupped my buttock with a sudden urgency. \u201cI need you, Sassenach. I need ye bad.\u201d</p><p>The shift was just as thin in front as in back; I could feel his waistcoat buttons\u2014and a few other things\u2014through it. He did want me bad.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind doing it in a crypt that smells of wee?\u201d I asked, thinking of the Chenowyths\u2019 back bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken ye in worse places, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>Before I could say, \u201cName three,\u201d the tent flap opened to disgorge a small procession, this consisting of Denzell, Dottie, Rachel, and Ian, each couple carrying one end of a canvas sheet on which lay the protuberant form of Mrs. Peabody. Mr. Peabody led the way, lantern held high.</p><p>We were standing in shadow, and they passed without noticing us, the girls giggling at the occasional stumble, the young men grunting with effort, and Mr. Peabody calling out encouragement as they made their laborious way through the darkness, presumably heading for the Peabody abode.</p><p>The tent stood before us, dark and invitingly empty.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>The stretcher bearers had taken the lantern, and the setting moon was the barest sliver above the horizon; the inside of the tent was filled with a soft, dusty black that rose up around us in a fragrantly alcoholic cloud\u2014with a faint tang of vomit\u2014when we stepped inside.</p><p>I recalled exactly where things were, though, and we managed to push together four of the packing crates. I spread my cloak on these, he took off his coat and waistcoat, and we lay down precariously in the beery dark together.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think we have?\u201d I asked, undoing his flies. His flesh was warm and hard under my hand, and his skin there soft as polished silk.</p><p>\u201cLong enough,\u201d he said, and brushed my nipple with his thumb, slowly, in spite of his own apparent urgency. \u201cDinna hurry yourself, Sassenach. There\u2019s no telling when we\u2019ll have the chance again.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me lingeringly, his mouth tasting of Roquefort and port. I could feel the vibration of the camp here, too\u2014it ran through both of us like a fiddle string pegged tight.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think I\u2019ve got time to make ye scream, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cBut I\u2019ve maybe time to make ye moan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, possibly. It\u2019s some time \u2019til dawn, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Whether it was the beer and premarital explanations, the late hour and lure of secrecy\u2014or only Jamie himself and our increasing need to shut out the world and know only each other\u2014he had time, and to spare.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said at last, and came down slowly on me, his heart beating heavy against my ribs. \u201cOh . . . God.\u201d</p><p>I felt my own pulse throb in hands and bones and center, but couldn\u2019t manage any response more eloquent than a faint \u201cOoh.\u201d After a bit, though, I recovered enough to stroke his hair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go home again soon,\u201d I whispered to him. \u201cAnd have all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>That got me a softly affirmative Scottish noise, and we lay there for a bit longer, not wanting to come apart and get dressed, though the packing cases were hard and the possibility of discovery increasing with each passing minute.</p><p>At last he stirred, but not to rise.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he said softly, in another tone altogether. \u201cThree hundred men.\u201d And held me tighter.</p><p>STINKING PAPIST</p><p>THE SUN WASN\u2019T YET above the horizon, but the horse park was busy as an anthill, full of grooms, foragers, teamsters, and farriers, all scurrying about their business in an incongruous soft pink light filled with the sound of hundreds of pairs of steadily champing jaws. William picked up the bay gelding\u2019s hoof and held out his hand for the hoof pick his new, small groom was clutching nervously to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow, come here, Zeb,\u201d he said coaxingly. \u201cI\u2019ll show you how it\u2019s done; there\u2019s nothing to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Zebedee Jeffers edged an inch closer, eyes flicking back and forth from the hoof to the towering mass of horseflesh. Jeffers did not like horses. He particularly didn\u2019t like Visigoth. William thought it was just as well that Zeb likely didn\u2019t know what a Visigoth was.</p><p>\u201cAll right. See there?\u201d He tapped the pick against the shadow: the edge of a small rock that had trapped itself under the curve of the iron shoe during the night. \u201cIt\u2019s only a little one, but it feels just like a pebble in your own shoe would feel, and he\u2019ll go lame if we don\u2019t take care of it. Here, it\u2019s not stuck fast; do you want to try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Zeb said honestly. Zebedee came from the shore of Maryland and knew about oysters, boats, and fish. Not horses.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d William said, with a touch of impatience. He\u2019d be riding back and forth along the columns a dozen times a day, carrying dispatches and gathering reports; both his horses needed to be kept ready, his regular groom, Colenso Baragwanath, was down with a fever, and he hadn\u2019t time to find another servant.</p><p>\u201cYes, he will. Sir,\u201d Zeb added as an afterthought. \u201cSee?\u201d He held out a scrawny arm, displaying what was undoubtedly a festering bite mark.</p><p>William suppressed the urge to ask what the devil the boy had been doing to the horse. Visigoth wasn\u2019t a bad-tempered horse on the whole, but he could be irritable, and Zeb\u2019s nervous fidgeting was enough to try anyone, let alone a tired and hungry horse.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said with a sigh, and pried the rock loose with one sharp dig. \u201cBetter, then?\u201d he said to the horse, running a hand down the leg and then patting Goth\u2019s flank. He felt in his pocket and drew out a bunch of limp carrots, bought the night before from a farmwoman who\u2019d come through camp with baskets of produce on a yoke across her broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHere. Give him that; make friends with him,\u201d he suggested, handing a carrot to Zeb. \u201cHold it flat on your hand.\u201d Before the boy could extend this putative olive branch, though, the horse reached down and snatched it from his fingers with an audible crunch of big yellow teeth. The boy uttered a small shriek and took several steps back, collided with a bucket, and fell over it, arse over teakettle.</p><p>Torn between annoyance and an unseemly urge to laugh, William smothered both and went to pick his groom out of a manure pile.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d he said, dusting the boy off with a firm hand, \u201cyou see that all my dunnage is aboard the baggage wagon, see if Colenso needs anything, and make sure there\u2019s something for me to eat tonight. I\u2019ll ask Sutherland\u2019s groom to tend the horses.\u201d</p><p>Zeb sagged with relief.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd go see one of the surgeons and have that arm tended to!\u201d William shouted after him, above the rising sound of braying and whickering. The boy\u2019s shoulders rose up around his ears and he walked faster, pretending he hadn\u2019t heard.</p><p>William saddled Goth himself\u2014he always did, not trusting anyone else to check tack that his life might depend on\u2014then left him with his other horse, Madras, and went to find Lord Sutherland\u2019s groom. Despite the bustle, he had no trouble finding the string; Sutherland had ten horses, all prime creatures of sixteen hands or so, and at least a dozen grooms to tend them. William was just concluding negotiations with one of these when he caught sight of a familiar face among the throng.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said, under his breath, but Captain Richardson had seen him and was coming toward him, smiling genially.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Lord Ellesmere. Your servant, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours, sir,\u201d William said, as pleasantly as he could. What did the scoundrel want now? he wondered. Not that Richardson was a scoundrel\u2014or not necessarily one, despite Randall\u2019s warning. It might, after all, be Randall who was the scoundrel. But he did hold rather a grudge against Richardson, on Mother Claire\u2019s account, as well as his own. The thought of Mother Claire stabbed him unexpectedly, and he forced it back. None of it was her fault.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you here, your lordship,\u201d Richardson said, glancing round at the roiling camp. The sun was up, and bands of gold lit the fog of dust rising from the mules\u2019 rough coats. \u201cYou are a conventioneer, are you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d William said coldly. Richardson certainly knew he was. William felt obliged to defend himself, though against what, he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI cannot fight.\u201d He spread his arms slightly. \u201cAs you see, I carry no weapons.\u201d He made polite motions indicating his immediate need to be elsewhere, but Richardson went on standing there, smiling with that very ordinary face, so unremarkable that his own mother probably couldn\u2019t pick him out of a crowd, save for a large brown mole on the side of his chin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, to be sure.\u201d Richardson drew a little closer, lowering his voice. \u201cThat being the case . . . I wonder whether\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d William said definitely. \u201cI am one of General Clinton\u2019s aides, and I cannot leave my duty. You will excuse me, sir; I am expected.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and made off, his heart hammering\u2014and realized rather belatedly that he had left his horse behind. Richardson was still standing at the far side of the horse park, talking to a groom who was taking down the pickets, coiling the rope around one shoulder as he did so. The crowd of horses and mules was swiftly diminishing, but there were enough still near Visigoth to enable William to duck in and pretend to be fiddling with his saddlebags, head bent to hide his face until Richardson should go away.</p><p>The conversation had left him with an unsettling image of his erstwhile stepmother as he had last seen her, disheveled and en d\u00e9shabill\u00e9 but glowing with a radiant life he had never seen. He didn\u2019t suppose she was his stepmother anymore, but he\u2019d liked her. Belatedly, it occurred to him that Claire now-Fraser still was his stepmother\u2014by a different father. . . . Bloody hell.</p> <p>He set his teeth, rummaging in the saddlebag for his canteen. Now that that Scotch bugger had returned from his watery grave, throwing everything and everyone into confusion . . . why couldn\u2019t he have drowned and never come back?</p><p>Never come back.</p><p>\u201cYou are a stinking Papist, and your baptismal name is James.\u201d He froze as though shot in the back. He bloody remembered it. The stables at Helwater, the warm smell of horses and mash, and the prickle of straw that worked its way through his stockings. Cold stone floors. He\u2019d been crying . . . Why? All he recalled was a huge wash of desolation, total helplessness. The end of the world. Mac leaving.</p><p>He took a long, slow breath and pressed his lips together. Mac. The word didn\u2019t bring back a face; he couldn\u2019t remember what Mac had looked like. He\u2019d been big, that was all. Bigger than Grandfather or any of the footmen or the other grooms. Safety. A sense of constant happiness like a soft, worn blanket.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered, closing his eyes. And had that happiness been a lie, too? He\u2019d been too little to know the difference between a groom\u2019s deference to the young master and real kindness. But . . .</p> <p>\u201c\u2018You are a stinking Papist,\u2019\u201d he whispered, and caught his breath on something that might have been a sob. \u201c \u2018And your baptismal name is James.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only name I had a right to give ye.\u201d</p><p>He realized that his knuckles were pressed against his chest, against his gorget\u2014but it wasn\u2019t the gorget\u2019s reassurance that he sought. It was that of the little bumps of the plain wooden rosary that he\u2019d worn around his neck for years, hidden under his shirt where no one would see it. The rosary Mac had given him . . . along with his name.</p><p>With a suddenness that shocked him, he felt his eyes swim. You went away. You left me!</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d he said, and punched his fist so hard into the saddlebag that the horse snorted and shied, and a bolt of white-hot pain shot up his arm, obliterating everything.</p><p>DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT</p> <p>IAN WOKE JUST BEFORE dawn to find his uncle squatting beside him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m away to break bread wi\u2019 the captains of my companies,\u201d Jamie said without preamble. \u201cYe\u2019ll report to Colonel Wilbur as a scout. And will ye see about horses, Ian? I\u2019ll need a spare mount, gun-broke, and so will you.\u201d He dropped a purse on Ian\u2019s chest, smiled, and vanished into the morning mist.</p><p>Ian rolled slowly out of his blanket, stretching. He\u2019d chosen his resting spot well away from the main camp, on a small rise of ground near the river. He didn\u2019t bother wondering how Uncle Jamie had found him, or waste time in marveling at his uncle\u2019s recuperative powers.</p><p>He took his time about his preparations, dressed carefully, and found some food, thinking over the things that must be done. He\u2019d dreamed during the night, and the dream was still on him, though he couldn\u2019t recall the details. He\u2019d been in thick woods, and something was there with him, hiding among the leaves. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was, or even if he\u2019d seen it, but the sense of danger lingered uneasily between his shoulder blades. He\u2019d heard a raven calling in his dream, and that was certainly a warning of some kind\u2014but then the raven had flown past him, and it wasn\u2019t a raven at all but a white bird of some kind. Its wing had touched his cheek in flight, and he could still feel the brush of its feathers.</p><p>White animals were messengers. Both the Mohawk and the Highlanders said so.</p><p>He was an Indian and a Highlander; dreams were not to be dismissed. Sometimes the meaning of a dream floated to the surface of your mind like a drowned leaf rising. He let it go, hoping the dream would return to explain itself, and went about his work, seeing Colonel Wilbur, finding and haggling for two reasonable horses, big enough to bear a large man through battle . . . but the white bird stayed by him all day long, hovering just above his right shoulder, a glimpse now and then in the corner of his eye.</p><p>IN THE LATE afternoon, his business done for the moment, he returned to the main camp and found Rachel standing in line with a number of other women at the well in the yard of the Goose and Grapes, two buckets resting at her feet.</p><p>\u201cI could take those down to the river for ye,\u201d he offered. She was flushed with the heat of the day but looked beautiful, her bare arms brown and the curving muscle of them so neat and delicate that it lifted his heart to look at them.</p> <p>\u201cI thank thee, Ian, but no.\u201d She smiled up at him and reached to tweak one of the two eagle feathers he\u2019d knotted into his hair. \u201cThy auntie says the boats throw their waste into the river, and half the army is pissing in it, as well, and she\u2019s right. I should need to walk a mile upstream to find a clean place from which to draw water. Is thee about thy business, then?\u201d</p><p>She spoke with interest but with no sense of concern or disapproval, and he appreciated that.</p><p>\u201cI willna kill anyone unless I have to, Rachel,\u201d he said softly, and touched her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m signed on as a scout. I shouldna have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut things happen,\u201d she said, and looked away, to keep him seeing the sudden shadow in her eyes. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>With an unexpected spurt of impatience, he wanted to ask her: would she rather he kill or be killed for the sake of his soul\u2019s grace? But he smothered the impulse, and the tinge of anger with it. She loved him, he didn\u2019t doubt that. It was maybe a fair question to put to a Quaker, but not to his betrothed.</p><p>Her eyes were on his face, interested and thoughtful, and he felt a slight flush rise in his cheeks, wondering just how much of his thoughts showed.</p><p>\u201cThy life\u2019s journey lies along its own path, Ian,\u201d she said, \u201cand I cannot share thy journey\u2014but I can walk beside thee. And I will.\u201d</p><p>The woman standing behind them in the line heaved a deep, contented sigh.</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s a very pretty and right thing to say, sweetheart,\u201d she said to Rachel, in approving tones. And, switching her gaze to Ian, looked him skeptically up and down. He was dressed in buckskins, clout, and calico shirt, and, bar the feathers in his hair and the tattoos, didn\u2019t look too outlandish, he thought.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t deserve her,\u201d the woman said, shaking her head doubtfully. \u201cBut try, there\u2019s a good lad.\u201d</p><p>HE CARRIED THE water for Rachel, making their way through the sprawl of the camp toward the place where Denzell had set up his medical practice. The tent was still standing, but Denzell\u2019s wagon with its painted goldfinches on the tailboard was drawn up beside it, Dottie standing in it, and Denzell handing up parcels and boxes to her.</p><p>Rachel stood on tiptoe to kiss his cheek, then vanished into the tent to help with the packing.</p><p>\u201cWilt thee join us later, Ian?\u201d Denny looked up from the pack he was strapping together.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere, a bhr\u00e0thair,\u201d Ian said, smiling. \u201cWhere are ye bound, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Nowhere.\u201d Denny took off his spectacles, polishing them absently on the tail of his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet First Day, but we may well be engaged in battle then; we thought to hold meeting before supper tonight. We would be pleased if thee feels it good to sit with us, but if not . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll come,\u201d Ian said quickly. \u201cTo be sure. Ah . . . where . . . ?\u201d He waved a hand vaguely, indicating the half-ordered chaos of the camp surrounding them. New companies of militia were still coming in from New Jersey and Pennsylvania to join the Continental soldiers, and while officers had been assigned to receive and organize these and help them find campgrounds, they were swiftly overwhelmed. Men were making camp anywhere they could find open ground, and there was great to-ing and fro-ing in search of water and food, arguments and raised voices, and the sound of industrious shoveling and muttered curses nearby indicated the creation of yet another set of sanitary trenches. A constant small procession of persons who couldn\u2019t wait visited a nearby copse in hopes of a private moment. Ian made a mental note to step wary if he walked that way.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna mean to do it here, surely?\u201d People came in and out all day, in need of the doctor\u2019s attention, and wouldn\u2019t be likely to stop, only because meeting was being held.</p><p>\u201cFriend Jamie says he will provide us a refuge,\u201d Denny assured him. \u201cWe\u2019ll go as soon as\u2014who has thee there, Dorothea?\u201d</p><p>Dottie was stowing supplies but had paused to talk with a young girl who had climbed up to kneel on the wagon\u2019s seat and was addressing Dorothea earnestly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a woman in childbed, Denny,\u201d she called. \u201cThree campfires over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgent?\u201d Denny at once began unstrapping the pack he had just done up.</p><p>\u201cThis child says so.\u201d Dottie straightened up and tucked her straggling fair hair back under her cap. \u201cIt\u2019s her mother\u2019s fourth; no trouble with the first three, but given the conditions . . .\u201d She sidled past the baggage to the lowered tailboard, and Ian gave her a hand to hop down.</p><p>\u201cShe really wanted Mrs. Fraser,\u201d Dottie said to Denny, sotto voce. \u201cBut she\u2019ll settle for you.\u201d She dimpled. \u201cIs thee flattered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see my reputation spreads like pomade on a silken pillow,\u201d he replied tranquilly. \u201cAnd thy use of plain speech inflames me. Thee had best come with me. Will thee watch the wagon, Ian?\u201d</p><p>The two of them made off through the maze of wagons, horses, and stray pigs\u2014some enterprising farmer had driven a dozen lean hogs into camp, seeking to sell them to the quartermaster, but the pigs had taken fright at the inadvertent explosion of a musket nearby and run off among the crowd, causing mass confusion. Rollo had run one down and broken its neck; Ian had bled and eviscerated the carcass and\u2014after giving Rollo the heart and lights\u2014stashed it under damp canvas, hidden beneath Denzell\u2019s wagon. Should he meet the distraught swineherd, he\u2019d pay him for the beast, but he wasn\u2019t letting it out of his sight. He stole a quick glance under the skirting board, but the canvas-covered lump was still there.</p><p>Rollo moved a little and made an odd sound, not quite a whine, that shifted Ian\u2019s attention at once to the dog.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, a choin?\u201d he asked. Rollo at once licked his hand and panted in a genial fashion, but Ian slid off the wagon tongue and knelt in the leaves, feeling his way over the big, shaggy body, just in case. Palpating, Auntie Claire called it, a word that always made Ian smile.</p><p>He found a little tenderness where the dog had been shot the autumn before, in the meat of the shoulder just above the foreleg, but that was always there. And a spot on his spine, a few inches forward of the beast\u2019s tail, that made him splay his legs and groan when it was pressed. Maybe Rollo had strained himself taking down the hog.</p><p>\u201cNone sae young as ye used to be, are ye, a choin?\u201d he asked, scratching Rollo\u2019s whitened jaw.</p><p>\u201cNone of us are, a mac mo pheathar,\u201d said his uncle Jamie, coming out of the gloaming and sitting down on the stump Dottie had been using to mount the wagon. He was wearing full uniform and looked hot. Ian passed over his canteen and Jamie took it with a nod of thanks, wiping his sleeve across his face.</p><p>\u201cAye, day after tomorrow,\u201d he said, in answer to Ian\u2019s raised brow. \u201cFirst light, if not before. Wee Gilbert\u2019s got command of a thousand men and permission to go after the rear guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014I mean us\u201d\u2014Ian corrected himself\u2014\u201cwith him?\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded and drank deep. Ian thought he looked a bit tense, but, after all, he was in command of three hundred men\u2014if all of them were going with La Fayette . . .</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re sending me with him in hopes that my ancient wisdom will balance the Seigneur de La Fayette\u2019s youthful enthusiasm,\u201d Jamie said, lowering the canteen with a sigh. \u201cAnd it\u2019s maybe better than staying back wi\u2019 Lee.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cBoiling Water thinks it beneath his dignity to marshal no but a thousand men and declined the command.\u201d</p><p>Ian made a noise indicating amusement at this and faith in his uncle\u2019s sagacity. It might be fun, harrying the British rear. He felt a tingle of anticipation at thought of putting on his war paint.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Denzell gone?\u201d Jamie asked, glancing at the wagon.</p><p>\u201cAttending a childbirth over yon,\u201d Ian said, lifting his chin in the direction Denzell and Dottie had taken. \u201cHe says ye\u2019re hosting a Quaker meeting tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jamie lifted a thick brow glistening with droplets of sweat.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wasna planning to join in, but I said they might use my tent and welcome. Why, are ye going yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought I might,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI was invited, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere ye?\u201d Jamie looked interested. \u201cD\u2019ye think they mean to convert ye?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI dinna think that\u2019s how Quakers work,\u201d Ian said, a little ruefully. \u201cAnd good luck to them if they do. I think the power o\u2019 prayer must have limits.\u201d</p><p>That made his uncle snort with amusement, but Jamie shook his head. \u201cNever think it, laddie,\u201d he advised. \u201cIf wee Rachel sets her mind to it, she\u2019ll have your sword beaten into a plowshare before ye can say Peter Piper picked a peck o\u2019 pickled peppers. Well, twice,\u201d he added. \u201cOr maybe three times.\u201d</p><p>Ian made a dissentient noise through his nose. \u201cAye, and if I were to try bein\u2019 a Friend, who would there be to protect the lot of \u2019em? Rachel and her brother and Dottie, I mean. Ye ken that, don\u2019t ye? That they can only be what they are because you and I are what we are?\u201d</p><p>Jamie leaned back a little, purse-lipped, then gave him the ghost of a wry smile.</p> <p>\u201cI ken that fine. And so does Denzell Hunter; it\u2019s why he\u2019s here, though it\u2019s cost him his home and his meeting. But, mind, they\u2019re worth protecting\u2014beyond you bein\u2019 in love wi\u2019 Rachel, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Ian wasn\u2019t in the mood to discuss philosophy, and he doubted his uncle was, either. The light was in that long hour before darkfall, when the things of the forest pause and draw breath, slowing for the night. It was a good time to hunt, because the trees slowed first, so you saw the animals still moving among them.</p><p>Uncle Jamie kent that. He sat, relaxed, nothing moving save his eyes. Ian saw his gaze flick up and turned his own head to see. Sure enough, a squirrel clung to the trunk of a sycamore, ten feet away. He\u2019d not have seen it, had he not caught the last flick of its tail as it stilled there. He met Jamie\u2019s eyes, and they both smiled and sat silent for a while, listening to the racket of the camp, even this beginning to mute itself.</p><p>Denzell and Dottie hadn\u2019t come back; perhaps the birth was more complicated than Denny had thought. Rachel would be going to Jamie\u2019s tent soon, for the meeting.</p><p>He wondered about that. You needed a meeting, to counsel the two of you, then to approve and witness the marriage. Might Denny have it in his mind to establish a new Friends meeting, within which he could marry Dottie\u2014and Rachel might wed Ian?</p> <p>Jamie sighed and stirred, getting ready to rise.</p><p>\u201cAhh . . . Uncle,\u201d Ian said, in a casual tone that made his uncle instantly focus attention on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d said his uncle warily. \u201cYe havena got your lass wi\u2019 child, have ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not,\u201d Ian said, offended\u2014and wondering vaguely how his uncle had known he was thinking of Rachel. \u201cAnd why would ye think a thing like that, ye evil-minded auld mumper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I ken well enough what \u2018Ahh . . . Uncle\u2019 usually means,\u201d Jamie informed him cynically. \u201cIt means ye\u2019ve got yourself into some confusion involving a lass and want advice. And I canna think what ye could be confused about wi\u2019 regard to wee Rachel. A more straightforward lass I\u2019ve never met\u2014bar your auntie Claire, that is,\u201d he added, with a brief grin.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Ian said, not best pleased by his uncle\u2019s acuity, but obliged to admit the truth of it. \u201cWell, then. It\u2019s only . . .\u201d Despite the completely benign intent\u2014the innocence, even\u2014of the question that had come into his mind, he felt his face go hot.</p> <p>Jamie raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cWell, if ye must know, then\u2014I\u2019ve never lain wi\u2019 a virgin.\u201d Once he\u2019d got it out, he relaxed a little, though his uncle\u2019s brows nearly met his hairline. \u201cAnd, aye, I\u2019m sure Rachel is one,\u201d he added defensively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure, too,\u201d his uncle assured him. \u201cMost men wouldna consider it a problem.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave him a look. \u201cYe ken what I mean. I want her to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVerra commendable. Have ye had complaints from women before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re in a rare mood, Uncle,\u201d Ian said coldly. \u201cYe ken verra well what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye mean if ye\u2019re paying a woman to bed ye, ye\u2019re no likely to hear anything ye dinna like regarding your own performance.\u201d Jamie rocked back a little, eyeing him. \u201cDid ye tell Rachel ye\u2019re in the habit of consorting wi\u2019 whores?\u201d</p><p>Ian felt the blood rush to his ears and was obliged to breathe evenly for a moment before replying.</p> <p>\u201cI told her everything,\u201d he said between clenched teeth. \u201cAnd I wouldna call it a \u2018habit.\u2019\u201d He did know better than to go on with, \u201cIt\u2019s no more than other men do,\u201d because he kent fine what sort of answer he\u2019d get to that.</p><p>Fortunately, Jamie seemed to have reined in his jocularity for the moment and was considering the question.</p><p>\u201cYour Mohawk wife,\u201d he said delicately. \u201cShe, er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ian said. \u201cThe Indians see bedding a bit differently.\u201d And, seizing the opportunity to get a bit of his own back, added, \u201cD\u2019ye not recall the time we went to visit the Snowbird Cherokee and Bird sent a couple of maidens to warm your bed?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave him an old-fashioned sort of look that made him laugh.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Ian,\u201d he said, after a pause, \u201cwould ye be having this conversation with your da?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d Jamie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWell, see . . .\u201d Ian had answered by reflex and found himself fumbling for an explanation. \u201cIt\u2014I mean . . . it\u2019s no that I wouldna talk to Da about things, but if he\u2019d told me anything about . . . it would ha\u2019 been to do with him and Mam, wouldn\u2019t it? And I couldna . . . well, I couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d</p><p>Ian narrowed his eyes at his uncle.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re no going to try and tell me that my mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s my sister, aye? No, I wouldna tell ye anything like that. I see your point. I\u2019m only thinkin\u2019 . . .\u201d He trailed off and Ian gave him a pointed look. The light was fading, but there was still plenty. Jamie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAye, well. It\u2019s only\u2014your auntie Claire was widowed when I wed her, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was me that was virgin on our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Ian hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d moved, but Rollo jerked his head up and looked at him, startled. Ian cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cOh. Aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said his uncle, wry as a lemon. \u201cAnd I was given any amount of advice beforehand, too, by my uncle Dougal and his men.\u201d</p><p>Dougal MacKenzie had died before Ian was born, but he\u2019d heard a good bit about the man, one way and another. His mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cWould ye care to pass on any of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d Jamie stood up and brushed bits of bark from the tails of his coat. \u201cI think ye already ken ye should be gentle about it, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019d thought of that,\u201d Ian assured him. \u201cNothing else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well.\u201d Jamie stood still, considering. \u201cThe only useful thing was what my wife told me on the night. \u2018Go slowly and pay attention.\u2019 I think ye canna go far wrong wi\u2019 that.\u201d He settled his coat on his shoulders. \u201cOidhche mhath, Ian. I\u2019ll see ye at first light\u2014if not somewhat before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOidhche mhath, Uncle Jamie.\u201d</p><p>As Jamie reached the edge of the clearing, Ian called after him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie!\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned to look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was she gentle with ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d Jamie said, and grinned broadly.</p><p>CASTRAMETATION</p><p>THE SUN WAS LOW in the sky by the time William reached Clinton\u2019s camp, and lower still before he\u2019d turned Goth over to Sutherland\u2019s grooms. Zeb was nowhere in sight. Perhaps he was with Colenso.</p><p>He delivered his cartouche of dispatches to Captain von Munchausen, saw the company clerk, and found the tent he shared with two other young captains, both of the 27th Foot. Randolph Merbling was sitting outside, reading by the last of the sun, but there was no sign of Thomas Evans\u2014nor of Colenso Baragwanath. Nor of Zebedee Jeffers. Nor of William\u2019s baggage.</p><p>He breathed for a moment, then shook himself like a dog shedding water. He was so tired of being angry that he just couldn\u2019t be arsed anymore. He shrugged, borrowed a towel from Merbling, washed his face, and went to find a bite to eat.</p><p>He\u2019d made up his mind not to think about anything whatever until he\u2019d had some food and largely succeeded, letting roast chicken, bread, cheese, and beer fill at least some of his empty spaces. As he finished, though, a sudden sharp image punctured his pleasant digestive reverie. A flushed, pretty face, with wary eyes the exact color of the cider he was drinking.</p><p>Jane. Bloody hell! What with one thing and another, he\u2019d quite forgotten the whore and her sister. He\u2019d told them to meet him at the surgeon\u2019s tent at sundown. . . . Well, the sun wasn\u2019t down yet. He was on his feet and on his way, but then had a second thought and, going back to the cook, wangled a couple of loaves and some cheese, just in case.</p><p>Castrametation was the science of laying out a proper military camp. Drainage, sanitary trenches, where to put the powder depot to avoid flooding if it rained . . . He\u2019d had a brief course in it once. He\u2019d likely never need to do it himself, but it did help in locating things, if you knew where they were supposed to be. And when in camp, the hospital was meant to be on the opposite side from command headquarters, close to water but on a height, if one was available.</p><p>One was, and he found the large green-canvas tent without difficulty. Could have found it with his eyes closed. Surgeons carried the smell of their work around with them, and the whiff of dried blood and the uneasy tang of sickness and recent death were perceptible at a hundred yards. It was worse\u2014much worse\u2014after a battle, but there was always illness and accident, and the stink lingered even on peaceful days, aggravated now by the muggy heat that lay like a wet blanket over the camp.</p><p>There were men, and not a few women, clustered round the tent, waiting for attention. He gave them a quick glance, but didn\u2019t see Jane. His heart had sped up a little at thought of seeing her, and he felt unaccountably disappointed. No reason why, he told himself. She and her sister would be nothing but trouble to him. They must have grown tired waiting, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very late, my lord,\u201d said an accusatory voice at his elbow, and he whirled round to see her looking down her nose at him\u2014as well as someone who was shorter than he could do, which wasn\u2019t very well. He found himself smiling down at her, absurdly.</p><p>\u201cI said sundown,\u201d he replied mildly, nodding toward the west, where a thin slice of brilliance still glowed through the trees. \u201cNot down yet, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun takes a bloody long time to go down out here.\u201d She switched her disapproval to the orb in question. \u201cIt\u2019s much faster in the city.\u201d</p><p>Before he could argue with this ridiculous assertion, she\u2019d glanced back at him, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing your gorget?\u201d she demanded, hands on her hips. \u201cI went to a deal of trouble to get it back for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exceedingly grateful to you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, striving for gravity. \u201cI thought it might provoke inquiries, though, should I turn up suddenly in the midst of camp wearing it, and I thought you and your sister might just possibly wish to avoid . . . tedious explanations?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed, but not without amusement.</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful. Not quite so thoughtful of your servants, though, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d She linked her arm with his and towed him off toward the wood before he could protest. She led him to a small lean-to shelter in the undergrowth, which seemed to have been constructed of an unstuffed army bed sack and two petticoats. Bending down at her invitation, he discovered her sister, Fanny, within, sitting next to a bed sack that had been stuffed with fresh grass, upon which crouched both Colenso and Zeb, both looking bewildered. On sight of him, they crouched further.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing here?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd where is my dunnage, Zeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack there, sir,\u201d Zeb quavered, jerking a thumb toward the growth behind the lean-to. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find your tent and I didn\u2019t want to leave it, see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I told you\u2014and what about you, Baragwanath? Are you still ill?\u201d William demanded, kneeling down suddenly and thrusting his head into the shelter. Colenso looked bad, pale as a cup of soured milk, and plainly in pain, curled up into himself.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . \u2019tisn\u2019t nothin\u2019, sir,\u201d he said, swallowing heavily. \u201cJust must have . . . ate . . . something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the surgeon?\u201d</p><p>Colenso turned his face into the bed sack, shoulders hunched. Zeb was edging away, apparently thinking of making a run for it.</p><p>William grabbed him by the arm; the little groom yelped and he let go. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you not have that arm seen to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the surgeons,\u201d Jane said sharply.</p><p>William drew himself up to his full height and glared down at her.</p><p>\u201cOh? Who told them they should be afraid of the surgeons? And how do they come to be in your care, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed tight together, and she glanced involuntarily into the shelter. Fanny was looking out at them, doe eyes huge in the fading light. She swallowed and put a protective hand on Colenso\u2019s shoulder. Jane sighed deeply and took William\u2019s arm again.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She led him away a short distance, still within sight of the little shelter but out of earshot.</p><p>\u201cFanny and I were waiting for you when those boys came along together. The bigger one\u2014what did you say his name is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColenso Baragwanath. He\u2019s Cornish,\u201d William added shortly, seeing a look of amusement flit across her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally. I hope it isn\u2019t catching. Well, he was so ill he couldn\u2019t stand, and sank down on the ground near us, making the most horrid noises. The little one\u2014yes, I know he\u2019s Zebedee, thank you\u2014was beside himself, half-weeping with confusion. My sister is a most tenderhearted creature,\u201d she said, rather apologetically. \u201cShe went to help, and I followed.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe got Colenso into the wood far enough to get his britches down in time, and I gave him a little water.\u201d She touched a small wooden canteen that hung from her shoulder, and he wondered briefly where she\u2019d got it. She hadn\u2019t had it when he\u2019d met the girls by the creek yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI am much obliged to you, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said formally. \u201cNow\u2014why is it, exactly, that you did not then take the boys in to see the surgeons?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, her composure showed signs of cracking. She turned a little away from him, and he noticed the last rays of the sun polishing the smooth crown of her head with a faint, familiar gleam of chestnut. The sight of it brought back memory of his first meeting with her with the force of a thunderclap\u2014and, with it, the memory of his mingled shame and arousal. Especially the latter.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer me,\u201d he said, more roughly than he\u2019d intended, and she turned on him, eyes narrowed at his tone.</p><p>\u201cThere was a finger lying on the ground by the surgeon\u2019s tent,\u201d she snapped. \u201cIt frightened my sister, and the boys took fright from her.\u201d</p><p>William rubbed a knuckle down the bridge of his nose, eyeing her.</p><p>\u201cA finger.\u201d He had himself seen piles of amputated limbs outside the surgeons\u2019 tents at Saratoga, and aside from a quick prayer of gratitude that none of the disconnected arms and legs was his, had experienced no particular qualms. \u201cWhose was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? I was too much occupied in keeping your orderly from shitting himself to ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh. Yes. Thank you,\u201d he said, rather formally. He glanced toward the shelter again and was surprised to see that Fanny had come out and was hovering a little way from her sister, a wary look on her lovely face. Did he look threatening? he wondered. Just in case, he relaxed his posture a bit and smiled at Fanny. She didn\u2019t change expression, but continued to stare at him suspiciously.</p><p>He cleared his throat and took the sack off his shoulder, holding it out to Jane. \u201cI thought you might have missed your supper. Have the boys\u2014well, Zeb, at least\u2014eaten anything?\u201d</p><p>Jane nodded and took the bag with a celerity suggesting that it had been some time since the girls had had a meal. \u201cHe ate with the other grooms, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ll take him in to have his arm seen to and perhaps get a dose for Colenso, while you and your sister refresh yourselves. Then, madam, we can discuss your own situation.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been intensely aware of her physical presence for some moments, but when he said that, she turned the full effect of her eyes on him\u2014cider, he thought vaguely, or sherry wine?\u2014and seemed somehow to flow, shifting in some indefinable way. He hadn\u2019t seen her move, but suddenly she was standing near enough to touch, and he smelled the odor of her hair and imagined he felt the warmth of her skin through her clothes. She took his hand briefly, and her thumb moved across the palm, slowly. The palm tingled and the hairs on his arm rippled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can come to a reasonable accommodation, my lord,\u201d she said, very grave, and let him go.</p> <p>He dragged Zeb into the surgeon\u2019s tent like a recalcitrant colt and stood by, only half-attending, as a young Scottish surgeon with freckles swabbed the boy\u2019s wound clean of dirt. Arabella\u2013Jane didn\u2019t smell of the whorish scent she\u2019d worn at the brothel, but, by Christ, she smelled good.</p><p>\u201cWe should cauterize the wound, sir,\u201d the young doctor\u2019s voice was saying. \u201cIt will stop an abscess forming, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Zeb jerked away from the doctor and made a dash for the door, knocking into people and sending one woman flying with a shriek. Jolted out of his random thoughts, William made a reflexive dive and knocked the boy flat.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Zeb,\u201d he said, hauling Zeb to his feet and propelling him firmly back to Dr. MacFreckles. \u201cIt won\u2019t be that bad. Just a moment or two, and then it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>Zeb appearing patently unconvinced by this, William deposited him firmly on a stool and pulled up his own right cuff.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, displaying the long, comet-shaped scar on his forearm. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you get an abscess.\u201d</p><p>Both Zeb and the doctor peered at the scar, impressed. It had been a splinter wound, he told them, caused by a lightning-struck tree.</p><p>\u201cWandered round the Great Dismal Swamp for three days in a fever,\u201d he said. \u201cSome . . . Indians found me and got me to a doctor. I nearly died, and\u201d\u2014he lowered his brows and gave Zeb a piercing look\u2014\u201cthe doctor was just about to cut off my arm, when the abscess burst and he cauterized it. You might not be so lucky, hey?\u201d</p> <p>Zeb still looked unhappy, but reluctantly agreed. William gripped him by the shoulders and said encouraging things while the iron was heating, but his own heart was beating as fast as it might have had he been awaiting cautery himself.</p><p>Indians. One, in particular. He\u2019d thought he\u2019d exhausted his anger, but there it bloody was again, bursting into bright fresh flame like an ember smashed open with a poker.</p><p>Bloody f**king Ian Murray. Fucking Scot and sometime Mohawk. His bloody f**king cousin, which made it all that much worse.</p><p>And then there was Rachel. . . . Murray had taken him to Dr. Hunter and Rachel. He drew a deep, ragged breath, remembering her worn indigo gown, hanging on its peg in the Hunters\u2019 house. Grabbing a handful of the cloth and pressing it to his face, breathing in her scent as though starved of air.</p><p>That was where Murray had met Rachel himself. And now she was betrothed to that\u2014</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Zeb writhed, and William realized belatedly that he was digging his fingers into the boy\u2019s shoulder, just like\u2014he let go as though Zeb were a hot potato, feeling the memory of James Fraser\u2019s iron grip on his arm and the agonizing pain that had numbed him from shoulder to fingertip.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, voice shaking a little with the effort to hide his fury. \u201cSorry, Zeb.\u201d The surgeon was ready with the glowing iron; William took Zeb\u2019s arm, as gently as he could, and held it still while the thing was done. Rachel had held his own.</p><p>He\u2019d been right; it was quick. The surgeon pressed the hot iron to the wound and counted five, slowly, then took it away. Zeb went stiff as a tent pole and sucked in enough breath to supply three people, but didn\u2019t scream.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d the doctor said, taking the iron away and smiling at Zeb. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll put a bit of sweet oil on and bandage it. Ye did well, laddie.\u201d</p><p>Zeb\u2019s eyes were watering, but he wasn\u2019t crying. He sniffed deeply and wiped the back of his hand across his face, looking up at William.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Zeb,\u201d William said, squeezing his shoulder gently, and Zeb managed a tiny smile in return.</p><p>By the time they\u2019d returned to the girls and Colenso, William had managed to tamp down the rage\u2014again. Was he never going to be able to get rid of it? Not \u2019til you make up your mind what to do about things, he thought grimly. But there wasn\u2019t anything that could be done right now, so he squashed all the sparks in his head firmly into one dense red ball and rolled it to the back of his mind.</p><p>\u201cHere, let Fanny do it. He trusts her.\u201d Jane took the vial containing the dose Dr. MacFreckles had made up for Colenso and gave it to her sister. Fanny promptly sat down beside Colenso, who was pretending as hard as he could to be asleep, and began stroking his head, murmuring something to him.</p><p>William nodded and, gesturing to Jane to accompany him, withdrew far enough to be out of earshot. Rather to his surprise, part of his brain had apparently been analyzing the problem and coming to conclusions while the rest was occupied, for he had a rough plan.</p><p>\u201cWhat I suggest is this,\u201d he said, without preamble. \u201cI will make provision for you and your sister to receive regular army rations, as camp followers, and to travel under my protection. Once in New York, I will give you five pounds, and you\u2019re on your own. In return . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite smile, but a dimple showed in one cheek.</p><p>\u201cIn return,\u201d he repeated more firmly, \u201cyou will mind my orderly and my groom, tend their ills, and make sure they\u2019re reasonably cared for. You will also be my laundress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour laundress?!\u201d The dimple had disappeared abruptly, replaced by an expression of sheer astonishment.</p><p>\u201cLaundress,\u201d he repeated doggedly. He knew what she\u2019d been expecting him to propose and was rather surprised himself that he hadn\u2019t, but there it was. He couldn\u2019t, not with his thoughts of Rachel and of Anne Endicott so fresh in his mind. Not with the deep, smothered rage fueled by the thought that he deserved no woman but a whore.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to do laundry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d he asked, as patiently as he could. \u201cYou wash my clothes. Don\u2019t put starch in my drawers. That\u2019s about it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014but\u2014\u201d She looked aghast. \u201cOne needs a . . . a kettle! A fork, a paddle, something to stir with . . . Soap! I haven\u2019t any soap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That hadn\u2019t occurred to him. \u201cWell . . .\u201d He dug in his pocket, found it empty, and tried the other, which held a guinea, tuppence, and a florin. He handed her the guinea. \u201cBuy what you need, then.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the golden coin in her palm, her face utterly blank. She opened her mouth, then closed it again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked impatiently. She didn\u2019t answer, but a soft voice behind him did.</p><p>\u201cThe duffent know how.\u201d</p><p>He whirled to find Fanny looking up at him from under her cap, her delicate cheeks flushed red by the sunset.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Fanny\u2019s soft mouth pressed tight and her cheeks grew redder, but she repeated it, dogged. \u201cThe . . . duffent . . . know how.\u201d</p><p>Jane reached Fanny in two steps, putting an arm around her sister\u2019s shoulders and glaring at William.</p><p>\u201cMy sister\u2019s tongue-tied,\u201d she said, daring him to say anything. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s afraid of the surgeons. She thinks they will amputate her tongue if they find out.\u201d</p><p>He drew a deep, slow breath.</p><p>\u201cI see. And what she said to me . . . \u2018She doesn\u2019t know how\u2019? She means you, I collect? What is it, pray, that you don\u2019t know how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuddy,\u201d whispered Fanny, now staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cMud\u2014money?\u201d He stared at Jane. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had any money!\u201d she snapped, and threw the guinea on the ground at his feet. \u201cI know the names of the coins, but I don\u2019t know what you can buy with them, except\u2014except\u2014what you can buy in a brothel! My cunt is worth six shillings, all right? My mouth is three. And my arse is a pound. But if someone gave me three shillings, I wouldn\u2019t know if I could buy a loaf of bread or a horse with them! I\u2019ve never bought anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you mean\u2014\u201d He was so flabbergasted, he couldn\u2019t string words into a sentence. \u201cBut you have wages. You said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a brothel whore since I was ten years old!\u201d Her fists clenched, knuckles sharp under the skin. \u201cI never see my wages! Mrs. Abbott spends them\u2014she says\u2014for my\u2014our\u2014food and clothes. I\u2019ve never had a penny to my name, let alone spent one. And now you hand me . . . that\u201d\u2014she stamped her foot on the guinea, driving it into the ground\u2014\u201cand tell me to buy a kettle?!? Where? How? From whom?!\u201d</p><p>Her voice shook and her face was a deal redder than the setting sun could make it. She was furious, but also very near to tears. He wanted to take her in his arms and soothe her, but thought that might be a good way to lose a finger.</p><p>\u201cHow old is Fanny?\u201d he asked instead. She jerked her head up, panting.</p><p>\u201cFanny?\u201d she said blankly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m e-lev-en,\u201d Fanny\u2019s voice said behind him. \u201cYou weve her awone!\u201d</p><p>He turned to see the girl glaring up at him, a stick clutched in her hand. He might have laughed, if not for the expression on her face\u2014and if not for what he\u2019d just realized. He took a step back, so as to see both girls at once, and like magnet and iron, they came together and clung, both staring distrustfully at him.</p><p>\u201cHow much is her maidenhead worth?\u201d he asked Jane baldly, with a nod at Fanny.</p><p>\u201cTen pounth,\u201d Fanny answered automatically, just as Jane shouted, \u201cShe\u2019s not for sale! To you or any other bugger!\u201d She pressed Fanny fiercely closer, daring him to make a move toward the girl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cI don\u2019t fornicate with children, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>Jane\u2019s hard expression didn\u2019t alter, and she didn\u2019t loosen her grip on her sister.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo verify my suppositions regarding your presence here.\u201d</p><p>Jane snorted. \u201cThose being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you ran away. Presumably because your sister has now reached an age where . . . ?\u201d He raised an eyebrow, nodding at Fanny. Jane\u2019s lips compressed, but she gave him a tiny, grudging nod.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Harkness?\u201d he asked. It was a shot in the dark, but well aimed. Harkness hadn\u2019t been pleased at being deprived of his prey and, unable to come at William, might well have decided to take his revenge elsewhere.</p><p>The light bathed everything in tones of gold and lavender, but he could see Jane\u2019s face go pale, nonetheless, and felt a tightening in his loins. If he found Harkness . . . He resolved to go looking tomorrow. The man might be in Philadelphia, as she\u2019d said\u2014but he might not. It would be a welcome focus for his rage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, then,\u201d he said, as matter-of-factly as he could. He stooped and pried the guinea out of the soft earth, realizing as he did so that he\u2019d been a fool to offer it to her. Not because of what she\u2019d told him but because someone like her\u2014or Colenso\u2014would never have such a sum. They\u2019d be suspected of stealing it and very likely would be relieved of it by the first person to see it.</p><p>\u201cJust look after the boys, will you?\u201d he said to Jane. \u201cAnd the both of you keep clear of the soldiers until I can find you simple clothes. Dressed like that\u201d\u2014he gestured at their dust-smudged, sweat-stained finery\u2014\u201cyou\u2019ll be taken for whores, and soldiers don\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a whore,\u201d Jane said, in a strange, dry voice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and felt his own voice as oddly separate from himself but very firm. \u201cYou\u2019re not. You travel under my protection. I\u2019m not a pimp\u2014so you\u2019re not a whore. Not until we reach New York.\u201d</p> <p>A DISCOVERY IN THE RANKS</p><p>THE 16TH PENNSYLVANIA militia company, Captain the Reverend Peleg Woodsworth in command, marched into camp in good order, having paused just outside to tidy themselves, clean their weapons, and wash their faces. Lord John knew no one would take notice but approved of the preparations on grounds of good military discipline, as he explained to Germain.</p><p>\u201cSlovenly troops make bad fighters,\u201d he said, critically examining a large rent in the sleeve of his filthy black coat. \u201cAnd soldiers must be in the habit of obeying orders, no matter what those orders are.\u201d</p><p>Germain nodded. \u201cAye, that\u2019s what my mam says. Doesn\u2019t matter whether ye see the point or not, ye do as ye\u2019re told, or else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother would make an admirable sergeant,\u201d Grey assured his orderly. He\u2019d encountered Marsali Fraser once or twice, at her printshop. \u201cSplendid grasp of the essence of command. Speaking of \u2018or else,\u2019 though\u2014what, exactly, do you expect to happen when you go home?\u201d</p> <p>It was evident that Germain hadn\u2019t given much thought to the prospect, but after a moment he uncreased his brow.</p><p>\u201cLikely it\u2019ll depend how long I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said, with a shrug. \u201cIf I went back tomorrow, I\u2019d get my ears blistered and my arse, too. But I think if I was to be gone longer than a week, she\u2019d be pleased I wasna deid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Have you heard the story of the Prodigal Son, by chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, me lo\u2014er . . . Bert.\u201d Germain coughed. \u201cHow does it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d he began automatically, but then stopped dead, feeling as though a stake had been driven through his chest. The company had already begun to fray and straggle; the few men behind him merely skirted him and went past. Germain twisted round to see what he was looking at.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that man who pretends to be a Frenchman. My father doesn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p> <p>Grey stared at the gentleman in the suit of very fashionable blue and gray-striped silk, who was likewise staring at Grey, mouth slightly open, ignoring the small knot of Continental officers accompanying him.</p><p>\u201cI know a lot of Frenchmen,\u201d Grey said, recovering his breath. \u201cBut you\u2019re right; that\u2019s not one of them.\u201d He turned his back on the man, mind awhirl, and gripped Germain by the arm.</p><p>\u201cYour grandfather has to be in this moil somewhere,\u201d he said, forcing resolution into his voice. \u201cDo you see the building over there, with the flag?\u201d He nodded at the limp banner, on the far side of the sprawling camp, but clearly visible. \u201cGo there. That will be the commander in chief\u2019s headquarters. Tell one of the officers who you\u2019re looking for; they\u2019ll find him for you among the militia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they won\u2019t have to,\u201d Germain assured him. \u201cGrand-p\u00e8re will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith General Washington,\u201d Germain said, with the exaggerated patience of those forced to consort with dunces. \u201cHe\u2019s a general, too; did ye not know that?\u201d Before Grey could respond to this piece of flabbergasting intelligence, Germain had scampered away in the direction of the distant banner.</p><p>Grey risked a glance over his shoulder, but Perseverance Wainwright had disappeared, as had the Continental officers, leaving only a couple of lieutenants in conversation.</p><p>He thought several blasphemous things in a row, alternating between Jamie Fraser and Percy Wainwright as the recipients of assorted violent assaults of a personal nature. What the f**king hell was either of them doing here? His fingers twitched, wanting to strangle someone, but he fought back this useless impulse in favor of deciding what the devil to do now.</p> <p>He began to walk hastily, with no clear notion where he was going. Percy had seen him, he knew that much. Jamie hadn\u2019t, but might at any moment. A general? What the\u2014no time to worry about that just now. What might either one of them do about it?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Percy\u2014ex-lover, ex-brother, French spy, and all-around shit\u2014since their last conversation in Philadelphia, some months before. When Percy had first reappeared in Grey\u2019s life, it had been with a last attempt at seduction\u2014political rather than physical, though Grey had an idea that he wouldn\u2019t have balked at the physical, either. . . . It was an offer for the British government: the return to France of the valuable Northwest Territory, in return for the promise of Percy\u2019s \u201cinterests\u201d to keep the French government from making an alliance with the American colonies.</p><p>He had\u2014as a matter of duty\u2014conveyed the offer discreetly to Lord North and then expunged it\u2014and Percy\u2014from his mind. He had no idea what, if anything, the First Minister had made of it.</p><p>Too late now in any case, he thought. France had signed a treaty with the rebellious colonies in April. It remained to be seen, though, whether that treaty would result in anything tangible in the way of support. The French were notoriously unreliable.</p><p>So now what? His instinct toward self-preservation urged him to fade quietly through the camp and disappear as quickly as possible. Germain wouldn\u2019t tell Jamie he was here; they\u2019d agreed that much in advance. Two considerations held him back, though: first, the minor matter that he didn\u2019t yet know where the British army was or how far away. And second . . . a sense of curiosity about Percy that he himself recognized as dangerously reckless.</p><p>He\u2019d kept moving, since to stand still was to be knocked over and trampled, and now found himself walking beside the Reverend Woodsworth. The tall minister\u2019s face was suffused with an excitement that kept breaking through the man\u2019s normal mien of calm dignity, and Grey couldn\u2019t help smiling at it.</p><p>\u201cGod has brought us safe thus far, Bert,\u201d Woodsworth said, looking about him with shining eyes. \u201cAnd He will grant us victory, I know it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Grey groped for some reply, and finding\u2014to his surprise\u2014that he was incapable of agreeing with this statement, settled for, \u201cI suppose we cannot presume to divine the Almighty\u2019s intent, but I do trust He will preserve us, in His mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well said, Bert, very well said.\u201d And Woodsworth clapped him resoundingly on the back.</p><p>QUAKERS AND QUARTERMASTERS</p><p>JAMIE FOUND NATHANAEL Greene in his tent and still in shirtsleeves, the remains of breakfast on a table before him, frowning at a letter in his hand. He put this down at once upon seeing Jamie and rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cCome in, sir, do! Have you et anything yet today? I\u2019ve a spare egg going to waste.\u201d He smiled, but briefly; whatever had troubled him about the letter still lurked in the creases of his brow. Jamie glanced at it from the corner of his eye; from the blots and ragged edge, it looked a piece of domestic correspondence, rather than an official note.</p><p>\u201cI have, I thank ye, sir,\u201d Jamie said, with a slight bow of acknowledgment toward the egg, which sat neglected in a little wooden cup with a flowered heart painted on it. \u201cI only wondered, if ye meant to ride out today, might I come with ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Greene looked surprised but pleased. \u201cI should welcome your advice, General.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we might trade wisdom, then,\u201d Jamie suggested. \u201cFor I should value your own advice, though perhaps on a different matter.\u201d</p><p>Greene paused, coat half-pulled on.</p><p>\u201cReally? Advice on what sort of matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage.\u201d</p><p>Greene\u2019s face struggled between astonishment, a courteous attempt to suppress the astonishment, and something else. He glanced behind him at the letter lying on the table and settled his coat on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI could use sound advice on that matter myself, General Fraser,\u201d he said, with a wry twist of the lips. \u201cLet\u2019s be off, then.\u201d</p><p>They rode out of camp north by northwest\u2014Greene was equipped with a battered compass, and Jamie wished for a moment that he still possessed the gold-plated astrolabe that William had sent from London at the behest of Lord John. That had perished when the Big House burned, though the spurt of dark feeling that went through him now had more to do with the thought of John Grey than with the fire and its aftermath.</p><p>Conversation at first dealt only with the business at hand: the location of supply dumps along the probable line of march\u2014and, if necessary, retreat, though no one spoke of that possibility. There was no particular doubt as to where the British army was headed; a body that large, with an enormous baggage train and outlying flocks of camp followers, was limited in its choice of roads.</p><p>\u201cAye, that would do,\u201d Jamie said, nodding in agreement at Greene\u2019s suggestion of an abandoned farmstead. \u201cD\u2019ye think the well\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m minded to find out,\u201d Greene said, turning his horse\u2019s head toward the farm. \u201cIt\u2019s hot as Hades already. Scorch our ears off by noon, I reckon.\u201d</p><p>It was hot; they\u2019d left off their stocks and waistcoats and were riding in shirtsleeves, coats across their saddlebows, but Jamie felt the linen of his shirt sticking to his back and sweat trickling over his ribs and down his face. Fortunately, the well was still good; water glimmered visibly below, and a stone dropped in gave back a satisfactory plunk!</p><p>\u201cI confess I\u2019m surprised to find you in want of advice regarding marriage, General,\u201d Greene said, having first drunk his fill and then upended a bucketful of water luxuriously over his head. He blinked water off his lashes, shook himself like a dog, and handed the bucket to Jamie, who nodded thanks. \u201cI should have thought your own union most harmonious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well, it\u2019s not my own marriage I\u2019m worrit for,\u201d Jamie said, grunting a little as he pulled up a fresh full bucket\u2014hand over hand, for the windlass had rotted away and he\u2019d been obliged to fetch a rope from his saddlebag. \u201cWill ye ken a young scout named Ian Murray? He\u2019s my nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurray. Murray . . .\u201d Greene looked blank for a moment, but then comprehension dawned. \u201cOh, him! Yes, drat him. Your nephew, you say? Thought he was an Indian. Cost me a guinea on that race. My wife won\u2019t be happy about that at all. Not that she\u2019s happy at the moment, regardless,\u201d he added with a sigh. Evidently the letter had been domestic.</p><p>\u201cWell, I might persuade him to give it ye back,\u201d Jamie said, suppressing a smile, \u201cif ye might be able to help him to wed.\u201d</p><p>He raised the bucket overhead and gave himself over to a moment of joy as the drench of water quenched the heat. He drew one deep, grateful breath of coolness, tasting of the dank stones at the bottom of the well, and likewise shook himself.</p><p>\u201cHe means to marry a Quaker lass,\u201d he said, opening his eyes. \u201cI kent that ye were a Friend yourself, havin\u2019 heard ye speak to Mrs. Hardman when we met. So I wondered, maybe, if ye could tell me just what\u2019s needed in the way of requirement for such a marriage?\u201d</p><p>If Greene had been surprised to find that Ian was Jamie\u2019s nephew, this news seemed to knock him speechless. He stood for a moment, pushing his lips in and out, as though they might suck up a word he could spit back out, and at last found one.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said. He paused for a bit, considering, and Jamie waited patiently. Greene was a man of fairly strong opinions, but he didn\u2019t give them hastily. Jamie did wonder what there was to consider in his question, though\u2014were Quakers even stranger in their customs than he thought?</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Greene said again, and exhaled, settling his shoulders. \u201cI must tell you, General, that I no longer consider myself a Friend, though I was indeed raised in that sect.\u201d He shot Jamie a sharp look. \u201cAnd I must also tell you that the cause of my departure was a mislike of their narrow-minded, superstitious ways. If your nephew means to turn Quaker, sir, I\u2019d recommend you do your best to dissuade him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch. Well, that\u2019s part of the difficulty, I gather,\u201d Jamie replied equably. \u201cHe doesna mean to turn Quaker himself. And I think that a wise decision; he isna suited for it at all.\u201d</p><p>Greene relaxed a little at that and went so far as to smile, if wryly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. But he has no objection to his wife remaining a Friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s better sense than to suggest otherwise.\u201d</p><p>That made Greene laugh. \u201cPerhaps he\u2019ll manage marriage well enough, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll make a bonny husband for the lass, I\u2019ve nay doubt. It\u2019s the getting them wed that seems a difficulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes.\u201d Greene glanced round the homestead, wiping his wet face with a wadded handkerchief. \u201cThat might in fact be very difficult, if the young woman . . . well. Let me think for a moment. In the meantime . . . the well\u2019s good, but we can\u2019t store powder here; there\u2019s not much roof left, and I\u2019m told this weather often presages thunderstorms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s likely a root cellar at the back,\u201d Jamie suggested. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was. The door had gone and a tangle of spindly, pallid vines had sprouted from a rotted sack of potatoes abandoned in the corner, tendrils crawling in slow desperation toward the light.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll do,\u201d Greene decided, and made a penciled note in the small book he carried everywhere. \u201cLet\u2019s move on, then.\u201d</p><p>They let the horses drink, poured more water over themselves, and rode on, gently steaming. Greene was not a chatterer, and there had been no conversation for a mile or two, when he finally reached a conclusion of his mental processes.</p><p>\u201cThe principal thing to bear in mind regarding Friends,\u201d he said, without preliminary, \u201cis that they depend very much upon one another\u2019s company and opinion\u2014often to the exclusion of the world outside their meetings.\u201d He shot Jamie a glance. \u201cThe young woman\u2014is your nephew known to her meeting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAs I understand from her brother, they were both put out of their meeting\u2014in a small place in Virginia when he decided to become a surgeon in the Continental army. Or perhaps he was put out, and she merely went with him; I dinna ken whether it makes a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d Greene plucked the wet shirt away from his body in hopes of admitting a little air to his skin, but it was a vain hope. The air lay thick as a woolen blanket on the simmering countryside. \u201cA \u2018fighting Quaker,\u2019 as they call it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he willna take up arms,\u201d Jamie assured Greene, \u201cbut apparently his merely being connected with the army offended his meeting.\u201d Greene snorted in what appeared to be a personal way, and Jamie cleared his throat. \u201cIn fact, Denzell Hunter\u2014Dr. Hunter\u2014also is engaged to be married. Though his path may be somewhat smoother, in that his bride has become a Friend herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she a home meeting?\u201d Greene asked sharply. Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, it appeared to be a . . . private event. The conversion, I mean. I am told that Quakers dinna have either clergy or ritual . . . ?\u201d He left that hanging delicately, and Greene snorted again.</p> <p>\u201cNor do they. But I assure you, General, there is nothing truly private in a Friend\u2019s life\u2014certainly no spiritual matter. My own father opposed reading, as being a practice likely to separate one from God, and when as a young man I not only read but began to collect works on military strategy, in which I had an interest, I was brought before an examination committee from our meeting and subjected to such questions as to\u2014well, as I say, I am no longer a member of that sect.\u201d</p><p>He blew out his lips and made small rumbling noises for a bit, frowning at the road ahead\u2014though Jamie saw that, even in his preoccupation, Greene was taking note of their surroundings, with an eye to logistics.</p><p>He himself had become aware of a certain vibration in the air and wondered if Greene sensed it. Not quite noise, it was a disturbance that he knew well: a large body of men and horses, too far away to see their dust\u2014but there. They\u2019d found the British army. He slowed a little, looking carefully at the trees ahead in case of British scouts\u2014for the British must surely know by now that they were pursued.</p><p>Greene\u2019s hearing was less acute, though, or perhaps he was only preoccupied, for he glanced at Jamie in surprise, though he slowed, as well. Jamie raised a hand to stop him speaking and lifted his chin\u2014there was a rider coming toward them, following the road. The sound of hooves was audible, and Jamie\u2019s own mount flung up his head and whickered with interest, nostrils flaring.</p><p>Both men had come armed; Greene set a hand on the musket balanced across his saddle. Jamie left his rifle in its sling but checked the priming of the pistols in his saddle holsters. Awkward to fire a long gun from horseback.</p><p>The rider was coming slowly, though; Jamie\u2019s hand on the pistol\u2019s grip relaxed, and he shook his head at Greene. They reined up, waiting, and a moment later the rider came in view.</p> <p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie!\u201d Ian\u2019s face blossomed with relief at sight of him, and no wonder. He was dressed like a Mohawk, in buckskin leggings and calico shirt, with feathers in his hair, and a long, hairy gray carcass lay across his saddlebow, blood dripping slowly from it down the horse\u2019s leg.</p><p>The beast wasn\u2019t dead, though; Rollo twitched and raised his head, giving the newcomers a yellow wolf glare, but recognized Jamie\u2019s scent and barked once, then let his tongue loll out, panting.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the hound, then?\u201d Jamie rode up alongside and leaned forward to look.</p><p>\u201cThe numpty fell into a deadfall trap,\u201d Ian said, frowning rebuke at the dog. Then he gently scratched the big dog\u2019s ruff. \u201cMind, I\u2019d ha\u2019 fallen in it myself, if he hadna gone before me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad hurt?\u201d Jamie asked. He didn\u2019t think so; Rollo was giving General Greene his usual look of appraisal\u2014a look that made most people take a few steps back. Ian shook his head, his hand curled into Rollo\u2019s fur to keep him steady.</p><p>\u201cNay, but he\u2019s torn his leg and he\u2019s lame. I was looking for a safe place to leave him; I\u2019ve got to report in to Captain Mercer. Though seein\u2019 as you\u2019re here\u2014oh, good day to ye, sir,\u201d he said to Greene, whose horse had backed up in response to Rollo and was presently indicating a strong desire to keep going, in spite of his rider\u2019s inclination. Ian sketched a salute and turned back to Jamie. \u201cSeein\u2019 as you\u2019re here, Uncle Jamie, could ye maybe fetch Rollo back to the lines with ye and get Auntie Claire to tend his leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d Jamie said, resigned, and swung down from the saddle, groping for his soggy handkerchief. \u201cLet me bind his leg first. I dinna want blood all over my breeks, and the horse willna like it, either.\u201d</p> <p>Greene cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cAs you mention reporting, Mr. . . . Murray?\u201d he asked, with a sideways glance at Jamie, who nodded. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d be so good as to give me, as well as Captain Mercer, the benefit of your report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, sir,\u201d Ian said agreeably. \u201cThe army\u2019s divided into three bodies now, wi\u2019 a great long line o\u2019 baggage wagons in between. Sae far as I could tell\u2014I exchanged words wi\u2019 another scout who\u2019d gone all the way up the column\u2014they\u2019re headed toward a place called Freehold. The ground\u2019s no verra good for attack\u2014folded up like a used napkin, all cut up wi\u2019 ravines and bitty creeks\u2014though the other scout told me there\u2019s meadows beyond that might do for a fight, and ye could lure them or drive them out there.\u201d</p><p>Greene asked sharp questions, some of which Ian could answer and some he couldn\u2019t, while Jamie tended to the ginger business of binding up the dog\u2019s leg\u2014there was a nasty stake wound, though not too deep; he hoped the stake hadn\u2019t been poisoned. Indians would do that sometimes, in case a wounded deer or wolverine might spring out of the trap.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s horse was not enthused at the prospect of carrying a wolf on his back but eventually was persuaded, and with no more than a nervous eye roll backward now and then, they were mounted.</p><p>\u201cFuirich, a choin,\u201d Ian said, leaning over and scratching Rollo behind the ears. \u201cI\u2019ll be back, aye? Taing, Uncle!\u201d And with a brief nod to Greene, he was away, his own horse clearly wanting to put as much distance between himself and Rollo as possible.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord,\u201d Greene said, wrinkling his nose at the dog\u2019s reek.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d Jamie said, resigned. \u201cMy wife says ye get used to any sort of smell after a bit of smelling it. And I suppose she\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, is she a cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no. A physician. Gangrene, ken, festering bowels and the like.\u201d</p><p>Greene blinked.</p><p>\u201cI see. You have a most interesting family, Mr. Fraser.\u201d He coughed and looked after Ian, rapidly vanishing in the distance. \u201cYou might be wrong about him never becoming a Quaker. At least he doesn\u2019t bow his head to a title.\u201d</p><p>A VISCOUS THREE-WAY</p><p>JAMIE CAME BACK from his ride with General Greene looking damp, wrinkled, and completely disheveled but otherwise refreshed\u2014and with Rollo, bloody and disgruntled but not badly hurt.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I said, scratching Rollo gently behind the ears. The gash had bled a lot, but wasn\u2019t deep. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stitch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna blame ye a bit, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, glancing at the dog, who had suffered my cleaning, salving, and bandaging his leg but didn\u2019t look at all inclined to stand for more fiddling. \u201cWhere are my good stockings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the portmanteau with your other linen,\u201d I replied patiently. \u201cWhere they are every morning. Surely you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI just like ye to tend to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, obligingly pulling them out. \u201cD\u2019you want me to put them on for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I can manage that,\u201d he said, taking them. \u201cCould ye find my shirt, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can do that, yes,\u201d I replied, taking the shirt out of the same portmanteau and shaking it out. \u201cHow was General Greene this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I asked him about the Quaker way of marriage,\u201d he said, pulling a fresh white shirt\u2014his only fresh white shirt, as I pointed out\u2014over his head.</p><p>\u201cEvidently the difficulty is with Denzell and Rachel not havin\u2019 a home meeting, as it\u2019s called. It\u2019s no that they canna marry, but to do it in the proper way, it would involve the whole meeting. There\u2019s a thing called a Clearness Committee, which meets wi\u2019 the bride and groom to counsel them and make sure they\u2019re suited and that they\u2019ve some notion what they\u2019re in for.\u201d He shrugged into the sleeves and grinned at me. \u201cI couldna help thinking, while he was tellin\u2019 me, what a committee like that would have had to say about us when we wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they wouldn\u2019t have had any more notion what we were in for than we did,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cDo you think they would have thought us well suited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019d seen the way I looked at ye, Sassenach, when ye didna see me lookin\u2019\u2014then, aye, they would.\u201d He kissed me briefly and looked round for the hairbrush. \u201cCan ye club up my hair for me? I canna be reviewing my troops like this.\u201d His hair was tied back carelessly with a leather thong, damp stray wisps sticking to his face.</p><p>\u201cOf course. How many of them are you reviewing? And when?\u201d I sat him down on the stool and set to work with the brush. \u201cHave you been burrowing through the countryside headfirst? You have foxtails and leaves in your hair, and those winged seeds that elder trees make. Ooh! To say nothing of this.\u201d I carefully removed a tiny green caterpillar that had become entangled in his tresses and showed it to him, perched inquisitively on my forefinger.</p><p>\u201cThalla le Dia,\u201d he said to the caterpillar. Go with God. And taking it carefully onto his own finger, brought it to the tent flap and loosed it into the grass.</p><p>\u201cAll of them, Sassenach,\u201d he said, returning and sitting down again. \u201cMy last two companies came in this morning; they\u2019ll have been fed now and rested a bit. I meant to ask,\u201d he added, twisting round to look up at me, \u201cwould ye come with me, Sassenach, and have a look at them? To see if any should be left back from the fighting or to tend any that might need the odd bit o\u2019 repair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the parade ground in an hour, if ye would.\u201d He passed a hand over the neatly gleaming auburn queue, doubled on itself and ribboned in a club at his nape. \u201cAye, that\u2019s grand. Am I decent otherwise?\u201d</p><p>He stood up and brushed bits of discarded leaf from his sleeve. The crown of his head brushed the tent, and he was glowing\u2014with sun, energy, and the suppressed excitement of impending action.</p><p>\u201cYou look like bloody Mars, god of war,\u201d I said dryly, handing him his waistcoat. \u201cTry not to scare your men.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked as he shrugged into the waistcoat, but he spoke seriously, eyes on mine.</p><p>\u201cOch, I want them frightened of me, Sassenach. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll have a chance of bringing them out of it alive.\u201d</p><p>WITH AN HOUR to spare, I took my kit of everyday medical supplies and went out to the big tree where the sick among the camp followers tended to gather. The army surgeons would tend camp followers as well as soldiers, if they had time\u2014but they wouldn\u2019t be having time today.</p><p>There was the usual assortment of minor ailments and injuries: a deeply embedded splinter (infected, requiring the application of drawing salve, followed by excavation, disinfection, and bandage); a dislocated toe (caused by the patient having kicked a fellow in play, but the work of a moment to reduce); a split lip (requiring one stitch and a little gentian ointment); a badly gashed foot (the result of inattention whilst chopping wood, requiring twenty-eight stitches and a large dressing); one child with an ear infection (an onion poultice and willow-bark tea prescribed); another with the bellyache (peppermint tea and a strong admonition against eating eggs of unknown age out of birds\u2019 nests of unknown provenance) . . .</p><p>The few patients requiring medicines I put aside until I\u2019d dealt with the injuries. Then\u2014with a wary eye on the sun\u2014I led them off to my tent to dispense packets of willow bark, peppermint, and hemp leaves.</p><p>The tent flap was open; surely I had left it closed? I ducked my head into the gloom of the tent and stopped abruptly. A tall figure stood before me, apparently in the act of rifling my medicine chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing with that?\u201d I asked sharply, and the figure jerked, startled.</p><p>My eyes had now become accustomed to the diffuse light, and I saw that the thief\u2014if that\u2019s what he was\u2014was a Continental officer, a captain.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, madam,\u201d he said, giving me a perfunctory bow. \u201cI had heard that there was a supply of medicaments here. I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is, and they\u2019re mine.\u201d This seemed a trifle ungracious\u2014though I certainly thought his own attitude rather brusque\u2014and I softened the remark a little. \u201cWhat is it that you need? I imagine I can spare a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d He glanced from the chest\u2014very clearly an expensive professional bit of furniture\u2014to me, and his brows rose. \u201cWhat are you doing with a thing like that?\u201d</p><p>Several possible replies flitted through my head, but I\u2019d recovered from the surprise of seeing him sufficiently as not to make any of them. I settled for a neutral \u201cMay I ask who you are, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mildly flustered, he bowed to me. \u201cI beg pardon. Captain Jared Leckie, your servant, ma\u2019am. I am a surgeon with the Second New Jersey.\u201d</p> <p>He eyed me consideringly, clearly wondering who the devil I was. I was wearing a canvas apron with capacious pockets over my gown, these pockets presently stuffed with all manner of small instruments, dressings, bottles and jars of ointments and liquids. I\u2019d also taken off my broad-brimmed hat when I came into the tent and, as usual, was not wearing a cap. I had bound up my hair, but it had come loose and was coiling damply round my ears. He obviously suspected me of being a laundress, come to collect soiled linen\u2014or possibly something worse.</p><p>\u201cI am Mrs. Fraser,\u201d I said, drawing myself up with what I hoped was a gracious nod. \u201cEr . . . Mrs. General Fraser, that is,\u201d I added, seeing that he appeared unimpressed.</p><p>His eyebrows shot up, and he looked me openly up and down, his eyes lingering on the top pockets of my apron, these featuring an unwieldy rolled dressing in the act of coming unrolled and trailing down my front and a jar of asafoetida, whose cork was loose, thus allowing the reek of it to waft gently above the other notable smells of the camp. It was known commonly as \u201cdevil\u2019s dung,\u201d and for good reason. I pulled the jar out and pushed the cork in more securely. This gesture seemed somehow to reassure him.</p><p>\u201cOh! The general is a physician, I perceive,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, beginning to see that I should have uphill work with Captain Leckie, who appeared young and not overbright. \u201cMy husband is a soldier. I am a physician.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at me as though I\u2019d told him I was a prostitute. Then he made the mistake of assuming that I was joking and laughed heartily.</p><p>At this point, one of my patients, a young mother whose one-year-old son had an ear infection, poked her neatly capped head hesitantly into the tent. Her little boy was in her arms, howling and red-faced.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Wilkins. Do bring him in; I\u2019ll get the bark for him directly.\u201d</p><p>Captain Leckie frowned at Mrs. Wilkins and beckoned her closer. She looked nervously at me, but allowed him to lean down and look at little Peter.</p><p>\u201cHe has a difficult tooth,\u201d Leckie said, rather accusingly, after running a large, unwashed thumb through Peter\u2019s drooling mouth. \u201cHe ought to have the gum slit, to let the tooth come through.\u201d He began to fumble in his pocket, where he doubtless had a highly insanitary scalpel or lancet.</p><p>\u201cHe is teething,\u201d I agreed, shaking out a quantity of crumbled willow bark into my mortar. \u201cBut he also has an ear infection, and the tooth will come through of its own accord within the next twenty-four hours.\u201d</p> <p>He rounded on me, indignant and astonished.</p><p>\u201cAre you contradicting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d I said, rather mildly. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You want to have a good look in his left ear. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, madam, am a diplomate of the Medical College of Philadelphia!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI congratulate you,\u201d I said, beginning to be provoked. \u201cYou\u2019re still wrong.\u201d Having thus rendered him momentarily speechless, I finished grinding the bark into powder and poured it into a square of gauze, which I folded into a neat packet and handed to Mrs. Wilkins, with instructions as to the brewing of the infusion and how to administer it, as well as how to apply an onion poultice.</p><p>She took the packet as though it might explode and, with a hasty glance at Captain Leckie, fled, little Peter\u2019s howls receding like a siren in the distance.</p><p>I drew a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d I said, as pleasantly as possible. \u201cIf you\u2019re in need of simples, Dr. Leckie, I have a good supply. I can\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He had drawn himself up like a crane eyeing a frog, beady-eyed and hostile.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said curtly, and stalked past me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes up toward the canvas overhead. There was a small gecko-like creature clinging to the cloth, who viewed me with no particular emotion.</p><p>\u201cHow to win friends and influence people,\u201d I remarked to it. \u201cTake note.\u201d Then I pushed the tent flap back and beckoned for the next patient to come in.</p><p>I HAD TO hurry in order to make my rendezvous with Jamie, who was just about to begin his review when I dashed up, twisting my hair into a mass and pinning it hastily under my broad-brimmed hat. It was a terribly hot day; being in the open sun for only a few minutes had made my nose and cheeks tingle warningly.</p><p>Jamie bowed gravely to me and began his advance along the line of men drawn up for review, greeting men, saluting officers, asking questions, giving his aide-de-camp notes of things to be done.</p><p>He had Lieutenant Schnell with him as aide-de-camp\u2014a nice German boy from Philadelphia, perhaps nineteen\u2014and a stout gentleman I didn\u2019t know but assumed from his uniform to be the captain in charge of whatever companies we were inspecting. I followed them, smiling at the men as I passed, while looking them over sharpish for any overt signs of illness, injury, or disability\u2014I was sure that Jamie could spot excessive drunkenness without my expert opinion.</p><p>There were three hundred men, he\u2019d told me, and most of them were quite all right. I kept walking and nodding, but wasn\u2019t above beginning to fantasize some dangerous circumstance in which I found Captain Leckie writhing in pain, which I would graciously allay, causing him to grovel and apologize for his objectionable attitude. I was trying to choose between the prospect of a musket ball embedded in his buttock, testicular torsion, and something temporarily but mortifyingly disfiguring, like Bell\u2019s palsy, when my eye caught a glimpse of something odd in the lineup.</p><p>The man in front of me was standing bolt upright, musket at port arms, eyes fixed straight ahead. This was perfectly correct\u2014but no other man in the line was doing it. Militiamen were more than capable, but they generally saw no point in military punctilio. I glanced at the rigid soldier, passed by\u2014then glanced back.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d I exclaimed, and only sheer chance kept Jamie from hearing me, he being distracted by the sudden arrival of a messenger.</p><p>I took two hasty steps back, bent, and peered under the brim of the dusty slouch hat. The face beneath was set in fierce lines, with a darkly ominous glower\u2014and was completely familiar to me.</p><p>\u201cBloody effing hell,\u201d I whispered, seizing him by the sleeve. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you,\u201d he whispered back, not moving a muscle of face or body. \u201cDo walk on, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Such was my astonishment, I might actually have done it, had my attention not been drawn by a small figure skulking about behind the line, trying to avoid notice by crouching behind a wagon wheel.</p><p>\u201cGermain!\u201d I said, and Jamie whirled about, eyes wide.</p><p>Germain stiffened for an instant and then turned to flee, but too late; Lieutenant Schnell, living up to his name, sprang through the line and grabbed Germain by the arm.</p><p>\u201cIs he yours, sir?\u201d he asked, glancing curiously from Jamie to Germain and back.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Jamie said, with a tone that had turned many a man\u2019s blood to water. \u201cWhat the devil\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an orderly!\u201d Germain said proudly, trying to detach himself from Lieutenant Schnell\u2019s grip. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d his grandfather assured him. \u201cAnd what do ye mean, an orderly? Whose orderly?\u201d</p><p>Germain at once glanced in John\u2019s direction, then, realizing his mistake, jerked his eyes back, but it was too late. Jamie reached John in a single stride and ripped the hat off his head.</p><p>The face was identifiable as that of Lord John Grey, but only by someone who knew him well. He wore a black felt patch over one eye, and the other was all but obscured by dirt and bruises. He\u2019d cut his luxuriant blond hair to roughly an inch in length and appeared to have rubbed dirt into it.</p><p>With considerable aplomb, he scratched his head and handed Jamie his musket.</p><p>\u201cI surrender to you, sir,\u201d he said, in a clear voice. \u201cTo you, personally. So does my orderly,\u201d he added, putting a hand on Germain\u2019s shoulder. Lieutenant Schnell, quite flabbergasted, let go of Germain as though he were red-hot.</p><p>\u201cI surrender, sir,\u201d Germain said solemnly, and saluted.</p><p>I\u2019d never seen Jamie at a complete loss for words, and didn\u2019t now, but it was a near thing. He inhaled strongly through his nose, then turned to Lieutenant Schnell.</p><p>\u201cEscort the prisoners to Captain McCorkle, Lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . .\u201d I said apologetically. A hard blue eye swiveled in my direction, brow raised.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s injured,\u201d I said, as mildly as I could, with a brief gesture in John\u2019s direction. Jamie\u2019s lips compressed for an instant, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cTake the prisoners\u2014and Mrs. Fraser\u201d\u2014I daresay it was merely sensitivity on my part that perceived a certain emphasis on \u201cMrs. Fraser\u201d\u2014\u201cto my tent, Lieutenant.\u201d</p><p>With scarcely a breath, he turned on John.</p><p>\u201cI accept your surrender, Colonel,\u201d he said, with icy politeness. \u201cAnd your parole. I will attend you later.\u201d</p><p>And, with that, he turned his back on the three of us, in what could only be described as a marked manner.</p><p>\u201cWHAT ON EARTH happened to your eye?\u201d I demanded, peering at it. I had John on the cot in my small medical tent, the flap open to admit as much light as possible. The eye was swollen half shut and surrounded by a sticky black ring where the felt patch had been peeled away, the underlying flesh a lurid palette of green, purple, and ghastly yellow. The eye itself was red as a flannel petticoat and, from the irritated state of the eyelids, had been watering more or less constantly for some time.</p><p>\u201cYour husband punched me when I told him I\u2019d bedded you,\u201d he replied, with complete composure. \u201cI do hope he didn\u2019t take any similarly violent actions upon being reunited with you?\u201d</p><p>Had I been capable of a convincing Scottish noise, I might have resorted to one. As it was, I merely glared at him.</p><p>\u201cI decline absolutely to discuss my husband with you,\u201d I said. \u201cLie down, blast you.\u201d</p><p>He eased himself back on the cot, wincing.</p><p>\u201cHe said he hit you twice,\u201d I remarked, watching this. \u201cWhere was the second one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the liver.\u201d He gingerly touched his lower abdomen. I pulled up his shirt and inspected the damage, which amounted to further spectacular bruising around the lower ribs, with blue streaks draining down toward the ilial crest, but little more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not where your liver is,\u201d I informed him. \u201cIt\u2019s on the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He looked blank. \u201cReally? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor. Let me look at your eye.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for permission, but he didn\u2019t resist, lying back and staring up at the canvas roof while I spread the eyelids as far as possible. The sclera and conjunctiva were badly inflamed, and even the dim light made the eye water profusely. I held up two fingers.</p><p>\u201cTwo,\u201d he said, before I could ask. \u201cAnd before you start ordering me to look to and fro and up and down . . . I can\u2019t. I can see out of it\u2014though it\u2019s a bit blurry, and I see everything doubled, which is very disagreeable\u2014but I can\u2019t move it at all. Dr. Hunter opined that some muscle or other was trapped by some sort of bone. He didn\u2019t feel competent to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered that you think I might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the fullest confidence in your abilities, Dr. Fraser,\u201d he said politely. \u201cBesides, have I any choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Keep quite still, there . . . Germain!\u201d I had caught sight of a telltale flutter of pink calico from the corner of my eye, and the runaway came sidling in, looking vaguely guilty.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you have in your shirt,\u201d I said, noting a suspicious bulge or two. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an accessory to crime. No, wait\u2014is it alive?\u201d</p><p>Germain prodded the bulge, as though not quite sure, but it didn\u2019t move, and he shook his head. \u201cNo, Grand-m\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Come here and hold this, will you?\u201d</p><p>I handed him my pocket looking glass and, adjusting the tent flap so that a ray of light shone in, then adjusted Germain\u2019s hand so that the reflected light shone directly from the mirror into the affected eye. John yelped slightly when the light struck his eye, but obediently clutched the sides of the cot and didn\u2019t move, though his eye watered terribly. All the better; it would wash out bacteria and perhaps make it easier to move the eyeball.</p><p>Denny was most likely right, I thought, selecting my smallest cautery iron and slipping it gently under the lower lid. It was the best thing I could find for the job, being flat, smooth, and spade-shaped. I couldn\u2019t move the globe of the eyeball upward at all; even slight pressure made him go white. I could move it slightly from side to side, and given the sensitivity of John\u2019s face just below the eye, I began to form a mental picture of the damage. It was almost certainly what was called a \u201cblowout\u201d fracture, which had cracked the delicate bone of the orbital floor and forced a displaced bit of it\u2014along with part of the inferior rectus muscle\u2014down into the maxillary sinus. The edge of the muscle was caught in the crack, thus immobilizing the eyeball. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBloody, bloody-minded, effing Scot,\u201d I said, straightening up.</p><p>\u201cNot his fault,\u201d said John. \u201cI provoked him.\u201d He sounded excessively cheerful, and I turned a cold look on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not any more pleased with you,\u201d I informed him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to like this, and it will serve you right. How in heaven\u2019s name did you\u2014no, don\u2019t tell me now. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>He folded his hands across his stomach, looking meek. Germain sniggered, but desisted when I gave him a glare of his own.</p> <p>Tight-lipped, I filled a syringe\u2014Dr. Fentiman\u2019s penis syringe, as it happened; how appropriate\u2014with saline solution for irrigation and found my small pair of needle-nosed forceps. I had another peek at the site with my makeshift spatula and prepared a tiny, curved needle with a wet catgut suture, cut very fine. I might manage without needing to stitch the inferior rectus\u2014it depended whether the edge of the muscle had frayed very badly, by reason of its long entrapment, and how it survived being dislodged\u2014but best to have the suture handy, in case of need. I hoped the need wouldn\u2019t occur; there was so much swelling . . . but I couldn\u2019t wait several days for it to subside.</p><p>What was troubling me was not so much the immediate reduction of the fracture and freeing of the muscle but the longer-term possibility of adhesion. The eye should be kept fairly immobile, to aid healing, but doing that might cause the muscle to adhere to the orbit, literally freezing the eye permanently. I needed something slippery with which to dress the site, something biologically inert and non-irritating\u2014in my own time, sterile glycerin drops would have been instantly available, but here . . .</p><p>Egg white, perhaps? Probably not, I thought; body heat might coddle it, and then what?</p><p>\u201cJohn!\u201d</p><p>A shocked voice behind me made me turn, needle in hand. A very dapper-looking gentleman in a stylish wig and a gray-blue velvet suit was standing just inside the tent flap, staring aghast at my patient.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to him?\u201d Percy Beauchamp demanded, spotting me in the background.</p><p>\u201cNothing serious,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d said John, in a voice I\u2019d never heard him use before. He sat up, fixing the newcomer with as steely a look as could be managed with one badly watering crimson eye. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you doing here?\u201d Beauchamp demanded. His accent was English, but English faintly tinged with French. He took a step nearer and lowered his voice. \u201cSurely you have not become a Rebel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I bloody haven\u2019t! Leave, I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, you mean you\u2014what the devil happened to you?\u201d He\u2019d come close enough now to behold the complete picture: filthy cropped hair, filthy disheveled clothes, filthy stockinged feet with holes in toe and heel, and a distorted visage now directing a glare of bloodshot venom at him.</p> <p>\u201cNow, look here\u2014\u201d I began, turning on Percy with determined firmness, but Germain stopped me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the man who was looking for Papa in New Bern last year,\u201d Germain said. He\u2019d put down the looking glass and was watching the evolving scene with interest. \u201cGrand-p\u00e8re thinks he\u2019s a villain.\u201d</p><p>Percy cast Germain a startled look, but recovered his composure with remarkable speed.</p><p>\u201cAh. The proprietor of distinguished frogs,\u201d he said, with a smile. \u201cI recall. Peter and Simon were their names? One yellow and one green.\u201d</p><p>Germain bowed respectfully.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur has an excellent memory,\u201d he said, with exquisite politeness. \u201cWhat do you want with my papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent question,\u201d said John, putting one hand over his injured eye, the better to glare at Monsieur Beauchamp.</p><p>\u201cYes, that is a good question,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cDo sit down, Mr. Beauchamp\u2014and bloody explain yourself. And, you,\u201d I added, taking John firmly by both shoulders, \u201clie down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat can wait,\u201d John said shortly, resisting my attempt to flatten him. He swung his legs over the side of the cot. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Percy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know him, do you?\u201d I said, beginning to be provoked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. He\u2019s my brother\u2014or was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Germain and I exclaimed as one. He looked at me and giggled.</p><p>\u201cI thought Hal was your only brother,\u201d I said, recovering. I glanced back and forth between John and Percy. There was no resemblance at all between them, whereas John\u2019s resemblance to Hal was as marked as if they\u2019d been stamped from the same mold.</p><p>\u201cStepbrother,\u201d John said, still more shortly. He got his feet under him, preparing to rise. \u201cCome with me, Percy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d I said, raising my voice slightly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you propose to stop me?\u201d John was on his feet, staggering a little as he tried to focus his eyes. Before I could answer, Mr. Beauchamp had lunged forward and grabbed his arm, to keep him from falling. John jerked violently away from him, nearly falling again as he stumbled backward into the cot. He caught his balance and stood glowering at Beauchamp, his fists half clenched.</p><p>Beauchamp\u2019s gaze was locked with his, and the air between them was . . . electric. Oh, I thought, glancing from one to the other, suddenly enlightened. Oh.</p><p>I must have made some small movement, because Beauchamp\u2019s gaze flicked suddenly toward my face. He looked startled at whatever he saw there, then, recovering himself, smiled wryly and bowed.</p><p>\u201cMadame,\u201d he said. Then, in perfect, accentless English, \u201cHe is really my stepbrother, though we haven\u2019t spoken in . . . some time. I am here as the guest of the Marquis de La Fayette\u2014amongst other things. Do allow me to take his lordship to meet the marquis. I promise to bring him back in one piece.\u201d He smiled at me, warm-eyed and sure of his charm, which was considerable.</p><p>\u201cHis lordship is a prisoner of war,\u201d said a very dry Scottish voice from behind Beauchamp. \u201cAnd my responsibility. I regret that he must remain here, sir.\u201d</p><p>Percy Beauchamp whirled round, gaping at Jamie, who was filling the tent flap in a most implacable fashion.</p><p>\u201cI still want to know what he wants with Papa,\u201d Germain said, small blond brows drawn down in a suspicious glower.</p><p>\u201cI should like to know that, too, monsieur,\u201d Jamie said. He came into the tent, ducking, and nodded toward the stool I had been using. \u201cPray be seated, sir.\u201d</p><p>Percy Beauchamp glanced from Jamie to Lord John and back again. His face had gone smooth and blank, though the lively dark eyes were full of calculation.</p><p>\u201cAlas,\u201d he said, the slight French accent back. \u201cI am engaged to le marquis\u2014and General Washington\u2014just now. You will excuse me, I am sure. Bonjour, Mon G\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\u201d He marched to the tent flap, head held high, turning at the last moment to smile at John. \u201cAu revoir, mon fr\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I bloody see you first.\u201d</p><p>NOBODY MOVED FOR the space of nine heartbeats\u2014I counted them\u2014following Percy Beauchamp\u2019s dignified exit. Finally, John sat down abruptly on the cot, exhaling audibly. Jamie caught my eye and, with a slight nod, sat down on the stool. Nobody spoke.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t hit him again, Grand-p\u00e8re,\u201d Germain said earnestly, breaking the silence. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good man, and I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t take Grannie to bed anymore, now that you\u2019re home to do it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave Germain a quelling look, but his mouth twitched. From my position behind the cot, I could see the back of John\u2019s neck flush a deep pink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much obliged to his lordship for his care of your grannie,\u201d Jamie told Germain. \u201cBut if ye think makin\u2019 impertinent remarks regarding your elders is going to save your arse\u2014think again.\u201d</p><p>Germain shifted uneasily, but rolled his eyes at Lord John in a \u201cworth a try\u201d sort of way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m obliged to you for your good opinion, sir,\u201d John told him. \u201cAnd I reciprocate the compliment\u2014but I trust you are aware that good intent alone does not absolve one from the consequences of rash conduct.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was beginning to flush as deeply as John.</p><p>\u201cGermain,\u201d I said. \u201cDo go away. Oh\u2014see if you can find me some honey, would you?\u201d</p><p>All three of them looked at me, startled at this apparent non sequitur.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s viscous,\u201d I said, with a slight shrug. \u201cAnd antibacterial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d John said under his breath in a hopeless sort of way.</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018viscous\u2019 mean?\u201d Germain asked, interested.</p><p>\u201cGermain,\u201d said his grandfather, in a menacing tone, and he hastily disappeared without waiting for enlightenment.</p><p>Everyone took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cLie down now,\u201d I said to John, before anything regrettable might be said. \u201cHave you got a moment, Jamie? I need someone to hold the mirror while I fix his eye.\u201d</p><p>With no more than an instant\u2019s hesitation, they both obeyed, not looking at each other. I was nearly ready; when I\u2019d got Jamie positioned and the ray of light focused on the eye, I once more irrigated the eye and socket gently with saline solution, then rinsed my fingers thoroughly with the same stuff.</p><p>\u201cI need you both to hold completely still,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, John, but there\u2019s no other way to do this, and if we\u2019re lucky, it will be quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019ve heard that one before,\u201d Jamie muttered, but desisted when I shot a sideways look at him.</p><p>I was afraid to use the forceps, for fear of puncturing his eyeball. So I spread the lids of John\u2019s affected eye with the fingers of my left hand, wedged the fingertips of my right as deeply into the eye socket as I could, and squeezed.</p><p>He made a shocked, strangled sort of noise, and Jamie gasped but didn\u2019t drop the mirror.</p><p>There are not many things in the world slipperier than a wet eyeball. I tried to squeeze as lightly as I could, but there was no help for it; a light pressure merely allowed the eyeball to pop out of my fingers like an oiled grape. I clenched my teeth and tried again, gripping harder.</p><p>On the fourth try, I managed to get a sufficient grip as to allow me to try to rotate the eyeball in its socket. I didn\u2019t quite manage it, but at least got a better idea of how it might go.</p><p>Five minutes later, John was trembling like a blancmange, hands clenched tight on the rails of the cot, Jamie was praying under his breath in Gaelic, and all three of us were drenched with sweat.</p><p>\u201cOnce more,\u201d I said, drawing breath and wiping sweat from my chin with the back of my hand. I rinsed my fingers again. \u201cIf I can\u2019t get it this time, we\u2019ll have a rest and try again later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d said John. He closed both eyes briefly, swallowed hard, and opened them as wide as he could. Both eyes were watering badly, and tears washed down his temples.</p><p>I felt Jamie move slightly next to me. He refocused the mirror\u2014but I saw that he had also moved nearer to the cot, so that his leg pressed against the rail, just next to John\u2019s gripping fingers. I wiggled my wet fingers in preparation, said a brief prayer to St. Claire, patron of sore eyes, and thrust my fingers as deeply into the socket as I could manage.</p><p>By this time, I had a very clear mental image of the fracture, a dark line beneath the torn conjunctiva, and the line of the inferior rectus muscle wedged into it. I twisted, a short, sharp jerk, before my fingers slipped\u2014and felt the muscle pop free. John shuddered the full length of his body and gave a little moan.</p><p>\u201cGlory be,\u201d I said, and laughed from sheer relief. There was a little blood\u2014not much\u2014on my fingers, and I wiped them on my apron. Jamie flinched and looked away.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d he asked, carefully not looking at John.</p><p>\u201cNow what\u2014Oh.\u201d I considered that one for a moment, then shook my head.</p><p>\u201cHe has to lie down for several hours with the eye covered\u2014a day or two, ideally. If Germain finds me some honey, I\u2019ll lubricate the eye socket with a bit of it, to prevent adhesion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean,\u201d Jamie said patiently, \u201cdoes he require to be kept under a doctor\u2019s care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all the time,\u201d I said, surveying John critically. \u201cSomeone\u2014me, I mean\u2014needs to check the eye every so often, but there\u2019s really nothing else to be done for it; the swelling and bruises will take care of themselves. Why? What were you planning to do with him?\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a small gesture of frustration.</p><p>\u201cI would hand him over to Washington\u2019s staff for interrogation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I surrendered to you personally,\u201d John said helpfully. He glanced at me out of his working eye. \u201cThat means I\u2019m his responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, thank ye for that,\u201d Jamie muttered, giving him an irritable look.</p><p>\u201cWell, you aren\u2019t going to tell him anything useful, either, are you?\u201d I asked, putting a hand on John\u2019s forehead. Slightly warm, but no gross fever. \u201cSuch as the nature of the relations between yourself and the recent Mr. Beauchamp?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave a brief snort.</p><p>\u201cI ken fine what his relations are wi\u2019 that wee sodomite,\u201d he said bluntly. He gave John a piercing stare. \u201cYe dinna mean to tell me what he\u2019s doing here, do ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d John said cheerfully. \u201cThough it almost certainly wouldn\u2019t help you if I did.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, having evidently expected nothing better, and rose with an air of decision.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. I\u2019ve work to do, and so have you, Sassenach. Wait here for Germain, if ye will, and when ye\u2019ve finished with the honey, tell Germain he\u2019s to be in charge of his lordship. He\u2019s no to leave his lordship under any circumstances, save you or I tell him he may\u2014and should Monsieur Beauchamp pay another call, Germain is to be present at any conversation. He speaks French verra fluently,\u201d he advised John. \u201cAnd should ye think of attempting to subvert my grandson\u2019s loyalty\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSir!\u201d John said, looking shocked at the mere idea.</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Jamie said darkly, and left.</p><p>THE MULE DISLIKES YOU</p><p>I DIDN\u2019T KNOW QUITE what to say to John, in the wake of recent events. He seemed similarly at a loss, but coped with the social awkwardness by closing his eyes and pretending to be asleep. I couldn\u2019t leave him until Germain got back with the honey\u2014assuming he found any, but I had a fair amount of faith in his abilities.</p> <p>Well, no point in sitting about with my hands folded. I took out my mortar and pestle and set to work grinding gentian root and garlic for antibiotic ointment. This occupied my hands, but unfortunately not my mind, which was scampering in circles like a hamster on a wheel.</p><p>I had two main anxieties at the moment, one of which I could do nothing about: that being the escalating sense of oncoming battle. I knew it very well; I couldn\u2019t be mistaken. Jamie hadn\u2019t told me explicitly, perhaps because he hadn\u2019t had written orders yet\u2014but I knew as clearly as if it had been shouted by a town crier. The army would move soon.</p><p>I stole a glance at John, who lay like a tomb effigy, hands neatly crossed at his waist. All it wanted was a small dog curled up at his feet. Rollo, snoring under the cot, would have to do, I supposed.</p><p>John, of course, was the other anxiety. I had no idea how he\u2019d come to be where he was, but enough people had seen him surrender that his presence would be common knowledge by nightfall. And once it was . . .</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d consider escaping, if I left for a moment?\u201d I asked abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, not opening his eyes. \u201cI gave my parole. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t make it outside the camp,\u201d he added.</p><p>The silence resumed, broken by the brumm of a large bumblebee, which had blundered into the tent, and the more distant shouts and drumbeats of soldiers drilling and the low thrashing noises of daily camp life.</p><p>The only good thing\u2014if one chose to regard it that way, and I might as well\u2014was that the rising sense of battle urgency was likely to preclude official curiosity about John. What the devil would Jamie do with him when the army decamped in the morning? I wondered.</p><p>\u201cGrand-m\u00e8re, Grand-m\u00e8re!\u201d Germain burst into the tent, and Rollo\u2014who had slept through Percy Beauchamp\u2019s visit without stirring a whisker\u2014shot out from under the cot with an explosive WOOF! that nearly overturned the cot and John with it.</p><p>\u201cHush, dog,\u201d I said, seeing him glaring wildly round, and took a restraining grip on his scruff. \u201cAnd what the he\u2014I mean the dev\u2014I mean what\u2019s the matter, Germain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him, Grannie! I saw him! The man who took Clarence! Come quick!\u201d And without waiting for response, he turned and raced out of the tent.</p> <p>John began to sit up, and Rollo tensed under my hand.</p><p>\u201cSit!\u201d I said to both of them. \u201cAnd bloody stay!\u201d</p><p>THE HAIRS ON my forearms were prickling, even as sweat streamed down my neck. I\u2019d left my hat behind and the sun blazed on my cheeks; I was panting by the time I caught up with Germain, as much from emotion as from heat.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust there, Grannie! The big bugger wi\u2019 the kerchief round his arm. Clarence must ha\u2019 bitten him!\u201d Germain added, with glee.</p><p>The bugger in question was big: roughly twice my size, with a head like a pumpkin. He was sitting on the ground under the shade of what I thought of as the hospital tree, nursing his kerchief-wrapped arm and glowering at nothing in particular. A small group of people seeking medical treatment\u2014you could tell as much from their hunched and drooping attitudes\u2014was keeping a distance from him, looking warily at him from time to time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best keep out of sight,\u201d I murmured to Germain, but, hearing no answer, glanced round to discover that he\u2019d already faded artfully from view, canny child that he was.</p><p>I walked up, smiling, to the little group of waiting people\u2014mostly women with children. I didn\u2019t know any of them by name, but they clearly knew who and what I was; they bobbed their heads and murmured greetings, but cut their eyes sideways at the man under the tree. \u201cTake him first before he does something messy\u201d was the clear message. Just as clear as the sense of badly contained violence that the man was radiating in all directions.</p> <p>I cleared my throat and walked over to the man, wondering what on earth I was to say to him. \u201cWhat have you done with Clarence the mule?\u201d or \u201cHow dare you rob my grandson and leave him in the wilderness alone, you bloody bastard?\u201d</p><p>I settled for \u201cGood morning. I\u2019m Mrs. Fraser. What happened to your arm, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleedin\u2019 mule bit me to the bone, gaddamn his stinkin\u2019 hide,\u201d the man replied promptly, and glowered at me under eyebrows ridged with scar tissue. So were his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cLet me see it, will you?\u201d Not waiting for permission, I took hold of his wrist\u2014it was hairy and very warm\u2014and unwrapped the kerchief. This was stiff with dried blood, and no wonder.</p><p>Clarence\u2014if it was Clarence\u2014actually had bitten him to the bone. Horse and mule bites could be serious but usually resulted only in deep bruising; equines had powerful jaws, but their front teeth were designed for tearing grass, and as most bites were through clothing, they didn\u2019t often break skin. It could be done, though, and Clarence had done it.</p><p>A flap of skin\u2014and a good chunk of flesh\u2014about three inches wide had been partially detached, and I could see past the thin fatty layer to the gleam of tendon and the red membranous covering of the radius. The wound was recent but had stopped bleeding, save for a little oozing at the edges.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said noncommittally, and turned his hand over. \u201cCan you close your fingers into a fist?\u201d He could, though the ring finger and little finger wouldn\u2019t fold in completely. They did move, though; the tendon wasn\u2019t severed. \u201cHmm,\u201d I said again, and reached into my bag for the bottle of saline solution and a probe. Saline was a little less painful for disinfection than dilute alcohol or vinegar\u2014and it was somewhat easier to get hold of salt, at least when living in a city\u2014but I kept a tight grip on the enormous wrist as I poured the liquid into the wound.</p><p>He made a noise like a wounded bear, and the waiting onlookers took several steps back, as a body.</p><p>\u201cRather a vicious mule,\u201d I observed mildly, as the patient subsided, panting. His face darkened.</p><p>\u201cGonna beat the gaddamn bastarding f**ker to death, soon as I get back,\u201d he said, and bared his yellow teeth at me. \u201cSkin him, I will, and sell his meat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t advise that,\u201d I said, keeping a grip on my temper. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be using that arm violently; it could bring on gangrene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could?\u201d He didn\u2019t go pale\u2014it wasn\u2019t possible, given the temperature\u2014but I\u2019d definitely got his attention.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said pleasantly. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen gangrene, I daresay? The flesh goes green and putrid\u2014beastly smell\u2014limb rots, dead in days . . . that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seen it,\u201d he muttered, eyes now fixed on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d I said soothingly, \u201cwe\u2019ll do our best here, won\u2019t we?\u201d I would normally have offered a patient in such a case a fortifying draft of whatever liquor was available\u2014and, thanks to the marquis, I had quite a good supply of French brandy\u2014but in the present instance, I wasn\u2019t feeling charitable.</p><p>In fact, my general feeling was that Hippocrates could turn a blind eye for the next few minutes. Do no harm, forsooth. Still, there wasn\u2019t a great deal I could do to him, armed with a two-inch suture needle and a pair of embroidery scissors.</p><p>I stitched the wound as slowly as I could, taking care to slosh more saline over it periodically and glancing covertly round for assistance. Jamie was with Washington and the high command as they strategized the imminent engagement; I couldn\u2019t summon him out to deal with a mule thief.</p><p>Ian had vanished on his pony, scouting the British rear guard. Rollo was with Lord John. Rachel had gone off with Denny and Dottie in the Quakers\u2019 wagon, to look for supplies in the nearest village. And good luck to them, I thought; General Greene\u2019s foragers had spread out like locusts over the face of the earth the moment the army halted, stripping farmsteads and storage barns in their path.</p><p>The patient was cursing in a rather monotonous and uninspired fashion, but showed no signs of keeling over in a convenient faint. What I was doing to his arm was unlikely to improve his temper; what if he actually did intend to go straight off and beat Clarence to death?</p><p>If Clarence was loose, I\u2019d put good odds on the mule to win any such encounter, but he was very likely tied or hobbled. But then . . . a horrid thought struck me. I knew where Germain was, and what he was doing\u2014or trying to do.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I muttered, bending my head over the teamster\u2019s arm to hide an undoubtedly appalled expression. Germain was an extremely talented pickpocket, but stealing a mule out of the middle of a gang of teamsters . . .</p><p>What had Jamie said? \u201cHe\u2019d be taken up for theft and hanged or flogged within an inch of his life, and I couldna do a thing to stop it.\u201d Teamsters being what they were, they\u2019d likely just break his neck and be done with it, rather than waiting for any sort of military justice.</p><p>I swallowed hard and glanced quickly over my shoulder, to see if I could spot the teamsters\u2019 encampment. If I could see Germain . . .</p><p>I didn\u2019t see Germain. What I saw was Percy Beauchamp, regarding me thoughtfully from the shadow of a nearby tent. Our eyes met, and he instantly came toward me, straightening his coat. Well, I was in no position to look a gift horse\u2014or mule\u2014in the mouth, was I?</p><p>\u201cMadame Fraser,\u201d he said, and bowed. \u201cAre you in need of some assistance?\u201d</p><p>Yes, I bloody did need assistance; I couldn\u2019t drag my surgical repairs out much longer. I darted a look at my massive patient, wondering whether he had any French.</p><p>Apparently my face was just as transparent as Jamie had always told me it was; Percy smiled at me and said conversationally in French, \u201cI don\u2019t think this clot of decaying menstrual blood is capable of understanding more English than it takes to hire the sort of poxed and imbecile whore who would let him touch her, let alone understand the tongue of angels.\u201d</p><p>The teamster went on muttering, \u201cShit-fire, shit-fire, f**king shit-ass f**king-ass mule, that gaddamn hurts . . .\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a little and replied in French. \u201cYes, I need help\u2014with the utmost urgency. My grandson is trying to steal the mule this oaf stole from him. Can you retrieve him from the teamsters\u2019 camp before someone notices?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00c0 votre service, madame,\u201d he replied promptly, and, clicking his heels smartly together, bowed and went off.</p><p>I TOOK AS long as I could over the final dressing of the wound, worried that should my foul-mouthed patient find Germain among the teamsters, Percy\u2019s French manners might be unequal to the occasion. And I couldn\u2019t really expect Hippocrates to continue turning a blind eye, were I compelled to do something drastic if the man tried to break Germain\u2019s neck.</p><p>I heard a familiar loud braying behind me, though, and turned sharply to see Percy, flushed and a trifle disheveled, leading Clarence toward me. Germain sat atop the mule, his face set in lines of vindictive triumph as he glared at my patient.</p><p>I stood up hastily, groping for my knife. The teamster, who had been gingerly prodding the fresh bandage round his arm, looked up, startled, then surged to his feet with a roar.</p><p>\u201cShit-FIRE!\u201d he said, and started purposefully toward them, fists clenched. Percy, to his credit, stood his ground, though he paled a little. He handed the reins up to Germain, though, and stepped firmly forward.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur . . .\u201d he began. I would have liked to know just what he had in mind to say but didn\u2019t find out, as the teamster didn\u2019t bother with colloquy, instead driving a hamlike fist into Percy\u2019s belly. Percy sat down hard and folded up like a fan.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell\u2014Germain!\u201d For Germain, nothing daunted by the sudden loss of support, had gathered up Clarence\u2019s reins and tried to lash the teamster across the face with them.</p><p>This might possibly have been effective, had he not telegraphed his intention quite so clearly. As it was, the teamster ducked and reached out, clearly intending to grab either the reins or Germain. The crowd around me had realized what was happening by now, and women started screaming. At this point, Clarence decided to become involved and, laying back his ears, curled his lips and snapped at the teamster\u2019s face, coming within a toucher of taking off the man\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cSHIT-ASS FUCKING MULE!!\u201d Deeply inflamed, the teamster leapt at Clarence and fixed his teeth in the mule\u2019s upper lip, clinging like grim death to his neck. Clarence screamed. The women screamed. Germain screamed.</p><p>I didn\u2019t scream, because I couldn\u2019t breathe. I was elbowing my way through the crowd, fumbling for the slit in my skirt so I could reach my knife. Just as I laid my hand on the hilt, though, a hand came down on my shoulder, halting me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cPardon me, milady,\u201d said Fergus, and, stepping purposefully past me, walked up beside the lunging mass of mule, teamster, and shrieking child, and fired the pistol in his hand.</p><p>Everything stopped, for a split second, and then the shouting and screaming started again, everyone surging toward Clarence and his companions to see what had happened. For a long moment, it wasn\u2019t apparent what had happened. The teamster had let go his grip in astonishment and turned toward Fergus, eyes bulging and blood-tinged saliva running down his chin. Germain, with more presence of mind than I would have had in such a situation, got hold of the reins and was hauling on them with all his strength, trying to turn Clarence\u2019s head. Clarence, whose blood was plainly up, was having none of it.</p><p>Fergus calmly put the fired pistol back into his belt\u2014I realized at this point that he must have fired into the dirt near the teamster\u2019s feet\u2014and spoke to the man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I were you, sir, I would remove myself promptly from this animal\u2019s presence. It is apparent that he dislikes you.\u201d</p><p>The shouting and screaming had stopped, and this made several people laugh.</p><p>\u201cGot you there, Belden!\u201d a man near me called. \u201cThe mule dislikes you. What you think of that?\u201d</p><p>The teamster looked mildly dazed but still homicidal. He stood with his fists clenched, legs braced wide apart and shoulders hunched, glowering at the crowd.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I think . . . ?\u201d he began. \u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Percy had managed to get to his feet and, while still somewhat hunched, was mobile. Without hesitation, he walked up and kicked the teamster smartly in the balls.</p><p>This went over well. Even the man who appeared to be a friend of Belden\u2019s whooped with laughter. The teamster didn\u2019t go down but curled up like a dried leaf, clutching himself. Percy wisely didn\u2019t wait for him to recover, but turned and bowed to Fergus.</p><p>\u201c\u00c0 votre service, monsieur. I suggest that you and your son\u2014and the mule, of course\u2014might withdraw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerci beaucoup, and I suggest you do the same, tout de suite,\u201d Fergus replied.</p> <p>\u201cHey!\u201d shouted the teamster\u2019s friend, not laughing now. \u201cYou can\u2019t steal that mule!\u201d</p><p>Fergus rounded on him, imperious as the French aristocrat Percy had implied he might be.</p><p>\u201cI cannot, sir,\u201d he said, inclining his head a quarter of an inch in acknowledgment. \u201cBecause a man cannot steal that which already belongs to him, is this not so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that not . . . is what not so?\u201d demanded the man, confused.</p><p>Fergus scorned to answer this. Lifting one dark brow, he strode off several paces, turned, and shouted, \u201cClarence! \u00c9coutez-moi!\u201d</p><p>With the teamster\u2019s collapse, Germain had succeeded in getting Clarence somewhat under control, though the mule\u2019s ears were still laid out flat in displeasure. At the sound of Fergus\u2019s voice, though, the ears rose slowly upright and swiveled in his direction.</p> <p>Fergus smiled, and I heard a woman behind me sigh involuntarily. Fergus\u2019s smile was remarkably charming. He reached into his pocket and withdrew an apple, which he skewered neatly on his hook.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said to the mule, extending his right hand and twiddling the fingers in a head-scratching motion. Clarence came, disregarding Mr. Belden, who had now sat down and was clutching his knees, the better to contemplate his state of inner being. The mule ducked his head to take the apple, nudging Fergus\u2019s elbow, and allowed his forehead to be scratched. There was a murmur of interest and approbation from the crowd, and I noticed a few censorious glances being shot at the groaning Mr. Belden.</p><p>The sense of being about to faint had left me, and now my insides began to unclench. With some effort, I slid the knife back into its sheath without stabbing myself in the thigh and wiped my hand on my skirt.</p><p>\u201cAs for you, sans crevelle,\u201d Fergus was saying to Germain, with a low-voiced menace that he\u2019d plainly learned from Jamie, \u201cwe have a few things to discuss presently.\u201d</p><p>Germain turned a rather sickly shade of yellow. \u201cYes, Papa,\u201d he murmured, hanging his head in order to avoid his father\u2019s minatory eye.</p><p>\u201cGet down,\u201d Fergus said to him, and, turning to me, raised his voice. \u201cMadame General, permit me to present this animal personally to General Fraser, in the service of liberty!\u201d</p><p>This was delivered in such a tone of ringing sincerity that a few souls applauded. I accepted, as graciously as possible, on behalf of General Fraser. By the conclusion of these proceedings, Mr. Belden had got awkwardly to his feet and stumbled off toward the teamsters\u2019 camp, tacitly ceding Clarence to the cause.</p><p>I took Clarence\u2019s reins, relieved and glad to see him again. Apparently it was mutual, for he nosed me familiarly in the shoulder and made chummy huffing noises.</p> <p>Fergus, meanwhile, stood for a moment looking down at Germain, then squared his shoulders and turned to Percy, who still looked a little pale but had straightened his wig and regained his self-possession. Percy bowed very formally to Fergus, who sighed deeply, then bowed back.</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose that we, too, have matters to discuss, monsieur,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cPerhaps a little later?\u201d</p><p>Percy\u2019s handsome face lighted.</p><p>\u201c\u00c0 votre service . . . seigneur,\u201d he said, and bowed again.</p><p>AN ALTERNATE USE FOR A PENIS SYRINGE</p><p>GERMAIN HAD, IN FACT, found some honey, and now that the excitement of recovering Clarence was over, he produced a large chunk of sticky honeycomb, wrapped in a dirty black kerchief, from the recesses of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do wi\u2019 that, Grannie?\u201d he asked, curious. I\u2019d set the oozing chunk of comb in a clean pottery dish and was again employing the useful penis syringe\u2014carefully sterilized with alcohol\u2014to suck up honey, being careful to avoid bits of wax and noticeable pollen grains. Having been designed for irrigation rather than puncture, the syringe had a blunt, smoothly tapered tip: just the thing for dribbling honey into someone\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lubricate his lordship\u2019s bad eye,\u201d I said. \u201cFergus, will you come and steady his lordship\u2019s head, please? Put your hand on his forehead. And, Germain, you\u2019ll hold his eyelids open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can keep still,\u201d John said irritably.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d I said briefly, and sat down on the stool beside him. \u201cNo one can keep still while having things poked into their eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were poking your bloody fingers into my eye not an hour since! And I didn\u2019t move!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou squirmed,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, you couldn\u2019t help it. Now, be quiet; I don\u2019t want to accidentally stab you in the eyeball with this.\u201d</p><p>Breathing audibly through his nose, he clamped his mouth shut and suffered Fergus and Germain to immobilize him. I\u2019d debated whether to dilute the honey with boiled water, but the heat of the day had made it sufficiently thin that I thought it better to use it at full strength.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s antibacterial,\u201d I explained to the three of them, using my cautery iron again to lift the eyeball and squirting a slow dribble of honey under it. \u201cThat means it kills germs.\u201d</p><p>Fergus and Germain, to whom I had explained germs more than once, nodded intelligently and tried to look as though they believed in the existence of such things, which they didn\u2019t. John opened his mouth as though to speak, but then shut it again and exhaled strongly through his nose.</p><p>\u201cBut the chief virtue of honey in the present instance,\u201d I went on, anointing the eyeball generously, \u201cis that it\u2019s viscous. Let go now, Germain. Blink, John. Oh, very good!\u201d The handling had of course made the eye water, but even dilute honey retains its viscosity; I could see the altered gleam of the light across the sclera, indicating the presence of a thin, soothing\u2014I hoped\u2014layer of honey. Some had overflowed, of course, and amber beads were sliding down his temple toward his ear; I stanched the flow with a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cHow does it feel?\u201d</p><p>John opened and closed his eye a couple of times, very slowly.</p><p>\u201cEverything looks blurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter; you aren\u2019t going to be looking out of that eye for a day or two anyway. Does it feel any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, in a distinctly grudging manner, and the other three of us made approving noises that made him look embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cRight, then. Sit up\u2014carefully! Yes, that\u2019s it. Close your eye and hold this to catch the drips.\u201d And, handing him a clean handkerchief, I unrolled a length of gauze bandage, thumbed a pad of lint carefully into the eye socket, and rolled the bandage round his head a few times, tucking in the ends. He strongly resembled a figure in an old painting titled The Spirit of \u201976, but I didn\u2019t mention it.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, exhaling and feeling rather pleased with myself. \u201cFergus, why don\u2019t you and Germain go and find some food? Something for his lordship, and something for the road tomorrow. I rather think it will be a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s been quite long enough already,\u201d John said. He was swaying a little, and I pushed him gently back down with little resistance. He stretched his neck to ease it, then settled on the pillow with a sigh. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d I assured him. I hesitated, but, with Fergus\u2019s departure, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have a better chance to ask what was in my mind. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you know what Percival Beauchamp wants with Fergus, do you?\u201d</p><p>The good eye opened and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t think he believes Fergus to be the lost heir to a great fortune? No, I don\u2019t, either. But if Mr. Fraser will take a bit of unsolicited advice, I\u2019d strongly suggest having as little as possible to do with Monsieur Beauchamp.\u201d The eye closed again.</p><p>Percy Beauchamp had taken his leave\u2014very gracefully\u2014after Clarence\u2019s rescue, explaining that he must attend le marquis but adding that he would seek out Fergus on the morrow.</p><p>\u201cWhen things are quieter,\u201d he\u2019d added, with a genteel bow.</p><p>I regarded John thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d I asked. He didn\u2019t open his eye, but his lips tightened.</p><p>\u201cTo me? Nothing. Nothing at all,\u201d he repeated, and turned over on his side with his back to me.</p><p>THREE HUNDRED AND ONE</p><p>THREE HUNDRED MEN. Jamie stepped into the darkness beyond the 16th New Jersey\u2019s campfire and paused for a moment to let his eyes adjust. Three hundred bloody men. He\u2019d never led a band of more than fifty. And never had much in the way of subalterns, no more than one or two men under him.</p><p>Now he had ten militia companies, each with its own captain and a few informally appointed lieutenants, and Lee had given him a staff of his own: two aides-de-camp, a secretary\u2014now, that he could get used to, he thought, flexing the fingers of his maimed right hand\u2014three captains, one of whom was striding along at his shoulder, trying not to look worrit, ten of his own lieutenants, who would serve as liaison between him and the companies under his command, a cook, an assistant cook\u2014and, of course, he had a surgeon already.</p><p>Despite the preoccupations of the moment, the memory of Lee\u2019s face when Jamie\u2019d told him exactly why he didn\u2019t need an army surgeon assigned to him made him smile.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Lee had said, his long-nosed face going blank. Then he\u2019d gathered his wits and gone red in the face, thinking himself practiced upon. But Jamie had pushed back his cuff and shown Lee his right hand, the old white scars on his fingers like tiny starbursts where the bones had come through, and the broad one, still red but neat, straight, and beautifully knit, running down between the middle finger and the little one, showing where the missing finger had been amputated with such skill that one had to look twice to see why the hand seemed strange.</p><p>\u201cWell, General, your wife seems a most accomplished needlewoman,\u201d Lee said, now amused.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir, she is,\u201d he\u2019d said politely. \u201cAnd a verra bonny hand with a blade, too.\u201d</p><p>Lee gave him a sardonic look and spread out the fingers of his own right hand; the outer two were missing.</p><p>\u201cSo was the gentleman who took these off me. A duel,\u201d he added offhandedly, seeing Jamie\u2019s raised brows, and curled up his hand again. \u201cIn Italy.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know about Lee. The man had a reputation, but he was a boaster, and the two didn\u2019t often go together. On the other hand, he was proud as one of Louis\u2019s camels, and arrogance sometimes did mark a man who kent his worth.</p><p>The plan to attack the British rear guard, at first intended as a quick strike by La Fayette and a thousand men\u2014Lee scorning such a minor command\u2014had grown more elaborate, as such things always did if you gave commanders time to think about them. Once Washington had decided that the expeditionary force should be five thousand men, Lee had graciously condescended to this more appropriate command\u2014leaving La Fayette in charge of his own smaller force, for the sake of the marquis\u2019s amour-propre, but with Lee in command overall. Jamie had his doubts, but it wasn\u2019t his place to voice them.</p><p>He glanced to his left, where Ian and his dog were ambling along, the former whistling to himself and the latter a huge, shaggy shape in the dark, panting from the heat.</p><p>\u201cIain,\u201d he said casually in G\u00e0idhlig, \u201cdid your friends with the feathers have aught to say about Ounewaterika?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had, Uncle,\u201d Ian replied in the same language. \u201cNot much, though, for they know him only by repute. He\u2019s a most ferocious fighter, or so it\u2019s said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d The Mohawk were certainly ferocious and did set great store by personal courage\u2014but he thought they had a negligible grasp of strategy, tactics, and judgment. He was about to ask about Joseph Brant, who was likely the closest thing to a general\u2014in the formal sense\u2014among the Mohawk, but was interrupted by a tall, gangling form stepping out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, sir. Might I have a word?\u201d the man said, and, looking right and left at Jamie\u2019s companions, added, \u201cA private word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly, Captain . . . Woodsworth,\u201d he replied, hoping his hesitation in finding the man\u2019s name was small enough to pass unnoticed. He\u2019d memorized all the militia captains as he met them\u2014and as many men as he could\u2014but their names wouldn\u2019t come easy to him for a bit yet.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s further hesitation, he nodded to Ian to go on with Captain Whewell to the next fire.</p><p>\u201cTell them what\u2019s afoot, Captain,\u201d he said, for the next fire was one of Whewell\u2019s assigned companies, \u201cbut wait for me there, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s afoot?\u201d Woodsworth repeated, sounding alarmed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Are we to go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, Captain. Come aside, aye? Else we\u2019ll be trampled.\u201d For they were standing in the path that led from the fires to a set of hastily dug latrine trenches; he could smell the acrid tang of ordure and quicklime from here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leading Woodsworth aside, he acquainted him with the change of commander for the morning, but assured him that this would make no real difference to the militia companies under Jamie\u2019s command; they would receive their orders in the normal way.</p><p>He thought privately that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference in how the companies operated\u2014it might well make a difference as to whether they met battle on the morrow or not, and whether they survived if they did\u2014but there was no telling whether the better odds lay with La Fayette or Lee. Chances were that sheer accident, Fate, or, just possibly, God, would decide.</p><p>\u201cNow, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cYe wished to speak wi\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Woodsworth inhaled through his nose and straightened himself, hastily retrieving the words of whatever speech he\u2019d composed. \u201cYes, sir.

Bertram?</p><p>\u201cThe man is well enough disposed for the present, sir. My wife\u2019s seen to his eye, and he\u2019s been fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Woodsworth shuffled his feet, but stood his ground. \u201cI\u2019m glad of that, sir. But what I meant\u2014I am concerned for him. There is talk about him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there is,\u201d Jamie said, not bothering to hide the edge in his voice. \u201cAnd what is your concern, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are saying\u2014the men from Dunning\u2019s company\u2014that Armstrong is a government spy, that he is a British officer who concealed himself among us. That they found a commission upon him, and correspondence. I\u2014\u201d He paused and gulped breath, the next words coming out in a rush. \u201cI cannot believe it of him, sir, nor can any of us. We feel that some mistake must have been made, and we\u2014we wish to say that we hope nothing . . . hasty will be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has suggested anything of the sort, Captain,\u201d Jamie assured him, alarm running down his spine like quicksilver. Only because they haven\u2019t had time. He\u2019d been able to ignore the thorny problem Grey presented as a prisoner, in the fierce rush of preparation and the fiercer rush of his own feelings, but he couldn\u2019t ignore it much longer. He should have notified La Fayette, Lee, and Washington of Grey\u2019s presence immediately, but had gambled on the confusion of imminent battle to disguise his delay.</p><p>His eyes had grown used to the scattered light of stars and fire; he could see Woodsworth\u2019s long face, apologetic but determined.</p><p>\u201cYes. I hesitate to speak so frankly, sir, but the sorry fact is that when men\u2019s passions run high, regrettable actions\u2014irretrievable actions\u2014may be taken.\u201d Woodsworth swallowed audibly. \u201cI should not like to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe think someone might see fit to take such action? Now?\u201d He glanced round at the encircling fires. He could see bodies moving, restless as the flames, dark shadows in the woods\u2014but he caught no sense of riot, no pulse of anger. A murmur of talk, to be sure, voices raised in excitement, bursts of laughter and even singing, but it was the nervous spirit of anticipation, expectation, not the sullen rumble of a mob.</p> <p>\u201cI am a clergyman, sir.\u201d Woodsworth\u2019s voice was stronger now, urgent. \u201cI know how men may turn to evil conversation and how quickly such conversation may turn to action. One drink too many, a careless word . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, ye\u2019re right about that,\u201d Jamie said. He cursed himself for not having thought of this possibility; he\u2019d let his own feelings cloud his mind. Of course, he\u2019d had no idea when he left Grey that he\u2019d been carrying a commission\u2014but that was no excuse. \u201cI\u2019ve sent word to General Lee about . . . Mr. Armstrong. Should ye hear any more talk about the man, ye might let it be known that the matter is in official hands. That might prevent anything . . . regrettably informal happening.\u201d</p><p>Woodsworth\u2019s sigh of relief was palpable.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, with gratitude. \u201cI shall certainly let that be known.\u201d He stepped aside, bobbing his head, but then stopped, struck by a thought. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Jamie spoke impatiently; he felt assailed from all sides by swarms of tiny, stinging troubles, and was inclined to swat this one.</p><p>\u201cI trust you will forgive my persistence, General. But I just thought\u2014the boy who was with Armstrong. Bobby Higgins, he\u2019s called.\u201d</p><p>All Jamie\u2019s senses were instantly alert.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2014I mean Armstrong\u2014the boy said he was in search of his grandfather, and Armstrong said he knew the man\u2014and that his name was James Fraser. . . .\u201d</p><p>Jamie shut his eyes. If no one lynched John Grey before dawn, he might throttle the man himself.</p><p>\u201cThe boy is indeed my grandson, Captain,\u201d he said, as evenly as he could, opening his eyes. Which means, aye, I ken bloody Bert Armstrong. And if that small bit of information became generally known, there were going to be a lot of very awkward questions asked, by people in a position to demand answers. \u201cMy wife is caring for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good. I just wished to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make known your concern. Aye, Captain. I thank ye. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Woodsworth bowed and stepped back, murmuring, \u201cGood night,\u201d in his turn, and disappeared into a night that was far from good and getting worse by the moment.</p><p>Jamie jerked his coat straight and strode on. Three hundred men to inform and command, to rouse, lead, and control. Three hundred lives in his hands.</p><p>Three hundred and bloody one.</p><p>MOSQUITOES</p><p>JAMIE WALKED INTO the light of the fire quite late, smiled at me, and sat down suddenly.</p><p>\u201cIs there food?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere is, sir,\u201d said the woman who was stirring it. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll have some, too, ma\u2019am,\u201d she added firmly, giving me a look that strongly suggested that I was not looking my very best. I wasn\u2019t disposed to care, but accepted with thanks a wooden bowl of something hot and a chunk of bread to eat it with.</p><p>I barely noticed what I ate, though I was ravenous. The day had been so filled with activity that I hadn\u2019t had time to eat\u2014would not have eaten at all, in fact, had I not brought food for John, at which point he insisted that I sit down for ten minutes and eat with him. Percy Beauchamp had not come back; that was something on the plus side of the ledger, I supposed.</p><p>There had been a couple of dozen men from Jamie\u2019s companies that I rejected by reason of disfirmity\u2014crippled, asthmatic, collapsed with age\u2014and perhaps three dozen more who were essentially sound but sporting some injury requiring attention, these mostly the result of fistfights or falling down while under the influence of drink. Several of them were still under the influence of drink and had been sent off under guard to sleep it off.</p><p>I did wonder for a moment how many men normally went into battle drunk. In all honesty, I\u2019d be strongly tempted to do it myself, were I required to do what these men were about to do.</p><p>There was still a tremendous bustle, but the earlier sense of exhilaration had transmuted into something more concentrated, more focused and sober. Preparations were being made in earnest.</p><p>I\u2019d finished my own, or hoped I had. A small tent for shelter from the blazing sun, packs of medical supplies, surgical kits, each equipped with a jar of wet sutures, a wad of lint for mopping up blood, and a bottle of dilute alcohol\u2014I\u2019d run out of salt and couldn\u2019t summon the will to badger or beg more from the commissary officer; I\u2019d try to do it in the morning. And the emergency kit that I carried over my shoulder, no matter what.</p><p>I sat close to the fire, but despite that and in spite of the warmth of the night itself, I began to feel chilled and heavy, as though I were slowly ossifying, and only then realized how tired I was. The camp hadn\u2019t gone to sleep entirely\u2014there was still talk around the fires, and the occasional rasp of a scythe or a sword being sharpened, but the volume had dropped. The atmosphere had settled with the sinking of the moon, even those souls most excited at the prospect of imminent battle succumbing to sleep.</p><p>\u201cCome and lie down,\u201d I said softly to Jamie, and rose from my seat with a muffled groan. \u201cIt won\u2019t be for long, but you need some rest\u2014and so do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, all right, but I canna be under canvas,\u201d he said, low-voiced, following me. \u201cI feel half smothered; couldna breathe in a tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, plenty of room outside,\u201d I said, nobly suppressing a twinge at the thought of sleeping on the ground. Fetching a couple of blankets, I followed him, yawning, a little way along the riverbank, until we found a private spot behind the scrim of willows that dragged their leaves in the water.</p><p>In fact, it was surprisingly comfortable; there was a thick growth of springy grass on which to spread the blankets, and, so close to the water, the air was at least moving, cool on my skin. I shucked out of my petticoats and took my stays completely off, with a blissful shiver of relief as the coolness stirred gently through my damp shift.</p><p>Jamie had stripped to his shirt and was rubbing his face and legs with mosquito ointment, the presence of hordes of these insects accounting for the lack of company near the water. I sat down beside him and helped myself to a small scoop of the mint-smelling grease. Mosquitoes seldom bit me, but that didn\u2019t stop them whining past my ears and poking inquisitively into my mouth and nostrils, which I found disconcerting in the extreme.</p><p>I lay back, watching as he finished his more thorough anointing. I could feel the distant approach of morning, but longed all the more for whatever brief oblivion I could get before the sun rose and all hell broke loose.</p><p>Jamie closed the tin and stretched out beside me with a low groan, black leaf shadows trembling over the paleness of his shirt. I rolled toward him just as he rolled toward me, and we met with a blind and groping kiss, smiling against each other\u2019s mouth, wriggling and squirming to find a good way of lying together. Warm as it was, I wanted to be touching him.</p><p>He wanted to be touching me, too.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, astonished. \u201cHow can you possibly\u2014you\u2019ve been up for hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, only the last minute or two,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sassenach. I ken ye\u2019re tired and I wouldna ask\u2014but I\u2019m desperate.\u201d He let go of my bottom long enough to pull up his shirt, and I rather resignedly started disentangling my shift from my legs.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mind if ye fall asleep while I\u2019m about my business,\u201d he said in my ear, feeling his way one-handed. \u201cI willna take long about it. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mosquitoes will bite your arse,\u201d I said, wiggling my own arse into a better position and opening my legs. \u201cHadn\u2019t I best put some\u2014oh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said, sounding pleased. \u201cWell, it\u2019s all right if ye want to stay awake, of course . . .\u201d</p><p>I pinched his buttock, hard, and he gave a small yelp, laughed, and licked my ear. The fit was a bit dry, and he fumbled for the tin of mosquito ointment.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure\u2014\u201d I began dubiously. \u201cOh!\u201d He was already applying the half-liquid ointment, with more enthusiasm than dexterity, but the fact of his enthusiasm was more arousing than skill might have been. Having a small amount of oil of peppermint vigorously applied to one\u2019s private parts was a rather novel sensation, too.</p><p>\u201cMake that noise again,\u201d he said, breathing heavily in my ear. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>He was right; it didn\u2019t take long. He lay half on and half off me, panting, his heart beating slow and hard against my breast. I had my legs wrapped round him\u2014I could feel the flutter of tiny insects on my ankles and bare feet as they swarmed, avid for his unprotected bare flesh\u2014and didn\u2019t mean to let him go. I squeezed him close, rocking gently, slippery and tingling and . . . I didn\u2019t take long, either. My quivering legs relaxed, releasing him.</p><p>\u201cShall I tell you something?\u201d I said, after a bit of mint-scented heavy breathing. \u201cThe mosquitoes won\u2019t bite your cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna mind if they carry me off to their lair to feed to their bairns,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCome here, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>I pushed damp hair out of my face and settled contentedly in the hollow of his shoulder, his arm around me. By now, I had reached that sense of accommodation with the humid atmosphere in which I stopped trying to keep track of my own body\u2019s boundaries and simply melted into sleep.</p><p>I slept without dreaming and without moving, until a touch of cramp in my left foot roused me enough to shift a little. Jamie raised his arm a bit, then replaced it as I settled again, and I became aware that he wasn\u2019t asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . all right?\u201d I murmured, thick-tongued with drowsiness.</p><p>\u201cAye, fine,\u201d he whispered, and his hand smoothed the hair from my cheek. \u201cGo back to sleep, Sassenach. I\u2019ll wake ye when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>My mouth was sticky, and it took a moment to locate any words.</p><p>\u201cYou need to sleep, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, soft but definite. \u201cNo, I dinna mean to sleep. So close to the battle . . . I have dreams. I\u2019ve had them the last three nights, and they get worse.\u201d</p><p>My own arm was lying across his midsection; at this, I reached up involuntarily, putting my hand over his heart. I knew he\u2019d dreamed\u2014and I had a very good idea what he\u2019d dreamed about, from the things he\u2019d said in his sleep. And the way he\u2019d wakened, trembling. \u201cThey get worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, and bent his head to kiss my hair. \u201cDinna fash, a nighean. I want only to lie here wi\u2019 you in my arms, to keep ye safe and watch ye sleep. I can rise then with a clear mind . . . and go to do what must be done.\u201d</p><p>WAR PAINT</p><p>\u201cNESSUN DORMA.\u201d None shall sleep. It was a song\u2014an aria, Brianna had called it\u2014from an opera she knew; she\u2019d played a part in it at her university, dressed up in Chinese robes. Ian smiled at thought of his cousin, taller than most men, striding up and down on a stage, swishing her silk robes about her; he wished he\u2019d seen that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d thought of her from the moment he\u2019d opened the little deerskin bag that held his paints. She was a painter, Bree, and a good one. She ground her own pigments, and she\u2019d made his red ochre for him, and the black and white from charcoal and dried clay\u2014and made for him, too, a deep green from ground malachite, and a brilliant yellow from the gall of the buffalo she and her mother had killed; no other man had such deep colors to his paint, and he wished for a moment that Eats Turtles and some of his other Mohawk clan brothers could be with him to admire them.</p><p>The noise of the distant camp was like the singing of cicadas in the trees near a river: a buzz too loud to think through, but one that went away as you got used to it. None shall sleep . . . The women and children, they might sleep\u2014but the whores surely didn\u2019t. Not tonight.</p><p>He felt a twitch at the thought, but dismissed it. Thought of Rachel, and dismissed her, too, but reluctantly.</p><p>He opened the willow-bark box of deer fat and anointed his face and chest and shoulders with it, slowly, focusing his mind. Normally he\u2019d speak to the spirits of the earth as he did this, and then to his own particular saints, Michael and Bride. But he wasn\u2019t seeing Michael or Bride; Brianna was still faintly with him, but what he was feeling was a strong sense of his da, which was disconcerting.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t seem respectful to be dismissing his own father. He stopped what he was doing and closed his eyes instead, waiting to see if maybe Da had a thing to tell him.</p><p>\u201cI hope ye\u2019re no bringing me word of my death, aye?\u201d he said aloud. \u201cBecause I dinna mean to die until I\u2019ve lain wi\u2019 Rachel, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s a noble goal, to be sure.\u201d The dry voice was Uncle Jamie\u2019s, and Ian\u2019s eyes popped open. His uncle was standing among the trailing fronds of a river willow, dressed in nothing but his shirt.</p><p>\u201cOut of uniform, are ye not, Uncle?\u201d he said, though his heart had leapt in his chest like a startled deer mouse. \u201cGeneral Washington willna be pleased.\u201d Washington was a great stickler for proper uniform. Officers must be dressed suitably at all times; he said the Continentals couldn\u2019t be taken seriously as an army, did they come to the field looking and acting like a rabble in arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt ye, Ian,\u201d Uncle Jamie said, stepping out from the willow. The moon was nearly down; he was nay more than a ghost, bare-legged in his floating sark. \u201cWho were ye speaking to, though?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. My da. He was just . . . there in my mind, ken? I mean, I think of him often, but it\u2019s not sae often I feel him with me. So I wondered had he come to tell me I\u2019d die this day.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, not seeming bothered at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019re putting on your paint, aye? Getting ready, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I was about to. Ye want some, too?\u201d It was only half said in jest, and Jamie took it that way.</p><p>\u201cI would, Ian. But I think General Washington might have me strung up by the thumbs and flogged, should I come before him wi\u2019 my troops all marshaled and me wi\u2019 war paint on.\u201d</p><p>Ian made a small sound of amusement and scooped two fingers into the dish of red ochre, which he began to rub on his chest.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what are ye doin\u2019 out here in your sark, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWashing,\u201d Jamie said, but in a tone indicating that that wasn\u2019t all of it. \u201cAnd . . . talkin\u2019 to my ain dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Anyone in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy uncle Dougal, and Murtagh, him who was my godfather. They\u2019re the two I\u2019d most want with me, in battle.\u201d Jamie made a small restless movement. \u201cIf I can, I make a wee moment to be alone before a fight. To wash, ken, and pray a bit, and then . . . to just ask if they\u2019ll bide with me as I go.\u201d</p><p>Ian thought this interesting; he hadn\u2019t known either man himself\u2014they\u2019d both died at Culloden\u2014but he\u2019d heard stories.</p><p>\u201cBonnie fighters,\u201d he said. \u201cDid ye ask my da, too? To go with ye, I mean. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>Jamie turned his head sharply toward Ian, surprised. Then relaxed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI never had to ask Ian M\u00f2r,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHe was always . . . just with me.\u201d He gestured briefly to the darkness on his right.</p> <p>Ian\u2019s eyes stung and his throat closed. But it was dark; it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He cleared his throat and held out one of the tiny dishes. \u201cWill ye help me, Uncle Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Aye, surely. How d\u2019ye want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed across my forehead\u2014I can do that bit. But black from the wee dots to the chin.\u201d He drew a finger across the line of tattooed dots that curved under his cheekbones. \u201cBlack\u2019s for strength, aye? It declares ye\u2019re a warrior. And yellow means ye\u2019re no afraid to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, aye. Are ye wantin\u2019 the yellow today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He let the smile show in his voice, and Jamie laughed.</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Jamie dabbed with the rabbit-foot brush, then spread the color evenly with his thumb. Ian closed his eyes, feeling strength come into him with the touch.</p><p>\u201cDo ye usually do this alone, Ian? Seems hard, save ye\u2019ve a looking glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. Or sometimes we\u2019d do it together, and a clan brother would paint ye. If it\u2019s an important thing\u2014a big raid, say, or going to make war on someone\u2014then the medicine man would paint us, and sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me ye dinna want me to sing, Ian,\u201d his uncle murmured. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d try, but . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do without, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Black for the lower face, red on the forehead, and a band of the malachite green following the line of his tattoos, from ear to ear, across the bridge of his nose.</p><p>Ian peered at the small dishes of pigment; it was easy to spot the white, and he pointed to it.</p><p>\u201cCan ye maybe draw a wee arrow, Uncle? Across my forehead.\u201d He drew a finger from left to right, showing where.</p><p>\u201cI can, aye.\u201d Jamie\u2019s head was bent over the paint dishes, hand hovering. \u201cDid ye not tell me once the white is for peace, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, should ye be going to parley or trade, ye use a good deal of white. But it\u2019s for the mourning, too\u2014so if ye go to avenge someone, ye\u2019d maybe wear white.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s head came up at that, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s no for vengeance,\u201d Ian said. \u201cIt\u2019s for Flying Arrow. The dead man whose place I took, when I was adopted.\u201d He spoke as casually as he could, but he felt his uncle tighten and look down. Neither one of them was ever going to forget that day of parting, when he\u2019d gone to the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka, and both of them had thought it was forever. He leaned over and put a hand on Jamie\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cThat day, ye said to me, \u2018Cuimhnich,\u2019 Uncle Jamie. And I did.\u201d Remember.</p><p>\u201cSo did I, Ian,\u201d Jamie said softly, and drew the arrow on his forehead, his touch like a priest\u2019s on Ash Wednesday, marking Ian with the sign of the cross. \u201cSo did we all. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>Ian touched the green stripe gingerly, to be sure it was dry enough.</p><p>\u201cAye, I think so. Ken Brianna made me the paints? I was thinking of her, but then I thought I maybe shouldna take her with me that way.\u201d</p><p>He felt Jamie\u2019s breath on his skin as his uncle gave a small snort and then sat back.</p><p>\u201cYe always carry your women wi\u2019 ye into battle, Ian \u00d2g. They\u2019re the root of your strength, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d That made sense\u2014and was a relief to him. Still . . . \u201cI was thinkin\u2019 it maybe wasna right to think of Rachel in such a place, though. Her being Quaker and all.\u201d</p><p>Jamie dipped his middle finger into the deer fat, then delicately into the white clay powder, and drew a wide, swooping \u201cV\u201d near the crest of Ian\u2019s right shoulder. Even in the dark, it showed vividly.</p><p>\u201cWhite dove,\u201d he said with a nod. He sounded pleased. \u201cThere\u2019s Rachel for ye.\u201d</p><p>He wiped his fingers on the rock, then rose and stretched. Ian saw him turn to look toward the east. It was still night, but the air had changed, just in the few minutes they\u2019d sat. His uncle\u2019s tall figure was distinct against the sky, where a little before he\u2019d seemed part of the night.</p><p>\u201cAn hour, nay more,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cEat first, aye?\u201d And, with that, turned and walked away to the stream and his own interrupted prayers.</p><p>REACHING FOR THINGS THAT AREN\u2019T THERE</p><p>WILLIAM WISHED he could stop reaching for things that weren\u2019t there. A dozen times today\u2014oftener!\u2014he\u2019d reached for the dagger that should have been on his belt. Once or twice, for one of his pistols. Slapped an impotent hand against his hip, missing his sword, missing the small, solid weight of his shot pouch, the swing of his cartridge box.</p><p>And now he lay sweating naked on his cot, hand slapped flat on his chest where he\u2019d reached without thinking for the wooden rosary. The rosary that, if he\u2019d had it, would no longer be the comfort it had been for so many years. The rosary that, if he\u2019d had it, no longer said \u201cMac\u201d to him. If he did still have it, he\u2019d have snatched it off and thrown it into the nearest fire. That\u2019s likely what James Fraser had done with it after William had thrown the rosary in the bastard\u2019s face. But, then, Fraser wasn\u2019t the bastard here, was he?</p><p>He muttered \u201cScheisse!\u201d and flung himself irritably over. Three feet away, Evans stirred and farted in his sleep, a sudden, muffled sound like distant cannon. On his other side, Merbling went on snoring.</p><p>Tomorrow. He\u2019d gone to bed late after an exhausting day and would be up in an hour, maybe, but he lay wide awake, eyes so adapted to the dark that he could see the pale blur of the tent canvas overhead. No chance of sleep, he knew. Even if he\u2019d see no action himself\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t\u2014the proximity of battle had him so keyed up that he could have leapt from bed and gone straight for the enemy right now, sword in hand.</p><p>There\u2019d be a battle. Maybe not a big one, but the Rebels were yapping at their heels, and tomorrow\u2014today\u2014there would be a meeting. It might put paid to Washington\u2019s ambitions, though Sir Henry was firm that this was not his goal. He meant to get his army and the people under its protection to New York; that was all that mattered\u2014though if his officers should choose to demonstrate their military superiority while doing so, he had no great objection.</p><p>William had stood at attention behind Sir Henry\u2019s chair at dinner, his back against the tent wall, listening attentively while the plans were drawn up. Had in fact had the honor of carrying the formal written orders to von Knyphausen, whose troops were to march to Middletown, while Clinton\u2019s brigade would form up at the rear, to engage the Rebels while my lord Cornwallis\u2019s escorted the baggage train on to safety. That\u2019s why he\u2019d been so late getting to bed.</p><p>He yawned suddenly, surprising himself, and settled back, blinking. Maybe he could sleep a bit, after all. Thinking of dinner and orders and such mundanities as the color of von Knyphausen\u2019s nightshirt\u2014it was pink silk, with purple pansies embroidered round the neck\u2014rather than the oncoming battle had calmed his mind amazingly. Distraction. That\u2019s what he needed.</p><p>Worth a try, he supposed. . . . He squirmed into the most comfortable attitude he could manage, closed his eyes, and began mentally extracting the square roots of numbers greater than one hundred.</p><p>He\u2019d got to the square root of 117 and was muzzily groping for the product of 12 and 6 when he felt the sudden stir of air on his damp skin. He sighed and opened his eyes, thinking that Merbling had got up for a piss, but it wasn\u2019t Merbling. A dark figure stood just inside the tent flap. The flap wasn\u2019t closed, and the figure was clearly visible against the faint glow from the banked campfires outside. A girl.</p><p>He sat up fast, groping one-handed for the shirt he\u2019d tossed to the foot of his cot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you doing here?\u201d he whispered, as softly as he could.</p><p>She\u2019d been hovering, uncertain. But hearing him speak, she came straight for him, and next thing he knew, her hands were on his shoulders, her hair brushing his face. He put up his own hands in reflex and found that she was in her shift, her br**sts free and warm under it, a few inches from his face.</p><p>She pulled back, and in what seemed like the same motion, skimmed the shift off over her head, shook out her hair, and straddled him, her moist round thighs pressing his.</p><p>\u201cGet off!\u201d He grabbed her by the arms, pushing her away. Merbling stopped snoring. Evans\u2019s bedclothes rustled.</p><p>William stood up, snatched up her shift and his shirt, and, taking her by the arm, marched her out of the tent, as quietly as he could.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil do you think you\u2019re doing? Here, put that on!\u201d He thrust the shift unceremoniously into her arms and hastily pulled his shirt on. They were not in full view of anyone, but might be at any moment.</p><p>Her head emerged from the shift like a flower popping out of a snowbank. A rather angry flower.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you think I was doing?\u201d she said. She pulled her hair free of the shift and fluffed it violently. \u201cI was trying to do you a kindness!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to fight tomorrow, aren\u2019t you?\u201d There was enough light to see the shine of her eyes as she glared at him. \u201cSoldiers always want to f**k before a fight! They need it.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand hard over his face, palm rasping on his sprouting whiskers, then took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI see. Yes. Very kind of you.\u201d He suddenly wanted to laugh. He also\u2014very suddenly\u2014wanted to take advantage of her offer. But not enough to do it with Merbling on one side and Evans on the other, ears flapping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight tomorrow,\u201d he said, and the pang it caused him to say that out loud startled him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not? Why not?\u201d She sounded startled, too, and more than a little disapproving. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story,\u201d he said, struggling for patience. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not your business. Now, look. I appreciate the thought, but I told you: you\u2019re not a whore, at least not for the time being. And you\u2019re not my whore.\u201d Though his imagination was busy with images of what might have happened had she stolen into his cot and taken hold of him before he was fully awake . . . He put the thought firmly aside and, taking her by the shoulders, turned her round.</p><p>\u201cGo back to your own bed now,\u201d he said, but couldn\u2019t stop himself from patting her very nice arse in farewell. She turned her head and glared at him over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCoward!\u201d she said. \u201cA man that won\u2019t f**k won\u2019t fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d For an instant, he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d really said it, but she had.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me. Good\u2014fucking\u2014night!\u201d</p><p>He reached her in two strides, seized her shoulder, and whirled her round to face him.</p><p>\u201cAnd who gave you that bit of wisdom, may I ask? Your good friend Captain Harkness?\u201d He wasn\u2019t truly angry, but the shock of her unexpected arrival was still reverberating in his blood and he was annoyed. \u201cDid I save you from buggery so you could throw my circumstances in my face?\u201d</p><p>Her chin drew back, and she breathed hard, but not in apparent distress.</p><p>\u201cWhat circumstances?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI told you\u2014bloody hell. Do you know what the Convention army is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the long story, and I\u2019m not telling you it standing in my shirt in the middle of camp. Now, bugger off and take care of your sister and the lads. That\u2019s your job; I\u2019ll take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled sharply, with a puh! sound.</p><p>\u201cDoubtless you will,\u201d she said, with the maximum of sarcasm and a pointed glance at his cock, which was poking absurdly at his shirt, making its own urgent preferences known.</p><p>\u201cScheisse,\u201d he said again, briefly, then grabbed her in a bear hug that pressed her body against his all the way down and kissed her. She struggled, but after the first moment he realized that the struggle was not meant to procure her release but to provoke him further. He tightened his grip until she stopped, but didn\u2019t quit kissing her for some time thereafter.</p> <p>He finally let go, panting and bedewed with perspiration; the air was like breathing hot tar. She was panting, too. He could take her. Wanted to. Push her down on her knees in the grass beside the tent, pull up her shift, and have her from behind\u2014it wouldn\u2019t take more than seconds.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand. \u201cNo,\u201d he said again, more positively. Every nerve in his body wanted her, and had he been sixteen, it would have been long over by this time. But he wasn\u2019t, and he had just enough self-control to turn her round again. He gripped her by scruff and buttock to keep her from turning back and held her immobile.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get to New York,\u201d he whispered, bending to speak in her ear, \u201cI\u2019ll think again.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, her buttock rounding hard in his hand, but didn\u2019t pull away or try to bite him, which he\u2019d half-expected.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she said, in a calm voice.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long story, too,\u201d he said. \u201cGood night, Jane.\u201d And, releasing her, stalked away into the dark. Nearby, the drums of reveille began.</p><p>PART FOUR</p><p>Day of Battle</p> <p>GO OUT IN DARKNESS</p><p>IAN HAD BEEN OVER the land briefly the day before, scouting. \u201cAnd a good thing, too,\u201d he said, under his breath. It was the dark of the moon, and he must go canny and keep the road. He wasn\u2019t risking his horse\u2019s legs over the rough land before he had to, and Bride grant him the sky would be fully light by then.</p><p>Still, he was glad of the dark, and the solitude. Not that the land was still; the woods lived at night, and many things came out in the strange dawn hour when the light began to swell. But neither the rustle of hares and voles nor the sleepy call of waking birds demanded his notice or took any notice of him. He had finished his own prayers after Uncle Jamie left him, then departed alone in silence, and the peace of his preparations was still on him.</p><p>When he had lived with the Mohawk\u2014particularly when things had gone wrong with Emily\u2014he would leave the longhouse for days, hunting alone with Rollo, until the wilderness had eased his spirit enough to go back, strengthened. He glanced down by reflex, but Rollo had been left behind with Rachel. The wound from the deadfall trap was clean; Auntie Claire had put something on it that helped\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t have let Rollo come to a battle like this one offered to be, even had he been whole and a good deal younger than he was.</p><p>There was no doubt of the coming battle. He could smell it. His body was rising toward the fight; he could feel the tingling of it\u2014but he treasured this momentary stillness the more for that.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t last long, mind,\u201d he said softly to the horse, who ignored him. He touched the white dove on his shoulder and rode on, still quiet but not alone.</p><p>THE MEN HAD lain on their arms all night, by Sir Henry\u2019s orders. While one didn\u2019t actually lie on a musket and cartridge box, there was something about sleeping with a gun touching your body that kept you alert, ready to rouse from sleep in nothing flat.</p><p>William had no arms to lie on, and hadn\u2019t needed rousing, as he hadn\u2019t slept, but was no less alert for the lack. He wouldn\u2019t be fighting, and deeply regretted that\u2014but he would be out in it, by God.</p><p>The camp was a-bustle, drums rattling up and down the aisles of tents, summoning the soldiers, and the air was full of the smells of baking bread, pork, and hot pease porridge.</p><p>There was no visible sign of dawn yet, but he could feel the sun there, just below the horizon, rising with the slow inevitability of its daily dominion. The thought reminded him, vividly, of the whale he had seen on the voyage to America: a dark shadow below the ship\u2019s side, easily dismissed as the change of light on the waves\u2014and then, slowly, the growing bulk, the realization and the breathless wonder of seeing it rise, so close, so huge\u2014and suddenly there.</p><p>He fastened his garters and tugged them tight before buckling his knee bands and pulling on his Hessian boots. At least he had his gorget back, to lend a touch of ceremony to the mundane task of getting dressed. The gorget, of course, reminded him of Jane\u2014was he ever going to be able to wear it without thinking of the damned girl?\u2014and of recent events.</p><p>He\u2019d regretted not accepting her offer, and still did. He could still smell her scent, musky and soft, like putting his face in thick fur. Her remark still rankled, too, and he snorted, settling his coat on his shoulders. Perhaps he\u2019d think again before they reached New York.</p><p>These idle thoughts were interrupted by the appearance of another of Sir Henry\u2019s aides, Captain Crosbie, who popped his head through the tent flap, clearly in a great flurry.</p><p>\u201cOh, there you are, Ellesmere. Hoped I\u2019d catch you\u2014here.\u201d He tossed a folded note in William\u2019s general direction and vanished.</p><p>William snorted again and picked it up off the ground. Evans and Merbling had both left, they having actual troops to inspect and command; he envied them bitterly.</p><p>It was from General Sir Henry Clinton, and hit him in the stomach like a blow: . . . in view of your peculiar status, I think it best that you remain with the clerical staff today . . .</p><p>\u201cStercus!\u201d he said, finding German insufficient to his feelings. \u201cExcrementum obscaenum! Filius mulieris prostabilis!\u201d</p><p>His chest was tight, blood was pounding in his ears, and he wanted to hit something. It would be useless to appeal to Sir Henry, he knew that much. But to spend the day essentially kicking his heels in the clerks\u2019 tent\u2014for what was there for him to do, if he wasn\u2019t allowed to carry dispatches or even do the lowly but necessary work of shepherding the camp followers and Loyalists? What\u2014was he to fetch the clerks\u2019 dinner in, or hold a torch in each hand when it got dark, like a f**king candelabra?</p><p>He was about to crumple the note into a wad, when yet another unwelcome head intruded itself, followed by an elegant body: Captain Andr\u00e9, dressed for battle, sword at his side and pistols in his belt. William eyed him with dislike, though in fact he was an amiable fellow.</p><p>\u201cOh, there you are, Ellesmere,\u201d Andr\u00e9 said, pleased. \u201cHoped you hadn\u2019t gone off yet. I need you to run me a dispatch, quickly. To Colonel Tarleton\u2014with the British Legion, the new Provincials, green chaps\u2014you know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yes.\u201d William accepted the sealed dispatch, feeling odd. \u201cCertainly, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood man.\u201d Andr\u00e9 smiled and squeezed his shoulder, then strode out, ebullient with the promise of imminent action.</p><p>William drew a deep breath, carefully folded Sir Henry\u2019s note back into its original shape, and placed it on his cot. Who was to say that he hadn\u2019t met Andr\u00e9 first and, owing to the urgency of his request, left immediately, without reading Sir Henry\u2019s note?</p><p>He doubted he\u2019d be missed, in any case.</p><p>SPARROW-FART</p><p>IT WAS PERHAPS four o\u2019clock ack emma. Or before sparrow-fart, as the British armed forces of my own time used to put it. That sense of temporal dislocation was back again, memories of another war coming like a sudden fog between me and my work, then disappearing in an instant, leaving the present sharp and vivid as Kodachrome. The army was moving.</p><p>No fog obscured Jamie. He was big and solid, his outlines clearly visible against the shredding night. I was awake and alert, dressed and ready, but the chill of sleep still lay upon me, making my fingers clumsy. I could feel his warmth and drew close to him, as I might to a campfire. He was leading Clarence, who was even warmer, though much less alert, ears sagging in sleepy annoyance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have Clarence,\u201d Jamie told me, putting the mule\u2019s reins in my hand. \u201cAnd these, to make sure ye keep him, if ye should find yourself on your own.\u201d \u201cThese\u201d were a heavy pair of horse pistols, holstered and strung on a thick leather belt that also held a shot bag and powder horn.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, swallowing as I wrapped the reins around a sapling in order to belt the pistols on. The guns were amazingly heavy\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t deny that the weight of them on my hips was amazingly comforting, too.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, glancing toward the tent where John was. \u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen to that,\u201d he said, cutting me off. \u201cGather the rest of your things, Sassenach; I\u2019ve nay more than a quarter hour, at most, and I need ye with me when we go.\u201d</p><p>I watched him stride off into the m\u00eal\u00e9e, tall and resolute, and wondered\u2014as I had so often before\u2014Will it be today? Will this be the last sight I remember of him? I stood very still, watching as hard as I could.</p><p>When I\u2019d lost him the first time, before Culloden, I\u2019d remembered. Every moment of our last night together. Tiny things would come back to me through the years: the taste of salt on his temple and the curve of his skull as I cupped his head; the soft fine hair at the base of his neck, thick and damp in my fingers . . . the sudden, magical well of his blood in dawning light when I\u2019d cut his hand and marked him forever as my own. Those things had kept him by me.</p><p>And when I\u2019d lost him this time, to the sea, I\u2019d remembered the sense of him beside me, warm and solid in my bed, and the rhythm of his breathing. The light across the bones of his face in moonlight and the flush of his skin in the rising sun. I could hear him breathe when I lay in bed alone in my room at Chestnut Street\u2014slow, regular, never stopping\u2014even though I knew it had stopped. The sound would comfort me, then drive me mad with the knowledge of loss, so I pulled the pillow hard over my head in a futile attempt to shut it out\u2014only to emerge into the night of the room, thick with woodsmoke and candle wax and vanished light, and be comforted to hear it once more.</p><p>If this time\u2014but he had turned, quite suddenly, as though I\u2019d called his name. He came swiftly up to me, grasped me by the arms, and said in a low, strong voice, \u201cIt willna be today, either.\u201d</p><p>Then he put his arms around me and drew me up on tiptoe into a deep, soft kiss. I heard brief cheers from a few of the men nearby, but it didn\u2019t matter. Even if it should be today, I would remember.</p><p>JAMIE STRODE toward his waiting companies, loosely assembled near the river. The breath of the water and the mist rising from it comforted him, keeping him wrapped for a little while longer in the peace of the night and the deep sense of his kin, there at his shoulder. He\u2019d told Ian M\u00f2r to stay with Ian \u00d2g, as was right, but had the odd sense that there were three men with him, still.</p><p>He\u2019d need the strength of his dead. Three hundred men, and he\u2019d known them for only days. Always before, when he\u2019d taken men into battle, they were men of his blood, of his clan, men who knew him, trusted him\u2014as he knew and trusted them. These men were strangers to him, and yet their lives were in his hands.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t worried by their lack of training; they were rough and undisciplined, a mere rabble by contrast with the Continental regulars who\u2019d drilled all winter under von Steuben\u2014the thought of the little barrel-shaped Prussian made him smile\u2014but his troops had always been this kind of men: farmers and hunters, pulled from their daily occupations, armed with scythes and hoes as often as with muskets or swords. They\u2019d fight like fiends for him\u2014with him\u2014if they trusted him.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, then, Reverend?\u201d he said softly to the minister, who had just blessed his flock of volunteers and was hunched among them in his black coat, arms still half spread like a scarecrow protecting his misty field at dawn. The man\u2019s face, always rather stern in aspect, lightened upon seeing him, and he realized that the sky itself had begun to glow.</p><p>\u201cAll well, sir,\u201d Woodsworth said gruffly. \u201cWe are ready.\u201d He didn\u2019t, thank God, mention Bertram Armstrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Jamie, smiling from face to face, and seeing them all lighten in turn as the dawn touched them. \u201cMr. Whelan, Mr. Maddox, Mr. Hebden\u2014ye\u2019re all well in yourselves this morning, I hope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d they murmured, looking shyly gratified that he knew their names. He wished he knew them all, but had had to do the best he could, learning the names and faces of a handful of men in each company. It might give them the illusion that he did know every man by name\u2014he hoped so; they needed to know he cared for them.</p><p>\u201cReady, sir.\u201d It was Captain Craddock, one of his three captains, stiff and self-conscious with the importance of the occasion, and Judah Bixby and Lewis Orden, two of Jamie\u2019s lieutenants, behind him. Bixby was no more than twenty, Orden maybe a year older; they could barely repress their excitement, and he smiled at them, feeling their joy in their young manhood echo in his own blood.</p><p>There were some very young men among the militia, he noticed. A couple of half-grown boys, tall and spindly as cornstalks\u2014who were they? Oh, yes, Craddock\u2019s sons. He remembered now; their mother had died only a month ago, and so they had come with their father into the militia.</p> <p>God, let me bring them back safe! he prayed.</p><p>And felt\u2014actually felt\u2014a hand rest briefly on his shoulder, and knew who the third man was who walked with him.</p><p>Taing, Da, he thought, and blinked, raising his face so the tears in his eyes might be thought due to the brightness of the growing light.</p><p>I TIED CLARENCE to a picquet and made my way back into the tent, less troubled, though still keyed up. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen fast, and likely with little warning. Fergus and Germain had gone to find breakfast; I hoped they would show up before I had to leave\u2014because when the time came, I would have to leave, no matter my reservations about abandoning a patient. Any patient.</p><p>This particular patient was lying on his back, under the lantern, his working eye half closed, singing to himself in German. He desisted when I came in, and turned his head to see who it was, blinking at sight of my armament.</p> <p>\u201cAre we expecting imminent invasion and capture?\u201d he asked, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cLie back down. No, this is Jamie being provident.\u201d I touched one of the pistols gingerly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re loaded yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly they are. The man is nothing if not thorough.\u201d He eased himself back down, groaning slightly.</p><p>\u201cYou think you know him awfully well, don\u2019t you?\u201d I asked, with an edge that rather surprised me.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he answered promptly. He smiled slightly at my expression. \u201cNot nearly as well as you do in some matters, I\u2019m sure\u2014but perhaps better in others. We are both soldiers.\u201d He tilted his head, indicating the military racket going on outside.</p><p>\u201cIf you know him that well,\u201d I said, nettled, \u201cyou should have known better than to say whatever you did say to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d The smile disappeared and he looked up at the canvas overhead in contemplation. \u201cI did. Know better. I just said it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d I replied, and sat down next to the pile of bags and supplies that had made it thus far. Much of this would have to be abandoned. I could take a good deal in Clarence\u2019s packs and saddlebags, but not everything. The army had been instructed to abandon almost everything they carried, save weapons and canteens, in the interests of speed.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you what it was?\u201d John asked after a moment, his voice elaborately casual.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said? No, but I could very likely guess.\u201d I compressed my lips and didn\u2019t look at him, instead lining up bottles on top of a chest. I\u2019d got salt from the innkeeper\u2014not without trouble\u2014and had made up a couple of bottles of crude saline solution, and there was the alcohol . . . I picked up the candle and began to dribble wax carefully over the corks, lest they loosen and the bottles discharge their contents along the way.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to pursue the history of John\u2019s eye any further. Other considerations aside, any discussion might lead a little too close to Wentworth Prison for comfort. However close a friend Jamie might have considered John during the last few years, I was positive that he\u2019d never told John about Black Jack Randall and what had happened at Wentworth. He\u2019d told his brother-in-law Ian, many years ago\u2014and therefore Jenny must know, too, though I doubted she\u2019d ever spoken of it to Jamie\u2014but no one else.</p><p>John would likely assume that Jamie had hit him purely from revulsion at something overtly sexual from John\u2014or from jealousy over me. It was perhaps not quite fair to let him think that\u2014but fairness didn\u2019t come into it.</p><p>Still, I regretted the trouble between them. Beyond whatever personal awkwardness I found in the present situation, I knew how much John\u2019s friendship had meant to Jamie\u2014and vice versa. And while I was more than relieved not to be married to John anymore, I did care for him.</p><p>And\u2014while the noise and movement all around urged me to forget everything else but the urgency of departure\u2014I couldn\u2019t forget that this might be the last time I ever saw John, too.</p> <p>I sighed and began to wrap the waxed bottles in towels. I should add whatever I could find room for from my Kingsessing haul, but . . .</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be troubled, my dear,\u201d John said gently. \u201cYou know it will all come right\u2014provided that we all live long enough.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a marked look and nodded toward the tent flap, where the clatter and clash of a military camp on the verge of movement was escalating.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll likely survive,\u201d I said. \u201cUnless you say the wrong thing to Jamie before we leave and he really does break your neck this time.\u201d</p><p>He glanced\u2014as briefly as possible\u2014toward the pale shaft of dust-filled light, and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had to do it, have you?\u201d I said, seeing his face. \u201cSit and wait through a battle, wondering if someone you care for will come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with regard to anyone other than myself, no,\u201d he replied, but I could see that the remark had gone home. He hadn\u2019t thought of that, and he didn\u2019t like the thought one bit. Welcome to the club, I thought sardonically.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll catch Clinton?\u201d I asked, after a moment\u2019s silence. He shrugged, almost irritably.</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? I haven\u2019t the slightest idea where Clinton\u2019s troops are\u2014I have no idea where Washington is, or where we are, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral Washington would be about thirty yards that way,\u201d I said, picking up a basket of bandages and lint, and nodding toward where I\u2019d last seen the commander. \u201cAnd I would be surprised if General Clinton is very much farther off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And why is that, madam?\u201d he asked, now half amused.</p><p>\u201cBecause the order came down an hour ago to jettison all unnecessary supplies\u2014though I don\u2019t know if he actually said \u2018jettison,\u2019 come to think; that may not be a word in common use now. That\u2019s why we were inspecting the men, when we found you\u2014to leave back any who aren\u2019t capable of a long forced march on short rations, should that be necessary. Apparently it is.</p><p>\u201cBut you know what\u2019s happening,\u201d I added, watching him. \u201cI can hear it. You surely can.\u201d Anyone with ears or eyes could sense the nervous excitement in camp, see the hasty preparations being made, the small fights and outbreaks of cursing as men got in each other\u2019s way, the bawling of officers, only a hair short of eye-rolling, horn-tossing violence, the braying of mules\u2014I hoped no one would steal Clarence before I got back to him.</p><p>John nodded, silent. I could see him turning the situation over in his mind, along with the obvious implications.</p><p>\u201cYes, \u2018jettison\u2019 is certainly a word in common use,\u201d he said absently. \u201cThough you hear it more in terms of sea cargo. But\u2014\u201d He jerked a little, realizing the further implications of what I\u2019d said, and stared hard at me with his uncovered eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt the other one. And what I am or am not isn\u2019t important just now, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered, and shut the eye for a moment, then opened it, staring upward at the canvas overhead. Dawn was coming; the yellowed canvas was beginning to glow, and the air around us was thick with dust and the odor of dried sweat.</p><p>\u201cI know very little that would be of interest to General Washington,\u201d he said, \u201cand I would be surprised if he didn\u2019t know that little already. I am not a serving officer\u2014or . . . well, I wasn\u2019t, until my bloody brother decided to reenter me on the rolls of his bloody regiment. Do you know, he nearly got me hanged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it sounds extremely like him,\u201d I said, laughing despite my disquiet.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you\u2014oh, God. You\u2019ve met Hal?\u201d He\u2019d reared up on one elbow, blinking at me.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d I assured him. \u201cLie down, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d Neither of us was going anywhere for a few minutes at least, and I was able to give him the entire story of my adventures with Hal in Philadelphia, while I wound up bandages, put my medical box in good order, and extracted what I thought the most important items from the supplies I\u2019d brought. In an emergency, I might be reduced to what I could carry on my back at a dead run, and I made up a small rucksack with that contingency in mind, whilst regaling John with my opinions of his brother.</p><p>\u201cJesus, if he thinks he\u2019s a chance in hell of preventing Dorothea from marrying Dr. Hunter . . . I believe I\u2019d pay good money to overhear the conversation when he meets Denzell,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWho would you bet on\u2014given that Hal hasn\u2019t got a regiment at his back to enforce his opinions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likely has met him by now. As to odds\u2014Denzell, three to two,\u201d I said, after a moment\u2019s consideration. \u201cHe\u2019s got not only God but love\u2014and Dorothea\u2014on his side, and I do think that will outweigh even Hal\u2019s brand of . . . of . . . autocratic conviction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d call it undiluted bastardliness, myself, but, then, I\u2019m his brother. I\u2019m allowed liberties.\u201d</p><p>The sound of voices speaking French announced the arrival of Fergus and Germain, and I stood up abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI may not\u2014\u201d I began, but he raised a hand, stopping me.</p><p>\u201cIf not, then goodbye, my dear,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd good luck.\u201d</p><p>A SINGLE LOUSE</p><p>IT WAS BARELY AN hour past dawn and it would doubtless be another beastly hot day, but for the moment the air was still fresh and both William and Goth were happy. He threaded his way through the boiling mass of men, horses, limbers, and the other impedimenta of war, quietly whistling \u201cThe King Enjoys His Own Again.\u201d</p><p>The baggage wagons were already being readied; a great dust cloud rose, roiling and shot through with gold from the rising sun, from the teamsters\u2019 park near von Knyphausen\u2019s division, encamped a quarter mile away, on the other side of Middletown. They\u2019d be off directly, heading for Sandy Hook\u2014and Jane, Fanny, Zeb, and Colenso with them, he sincerely hoped. A brief sensory recollection of the skin inside Jane\u2019s thighs sparked through his mind and he stopped whistling for an instant, but then shook it out of his head. Work to be done!</p><p>No one quite knew where the new British Legion was, though it was assumed to be somewhere in the vicinity of Clinton\u2019s division, it being one of his personal regiments, raised only a month ago in New York. That might be chancy, but William was quite willing to wager that he could evade Sir Henry\u2019s notice, under the conditions.</p><p>\u201cLike picking one louse out of a Frenchie\u2019s wig,\u201d he murmured, and patted Goth\u2019s neck. The horse was fresh and frisky, couldn\u2019t wait to reach the open road and break into a gallop. Clinton\u2019s division was holding the rear guard at Middletown\u2014enough distance to take the edge off Goth\u2019s bounciness. First, though, they\u2019d have to get through the spreading mass of camp followers, struggling out of sleep into a desperate haste. He kept Goth on a short rein, lest he trample a child\u2014there were dozens of the little buggers, swarming over the ground like locusts.</p><p>Glancing up from the ground, he caught sight of a familiar form, standing in line for bread, and his heart gave a small leap of pleasure. Anne Endicott, dressed for day but without her cap, dark hair in a thick plait down her back. The sight of it gave him a frisson of intimacy, and he barely stopped himself calling out to her. Time enough, after the fight.</p><p>FOLIE \u00c0 TROIS</p><p>FERGUS HAD BROUGHT me a sausage roll and a cannikin of coffee\u2014real coffee, for a wonder.</p><p>\u201cMilord will send for you shortly,\u201d he said, handing these over.</p><p>\u201cIs he nearly ready?\u201d The food was warm and fresh\u2014and I knew it might be the last I got for some time\u2014but I barely tasted it. \u201cHave I time to dress Lord John\u2019s eye again?\u201d The pervading air of haste was clearly perceptible to me, and my skin had started twitching as though I were being attacked by ants.</p><p>\u201cI will go and see, milady. Germain?\u201d Fergus tilted his head toward the tent flap, beckoning Germain to go with him.</p><p>But Germain, out of what might have been either loyalty to John or fear of finding himself alone with Jamie\u2014who had rather plainly meant what he said regarding the future of Germain\u2019s arse\u2014wanted to stay in the tent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d John assured him. \u201cGo with your father.\u201d He was still pale and sweating, but his jaw and hands had relaxed; he wasn\u2019t in severe pain.</p><p>\u201cYes, he will be fine,\u201d I said to Germain, but nodded to Fergus, who went out without further comment. \u201cFetch me some fresh lint, will you? Then you can come and help me while his lordship rests. As for you\u2014\u201d I turned to John. \u201cYou lie flat, keep your eye closed, and bloody stay out of trouble, if such a thing is possible.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He swiveled his good eye in my direction, wincing slightly as the movement pulled on the bad one.</p><p>\u201cAre you accusing me of causing the imbroglio that resulted in my injury, madam? Because I distinctly recall your playing some minor role in its origins.\u201d He sounded rather cross.</p><p>\u201cI had nothing whatever to do with your ending up here,\u201d I said firmly, though I could feel my cheeks flush. \u201cGermain, have you found the lint?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the honey not draw flies, Grannie?\u201d Germain handed me the requested lint but stood by the cot, frowning down at its occupant. \u201cKen what they say, aye? Ye catch more flies wi\u2019 honey than ye do wi\u2019 vinegar. Ye couldna pour vinegar on him, I suppose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d He had a point. We were no great distance from the teamsters; I could hear mules snorting and braying, and newly wakened flies, still heavy with sleep, had been buzzing round my ears even as I unwrapped the old bandage. \u201cRight. Not vinegar, but mint might help. Find the tin with the fleur-de-lis, then, and rub ointment on his lordship\u2019s face and hands\u2014don\u2019t get it in his eyes. Then bring the small box\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certainly capable of rubbing ointment on myself,\u201d John interrupted, and extended a hand to Germain. \u201cHere, give it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie still,\u201d I said, rather cross myself. \u201cAs for what you\u2019re capable of, I shudder to think.\u201d I had set a small dish of honey to warm near the lantern; I filled my syringe and injected the honey around his bad eye, made a small pad of lint, thumbed it gently into his eye socket, and bound a clean length of gauze round his head to hold it in place, thinking as I did so.</p><p>\u201cGermain . . . go and fill the canteen, will you?\u201d It was half full already, but he obligingly took it and went, leaving me alone with John.</p><p>\u201cShall I leave Germain with you?\u201d I asked, stuffing the last few items into my first-aid kit. \u201cAnd Fergus?\u201d I added hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, slightly startled. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . protection. In case Monsieur Beauchamp should come back, I mean.\u201d I didn\u2019t trust Percy in the slightest. I was also dubious about putting Fergus in close proximity to him, but it had occurred to me that perhaps John might be some protection to him.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He closed his good eye for a moment, then opened it again. \u201cNow, that imbroglio is indeed of my own making,\u201d he said ruefully. \u201cBut while Germain is admittedly a formidable presence, I shan\u2019t need a bodyguard. I rather doubt that Percy intends either to assault or to kidnap me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you . . . care for him?\u201d I asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cIs it your business if I do?\u201d he replied evenly.</p><p>I flushed more deeply, but took a few breaths before answering.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said at last. \u201cYes, I rather think it is. Whatever my role in the origins of this . . . this . . . er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cFolie \u00e0 trois?\u201d he suggested, and I laughed. I\u2019d told him what a folie \u00e0 deux was, with reference to Mrs. Figg\u2019s and the laundress\u2019s shared obsession with starched drawers.</p><p>\u201cThat will do. But, yes, it is my business\u2014on Jamie\u2019s behalf, if not yours.\u201d But it was on his behalf, as well. The shock and rush of recent events had prevented my thinking through the situation, but I was quite sure that Jamie had. And now that I was thoroughly awake and undistracted by my own affairs, my thoughts were catching up with uncomfortable rapidity.</p><p>\u201cDo you recall a Captain Andr\u00e9?\u201d I asked abruptly. \u201cJohn Andr\u00e9. He was at the Mischianza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may have lost a few things over the course of the last few days,\u201d he said, with some acerbity, \u201cbut neither my memory nor my wits. Yet,\u201d he added, in a marked manner. \u201cOf course I know him. A very sociable and artistic young man; he was invited everywhere in Philadelphia. He\u2019s on General Clinton\u2019s staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that he\u2019s also a spy?\u201d My heart was thumping in my ears, and my stays felt suddenly too tight. Was I about to do something hideously irrevocable?</p><p>He blinked, obviously startled.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why on earth should you think that?\u201d And, a half second later, \u201cAnd why the devil would you tell me about it, if you do think so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause,\u201d I said, as evenly as I could, \u201che\u2019ll be caught doing it, in another year or two. He\u2019ll be found behind the American lines, in civilian clothes, with incriminating documents on his person. And the Americans will hang him.\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the air between us, visible as though they were written in black smoke. John opened his mouth, then shut it again, clearly nonplussed.</p><p>I could hear all the sounds of the camp around us: talk, occasional shouting, and the sounds of horses and mules, the beat of a drum in the distance, summoning men to . . . what? Someone at close range practicing a fife, the shrill note breaking in the same place each time. The constant rumble and shriek of the grinding wheel, frenziedly sharpening metal for the last time. And the increasing buzz of flies.</p><p>They were drifting into the tent in small clouds of carnivory; two of them landed on John\u2019s forehead, to be irritably brushed away. The tin of bug repellent lay on the cot where Germain had put it down; I reached for it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rather sharply, and took it from my hand. \u201cI can\u2014I\u2014don\u2019t touch me, if you please.\u201d His hand trembled, and he had a moment\u2019s difficulty in getting the lid off, but I didn\u2019t help him. I\u2019d gone cold to the fingertips, in spite of the stifling atmosphere in the tent.</p><p>He\u2019d surrendered to Jamie personally, given his parole. It would be Jamie who would eventually have to hand him over to General Washington. Would have to; too many people had seen the incident, knew where John was\u2014and, by this time, what he was.</p><p>John didn\u2019t sit up, but managed to thumb a glob of the mentholated grease from the tin and rub it on his face and neck.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have anything in your clothes,\u201d I ventured, with a faint hope. \u201cNo incriminating documents, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my warrant of commission in my pocket when the Rebel militia took me, outside Philadelphia,\u201d he said, but spoke in an abstract tone, as though it didn\u2019t really matter. He rubbed ointment briskly over his hands and wrists. \u201cNot proof of spying in itself\u2014but certainly proof that I was a British officer, out of uniform and arguably behind the American lines at the time. Don\u2019t talk anymore, my dear; it\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He snapped the lid onto the tin and held it out to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better go,\u201d he said, looking me in the eye and speaking in a low voice. \u201cYou must not be found alone with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrannie?\u201d Germain pushed back the tent flap, red as a beet under his shaggy bangs. \u201cGrannie! Come quick! Papa says Grand-p\u00e8re wants you!\u201d</p><p>He disappeared and I hastily snatched up my equipment, bedizening myself with bags and boxes. I made for the tent flap, but paused for an instant, turning to John.</p><p>\u201cI should have asked\u2014does he care for you?\u201d I said.</p><p>He shut his good eye and his lips compressed for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI hope not,\u201d he said.</p><p>I HURRIED AFTER Germain with my medical satchel full of gurgling bottles slung over my shoulder, a small box of extra instruments and sutures under my arm, Clarence\u2019s reins in hand, and a mind so agitated I could hardly see where I was going.</p><p>I realized now that I hadn\u2019t been telling John anything he didn\u2019t know. Well . . . bar the account of Captain Andr\u00e9\u2019s future fate, and while that was chilling enough, it wasn\u2019t of direct importance at the moment.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped me speaking, because he\u2019d already known how much danger he stood in\u2014and what the effects were likely to be on Jamie, and on me. \u201cYou must not be found alone with me.\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019d been at one point his wife, he meant. That\u2019s what he\u2019d been thinking but hadn\u2019t wanted to tell me, until I forced the issue.</p><p>If anything happened\u2014well, be blunt about it: if he broke his parole and escaped\u2014I\u2019d very likely be suspected of having a hand in it, but the suspicion would be a great deal more pronounced if anyone could testify to having seen us in private conversation. And Jamie would be suspected of complicity at worst, or, at best, of having a wife who was disloyal both to him and to the cause of independence. . . . I could easily end up in a military prison. So might Jamie.</p><p>But if John didn\u2019t escape . . . or escaped and was recaptured . . .</p><p>But the road lay before me, and Jamie was there on his horse, holding the reins of my mare. And it was Jamie with whom I\u2019d cross the Rubicon today\u2014not John.</p><p>THE MARQUIS de La Fayette was waiting for them at the rendezvous, face flushed and eyes bright with anticipation. Jamie couldn\u2019t help smiling at sight of the young Frenchman, got up regardless in a glorious uniform with red silk facings. He wasn\u2019t inexperienced, though, despite his youth and his very obvious Frenchness. He\u2019d told Jamie about the battle at Brandywine Creek a year before, where he\u2019d been wounded in the leg, and how Washington had insisted that he lie beside him and wrapped him in his own cloak. Gilbert idolized Washington, who had no sons of his own, and who clearly felt a deep affection for the wee marquis.</p><p>Jamie glanced at Claire, to see if she was appreciating La Fayette\u2019s stylish toilette, but her gaze was fixed\u2014with a small frown\u2014on a group of men in the far distance, beyond the Continental regulars drawn up in orderly formations. She wasn\u2019t wearing her spectacles; he could see easily at a distance and half-stood in his stirrups to look.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Washington and Charles Lee,\u201d he told her, sitting back in the saddle. La Fayette, spotting them, as well, swung himself into his own saddle and rode toward the senior officers. \u201cI suppose I\u2019d best go join them. D\u2019ye see Denzell Hunter yet?\u201d He had it in mind to confide Claire to Hunter\u2019s care; he didn\u2019t mean her to be wandering the battlefield\u2014if there was one\u2014on her own, no matter how helpful she might be there, and was wary of leaving her alone.</p><p>Hunter was driving his wagon, though, and that couldn\u2019t keep up with the marching men. Clouds of dust rose in the air, stirred by thousands of eager feet; it tickled in his chest, and he coughed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d And she smiled at him, brave, though her face was pale despite the heat, and he could feel the flutter of her fear in his own wame. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d She always looked at him in that searching way when he set out to a fight, as though committing his face to memory in case he was killed. He kent why she did it, but it made him feel strange\u2014and he was already unsettled this morning.</p><p>\u201cAye, fine,\u201d he said, and taking her hand, kissed it. He should have spurred up and gone, but lingered for a moment, loath to let go.</p><p>\u201cDid you\u2014\u201d she began, and then stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cPut on clean drawers? Aye, though it\u2019s like to be wasted effort, ken, when the guns start firin\u2019.\u201d It was a feeble enough jest, but she laughed, and he felt better.</p><p>\u201cDid I what?\u201d he prompted, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. You don\u2019t need anything else to think of now. Just\u2014be careful, will you?\u201d She swallowed visibly, and his heart turned over.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, and took up the reins but looked back over his shoulder, in case Young Ian should be coming. She was safe enough, in the midst of the forming companies, but he\u2019d still be happier with someone to look after her. And if he told her that, she\u2019d likely\u2014</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Ian!\u201d she exclaimed, squinting to see. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with his horse, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>He looked where she was looking and saw the cause at once. His nephew was afoot, leading the halting horse, and both of them were looking crankit.</p><p>\u201cLame,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd badly lamed, too. What\u2019s amiss, Ian?\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cStepped on summat sharp, coming up the bank, and cracked his hoof, right down into the quick.\u201d Ian ran a hand down the horse\u2019s leg and the animal all but leaned on him, picking up its unshod hoof at once. Sure enough, the crack was visible, and deep enough to make Jamie wince in sympathy. Like having a toenail torn off, he supposed, and having to walk a distance with it.</p><p>\u201cTake my horse, Ian,\u201d Claire said, and slid off in a flurry of petticoats. \u201cI can ride Clarence. No need for me to be fast, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, all right,\u201d Jamie said, though a bit reluctant. Her mare was a good one, and Ian had to have a mount. \u201cShift the saddles, then, and, Ian, watch out for Dr. Hunter. Dinna leave your auntie \u2019til he comes, aye? Goodbye, Sassenach; I\u2019ll see ye later in the day.\u201d He could wait no longer, and nudged his horse away into the crowd.</p><p>Other officers had gathered around Washington; he\u2019d barely be in time. But it wasn\u2019t the risk of being conspicuously late that cramped his bowels. It was guilt.</p><p>He ought to have reported John Grey\u2019s arrest at once. He kent that fine, but had delayed, hoping . . . hoping what? That the ridiculous situation would somehow evaporate? If he had reported it, Washington would have had Grey taken into custody and locked up somewhere\u2014or hanged him out of hand, as an example. He didn\u2019t think that likely, but the possibility had been enough to keep him from saying anything, counting on the chaos of the impending exodus to keep anyone from noticing.</p><p>But what was eating at his insides now was not guilt over duty deferred, or even over exposing Claire to danger by keeping the wee sodomite in his own tent instead of turning him over. It was the fact that he had not thought to revoke Grey\u2019s parole this morning when he left. If he had, Grey might easily have escaped in the confusion of leaving, and even if there had been trouble later over it . . . John Grey would be safe.</p><p>But it was too late, and with a brief prayer for the soul of Lord John Grey, he reined up beside the Marquis de La Fayette and bowed to General Washington. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>MORASSES AND IMBROGLIOS</p><p>THERE WERE THREE CREEKS running through the land, cutting it up. Where the earth was soft, the water had cut deep and the creek ran at the bottom of a steep ravine, the banks of it thick with saplings and underbrush. A farmer he\u2019d spoken to while scouting the day before had told him the names of them\u2014Dividing Brook, Spotswood Middle Brook, and Spotswood North Brook\u2014but Ian wasn\u2019t at all sure he kent for sure which this one was.</p><p>The ground here was wide and low; the creek ran out into a sunken, marshy sort of place, and he turned away; bad footing for either man or horse. One of the farmers had called the ravines \u201cmorasses,\u201d and he thought that a good word. He looked up the creek, searching for good watering places, but the ravine fell too steeply. A man could make shift to scramble down to the water, maybe, but not horses or mules.</p><p>Ian felt them before he saw them. The sense of a hunting animal, lying concealed in the wood, waiting for prey to come down to drink. He turned his horse sharply and rode along the creek bank, watching the trees on the other side.</p> <p>Movement, a horse\u2019s head tossing against flies. A glimpse of a face\u2014faces\u2014painted, like his own.</p><p>A thrill of alarm shot up his spine and instinct flattened him against the horse\u2019s neck, as the arrow whizzed over his head. It stuck, quivering, in a nearby sycamore.</p><p>He straightened, his own bow in hand, nocked an arrow in the same movement, and sent it back, aiming blind for the spot where he\u2019d seen them. The arrow shredded leaves as it went but struck nothing\u2014he hadn\u2019t expected it to.</p><p>\u201cMohawk!\u201d came a derisory shout from the other side, and a few words in a language he didn\u2019t understand but whose intended meaning was clear enough. He made a very Scottish gesture, whose meaning was also clear, and left them laughing.</p><p>He paused to yank the arrow out of the sycamore. Fletched with a yaffle\u2019s tail feathers, but not a pattern he knew. Whatever they\u2019d been speaking wasn\u2019t an Algonquian tongue. Might be something northern like Assiniboine\u2014he\u2019d know, if he got a clear look at them\u2014but might equally be something from nearer to hand.</p> <p>Very likely working for the British army, though. He kent most of the Indian scouts presently with the Rebels. And while they hadn\u2019t been trying to kill him\u2014they could have done so, easily, if they\u2019d really wanted to\u2014this was rougher teasing than might be expected. Perhaps only because they\u2019d recognized him for what he was.</p><p>Mohawk! To an English speaker, it was just easier to say than \u201cKahnyen\u2019kehaka.\u201d To any of the tribes who lived within knowledge of the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka, it was either a word to scare children with or a calculated insult. \u201cMan-eater,\u201d it meant, for the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka were known to roast their enemies alive and devour the flesh.</p><p>Ian had never seen such a thing, but he knew men\u2014old men\u2014who had and would tell you about it with pleasure. He didn\u2019t care to think about it. It brought back much too vividly the night the priest had died in Snaketown, mutilated and burned alive\u2014the night that had inadvertently taken Ian from his family and made him a Mohawk.</p><p>The bridge lay upstream, perhaps sixty yards from where he was. He paused, but the woods on the other side were silent, and he ventured across, his horse\u2019s hooves a careful clopping on the boards. If there were British scouts here, the army was not too far beyond.</p><p>There were broad meadows past the woods on the far side, and beyond these the fields of a good-sized farm; he could see a snatch of the buildings through the trees\u2014and the movement of men. He turned hastily, circling a copse and coming out into ground open enough to see.</p><p>There were green-coated soldiers on the ridgeline beyond the farm buildings, and he could smell the sulfur of their slow match on the heavy air. Grenadiers.</p> <p>He wheeled his horse and headed back, to find someone to tell.</p><p>WILLIAM FINALLY discovered the cavalry detachment of the British Legion, filling their canteens from a well in the yard of a farmhouse. They had a picket out, though, who gave a warning shout at sight of a lone horseman, and half the company swung round, on the alert. A well-trained company; Banastre Tarleton was a good, energetic officer.</p><p>Tarleton himself was standing relaxed in the shade of a big tree, his ornately plumed helmet cradled in one arm, mopping his face with a green silk kerchief. William rolled his eyes briefly at this bit of affectation, but not so Tarleton could see. He came to a walk and rode up beside Tarleton, leaning down to give him the dispatch.</p><p>\u201cFrom Captain Andr\u00e9,\u201d he said. \u201cBeen busy?\u201d The men had been fighting; he could smell the smoke on them, and a couple of men with what looked like minor wounds were sitting against the barn, uniforms streaked with blood. The barn doors hung open on emptiness, and the yard was trampled and spotted with dung; he wondered for a moment whether the farmer had driven his own stock away, or whether one or another of the armies had taken the animals.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly busy enough,\u201d Tarleton replied, reading the note. \u201cThis may help, though. We\u2019re to go reinforce my lord Cornwallis.\u201d His face was flushed with the heat, and his leather stock was clearly cutting into his thick, muscular neck, but he looked exceedingly cheerful at the prospect.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said William, reining up to turn and go, but Tarleton stopped him with a raised hand. He tucked the dispatch away in his pocket, along with the green kerchief.</p><p>\u201cSince I see you, Ellesmere\u2014saw a tasty piece last night in camp, in the bread line,\u201d he said. Tarleton sucked his lower lip for an instant and released it, red and wet. \u201cVery tasty, and a sweet little sister with her, too, though that one\u2019s not quite ripe enough for me.\u201d William raised his brows, but felt himself tense in thighs and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMade her an offer,\u201d Tarleton said, overtly careless but with a swift glance at William\u2019s hands. William relaxed them with an effort. \u201cShe declined, though\u2014said she was yours?\u201d This last was not quite a question, but not quite not.</p> <p>\u201cIf her name is Jane,\u201d William said shortly, \u201cshe and her sister are traveling under my protection.\u201d</p><p>Tarleton\u2019s quizzical look flowered into open amusement.</p><p>\u201cYour protection,\u201d he repeated. His full lips twitched. \u201cI believe she told me that her name was Arabella, though\u2014perhaps we\u2019re thinking of different girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d William did not want to be having this conversation, and gathered up his reins. \u201cDon\u2019t f**king touch her.\u201d</p><p>That was a mistake; Tarleton never passed up a challenge. His eyes sparkled and William saw him set himself, legs spread.</p><p>\u201cFight you for her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat, here? Are you insane?\u201d There were bugles in the distance, and not a very far distance, either. To say nothing of Tarleton\u2019s troops, many of them clearly listening to this exchange.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t take long,\u201d Tarleton said softly, rocking back on his heels. His left fist was loosely curled and he rubbed his right hand flat on the side of his breeches, coat pushed back. He glanced over his shoulder, to the empty barn. \u201cMy men wouldn\u2019t interfere, but we could go in there, if you\u2019re shy.\u201d \u201cShy\u201d said with that particular intonation that made it clear that cowardice was meant.</p><p>It had been on the tip of William\u2019s tongue to say, \u201cI don\u2019t own the girl\u201d\u2014but to make that admission was to give Tarleton license to go after her. He\u2019d seen Ban with girls often enough; he wasn\u2019t violent with them, but he was insistent. Never left without getting what he wanted, one way or another.</p><p>And after Harkness . . . His thoughts hadn\u2019t caught up with his body; he was on the ground, shucking his coat, before he\u2019d made a conscious decision.</p><p>Ban laid his helmet on the ground, grinning, and took off his own coat in a leisurely fashion. The motion attracted all his men at once, and in seconds they were surrounded by a circle of dragoons, whistling and hooting encouragement. The only dissenter was Ban\u2019s lieutenant, who had gone a sickly shade of gray.</p><p>\u201cColonel!\u201d he said, and William realized that the man\u2019s fear had all to do with taking issue with Ban and not the consequences of what might happen if he didn\u2019t. He meant to do his duty, though, and reached out a hand to grip Tarleton\u2019s arm. \u201cSir. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d Ban said, not taking his eyes off William. \u201cAnd shut up.\u201d The lieutenant\u2019s hand dropped away as though someone had punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>William felt at once detached, as though he were watching this from somewhere outside himself, above it all\u2014and that part of him wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. And some very tiny remnant of conscience was appalled. But the fleshly part of him was grimly exultant, and very much in charge.</p><p>He\u2019d seen Ban fight before, and didn\u2019t make the mistake of waiting for any sort of signal. The moment the green coat hit the ground, William launched himself and\u2014ignoring a ferocious hook that slammed into his ribs\u2014grabbed Tarleton by both shoulders, jerked him forward, and butted him in the face with a horrid sound of cracking bone.</p><p>He let go, pushed Ban hard in the chest, and sent him staggering backward, blood flying from his broken nose and a surprised look on his face that turned immediately to berserk fury. Tarleton dug in his heels and leapt at William like a rabid dog.</p><p>William had six inches and forty pounds on Ban, and three older cousins who had taught him to fight. Banastre Tarleton had an unshakable conviction that he was going to win any fight he started.</p><p>They were struggling on the ground, so locked that neither was actually able to hit the other effectively, when William dimly heard the lieutenant\u2019s voice, full of panic, and a rush all round them. Hands seized him and dragged him away from Tarleton; more hands pushed him frantically toward his horse. There were drums coming down the lane and the sound of marching feet.</p><p>He mounted in a daze, a taste of blood in his mouth, and spat by reflex. His coat was thrown across his lap, and someone slapped his horse with a sharp \u201cT\u2019cha!\u201d that nearly unseated William, whose feet were nowhere near the stirrups.</p><p>He pressed knees and calves into the horse\u2019s sides, urging Goth into a gallop, and burst from the lane directly in front of an infantry column, whose sergeant recoiled with a shout of alarm. Scots. He saw the checkered trews and caps, and heard a few uncouth shouts in what might be Scots or Gaelic, but didn\u2019t care. They belonged to a regiment he didn\u2019t know\u2014and so their officers wouldn\u2019t know him.</p><p>Tarleton could give what explanations he liked. William\u2019s left ear was ringing, and he shook his head and pressed the flat of his hand against the ear to quiet it.</p><p>When he took the hand away, the ringing had eased, and a number of people were singing \u201cYankee Doodle\u201d instead. He glanced over his shoulder, incredulous, and saw a number of blue-coated Continentals, dragging a number of cannon, making for the distant ridgeline.</p><p>Go back and tell the Scots infantry and Tarleton\u2019s men? Head south to Cornwallis?</p><p>\u201cHey, redcoat!\u201d A shout from his left made him look in that direction, and just in time. A group of ten or fifteen men in hunting shirts was bearing down on him, most of them armed with scythes and hoes. One man was aiming a musket at him; apparently he was the one who had shouted, for he did so again: \u201cDrop your reins and get off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil I will,\u201d William replied, and booted Goth, who took off as though his tail were on fire. William heard the boom of the musket, but crouched low over the horse\u2019s neck and kept going.</p><p>PECULIAR BEHAVIOR OF A TENT</p><p>WHILE NOT EAGER to be removed to a prison of some sort, John Grey was beginning to wish at least for solitude. Fergus Fraser and his son had insisted on remaining with him until someone came for him. Presumably so they could tell Jamie how he had been disposed of.</p><p>He was peculiarly disinterested in the method and means of that disposal, content to await developments. What he wanted solitude for was a contemplation of Percy Wainwright\u2019s presence, motives, and possible action. With La Fayette, he\u2019d said. Adviser. John shuddered to think what sort of advice might be given by that . . . and what about his interests in Fergus Fraser?</p><p>He glanced at said printer, presently engaged in argument with his precocious offspring.</p><p>\u201cYou did it!\u201d Germain glowered up at his father, face flushed red with righteous indignation. \u201cYe told me so yourself, a dozen times or more! How you went to war with Grand-p\u00e8re, and stabbed a man in the leg, and rode on a cannon when the soldiers dragged it back from Prestonpans\u2014and ye weren\u2019t even as old as I am now when ye did all that!\u201d</p><p>Fergus paused for an instant, regarding his offspring through narrowed eyes, obviously regretting his previous prolixity. He breathed steadily through his nose for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat was different,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cI was milord\u2019s employee at the time, not his son. I had a duty to attend him; he had no responsibility to prevent me doing so.\u201d</p><p>Germain blinked, frowning uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t his son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Fergus said, exasperated. \u201cIf I told you about Prestonpans, surely I have told you that I was an orphan in Paris when I met your grand-p\u00e8re. He hired me to pick pockets for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d John hadn\u2019t meant to interrupt, but couldn\u2019t help it. Fergus glanced at him, startled; evidently he hadn\u2019t really noticed John\u2019s presence, focused as he was on Germain. He bowed.</p><p>\u201cHe did, my lord. We were Jacobites, you understand. He required information. Letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d John murmured, and took a sip from his flask. Then, recalling his manners, offered it to Fergus, who blinked in surprise, but then accepted it with another bow and took a healthy gulp. Well, it must be thirsty work, pursuing an errant child through an army. He thought briefly of Willie, and thanked God his son was safe\u2014or was he? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d known that William would of course have left Philadelphia when Clinton withdrew the army\u2014perhaps as a non-fighting aide-de-camp to a senior officer. But he hadn\u2019t thought about that supposition in conjunction with the apparent present fact that General Washington was now in hot pursuit of Clinton and might just possibly catch up with him. In which case, William . . .</p><p>These thoughts had distracted him from the ongoing t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, and he was jerked out of them by a question directed to him by Germain.</p><p>\u201cMe? Oh . . . sixteen. I might have gone to the army earlier,\u201d John added apologetically, \u201chad my brother\u2019s regiment been formed, but he only raised it during the Jacobite Rising.\u201d He looked at Fergus with new interest. \u201cYou were at Prestonpans, were you?\u201d That should have been his own first battle, too\u2014and would have been, save for his happening to meet one Red Jamie Fraser, notorious Jacobite, in a mountain pass two nights before.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill anybody?\u201d Germain demanded.</p> <p>\u201cNot at Prestonpans. Later, at Culloden. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\u201d He stretched out a hand for the flask. It was nearly empty, and he drained it.</p><p>A moment later, he was glad of his celerity; had he not drained the flask already, he might have choked. The tent flap folded back, and Percy Wainwright/Beauchamp stuck his head in, then froze in surprise, dark eyes darting from one to another of the tent\u2019s inhabitants. John had an impulse to throw the empty flask at him, but thought better of it, instead saying coldly, \u201cI beg your pardon, sir; I am engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see.\u201d Percy didn\u2019t look at John \u201cMr. Fergus Fraser,\u201d he said softly, coming into the tent, hand outstretched. \u201cYour servant, sir. Comment \u00e7a va?\u201d</p><p>Fergus, unable to avoid him, shook his hand with reserve and bowed slightly but said nothing. Germain made a small growling noise in his throat, but desisted when his father gave him a sharp glance.</p><p>\u201cI am so pleased finally to have encountered you in private, Monsieur Fraser,\u201d Percy said, still speaking French. He smiled as charmingly as possible. \u201cMonsieur\u2014do you know who you are?\u201d</p> <p>Fergus regarded him thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cFew men know themselves, monsieur,\u201d he said. \u201cFor my part, I am entirely content to leave such knowledge to God. He can deal with it far better than I could. And having come to this conclusion, I believe that is all I have to say to you. Pardonnez-moi.\u201d With that, he shouldered past Percy, taking him off-guard and knocking him off-balance. Germain turned at the tent flap and stuck out his tongue.</p><p>\u201cDamned frog!\u201d he said, then disappeared with a small yelp as his father jerked him through the flap.</p><p>Percy had lost one of his silver-buckled shoes in trying to stay upright. He brushed dirt and vegetable matter from the bottom of his stocking and screwed his foot back into the shoe, lips compressed and a rather attractive flush showing across his cheekbones.</p><p>\u201cOughtn\u2019t you to be with the army?\u201d John inquired. \u201cSurely you want to be there, if Washington does meet Clinton. I imagine your \u2018interests\u2019 would want a full report by an eyewitness, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, John,\u201d Percy said briefly, \u201cand listen. I haven\u2019t got much time.\u201d He sat down on the stool with a thump, folded his hands on his knee, and looked intently at John, as though evaluating his intelligence. \u201cDo you know a man\u2014a British officer\u2014called Richardson?\u201d</p> <p>FERGUS MADE HIS way through the shambles left by the exodus of the army, holding Germain firmly by the hand. The camp followers and such men as had been left behind as unfit were setting to the work of salvage, and no one gave the Frasers more than a glance. He could only hope that the horse was where he had left it. He touched the pistol tucked under his shirt, just in case.</p><p>\u201cFrog?\u201d he said to Germain, not bothering to keep amusement out of his voice. \u201cDamned frog, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is, Papa.\u201d Germain stopped walking suddenly, pulling his hand free. \u201cPapa, I need to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Have you forgotten something?\u201d Fergus glanced over his shoulder at the tent, feeling an uneasiness between his shoulder blades. Beauchamp couldn\u2019t force him to listen, let alone to do anything he didn\u2019t wish to, and yet he had a strong aversion to the man. Well, call it fear; he seldom bothered lying to himself. Though why he should fear a man such as that . . .</p><p>\u201cNo, but . . .\u201d Germain struggled to choose among several thoughts that were plainly all trying to emerge into speech at once. \u201cGrand-p\u00e8re told me I must stay with his lordship and if Monsieur Beauchamp should come, I must listen to anything they said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Did he say why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he said it. And, also, I was\u2014I am\u2014his lordship\u2019s servant, his orderly. I have a duty to attend him.\u201d Germain\u2019s face was touchingly earnest, and Fergus felt his heart squeeze a little. Still . . .</p><p>Fergus had never mastered the Scottish way of making crude but eloquent noises in the throat\u2014he rather envied them\u2014but was not bad with similar communications made via the nose.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to what the soldiers said, he is a prisoner of war. Do you mean to accompany him to whatever dungeon or hulk they put him in? Because I think Maman would come and hoick you out of it by the scruff of your neck. Come along, she\u2019s very worried and waiting to hear that you\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Mention of Marsali had the hoped-for effect; Germain cast down his eyes and bit his lip.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2014I mean, I\u2019m not . . . well, but, Papa! I have to just go and be sure that Monsieur Beauchamp isn\u2019t doing anything bad to him. And maybe see that he has some food before we leave,\u201d he added. \u201cYou wouldna have him starve, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilord looked reasonably well nourished,\u201d Fergus said, but the urgency on Germain\u2019s face drew him a reluctant step back toward the tent. Germain at once glowed with relief and excitement, seizing his father\u2019s hand again.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think Monsieur Beauchamp means his lordship harm?\u201d Fergus asked, holding Germain back for a moment.</p><p>\u201cBecause his lordship doesna like him, and neither does Grand-p\u00e8re,\u201d the boy said briefly. \u201cCome on, Papa! His lordship is unarmed, and who knows what that sodomite has in his pocket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSodomite?\u201d Fergus stopped dead in his tracks.</p><p>\u201cOui, Grand-p\u00e8re says he\u2019s a sodomite. Come on!\u201d Germain was nearly frantic now and drew his father on by sheer willpower.</p><p>Sodomite? Well, that was interesting. Fergus, observant and very much experienced in the ways of the world and of sex, had some time ago drawn his own conclusions regarding milord Grey\u2019s preferences but had naturally not mentioned these to Jamie, as the English lord was his father\u2019s good friend. Did he know? Regardless, that might make his lordship\u2019s relationship with this Beauchamp a good deal more complex, and he approached the tent with a heightened sense of both curiosity and wariness.</p><p>He was prepared to clap his hand over Germain\u2019s eyes and drag him away, should anything untoward be going on in that tent, but before they came close enough to see through the flap, he saw the canvas quiver in a very odd way, and pulled Germain to a halt.</p><p>\u201cArr\u00eate,\u201d he said softly. He couldn\u2019t conceive of even the most depraved sexual practices causing a tent to behave in that way and, gesturing to Germain to stay put, moved soft-footed to one side, keeping a little distance among the camp debris.</p><p>Sure enough, Lord John was wriggling out under the back edge of the tent, cursing quietly in German. Eyes on this peculiar exhibition, Fergus didn\u2019t notice that Beauchamp had emerged from the front of the tent until he heard Germain\u2019s exclamation and turned to find the boy behind him. He was impressed at Germain\u2019s ability to move quietly, but this was not the time for praise. He motioned to his son and withdrew a little farther, taking cover behind a pile of spiled barrels.</p><p>Beauchamp, with a high color in his face, walked off briskly, dusting chaff from the elegant skirts of his coat. Lord John, scrambling to his feet, made off in the other direction, toward the woods, not bothering about his own costume, and no wonder. What on earth had the man been doing, dressed in such a way?</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do, Papa?\u201d Germain whispered.</p><p>Fergus hesitated only a moment, glancing after Beauchamp. The man was heading toward a large inn, likely General Washington\u2019s erstwhile center of command. If Beauchamp were remaining with the Continental army, he could be found again\u2014if that proved necessary.</p><p>\u201cShall we follow Lord John, Papa?\u201d Germain was vibrating with anxiety, and Fergus put his hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder to calm him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, firmly but with some regret\u2014he himself was more than curious. \u201cClearly his business is urgent, and our presence would be more likely to cause him danger than to help.\u201d He didn\u2019t add that Lord John was almost certainly headed for the battlefield\u2014if there should be one. Such an observation would only make Germain more eager.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Germain had his mother\u2019s sense of Scottish stubbornness, and Fergus suppressed a smile at seeing his small blond brows draw down in Marsali\u2019s exact expression.</p><p>\u201cHe will be looking either for your grand-p\u00e8re or for his compatriots,\u201d Fergus pointed out. \u201cEither will take care of him, and in neither case would our presence be useful to him. And your mother will assassinate both of us if we don\u2019t return to Philadelphia within the week.\u201d</p><p>He also didn\u2019t mention that the thought of Marsali and the other children alone in the printshop caused him a great uneasiness. The exodus of the British army and a horde of Loyalists hadn\u2019t rendered Philadelphia safe, by any means. There were a good many looters and lawless men who had moved in to pick over the leavings of those who had fled\u2014and there were plenty still left with Loyalist sympathies who didn\u2019t admit them openly but might easily act upon them under cover of darkness.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said more gently, and took Germain by the hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to find some food to eat along the way.\u201d</p><p>JOHN GREY MADE his way through the wood, stumbling now and then by reason of having only one working eye; the ground wasn\u2019t always where he thought it was.</p><p>Once away from the campsite, he made no effort to keep out of sight; Claire had packed his eye with cotton lint and wrapped his head in a most professional manner with a gauze bandage to keep the lint in place. It would protect the bad eye while allowing air to dry the skin around it, she said. He supposed it was working\u2014his eyelids weren\u2019t as raw and sore as they had been, only rather sticky\u2014but at the moment was only grateful that he looked like a wounded man who\u2019d been left behind by the rushing American army. No one would stop or question him.</p><p>Well, no one save his erstwhile comrades of the 16th Pennsylvania, should he have the misfortune to encounter them. God only knew what they\u2019d thought when he surrendered to Jamie. He felt badly about them\u2014they\u2019d been very kind to him and must feel their kindness betrayed by the revelation of his identity, but there hadn\u2019t been much bloody choice about it.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much choice about this, either.</p><p>\u201cThey mean to take your son.\u201d It was probably the one thing Percy could have said that would have made him attend.</p><p>\u201cThey who?\u201d he\u2019d said sharply, sitting up. \u201cTake him where? And what for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Americans. As to what for\u2014you and your brother.\u201d Percy had looked him over, shaking his head. \u201cDo you have the slightest notion of your value, John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValue to whom?\u201d He\u2019d stood up then, swaying perilously, and Percy had grabbed his hand to steady him. The touch was warm and firm and startlingly familiar. He withdrew his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told I have considerable value as a scapegoat, should the Americans decide to hang me.\u201d Where was that bloody note from Hal . . . who had it now? Watson Smith? General Wayne?</p><p>\u201cWell, that won\u2019t do at all, will it?\u201d Percy appeared undisturbed at thought of Grey\u2019s imminent demise. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll have a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom?\u201d he asked, curious.</p><p>\u201cGeneral La Fayette,\u201d Percy said, adding with a slight bow, \u201cto whom I have the honor of being an adviser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Grey said dryly. \u201cI am not concerned with the possibility of being hanged\u2014at least not right this minute\u2014but I want to know what the devil you mean about my son, William.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be much easier over a bottle of port,\u201d Percy said, with a sigh, \u201cbut time doesn\u2019t permit, alas. Sit down, at least. You look as though you\u2019re going to fall on your face.\u201d</p><p>Grey sat, with as much dignity as he could muster, and glared up at Percy.</p><p>\u201cTo put it as simply as possible\u2014and it\u2019s not simple, I assure you\u2014there is a British officer named Richardson\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him,\u201d Grey interrupted. \u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do. Be quiet.\u201d Percy flapped a hand at him. \u201cHe\u2019s an American spy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014what?\u201d For an instant, he thought he might really fall on his face, despite the fact of sitting down, and grasped the cot\u2019s frame with both hands to prevent this. \u201cHe told me that he proposed to arrest Mrs. Fraser for distributing seditious materials. That was what caused me to marry her. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Percy goggled at him. \u201cYou married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Grey said crossly. \u201cSo did you, or so you told me. Go on about bloody Richardson. How long has he been spying for the Americans?\u201d</p><p>Percy snorted but obliged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I became aware of him in the spring of last year, but he may well have been at it before that. Active fellow, I\u2019ll give him that. And not content with merely gathering information and passing it on, either. He\u2019s what one might call a provocateur.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s provoking,\u201d Grey muttered, resisting the urge to rub his bad eye. \u201cWhat\u2019s he got to do with William?\u201d He was beginning to have an unpleasant feeling in his abdomen. He had given William permission to undertake small intelligence-gathering missions for Captain Richardson, who\u2014</p><p>\u201cPut as bluntly as possible, he\u2019s tried more than once to lure your son into a position where he might appear to have sympathies with the Rebels. I gather that last year he sent him into the Great Dismal in Virginia, with the intention that he should be captured by a nest of Rebels who have a bastion there\u2014presumably they would let it be known that he had deserted and joined their forces, while actually holding him prisoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d Grey demanded. \u201cWill you bloody sit down? Looking up at you is giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>Percy snorted again and sat\u2014not on the conveniently placed stool, but beside Grey on the camp bed, hands on his knees.</p> <p>\u201cPresumably to discredit your family\u2014Pardloe was making rather inflammatory speeches in the House of Lords at the time, about the conduct of the war.\u201d He made a small, impatient gesture that John recognized, a quick flutter of the fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t know everything\u2014yet\u2014but what I do know is that he\u2019s arranged to have your son taken, during the journey to New York. He\u2019s not bothering with indirection or politics; things have changed, now that France has come into the war. This is simple abduction, with the intent of demanding your\u2014and Pardloe\u2019s\u2014cooperation in the matter of the Northwest Territory\u2014and possibly something else\u2014as the price of the boy\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Grey closed his good eye, in an effort to stop his head spinning. Two years before, Percy had abruptly reentered his life, bearing a proposal from certain French \u201cinterests\u201d\u2014to wit, that these interests wanted the return of the valuable Northwest Territory, presently held by England, and in return for assistance in achieving that goal would offer their influence to keep France from entering the war on the side of the Americans.</p><p>\u201cThings have changed,\u201d he repeated, with an edge.</p><p>Percy inhaled strongly through his nose.</p><p>\u201cAdmiral d\u2019Estaing sailed from Toulon with a fleet, in April. If he\u2019s not already off New York, he will be shortly. General Clinton may or may not know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus!\u201d He clenched his fists on the bedframe, hard enough to leave marks from the nailheads. So the bloody French had now officially entered the war. They\u2019d signed a Treaty of Alliance with America in February, and declared war on England in March, but talk was cheap. Ships and cannon and men cost money.</p><p>Suddenly he grasped Percy\u2019s arm, squeezing hard.</p><p>\u201cAnd where do you come into this?\u201d he said, voice level and cold. \u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d</p><p>Percy drew breath, but didn\u2019t jerk away. He returned Grey\u2019s stare, brown eyes clear and direct.</p><p>\u201cWhere I come into it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t time. You need to find your son quickly. As to why I tell you . . .\u201d</p><p>John saw it coming and didn\u2019t pull away. Percy smelled of bergamot and petitgrain and the red wine on his breath. John\u2019s grip on Percy\u2019s arm loosened.</p> <p>\u201cPour vos beaux yeux,\u201d Percy had whispered against his lips\u2014and laughed, damn him.</p><p>THE SORT OF THING THAT WILL MAKE A MAN SWEAT AND TREMBLE</p><p>WE FOLLOWED IN the wake of the army. Because of the speed of march, the soldiers had been instructed to jettison their nonessential equipment, and I had had to abandon many of my supplies, as well. Still, I was mounted and thus would be able to keep up, even loaded with what I managed to keep. After all, I reasoned, it would do me no good to catch up with the army if I had nothing with which to treat wounds when I did.</p><p>I had Clarence packed with as much as he could reasonably be expected to carry. As he was a large mule, this was a substantial amount, including my small tent, a folding camp bed for surgery, and all I could cram in, in terms of bandages, lint, and disinfectant\u2014I had both a small cask of purified saline solution and a couple of bottles of straight ethyl alcohol (these disguised as poison, with large skull-and-crossbones labels painted on). Also a jug of sweet oil for burns, my medicine chest, and bundles of raw herbs, large jars of prepared ointment, and dozens of small bottles and vials of tinctures and infusions. My surgical instruments, stitching needles, and sutures were in their own small box, this in a haversack with extra bandage rolls, to be carried on my person.</p><p>I left Clarence tied and went to find out where the hospital tents were to be set up. The camp was milling with non-combatants and support personnel, but I was finally able to locate Denny Hunter, who told me that on the basis of General Greene\u2019s reports, the surgeons were to be dispatched to the village of Freehold, where there was a large church that could be used as a hospital.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I\u2019ve heard is that Lee has taken command of the force attacking the British rear and means to encircle the British,\u201d he said, polishing his spectacles on the tail of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cLee? But I thought he didn\u2019t think it an important command and wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t care one way or the other\u2014save that Jamie and his companies would be engaged in that mission, and I had my own doubts about General Lee.</p><p>Denzell shrugged, putting his spectacles back on and tucking in his shirttail.</p> <p>\u201cApparently Washington decided that a thousand men were insufficient to his purpose and raised the number to five thousand, which Lee considered more appropriate to his . . . sense of his own importance.\u201d Denny\u2019s mouth twisted a little at this. He looked at my face, though, and touched my arm gently.</p><p>\u201cWe can but put our trust in God\u2014and hope that the Lord has his eye upon Charles Lee. Will thee come with the girls and me, Claire? Thy mule will bide with us willingly.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated for no more than a moment. If I rode Clarence, I could take only a fraction of the equipment and supplies he could otherwise carry. And while Jamie had said he wanted me with him, I knew quite well that what he really meant was that he wanted to be assured of where I was, and that I was near at hand if he needed me.</p><p>\u201cThy husband does trust me with thy welfare,\u201d Denny said, smiling, having plainly divined what I was thinking.</p><p>\u201cEt tu, Brute?\u201d I said rather curtly, and, when he blinked, added more civilly, \u201cI mean\u2014does everyone know what I\u2019m thinking, all of the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I doubt it,\u201d he said, and grinned at me. \u201cIf they did, I expect a number of them would take a deal more care in what they said to thee.\u201d</p><p>I rode in Denny\u2019s wagon with Dottie and Rachel, Clarence pacing stolidly along behind, tied to the tailboard. Dottie was flushed with heat and excitement; she had never been near a battle before. Neither had Rachel, but she had helped her brother during a very bad winter at Valley Forge and had much more idea of what the day might hold.</p><p>\u201cDoes thee think perhaps thee should write to thy mother?\u201d I heard Rachel ask seriously. The girls were behind Denny and me, sitting in the bed of the wagon and keeping things from bouncing out when we hit ruts and mud bogs.</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d Dottie\u2019s tone was wary\u2014not quite hostile, but very reserved. I knew she had written to tell her mother that she intended to wed Denzell Hunter, but she hadn\u2019t received a reply. Given the difficulties of correspondence with England, though, there was no assurance that Minerva Grey had ever read the letter.</p><p>It occurred to me, with a sudden qualm, that I hadn\u2019t written a letter to Brianna in several months. I hadn\u2019t been able to bear to write about Jamie\u2019s death, and there hadn\u2019t been time since his return even to think about it.</p><p>\u201cIt is a war, Dottie,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cUnexpected things may happen. And thee would not wish thy mother to . . . well . . . to discover that thee had perished without some assurance that she was in thy heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm!\u201d said Dottie, clearly taken aback. Beside me, I felt Denzell shift his weight, bending a little forward as he took a fresh grip on the reins. He glanced aside at me, and his mouth turned up in an expression that was as much grimace as smile, acknowledging that he\u2019d been listening to the girls\u2019 talk, too.</p><p>\u201cShe worries for me,\u201d he said very quietly. \u201cNever for herself.\u201d He let go the reins with one hand to rub a knuckle under his nose. \u201cShe has as much courage as her father and brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much pigheadedness, you mean,\u201d I said under my breath, and he grinned, despite himself.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. He glanced over his shoulder and so did I, but the girls had moved to the tailboard and were talking over it to Clarence, brushing flies off his face with the needles of a long pine twig. \u201cDoes thee think it a familial lack of imagination? For in the case of the men of her family, it cannot be ignorance of the possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it certainly can\u2019t,\u201d I agreed, with a note of ruefulness. I sighed and stretched my legs a little. \u201cJamie is the same way, and he certainly doesn\u2019t lack for imagination. I think it\u2019s . . .\u201d I made a small helpless gesture. \u201cPerhaps \u2018acceptance\u2019 is the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcceptance of the fact of mortality?\u201d He was interested and pushed his spectacles back into place. \u201cWe have discussed that\u2014Dorothea and I.\u201d He nodded back toward the girls. \u201cFriends live in the certain knowledge that this world is temporary and there is nothing to fear in death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of that, perhaps.\u201d In fact, almost everyone in this time had a very matter-of-fact acceptance of mortality; death was a constant presence at everyone\u2019s elbow, though they regarded that presence in a variety of ways. \u201cBut they\u2014those men\u2014what they do is something different, I think. It\u2019s more an acceptance of what they think God made them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He seemed slightly startled by that, and his brows drew together in consideration. \u201cWhat does thee mean by that? That they believe God has created them deliberately to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be responsible for other people, I think,\u201d I said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say whether it\u2019s the notion of noblesse oblige\u2014Jamie was a laird, you know, in Scotland\u2014or just the idea that . . . that\u2019s what a man does,\u201d I ended, rather lamely. Because \u201cthat\u201d was plainly not what Denzell Hunter thought a man should do. Though I did wonder a bit. Plainly the question troubled him a little.</p><p>As well it might, given his position. I could see that the prospect of battle excited him and that the fact that it did troubled him a great deal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very brave man,\u201d I said quietly, and touched his sleeve. \u201cI saw that. When you played Jamie\u2019s deserter game, after Ticonderoga.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t courage, I assure thee,\u201d he said, with a short, humorless laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t seek to be brave; I only wanted to prove that I was.\u201d</p><p>I made a rather disrespectful noise\u2014I wasn\u2019t in either Jamie\u2019s or Ian\u2019s class, but I had picked up a few pointers\u2014and he glanced at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI do appreciate the distinction,\u201d I told him. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known a lot of brave men in my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can thee know what lies\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d I waved my fingers at him. \u201c \u2018Brave\u2019 covers everything from complete insanity and bloody disregard of other people\u2019s lives\u2014generals tend to go in for that sort\u2014to drunkenness, foolhardiness, and outright idiocy\u2014to the sort of thing that will make a man sweat and tremble and throw up . . . and go and do what he thinks he has to do anyway.</p><p>\u201cWhich,\u201d I said, pausing for breath and folding my hands neatly in my lap, \u201cis exactly the sort of bravery you share with Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThy husband does not sweat and tremble,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him. Or, rather, I have not seen him do such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does the sweating and trembling on the inside, mostly,\u201d I replied. \u201cThough he really does often vomit before\u2014or during\u2014a battle.\u201d</p><p>Denzell blinked, once, and didn\u2019t speak for a bit, absorbed\u2014apparently\u2014in steering his way past a large hay wagon whose oxen had suddenly decided they didn\u2019t want to go any farther and stopped dead in the middle of the road.</p><p>At last he took a breath and let it out explosively.</p><p>\u201cI am not afraid to die,\u201d he said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t my difficulty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d I asked, curious. \u201cAre you afraid of being maimed and left helpless? I certainly would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His throat moved as he swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s Dorothea and Rachel. I\u2019m afraid I would lack the courage to see them die without trying to save them, even if that meant killing someone.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say to this, and we jolted on in silence.</p><p>LEE\u2019S TROOPS LEFT Englishtown at about 6 A.M., heading east toward Monmouth Courthouse. Lee arrived at the courthouse at about nine-thirty, to find that the bulk of the British army had left\u2014presumably moving toward Middletown, as that was where the road went.</p><p>Lee was prevented from following, though, by the presence of a small but very belligerent rear guard under the command of General Clinton himself. Or so Ian told Jamie, having got close enough to see Clinton\u2019s regimental banners. Jamie had communicated this information to Lee, but saw no evidence that it affected either that gentleman\u2019s plan of action (always assuming that he had one) or his disinclination to send out more scouts to reconnoiter.</p><p>\u201cGo round this lot and see can ye find out where Cornwallis is,\u201d Jamie told Ian. \u201cThe grenadiers ye saw are likely Hessians, so they\u2019ll be close to von Knyphausen.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded and took the full canteen Jamie offered him.</p><p>\u201cShall I tell General Lee, if I do? He didna seem much interested in what I had to say.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, tell him if ye see him before ye see me\u2014tell the marquis, too, should ye come within reach of him\u2014but find me, regardless, aye?\u201d</p><p>Ian grinned at him and slung the canteen over his pommel.</p><p>\u201cGood hunting, a Bhr\u00e0thair-math\u00e0r!\u201d</p><p>Jamie had had two companies blooded by midmorning, skirmishing near Monmouth Courthouse, but no one killed yet and only three wounded badly enough to retire. Colonel Owen had requested cover for his artillery\u2014only two cannon, but any artillery was welcome\u2014and Jamie had sent Thomas Meleager\u2019s Pennsylvanians to deal with that.</p> <p>He\u2019d sent one of Captain Kirby\u2019s companies to reconnoiter toward what he thought was the creek and kept back the rest, waiting for orders from La Fayette or Lee. La Fayette was somewhere ahead of him, Lee well behind and to the east with the main body of his troops.</p><p>The sun stood just short of ten o\u2019clock when a messenger appeared, crouched dramatically in his saddle as though dashing through a hail of bullets, though in fact there was not a British soldier in sight. He pulled his lathered horse to a stop and gasped out his message.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s dust clouds in the east\u2014might be more redcoats comin\u2019! And the marky says there\u2019s redcoat cannon in the cider orchard, sir, and will you do summat about it, please.\u201d</p><p>The sweating messenger gulped air, loosening his rein in obvious preparation for dashing off again. Jamie leaned over and seized the horse\u2019s bridle to prevent it.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the cider orchard?\u201d he asked calmly. The messenger was young, maybe sixteen, and wild-eyed as his rawboned horse.</p> <p>\u201cDunno, sir,\u201d he said, and began glancing to and fro, as though expecting the orchard to materialize suddenly out of the meadow they were standing in. A sudden distant boom reverberated in Jamie\u2019s bones, and his horse\u2019s ears pricked up.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, lad,\u201d he said. \u201cI hear them. Breathe your horse, or he\u2019s like to die under ye before the sun\u2019s high.\u201d</p><p>Letting go the bridle, he waved to Captain Craddock and turned his own horse\u2019s head toward the sound of cannon.</p><p>THE AMERICAN ARMY had several hours\u2019 lead on him, and the British army very much more\u2014but a man alone could move a great deal faster than even a company of light infantry. Neither was John burdened with weapons. Or food. Or water.</p><p>You know perfectly well that he\u2019s lying to you.</p><p>\u201cOh, be quiet, Hal,\u201d Grey muttered to his brother\u2019s shade. \u201cI know Percy a great deal better than you do.\u201d</p> <p>I said, you know perfectly well . . .</p><p>\u201cI do. What am I risking if he is lying\u2014and what am I risking if he\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>Hal was high-handed, but logical. He was also a father; that shut him up.</p><p>What he was risking if Percy was lying was being shot or hanged out of hand if anyone recognized him. Anyone. If the Americans found him out before he reached the British lines, they\u2019d arrest him for breaking his parole and promptly execute him as a spy. If the British didn\u2019t recognize him in time, they\u2019d shoot him on sight as Rebel militia. He put a hand in the pocket where he\u2019d wadded the LIBERTY OR DEATH cap and debated the wisdom of throwing it away, but, in the event, kept it.</p><p>What he was risking if Percy wasn\u2019t lying was Willie\u2019s life. No great effort required to call the odds.</p><p>It was midmorning, and the air was like treacle, thick and sweet with flowers, sticky with tree sap, and completely unbreathable. His good eye was beginning to itch from the floating pollen grains, and flies were buzzing interestedly round his head, drawn by the scent of honey.</p><p>At least the headache had gone away, dispelled by the burst of alarm\u2014and a brief flare of lust, might as well admit it\u2014occasioned by Percy\u2019s revelation. He wouldn\u2019t begin to speculate as to Percy\u2019s motives, but . . .</p><p>\u201c\u2018For your beautiful eyes,\u2019 indeed!\u201d he muttered, but couldn\u2019t help smiling at the impudence. A wise man would not touch Percy Wainwright with a ten-foot pole. Something shorter, though . . .</p> <p>\u201cOh, do be quiet, will you?\u201d he murmured to himself, and made his way down a clay bank to the edge of a tiny creek, where he could throw cold water on his heated face.</p><p>IT WAS PERHAPS eight o\u2019clock in the morning when we reached Free-hold, where Tennent Church was to be established as the main hospital. It was a large building, set in the midst of a huge, sprawling churchyard, an acre or more of ground whose headstones were as individual as doubtless their owners had been in life. No neat aisles of uniform white crosses here.</p><p>I spared a thought for the graves of Normandy and wondered whether those rows upon rows of faceless dead were meant to impose a sort of postmortem tidiness on the costs of war\u2014or whether it was meant rather to underline them, a solemn accounting carried out in endless rows of naughts and crosses.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t think long. Battle had been joined already\u2014somewhere\u2014and there were already wounded coming in, a number of men sitting in the shade of a large tree next to the church, more coming down the road, some staggering with the help of friends, some being carried on litters\u2014or in someone\u2019s arms. My heart lurched at the sight, but I tried not to look for Jamie or Ian; should they be among the early wounded, I\u2019d know it soon enough.</p><p>There was a bustle near the church\u2019s porch, where the double doors had been flung wide to accommodate passage, and orderlies and surgeons were coming and going in haste\u2014but organized haste, so far.</p><p>\u201cGo and see what\u2019s happening, why don\u2019t you?\u201d I suggested to Denzell. \u201cThe girls and I will unload things.\u201d</p><p>He paused long enough to unhitch his own two mules and hobble them, then hastened into the church.</p><p>I found the buckets and dispatched Rachel and Dottie to find a well. The day was already uncomfortably hot; we were going to need a good deal of water, one way or another.</p><p>Clarence was showing a strong urge to go join Denny\u2019s mules in cropping grass among the headstones, jerking his head against the pull of his tether and uttering loud cries of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, all right,\u201d I said, hurrying to undo the packing straps and lift his burdens off. \u201cHold your\u2014oh, dear.\u201d</p><p>A man was staggering toward me, giving at the knees with every step and lurching dizzily. The side of his face was black, and there was blood down the facing of his uniform. I dropped the bundle of tenting and poles and rushed to catch him by the arm before he should trip over a headstone and fall face-first into the dirt.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d I said. He looked dazed and appeared not to hear me, but as I was pulling on his arm, he did go down, letting his knees relax abruptly and nearly taking me with him as he landed on a substantial stone commemorating one Gilbert Tennent.</p><p>My patient was swaying as though about to fall over, and yet a hasty check showed me no significant wounds; the blood on his coat was from his face, where the blackened skin had blistered and split. It wasn\u2019t just the soot of black powder\u2014the skin had actually been burned to a crisp, the underlying flesh seared, and my patient smelled appallingly like a pork roast. I took a firm grip on my lurching stomach and stopped breathing through my nose.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond to my questions but stared hard at my mouth, and he seemed lucid, despite his continued swaying. The penny finally dropped.</p><p>\u201cEx . . . plo . . . sion?\u201d I mouthed with exaggerated care, and he nodded vigorously, then stopped abruptly, swaying so far that I had to grasp him by the sleeve and pull him upright.</p><p>Artilleryman, from his uniform. So something big had exploded near him\u2014a mortar, a cannon?\u2014and not only burned his face nearly to the bone but also likely burst both his eardrums and disturbed the balance of his inner ear. I nodded and set his hands to grip the stone he sat on, to keep him in place while I hastily finished unloading Clarence\u2014who was making the welkin ring with frustration; I should have realized at once that the artilleryman was deaf, as he was taking no notice of the racket\u2014hobbled him, and set him loose to join Denny\u2019s mules in the shade. I dug what I needed out of the packs and set about to do what little I could for the injured man, this consisting mostly of soaking a towel in saline and applying it to his face like a poultice, to remove as much soot as I could without scrubbing.</p><p>I thanked God that I\u2019d had the forethought to bring a jug of sweet oil for burns\u2014and cursed my lack of it for not having asked for aloe at Bartram\u2019s Garden.</p><p>The girls hadn\u2019t yet returned with water; I hoped there was a well somewhere close at hand. Creek water so close to an army couldn\u2019t be used without boiling it. That thought led me to look round for a spot where a fire could be lighted and to make a mental note to send the girls to look for wood next.</p><p>My mind was jerked from my rapidly expanding mental checklist, though, by Denny\u2019s sudden emergence from the church. He wasn\u2019t alone; he appeared to be having a passionate argument with another Continental officer. With a brief exclamation of exasperation, I dug in my pocket and found my silk-wrapped spectacles. With these on my nose, the face of Denny\u2019s interlocutor sprang into clear focus\u2014Captain Leckie, diplomate of the Medical College of Philadelphia.</p><p>My patient tugged at my skirt and, when I turned to him, apologetically opened his mouth and mimed drinking. I held up a finger, adjuring him to wait one moment, and went to see whether Denzell required reinforcement.</p><p>My appearance was greeted by an austere look from Captain Leckie, who viewed me rather as he might have looked at something questionable on the bottom of his shoe.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cI have just been telling your Quaker friend that there is no room inside the church for cunning-women or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire Fraser is the most skillful surgeon I have seen operate!\u201d Denzell said. He was flushed and fairly bristling with anger. \u201cYou will do your patients great harm, sir, by not allowing her to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where did you obtain your training, Dr. Hunter, that you are so confident of your own opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Edinburgh,\u201d Denny said through his teeth. \u201cWhere I was trained by my cousin, John Hunter.\u201d Seeing that this made no impact on Leckie, he added, \u201cAnd his brother, William Hunter\u2014accoucheur to the queen.\u201d</p><p>That took Leckie aback, but unfortunately also got up his nose.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, dividing a faint sneer evenly between us. \u201cI congratulate you, sir. But as I doubt the army requires a man midwife, perhaps you should assist your . . . colleague\u201d\u2014and here he actually flared his nostrils at me, the pompous little swine\u2014\u201cwith her seeds and potions, rather than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t time for this,\u201d I interrupted firmly. \u201cDr. Hunter is both a trained physician and a duly appointed surgeon in the Continental army; you can\u2019t bloody keep him out. And if my experience of battle\u2014which I venture to suggest may be somewhat more extensive than your own, sir\u2014is anything to go on, you\u2019ll need every hand you can get.\u201d I turned to Denzell and gave him a long, level look.</p><p>\u201cYour duty is with those who need you. So is mine. I told you about triage, did I not? I have a tent and my own surgical instruments and supplies. I\u2019ll do triage out here, deal with the minor cases, and send in anyone requiring major surgery.\u201d</p><p>I had a quick look over my shoulder, then turned back to the two fuming men.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go inside and be quick about it. They\u2019re starting to pile up.\u201d</p><p>This was not a metaphorical expression. There was a crowd of walking wounded under the trees, a few men lying on makeshift stretchers and sheets of canvas . . . and a small, sinister heap of bodies, these presumably men who had died of their wounds en route to the hospital.</p><p>Fortunately, Rachel and Dottie appeared at this moment, each lugging a heavy bucket of water in each hand. I turned my back on the men and went to meet them.</p><p>\u201cDottie, come and put up the tent poles, will you?\u201d I said, taking her buckets. \u201cAnd, Rachel\u2014you know what arterial bleeding looks like, I imagine. Go and look through those men and bring me anyone who\u2019s doing it.\u201d</p><p>I gave my burnt artilleryman water, then helped him to his feet. As he stood up, I saw behind his legs the epitaph carved into Gilbert Tennent\u2019s headstone:</p><p>O READER HAD YOU HEARD HIS LAST TESTIMONY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN CONVINCED OF THE EXTREME MADNESS OF DELAYING REPENTANCE.</p><p>\u201cI suppose there are worse places to be doing this,\u201d I remarked to the artilleryman, but, unable to hear me, he simply raised my hand and kissed it before swaying off to sit down on the grass, the wet towel pressed to his face.</p><p>THE CIDER ORCHARD</p><p>THE FIRST SHOT took them by surprise, a muffled boom from the cider orchard and a slow roll of white smoke. They didn\u2019t run, but they stiffened, looking to him for direction. Jamie said to those near him, \u201cGood lads,\u201d then raised his voice. \u201cTo my left, now! Mr. Craddock, Reverend Woodsworth\u2014circle them; come into the orchard from behind. The rest\u2014scatter to the right and fire as ye can\u2014\u201d The second crash drowned his words, and Craddock jerked like a puppet with his strings cut and dropped to the ground, blood spraying from the blackened hole in his chest. Jamie\u2019s horse shied violently, nearly unseating him.</p><p>\u201cGo with the reverend!\u201d he shouted at Craddock\u2019s men, who stood there drop-jawed, staring at their captain\u2019s body. \u201cGo now!\u201d One of the men shook himself, grabbed the sleeve of another, pulled him away, and then they all began to move as a body. Woodsworth, bless him, raised his musket overhead and roared, \u201cTo me! Follow me!\u201d and broke into the stork-legged shamble that passed with him for running\u2014but they followed him.</p><p>The gelding had settled but was moving uneasily. He was\u2014supposedly\u2014used to the sound of guns, but he didn\u2019t like the strong smell of blood. Jamie didn\u2019t like it, either.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we . . . bury Mr. Craddock?\u201d a timid voice suggested behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not dead, lackbrain!\u201d</p><p>Jamie glanced down. He wasn\u2019t\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t be more than a few seconds longer.</p><p>\u201cGo with God, man,\u201d he said quietly. Craddock didn\u2019t blink; his eyes were fixed on the sky, not yet dull but sightless.</p><p>\u201cGo wi\u2019 your fellows,\u201d he said to the two lingerers, then saw that they were Craddock\u2019s two sons, maybe thirteen and fourteen, white-faced and staring as sheep. \u201cSay farewell to him,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cHe\u2019ll still hear ye. Then . . . go.\u201d He thought for a moment to send them to La Fayette, but they\u2019d be no safer there. \u201cRun!\u201d</p> <p>They ran\u2014they were a deal safer running\u2014and with a gesture to Lieutenants Orden and Bixby, he wheeled his horse to the right, following Guthrie\u2019s company. The cannon were firing more regularly from the orchard. He saw a ball bounce past, ten feet away, and the air was thickening with smoke. He could still smell Craddock\u2019s blood.</p><p>He found Captain Moxley and sent him with a full company to look at the farmhouse on the far side of the orchard.</p><p>\u201cAt a distance, mind. I want to know if the redcoats are in it or if the family\u2019s still there. If the family\u2019s there, surround the house; go inside if they\u2019ll let ye, but don\u2019t force your way. If there are soldiers inside and they come out after you, engage them and take the house if ye think ye can. If they stay inside, don\u2019t stir them up; send someone back to tell me. I\u2019ll be at the back o\u2019 the orchard; the north side.\u201d</p><p>Guthrie was waiting for him, the men lying flat in the long grass behind the orchard. He left the two lieutenants with his horse, which he tied to a fence rail well out of range of the orchard, and scrambled along to the company, keeping low. He dropped to his belly by Bob Guthrie.</p><p>\u201cI need to know where the cannon are\u2014exactly where they are, and how many. Send three or four men in from different directions, goin\u2019 canny\u2014ye know what I mean? Aye. They\u2019re not to do anything; see what they can and come out again, fast.\u201d</p> <p>Guthrie was panting like a dog, stubbled face awash with sweat, but he grinned and nodded and wormed his way off through the grass.</p><p>The meadow was dry, brown and brittle in the summer heat; Jamie\u2019s stockings prickled with foxtails, and the warm sharp scent of ripe hay was stronger than that of black powder.</p><p>He gulped water from his canteen; it was nearly empty. It wasn\u2019t yet noon, but the sun was coming down on them like a flatiron. He turned to tell one of the lieutenants who\u2019d been following him to go and find the nearest water, but nothing moved in the grass behind him save hundreds of grasshoppers, whirring up like sparks. Gritting his teeth against the stiffness in his knees, he scrambled up onto hands and feet and scuttled back toward his horse.</p><p>Orden was lying ten feet away, shot through one eye. Jamie froze for an instant, and something whirred close past his cheek. It might be a grasshopper and it might not. He was flat to the earth beside the dead lieutenant, heart pounding in his ears before the thought had fully formed.</p><p>Guthrie. He daren\u2019t raise his head to call out\u2014but had to. He got his feet under him as best he could, shot out of the grass, and ran like a rabbit, to and fro, zigging away from the orchard as best he could while still going in the direction he\u2019d sent Guthrie.</p><p>He could hear the shots now: more than one sniper in the orchard, protecting the cannon, and the sound was the flat crack! of a rifle. Jaegers? He flung himself down and crawled madly, now shouting for Guthrie.</p> <p>\u201cHere, sir!\u201d The man popped up suddenly beside him like a groundhog, and Jamie seized Guthrie\u2019s sleeve, pulling him back down.</p><p>\u201cGet . . . your men back.\u201d He gulped air, chest heaving. \u201cShooting\u2014from the orchard. This side. They\u2019ll be picked off.\u201d</p><p>Guthrie was staring at him, mouth half open.</p><p>\u201cGet them!\u201d</p><p>Shaken out of his shock, Guthrie nodded like a puppet and started to rise. Jamie grabbed him by the ankle and jerked him flat, pressed him down with a hand on his back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t . . . stand up.\u201d His breathing was slowing and he managed to speak calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re still in range here. Get your men and retire with your company\u2014back to the ridgeline. Join Captain Moxley; tell him to come round and join me . . .\u201d His mind went blank for a moment, trying to think of some reasonable place for a rendezvous. \u201cSouth of the farmhouse. With Woodbine\u2019s company.\u201d He took his hand off Guthrie.</p><p>\u201cAye, sir.\u201d The man scuffed up onto hands and knees, reaching for the hat that had fallen off. He glanced back at Jamie, eyes full of earnest concern.</p><p>\u201cAre you hit bad, sir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s blood all down your face, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Go!\u201d</p><p>Guthrie swallowed, nodded, wiped his face on his sleeve, and made off through the grass, as fast as he could go. Jamie put a hand to his own face, belatedly aware of a slight sting across his cheekbone. Sure enough, his fingers came away bloody. Not a grasshopper, then.</p><p>He wiped his fingers on the skirt of his coat and noticed mechanically that the seam of the sleeve had burst at the shoulder, showing the white shirt beneath. He rose a little, cautious, looking round for Bixby, but there was no sign of him. Maybe dead in the long grass, too; maybe not. With luck, he\u2019d seen what was happening and run back to warn the companies coming up. The horse was still where he\u2019d left it, thank God, tethered to a fence, fifty yards away.</p><p>He hesitated for a moment, but there wasn\u2019t time to lose in looking for Bixby. Woodsworth and his two companies would be coming round the orchard in a few minutes, and right into range of the German rifles. He popped up and ran.</p><p>Something tugged at his coat, but he didn\u2019t stop, and reached his horse, gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cTiugainn!\u201d he said, swinging up into the saddle. He turned away from the orchard and galloped through a potato field, though it bruised his farmer\u2019s heart to see what the armies\u2019 passing had done to it already.</p><p>I DON\u2019T KNOW when physicians began calling it \u201cthe Golden Hour,\u201d but surely every battlefield medic from the time of the Iliad onward knows about it. From the time of an accident or injury that isn\u2019t immediately fatal, the victim\u2019s chances of living are best if he receives treatment within an hour of sustaining the injury. After that, shock, continued loss of blood, debility due to pain . . . the chance of saving a patient goes sharply downhill.</p><p>Add in blazing temperatures, lack of water, and the stress of running full out through fields and woods, wearing wool homespun and carrying heavy weapons, inhaling powder smoke, and trying either to kill someone or avoid being killed, just prior to being injured, and I rather thought we were looking at a Golden fifteen minutes or so.</p><p>Given also the fact that the wounded were having to be carried or to walk\u2014probably more than a mile\u2014to a place where they could find assistance . . . I supposed we were doing well to save as many as we were. If only temporarily, I added grimly to myself, hearing the screaming from inside the church.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, dear?\u201d I said to the young man in front of me. He couldn\u2019t be more than seventeen and was precious near to bleeding to death. A bullet had gone through the meat of his upper arm, which would normally be a fortuitous location for a wound. Unfortunately, in this instance the ball had passed through the underside of the arm and nicked the brachial artery, which had been spurting blood in a slow but earnest manner until I\u2019d taken a death grip on his arm.</p><p>\u201cPrivate Adams, ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied, though his lips were white and he was shaking. \u201cBilly, they call me,\u201d he added politely.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you, Billy,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you, sir . . . ?\u201d For he\u2019d been brought in staggering, leaning on another boy of about his own age\u2014and nearly as white-faced, though I thought he wasn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cHoratio Wilkinson, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, dipping his head in an awkward bow\u2014the best he could manage while holding his friend upright.</p><p>\u201cLovely, Horatio,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve got him now. Would you pour him out a little water, with a splash of brandy in it? Just there.\u201d I nodded at the packing case I was using for a table, on which one of my brown bottles marked POISON stood, along with a canteen full of water and wooden cups. \u201cAnd as soon as he\u2019s drunk it, give him that leather strip to bite down on.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d have told Horatio to have a tot, too, save that there were only two cups, and the second one was mine. I was sipping water steadily\u2014my bodice was soaked and clung to me like the membrane inside an eggshell, and sweat ran steadily down my legs\u2014and I didn\u2019t want to be sharing the germs of assorted soldiers who didn\u2019t brush their teeth regularly. Still, I might have to tell him to take a quick gulp direct from the brandy bottle; someone was going to have to apply pressure to Billy Adams\u2019s arm while I stitched his brachial artery, and Horatio Wilkinson didn\u2019t presently look equal to the task.</p><p>\u201cWould you\u2014\u201d I began, but I was holding a scalpel and a suture needle with a dangling ligature in my free hand, and the sight of these overcame young Mr. Wilkinson. His eyes rolled up in his head and he dropped, boneless, into the gravel.</p><p>\u201cWounded?\u201d said a familiar voice behind me, and I turned my head to see Denzell Hunter looking down at Mr. Wilkinson. He was nearly as pale as Horatio and, with strands of hair come loose and clinging to his cheeks, very much the antithesis of his usual collected self.</p><p>\u201cFainted,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are idiots,\u201d he said, so pale\u2014with rage, I now realized\u2014that he could barely speak. \u201cRegimental surgeons, they call themselves! A good quarter of them have never seen a man wounded in battle before. And those who have are barely capable of anything in the way of treatment save the crudest amputation. A company of barbers would do better!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they stop bleeding?\u201d I asked, taking his hand and wrapping it round my patient\u2019s upper arm. He automatically pressed his thumb to the brachial artery near the armpit, and the spurting that had started when I took my own hand away stopped again. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Yes, most of them can do that,\u201d he admitted, calming down just a little. \u201cBut they are so jealous of privilege\u2014and so much affiliated with their own regiments\u2014that some are letting a wounded man die because he is not one of theirs and his own regimental surgeon is otherwise occupied!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScandalous,\u201d I murmured, and, \u201cBite hard now, Private,\u201d as I thrust the leather between his teeth and made a quick incision to enlarge the wound enough to find the end of the severed artery. He did bite, and made no more than a low grunting noise as the scalpel sliced into his flesh; perhaps he was sufficiently in shock that he didn\u2019t feel it much\u2014I hoped not.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t a lot of choice,\u201d I observed, glancing toward the big shade trees that edged the graveyard. Dottie was minding the victims of heatstroke, giving them water and\u2014as time and buckets permitted\u2014dousing them with it. Rachel was in charge of depressed head fractures, abdominal wounds, and other serious wounds that couldn\u2019t be treated by amputation or binding and splinting. In most cases, this amounted to nothing more than comforting them as they died, but she was a good, steady girl, who had seen a great many men die during the winter at Valley Forge; she didn\u2019t shrink from the job.</p><p>\u201cWe have to let them\u201d\u2014I jerked my chin toward the church, my hands being occupied in holding Private Adams\u2019s arm and ligating the severed vessel\u2014\u201cdo what they\u2019re able to do. Not that we could bloody stop them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Denny breathed out, let go of the arm as he saw I had the vessel tied off, and wiped his face on his coat. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t. I just needed to express my anger where it wouldn\u2019t cause more trouble. And to ask if I may have some of thy gentian ointment; I saw thee had two good-sized tubs made up.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small, wry laugh.</p><p>\u201cBe my guest. That ass Leckie sent an orderly out a little while ago to try to appropriate my stock of lint and bandages. Do you need some, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf thee has them to spare.\u201d He cast a bleak eye over the dwindling pile of supplies. \u201cDr. McGillis has sent an orderly to scavenge the neighborhood for items of use and another to carry word back to camp and bring more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake half,\u201d I said, with a nod, and finished wrapping Billy Adams\u2019s arm with as miserly a bandage as would still do the job. Horatio Wilkinson had recovered himself a little and was sitting up, though still rather pale. Denny hoisted him to his feet and dispatched him with Billy to sit in the shade for a bit.</p><p>I was digging through one of my packs for the gentian ointment when I noticed the approach of another party and straightened up to see what their state of need might be.</p><p>None of them appeared to be wounded, though all were staggering. They weren\u2019t in uniform and bore no weapons save clubs; no telling whether they were militia, or . . .</p><p>\u201cWe hear you\u2019ve some brandy, missus,\u201d one of them said, reaching out in a quasi-friendly manner and seizing me by the wrist. \u201cCome and share it with us, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of her,\u201d Denzell said, in a tone of deep menace that made the man holding my wrist actually let go in surprise. He blinked at Denzell, whom he evidently hadn\u2019t noticed before.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell\u2019re you?\u201d he asked, though more in tones of befuddled astonishment than confrontation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a surgeon with the Continental army,\u201d Denzell said firmly, and moved to stand beside me, thrusting a shoulder between me and the men, all of whom were clearly very drunk. One of them laughed at this, a high heeheehee sound, and his fellow giggled and poked him, repeating, \u201csurgeon with the Continental ar-my.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, you must go,\u201d Denzell said, edging farther in front of me. \u201cWe have wounded men who need attention.\u201d He stood with his fists loosely curled, in the attitude of a man ready to do battle\u2014though I was fairly sure he wouldn\u2019t. I hoped intimidation would do the trick, but glanced at my bottle; it was three-quarters empty\u2014perhaps it would be better to give it to them and hope they went away. . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could see a small party of wounded Continentals coming down the road, two on stretchers, and a few more stumbling, stripped to their bloodied shirts, coats in their hands being dragged in the dust. I reached for the bottle, intending to thrust it at the intruders, but a movement at the corner of my eye made me look toward the shade where the girls were tending prisoners. Both Rachel and Dottie were standing upright, watching the proceedings, and at this point, Dottie, with a strong look of determination on her face, began to walk toward us.</p><p>Denny saw her, too; I could see the sudden shift in his posture, a touch of indecision. Dorothea Grey might be a professed Quaker, but her family blood clearly had its own ideas. And I could\u2014rather to my surprise\u2014tell exactly what Denzell was thinking. One of the men had already noticed Dottie and had turned\u2014swaying\u2014in her direction. If she confronted them and one or more of them attacked her . . .</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d I interrupted the hum of interest among our visitors, and three pairs of bloodshot eyes turned slowly toward me. I withdrew one of the pistols Jamie had given me, pointed it into the air, and pulled the trigger.</p><p>It went off with a violent jerk and a blam that momentarily deafened me, along with a puff of acrid smoke that made me cough. I wiped streaming eyes on my sleeve in time to see the visitors departing hastily, with anxious looks back over their shoulders. I located a spare handkerchief tucked into my stays and wiped a smear of soot from my face, emerging from the damp linen folds to find the doors of the church occupied by several surgeons and orderlies, all goggling at me.</p> <p>Feeling rather like Annie Oakley, and repressing the urge to try to twirl my pistol\u2014mostly for fear I would drop it; it was nearly a foot long\u2014I re-holstered my weapon and took a deep breath. I felt a trifle light-headed.</p><p>Denzell was regarding me with concern. He swallowed visibly and opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d I said, my own voice sounding muffled, and nodded toward the men coming toward us. \u201cThere isn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>THE DANGERS OF SURRENDER</p><p>FOUR BLOODY HOURS. Hours spent slogging through an undulant countryside filled with mobs of Continental soldiers, clots of militia, and more bloody rocks than anyplace required for proper functioning, if you asked Grey. Unable to stand the blisters and shreds of raw skin any longer, he\u2019d taken off his shoes and stockings and thrust them into the pockets of his disreputable coat, choosing to hobble barefoot for as long as he could bear it.</p> <p>Should he meet anyone whose feet looked his size, he thought grimly, he\u2019d pick up one of the omnipresent rocks and avail himself.</p><p>He knew he was close to the British lines. He could feel the tremble in the air. The movement of large bodies of men, their rising excitement. And somewhere, no great distance away, the point where excitement was turning to action.</p><p>He\u2019d felt the presence of fighting since just past daylight. Sometimes heard shouting and the hollow boom of muskets. What would I do if I were Clinton? he\u2019d wondered.</p><p>Clinton couldn\u2019t outstrip the pursuing Rebels; that was clear. But he would have had time enough to choose decent ground on which to stand and to make some preparation.</p><p>Chances were, some part of the army\u2014Cornwallis\u2019s brigade, maybe; Clinton wouldn\u2019t leave von Knyphausen\u2019s Hessians to stand alone\u2014would have taken up some defensible position, hoping to hold off the Rebels long enough for the baggage train to get away. Then the main body would wheel and take up its own position\u2014perhaps occupying a village. He\u2019d walked through two or three such, each with its own church. Churches were good; he\u2019d sent many a scout up a steeple in his day.</p><p>Where\u2019s William most likely to be? Unarmed and unable to fight, chances were that he was with Clinton. That\u2019s where he should be. But he knew his son.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he muttered. He would, without hesitation, lay down both life and honor for William. That didn\u2019t mean he was pleased at the prospect of having to do so.</p><p>Granted, the current circumstance was not William\u2019s fault. He had to admit\u2014reluctantly\u2014that it was at least in part his own. He\u2019d allowed William to undertake intelligence work for Ezekiel Richardson. He should have looked much more closely into Richardson . . .</p><p>The thought of having been gulled by the man was almost as upsetting as what Percy had told him.</p><p>He could only hope to run across Richardson in circumstances that would allow him to kill the man unobtrusively. But if it had to be at high noon in full view of General Clinton and his staff\u2014so bloody be it.</p><p>He was inflamed in every particular of his being, knew it, and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>There were men coming, rumbling up the road behind him. Americans, disorderly, with wagons or caissons. He stepped off the road and stood still in the shade of a tree, waiting for them to pass.</p><p>It was a group of Continentals, pulling cannon. Fairly small: ten guns, and only four-pounders. Pulled by men, not mules. It was the only artillery he\u2019d seen in the course of the morning, though; was it all Washington possessed?</p><p>They didn\u2019t notice him. He waited a few minutes, until they were out of sight, and followed in their wake.</p> <p>HE HEARD MORE cannon, some way to his left, and paused to listen. British, by God! He\u2019d had somewhat to do with artillery, early in his military career, and the rhythm of a working gun crew was embedded in his bones.</p><p>Sponge piece!</p><p>Load piece!</p><p>Ram!</p><p>Fire!</p><p>A single artillery unit. Ten-pounders, six of them. They had something in range but weren\u2019t being attacked; the firing was sporadic, not that of hot combat.</p><p>Though, to be fair, any physical effort whatever had to be described as \u201chot\u201d today. He lunged into a patch of trees, exhaling in relief at the shade. He was ready to expire in his black coat and took it off for a moment\u2019s respite. Dare he abandon the bloody thing altogether?</p><p>He\u2019d seen a band of militia earlier, shirtsleeved, some with kerchiefs tied over their heads against the sun. Coated, though, he might bluff his way as a militia surgeon\u2014the beastly garment smelled badly enough.</p><p>He worked his tongue, bringing a little saliva to his dry mouth. Why the devil had he not thought to bring a canteen when he\u2019d fled? Thirst decided him to make his move now.</p><p>Dressed as he was, he might well be shot by any infantryman or dragoon who saw him, before he could speak a word. But while cannon were very effective indeed against a massed enemy, they were almost useless against a single man, as the aim couldn\u2019t be adjusted quickly enough to bear, unless the man was fool enough to advance in a straight line\u2014and Grey was not that foolish.</p><p>Granted, the officer in charge of each gun\u2019s crew would be armed with sword and pistol, but a single man approaching an artillery unit on foot could be no conceivable danger; sheer amazement would likely let him get within earshot. And pistols were so inaccurate at anything over ten paces, he wasn\u2019t risking much anyway, he reasoned.</p><p>He hastened his step as much as he could, a wary eye out. There were a lot of Continental troops in his vicinity now, marching furiously. The regulars would take him for walking wounded, but he daren\u2019t try to surrender to the British lines while combat was joined, or he\u2019d be the walking dead in short order.</p><p>The artillery in the orchard might be his best chance, hair-raising as it was to walk into the mouths of the guns. With a muffled oath, he put his shoes back on and began to run.</p><p>HE RAN HEAD-ON into a militia company, but they were headed somewhere at the trot and gave him no more than a cursory glance. He swerved aside into a hedgerow, where he floundered for a moment before breaking through. He was in a narrow field, much trampled, and on the other side of it was an apple orchard, only the crowns of the trees showing above a heavy cloud of white powder smoke.</p><p>He caught a glimpse of movement beyond the orchard and risked a few steps to the side to look\u2014then ducked back hastily out of sight. American militia, men in hunting shirts or homespun, a few shirtless and glistening with sweat. They were massing there, likely planning a rush into the orchard from behind, in hopes of capturing or disabling the guns.</p><p>They were making a good deal of noise, and the guns had stopped firing. Plainly the artillerymen knew the Americans were there and would be making preparations to resist. Not the best time to come calling, then . . .</p><p>But then he heard the drums. Well in the distance, to the east of the orchard, but the sound carried clearly. British infantry on the march. A better prospect than the artillery in the orchard. Moving, infantry wouldn\u2019t be disposed or prepared to shoot a single, unarmed man, no matter how he was dressed. And if he could get close enough to attract the attention of an officer . . . but he\u2019d still have to cross the open ground below the orchard in order to reach the infantry before they\u2019d marched off out of reach.</p><p>Biting his lip with exasperation, he shoved through the hedgerow and ran through the clouds of drifting smoke. A shot cracked the air much too near him. He flung himself into the grass by instinct, but then leapt up and ran again, gasping for breath. Christ, there were riflemen in the orchard, defending the cannon! Jaegers.</p><p>But most of the riflemen must be facing the other way, ready to meet the gathering militia, for no more shots came on this side of the orchard. He slowed down, pressing a hand to the stitch in his side. He was past the orchard now. He could still hear the drums, though they were drawing away . . . keep going, keep going . . .</p><p>\u201cHoy! You there!\u201d He should have kept going but, short of breath and unsure who was calling, paused for an instant, half-turning. Only half, because a solid body hurtled through the air and knocked him down.</p><p>He hit the ground on one elbow and was already grappling the man\u2019s head with his other hand, wet greasy hair sliding through his fingers. He jabbed at the man\u2019s face, squirmed eel-like out from under his weight, kneeing the fellow in the stomach as he moved, and made it lurching to his feet.</p><p>\u201cStop right there!\u201d The voice cracked absurdly, shooting up into a falsetto, and startled him so that he did stop, gasping for breath.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . no-account . . . filthy . . .\u201d The man\u2014no, by God, it was a boy!\u2014who\u2019d knocked him down was getting to his feet. He had a large stone in his hand; his brother\u2014it had to be his brother; they looked like two peas in a pod, both half grown and gawky as turkey poults\u2014had a good-sized club.</p><p>Grey\u2019s hand had gone to his waist as he\u2019d risen, ready to draw the dagger Percy had given him. He\u2019d seen these boys before, he thought\u2014the sons of the commander of one of the New Jersey militia companies?\u2014and, rather clearly, they\u2019d seen him before, too.</p><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d One of them yelled at him. \u201cBloody f**king spy!\u201d They were between him and the distant infantry company; the orchard was at his back, and the three of them were well within range of any Hessian rifleman who happened to look in their direction.</p><p>\u201cLook\u2014\u201d he began, but could see that it was pointless. Something had happened; they were crazed with something\u2014terror, anger, grief?\u2014that made their features shift like water and their limbs tremble with the need to do something immediate and violent. They were boys, but both taller than he was and quite capable of doing him the damage they clearly intended.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Fraser,\u201d he said loudly, hoping to jar them into uncertainty. \u201cWhere is General Fraser?\u201d</p><p>THE PRICE OF BURNT SIENNA</p><p>\u201cCOMPANIES ALL present, sir!\u201d Robert MacCammon rushed up, panting. He was a heavyset man, and even the gently rolling fields and meadows were hard on him; the dark stains in his oxters were the size of dinner plates.</p><p>\u201cAye, good.\u201d Jamie glanced beyond Major MacCammon and saw Lieutenant Herbert\u2019s company emerging from a small wood, glancing cautiously round, their weapons in their hands. They were doing well, untrained as they were, and he was pleased with them.</p><p>Lord, let me bring them through it as best I can.</p><p>This prayer barely formed in his mind, he turned to look toward the west, and froze. On the slope below him, no more than a hundred yards away, he saw the two Craddock boys, armed with a rock and a stick, respectively, menacing a man whose back was turned to him but whose bare, cropped blond head was instantly recognizable, even without the stained bandage tied round it.</p><p>Then he saw Grey put a hand to his waist and knew beyond the shadow of doubt that it was a knife he reached for.</p><p>\u201cCraddock!!\u201d he bellowed, and the boys both started. One dropped his rock and stooped to pick it up again, exposing his scrawny neck to Grey. Grey looked at the vulnerable expanse of flesh, glanced bleakly at the older boy, gripping his stick like a cricket bat, then up the slope at Jamie, and let both hands and shoulders drop.</p><p>\u201cIfrinn!\u201d Jamie muttered under his breath. \u201cStay here,\u201d he said briefly to Bixby, and ran down the slope, stumbling and pushing his way through a thick growth of alders that left sticky sap all over his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere the devil is your company?\u201d he demanded without preamble, breathing hard as he came up with the boys and Grey.</p><p>\u201cOh. Er . . .\u201d The younger Craddock looked to his brother to answer.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t find \u2019em, sir,\u201d the older boy said, and swallowed. \u201cWe were looking, when we run into a party of redcoats and had to scamper pretty quick to get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we saw him,\u201d the younger Craddock said, thrusting out his chin at Grey. \u201cEverybody in camp had said as how he was a redcoat spy, and, sure enough, there he was, makin\u2019 for them, waving and callin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we thought as how it was our duty to stop him, sir,\u201d the older boy put in, anxious not to be eclipsed by his brother.</p><p>\u201cAye, I see.\u201d Jamie rubbed the spot between his eyebrows, which felt as though a small, painful knot had formed there. He glanced over his shoulder. Men were still running up from the south, but the rest of Craddock\u2019s company was nearly all there, milling anxiously and looking in his direction. No wonder: he could hear British drums, near at hand. Doubtless that was the company the boys had run into\u2014the one Grey had been making for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWenn ich etwas sagen d\u00fcrfte,\u201d Grey said in German, with a glance at the Craddocks. If I might speak . . .</p><p>\u201cYou may not, sir,\u201d Jamie replied, with some grimness. There wasn\u2019t time\u2014and if these two wee blockheids survived to get back to camp, they\u2019d recount every word that had passed between Grey and him to anyone who would listen. The last thing he could afford was for them to report him involved in foreign confabulation with an English spy.</p><p>\u201cI am in search of my son!\u201d Grey switched to English, with another glance at the Craddocks. \u201cI have reason to believe he\u2019s in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is everyone else out here,\u201d Jamie replied with an edge, though his heart jerked in his chest. So that was why Grey had broken his parole. \u201cIn danger from whom?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir! Sir!\u201d Bixby\u2019s voice was shouting from the other side of the alders, high and urgent. He had to go, and quickly.</p><p>\u201cComing, Mr. Bixby!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill them?\u201d he asked Grey abruptly, and jerked his head toward the Craddocks. \u201cIf you got past them, you could have made it.\u201d</p><p>One fair brow arched above the handkerchief binding Grey\u2019s bad eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d forgive me for Claire\u2014but not for killing your . . . men.\u201d He glanced at the two Craddocks, spotty as a pair of raisin puddings and\u2014Grey\u2019s look implied\u2014likely no brighter.</p><p>For a split second, the urge to punch him again surged up from Jamie\u2019s bowels, and for the same split second, the knowledge of it showed on John Grey\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t flinch, and his good eye widened in a pale-blue stare. This time, he\u2019d fight back.</p> <p>Jamie closed his eyes for an instant, forcibly setting anger aside.</p><p>\u201cGo with this man,\u201d he said to the Craddocks. \u201cHe is your prisoner.\u201d He pulled one of the pistols from his belt and presented it to the elder Craddock, who received it with wide-eyed respect. Jamie didn\u2019t bother telling the lad it was neither loaded nor primed.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d he said evenly to Grey. \u201cGo with them behind the lines. If the Rebels still hold Englishtown, guide them there.\u201d</p><p>Grey nodded curtly, lips compressed, and turned to go.</p><p>He reached out and caught Grey by the shoulder. The man whipped round, blood in his eye.</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Jamie said, speaking loudly enough to be sure the Crad-dock boys could hear him. \u201cI revoke your parole.\u201d He fixed Grey\u2019s single-eyed glare with one of his own. \u201cD\u2019ye understand me? When you reach Englishtown, ye\u2019ll surrender yourself to Captain McCorkle.\u201d</p> <p>Grey\u2019s mouth twitched, but he said nothing and gave the merest nod of acknowledgment before turning away.</p><p>Jamie turned, too, running for his waiting companies, but risked a single glance over his shoulder.</p><p>Shooing the Craddocks before him, awkward and flapping as a pair of geese bound for market, Grey was headed smartly to the south, toward the American lines\u2014if the concept of \u201clines\u201d held any meaning in this goddamned battle.</p><p>Grey had certainly understood, and despite the present emergency, a weight lifted from Jamie\u2019s heart. With his parole revoked, John Grey was once more a prisoner of war, in the custody of his jailors, officially without freedom of movement. But also without the obligation of honor that would hold him prisoner on his own recognizance. Without parole, his primary duty now was that of any soldier in the hands of his enemy\u2014escape.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d Bixby arrived at his shoulder, panting. \u201cThere are redcoats\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Mr. Bixby. I hear them. Let\u2019s be having them, then.\u201d</p><p>IF IT WEREN\u2019T for the coloring book, I might not have noticed immediately. In third or fourth grade, Brianna had had a coloring book featuring scenes from the American Revolution. Sanitized, suitably romantic scenes: Paul Revere flying through the night on a galloping horse, Washington crossing the Delaware while exhibiting (as Frank pointed out) a lamentable lack of seamanship . . . and a double-paged spread featuring Molly Pitcher, that gallant woman who had carried water to the heat-stricken troops (left-hand page) and then taken her wounded husband\u2019s place to serve his cannon (right-hand page)\u2014at the Battle of Monmouth.</p><p>Which, it had dawned on me, was very likely what the battle we were engaged in was going to be called, once anyone got round to naming it. Monmouth Courthouse was only two or three miles from my present location.</p> <p>I wiped my face once more\u2014this gesture did nothing for the perspiration, which was instantly renewed, but, judging from the state of my three soggy handkerchiefs, was removing a fair amount of dirt from my countenance\u2014and glanced toward the east, where I had been hearing distant cannon fire most of the day. Was she there?</p><p>\u201cWell, George Washington certainly is,\u201d I murmured to myself, pouring out a fresh cup of water and returning to my work rinsing out bloody cloths in a bucket of salt water. \u201cWhy not Molly Pitcher?\u201d</p><p>It had been a complicated picture to color, and as Bree had just got to the phase where she insisted that things be colored \u201creal,\u201d the cannon could not be pink or orange, and Frank had obligingly drawn several crude cannon on a sheet of paper and tried out everything from gray (with shadings of black, blue, blue-violet, and even cornflower) to brown, with tints of burnt sienna and gold, before they finally settled\u2014Frank\u2019s opinion as to actual historicity of cannon being diffidently advanced\u2014on black with dark green shadings.</p><p>Lacking credentials, I had been relegated to coloring in the grass, though I also got to help with the dramatic shading of Mrs. Pitcher\u2019s raggedly streaming clothes, once Brianna got tired of it. I looked up, the smell of crayons strong in my memory, and saw a small group coming down the road.</p><p>There were two Continental regulars\u2014and a man in what I recognized as the light-green uniform of Skinner\u2019s Greens, a Provincial Loyalist regiment. He was stumbling badly, though supported on both sides by the Continentals. The shorter of these also seemed to be wounded; he had a bloodstained scarf wrapped around one arm. The other was looking from side to side as though on guard, but didn\u2019t seem to be wounded.</p><p>At first I\u2019d looked at the Provincial, who must be a prisoner. But then I looked more closely at the wounded Continental supporting him. And with Molly Pitcher so clearly and recently in mind, I realized with a small shock that the Continental was a woman. The Continental\u2019s coat covered her hips, but I could plainly see the way in which her legs slanted in toward the knee; a man\u2019s thighbones run straight up and down, but a woman\u2019s width of pelvic basin compels a slightly knock-kneed stance.</p><p>It also became clear, by the time they reached me, that the wounded soldiers were related: both were short and thin, with squared-off chins and sloping shoulders. The Provincial was definitely male, though\u2014his face was thickly stubbled\u2014while his . . . sister? They seemed close in age . . . was clear-skinned as an egg and nearly as white.</p><p>The Provincial was not. He was red as a blast furnace and nearly as hot to the touch. His eyes were white slits, and his head wobbled on his spindly neck.</p><p>\u201cIs he wounded?\u201d I asked sharply, putting a hand under his shoulder to ease him down onto a stool. He went limp the moment his bu**ocks touched it and would have fallen to the ground had I not tightened my grip. The girl gave a frightened gasp and put out a hand toward him, but she also staggered and would have fallen, had the other man not seized her by the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cHe took a blow to the head,\u201d the male Continental said. \u201cI\u2014hit him with the hilt of my sword.\u201d This admission was made with some embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHelp me lay him down.\u201d I ran my hand over the Provincial\u2019s head, detecting an ugly, contused wound under his hair, but found no crepitation, no sense of a skull fracture. Concussion, likely, but maybe no worse. He began to twitch under my hand, though, and the tip of his tongue protruded from his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d I said, under my breath, but not far enough under, for the girl gave a small, despairing cry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s heatstroke,\u201d I told her at once, hoping this might sound reassuring. The reality was far from it; once they collapsed and fell into seizures, they usually died. Their core temperature was far above what the systems of the body could tolerate, and seizing like that was often an indication that brain damage had started to occur. Still\u2014</p><p>\u201cDottie!\u201d I bellowed, and made urgent gestures at her, then turned to the sound\u2014but very frightened-looking\u2014Continental soldier. \u201cSee that young woman in gray? Drag him over into the shade where she is; she\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d It was simple. Pour water over him and\u2014if possible\u2014into him. That was the sum total of what could be done. Meanwhile . . .</p><p>I got hold of the girl by the non-wounded arm and sat her down on the stool, hastily pouring most of what remained in my brandy bottle into a cup. She didn\u2019t look as though she had much blood left.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. When I got the scarf off, I discovered that her hand was missing, and the forearm badly mangled. She hadn\u2019t bled to death only because someone had twined a belt round her upper arm and fastened the tourniquet tight with a stick thrust through it. It had been a long time since I\u2019d fainted at sight of anything, and I didn\u2019t now, but did have one brief moment when the world shifted under my feet.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that, sweetheart?\u201d I asked, as calmly as possible. \u201cHere, drink this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014grenado,\u201d she whispered. Her head was turned away, not to see the arm, but I guided the cup to her lips and she drank, gulping the mix of brandy and water.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014he picked it up,\u201d said a low, choked voice at my elbow. The other Continental was back. \u201cIt rolled by my foot and he\u2014she picked it up.\u201d</p><p>The girl turned her head at his voice, and I saw his anguished look.</p><p>\u201cShe came into the army because of you, I suppose?\u201d Clearly the arm would have to be amputated; there was nothing below the elbow that could be saved, and to leave it in this state was to doom her to death by infection or gangrene.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t!\u201d the girl said, huffing for breath. \u201cPhil\u2014\u201d She gulped air and twisted her head to look toward the trees. \u201cHe tried to make me go with him. Loyalist c-camp . . . follower. Wouldn\u2019t.\u201d With so little blood remaining in her body, she was having trouble getting enough oxygen. I refilled the cup and made her drink again; she emerged from it spluttering and swaying, but more alert. \u201cI\u2019m a patriot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I tried to make her go home, ma\u2019am,\u201d the young man blurted. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t anyone left to look out for her.\u201d His hand hovered an inch from her back, wanting to touch her, waiting to catch her if she fell over.</p><p>\u201cI see. Him\u2014\u201d I nodded toward Dottie\u2019s station under the trees, where the man with heatstroke lay in the shade. \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t the strength to nod, but closed her eyes briefly in acquiescence.</p><p>\u201cHer father died just after Saratoga.\u201d The young man looked completely wretched. Christ, he couldn\u2019t be more than seventeen, and she looked about fourteen, though she must be older. \u201cPhillip was already gone; he\u2019d broke with his father when he joined the Provincials. I\u2014\u201d His voice broke, and he shut his mouth hard and touched her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, dear?\u201d I said. I\u2019d loosened the tourniquet to check that there was still blood flow to the elbow; there was. Possibly the joint could be saved.</p><p>\u201cSally,\u201d she whispered. Her lips were white, but her eyes were open. \u201cSarah.\u201d All my amputation saws were in the church with Denzell\u2014I couldn\u2019t send her in there. I\u2019d stuck my head in once and nearly been knocked over by the thick smell of blood and excrement\u2014even more by the atmosphere of pain and terror and the sounds of butchery.</p><p>There were more wounded coming along the road; someone would have to tend them. I hesitated for no more than a minute.</p><p>Both Rachel and Dottie had the necessary resolve to deal with things and the physical presence to command distraught people. Rachel\u2019s manner came from months of experience at Valley Forge, Dottie\u2019s more from a habit of autocratic expectation that people would of course do what she wanted them to. Both of them inspired confidence, and I was proud of them. Between them, they were managing as well as could be expected, and\u2014I thought\u2014much better than the surgeons and their assistants in the church, though these were commendably quick about their bloody business.</p><p>\u201cDottie!\u201d I called again, and beckoned. She rose and came at the trot, wiping her face on her apron. I saw her look at the girl\u2014at Sarah\u2014then turn with a brief look at the bodies on the grass, and turn back with a look in which curiosity, horror, and a desperate compassion were blended. So the brother was dead already, or dying.</p><p>\u201cGo and get Denzell, Dottie,\u201d I said, moving just a little so that she could see the mangled arm. She turned white and swallowed. \u201cTell him to bring my bow-frame saw and a small tenaculum.\u201d</p><p>Sarah and the young man made small gasps of horror at the word \u201csaw,\u201d and then he moved swiftly, touching her at last, gripping her by her sound shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, Sally,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019ll marry you! Won\u2019t make a blind bit of difference to me. I mean\u2014your\u2014your arm.\u201d He swallowed, hard, and I realized that he needed water, too, and passed over the canteen.</p><p>\u201cLike . . . hell,\u201d Sally said. Her eyes were dark and bright as unfired coal in her white face. \u201cI won\u2019t\u2014be married for pity. Damn . . . you. Nor guilt. Don\u2019t . . . need you!\u201d</p><p>The young man\u2019s face was blank with surprise\u2014and, I thought, affront.</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you going to live on?\u201d he demanded, indignant. \u201cYou don\u2019t own a thing in this world but that damned uniform! You\u2014you\u2014\u201d He pounded a fist on his leg in frustration. \u201cYou can\u2019t even whore, with one arm!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glared at him, breathing slow and hard. After a moment, a thought crossed her face and she nodded a little and turned to me.</p><p>\u201cYou reckon the army might . . . pay me . . . a pension?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I could see Denzell now, blood-splattered but collected, hurrying across the gravel with the box of surgical instruments. I would have sold my soul for ether or laudanum, but had neither. I took a deep breath of my own.</p><p>\u201cI expect they will. They\u2019ll give Molly Pitcher one; why not you?\u201d</p> <p>IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME</p><p>WILLIAM TOUCHED his jaw gingerly, congratulating himself that Tarleton had only managed to hit him in the face once, and it hadn\u2019t been in the nose. His ribs, arms, and abdomen were another matter, and his clothes were muddy and his shirt rent, but it wouldn\u2019t be apparent to a casual observer that he\u2019d been in a fight. He might just get away with it\u2014so long as Captain Andr\u00e9 didn\u2019t happen to mention the dispatch to the British Legion. After all, Sir Henry had had his hands full during the morning, if half what William had heard along his way was true.</p><p>A wounded infantry captain on his way back to camp had told of seeing Sir Henry, in command of the rear guard, lead a charge against the Americans, getting so far out to the front that he was nearly captured before the men behind came up to him. William had burned, hearing this\u2014he would have loved to be part of that. But at least he hadn\u2019t stayed mewed up in the clerks\u2019 tent. . . .</p><p>He was no more than a quarter mile along his way back to Cornwallis\u2019s brigade when Goth threw a shoe. William said something very bad, pulled up, and swung down to have a look. He found the shoe, but two nails had gone and a quick search didn\u2019t turn them up; no chance of hammering it back on with the heel of his boot, which had been his first thought.</p><p>He shoved the shoe in his pocket and looked round. Soldiers swarmed in every direction, but there was a company of Hessian grenadiers on the opposite side of the ravine, forming up at the bridgehead. He led Goth across, stepping gingerly.</p> <p>\u201cHallo!\u201d he called to the nearest fellow. \u201cWo ist der n\u00e4chste Hufschmied?\u201d</p><p>The man glanced indifferently at him and shrugged. A young fellow, though, pointed across the bridge and called out, \u201cZwei Kompanien hinter uns kommen Husaren!\u201d Hussars are coming, two companies behind!</p><p>\u201cDanke!\u201d William called back, and led Goth into the sparse shade of a stand of spindly pines. Well, that was luck. He wouldn\u2019t have to walk the horse a long way; he could wait for the farrier and his wagon to come to him. Still, he fretted at the delay.</p><p>Every nerve was keyed tight as a harpsichord string; he kept touching his belt, where his weapons would normally be. He could hear the sounds of musket fire in the far distance, but couldn\u2019t see a thing. The countryside was folded up like a leporello, rolling meadow diving suddenly into wooded ravines, then springing back out, only to disappear again.</p><p>He dug out his handkerchief, so soggy by now that it served only to sluice the sweat from his face. He caught a faint breath of coolness wafting up from the creek, forty feet below, and walked nearer the edge in hopes of more. He drank warm water from his canteen, wishing he could scramble down and drink from the stream, but he daren\u2019t; he might get down the steep slope without trouble, but coming back up would be an awkward climb, and he couldn\u2019t risk missing the farrier.</p><p>\u201cEr spricht Deutsch. Er geh\u00f6rt!\u201d Heard what? He hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the grenadiers\u2019 sporadic conversation, but these hissed words came to him clearly, and he glanced round to see who it was they were saying spoke German, only to see two of the grenadiers quite close behind him. One of them grinned nervously at him, and he stiffened.</p> <p>Suddenly two more were there, between him and the bridge. \u201cWas ist hier los?\u201d he demanded sharply. \u201cWas machst Ihr da?\u201d What is this? What are you doing?</p><p>A burly fellow pulled an apologetic face.</p><p>\u201cVerzeihung. Ihr seid hier falsch.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m in the wrong place? Before William could say anything more, they closed on him. He elbowed, punched, kicked, and butted wildly, but it didn\u2019t last more than a few seconds. Hands pulled his arms behind him, and the burly fellow said once more, \u201cVerzeihung,\u201d and, still looking apologetic, bashed him in the head with a rock.</p><p>He didn\u2019t lose consciousness altogether until he hit the bottom of the ravine.</p><p>THERE WAS THE devil of a lot of fighting, Ian thought\u2014but that was about all you could say about it. There was a good deal of movement\u2014particularly among the Americans\u2014and whenever they met with a group of redcoats, there was fighting, often ferocious fighting. But the countryside was so irregular, the armies seldom came together anywhere in large numbers.</p><p>He had found his way around several companies of British infantry more or less lying in wait, though, and beyond this vanguard were a goodly number of British, regimental banners in the midst of them. Would it help to know who was in command here? He wasn\u2019t sure he could tell, even if he was close enough to make out the details of the banners.</p><p>His left arm ached, and he rubbed it absently. The ax wound had healed well, though the scar was still raised and tender\u2014but the arm hadn\u2019t yet recovered anything like its full strength, and loosing an arrow at the Indian scouts earlier had left the muscles quivering and jumping, with a burning deep in the bone.</p> <p>\u201cBest not try that again,\u201d he murmured to Rollo\u2014then remembered that the dog wasn\u2019t with him.</p><p>He looked up and discovered that one of the Indian scouts was with him, though. Or at least he thought so. Twenty yards away, an Abenaki warrior sat on a rawboned pony, eyeing Ian thoughtfully. Yes, Abenaki, he was sure of it, seeing the scalp shaved clean from brows to crown and the band of black paint across the eyes, the long shell earrings that brushed the man\u2019s shoulders, their nacre glittering in the sun.</p><p>Even as he made these observations, he was turning his own mount, seeking shelter. The main body of men was a good two hundred yards distant, standing in open meadow, but there were stands of chestnut and poplar, and perhaps a half mile back the way he\u2019d come, the rolling land dipped into one of the big ravines. Wouldn\u2019t do to be trapped in the low ground, but if he had enough lead, it was a good way to disappear. He kicked his horse sharply and they shot off, turning abruptly left as they passed a patch of thick growth\u2014and a good thing, too, because he heard something heavy whiz past his head and go crashing into the growth. Throwing stick? Tomahawk?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter; the only important thing was that the man who\u2019d thrown it was no longer holding it. He did look back, though\u2014and saw the second Abenaki come round the grove from the other side, ready to cut him off. The second one shouted something and the other answered\u2014hunting cries. Beast in view.</p><p>\u201cCuidich mi, a Dhia!\u201d he said, and jammed his heels hard into his horse\u2019s sides. The new mare was a good horse, and they made it out of the open ground, crashed through a small copse of trees and out the other side to find a rail fence before them. It was too close to stop, and they didn\u2019t; the horse dropped her hindquarters, bunched, and soared over, back hooves clipping the top rail with a solid whank! that made Ian bite his tongue.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look back but bent low over his horse\u2019s neck, and they ran flat out for the curving land he could see before him, dropping down. He turned and ran at an angle, not wanting to hit the edge of the ravine straight on, in case it should be steep just there. . . . No sound from behind save the rumble and clash of the army massing. No yelps, no hunting calls from the Abenaki.</p><p>There it was, the thick growth that marked the edge of the ravine. He slowed and now risked a look over his shoulder. Nothing, and he breathed and let the horse slow to a walk, picking their way along the edge, looking for a good way down. The bridge was just visible above him, maybe fifty yards distant, but no one was on it\u2014yet.</p><p>He could hear men fighting in the ravine\u2014perhaps three hundred yards from where he was\u2014but there was sufficient growth that he was hidden from them. Only a scuffle, from the sounds\u2014he\u2019d heard or seen that a dozen times already today; men on both sides, driven by thirst down to the creeks that had carved the ravines, occasionally meeting and going for one another in a bloody splash among the shallows.</p><p>The thought of it reminded him of his own thirst\u2014and the horse\u2019s, for the creature was stretching out her neck, nostrils greedily flaring at the scent of water.</p><p>He slid off and led the way down to the creek\u2019s edge, careful of loose stones and boggy earth\u2014the creek bank here was mostly soft mud, edged with mats of duckweed and small reedbeds. A glimpse of red caught his eye and he tensed, but it was a British soldier, facedown in the mud and clearly dead, his legs swaying in the current.</p><p>He shucked his moccasins and edged out into the water himself; the creek was fairly wide here and only a couple of feet deep, with a silty bottom; he sank in ankle-deep. He edged out again and led the horse farther up the ravine, looking for better footing, though the mare was desperate for the water, pushing Ian with her head; she wouldn\u2019t wait long.</p><p>The sounds of the skirmish had faded; he could hear men up above and some way off, but nothing in the ravine itself anymore.</p><p>There, that would do. He let the horse\u2019s reins fall, and she lunged for the creek, stood with her forefeet sunk in mud but her hind feet solid on a patch of gravel, blissfully gulping water. Ian felt the pull of the water nearly as much and sank to his knees, feeling the blissful chill as it soaked his clout and leggings, that sensation fading instantly to nothingness as he cupped his hands and drank, and cupped and drank again and again, choking now and then in the effort to drink faster than he could swallow.</p><p>At last he stopped\u2014reluctantly\u2014and dashed water over his face and chest; it was cooling, though the bear grease in his paint made the water bead and run off his skin.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said to the horse. \u201cYe\u2019ll burst and ye keep on like that, amaidan.\u201d It took some struggle, but he got the horse\u2019s nose out of the creek, water and bits of green weed sloshing out of the loose-lipped mouth as the horse snorted and shook her head. It was while hauling the horse\u2019s head round in order to lead her up the bank that he saw the other British soldier.</p><p>This one was lying near the bottom of the ravine, too, but not in the mud. He was lying facedown, but with his head turned to one side, and . . .</p><p>\u201cOch, Jesus, no!\u201d Ian flung his horse\u2019s reins hastily round a tree trunk and bounded up the slope. It was, of course. He\u2019d known it from the first glimpse of the long legs, the shape of the head, but the face made it certain, even masked with blood as it was.</p><p>William was still alive; his face twitched under the feet of a half-dozen black flies feeding on his drying blood. Ian put a hand under his jaw, the way Auntie Claire did, but, with no idea how to find a pulse or what a good one should feel like, took it away again. William was lying in the shadow of a big sycamore, but his skin was still warm\u2014it couldn\u2019t help but be, Ian thought, even if he was dead, on a day like this.</p><p>He\u2019d risen to his feet, thinking rapidly. He\u2019d need to get the bugger onto the horse, but maybe best undress him? Take off the telltale coat, at least? But what if he were to take him back toward the British lines, find someone there to take charge of him, get him to a surgeon? That was closer.</p><p>Still need to take the coat off, or the man might die of the heat before he got anywhere. So resolved, he knelt again, and thus saved his own life. The tomahawk chunked into the sycamore\u2019s trunk just where his head had been a moment before.</p><p>And, a moment later, one of the Abenaki raced down the slope and leapt on him with a shriek that blasted bad breath into his face. That split second of warning, though, was enough that he\u2019d got his feet under him and pushed to the side, heaving the Abenaki\u2019s body over his hip in a clumsy wrestling throw that landed the man in the mud four feet away.</p><p>The second one was behind him; Ian heard the man\u2019s feet in the gravel and weeds and whirled to meet the downward strike, catching the blow on his forearm, grabbing for the knife with his other hand.</p><p>He caught it\u2014by the blade, and hissed through his teeth as it cut into his palm\u2014and chopped down on the man\u2019s wrist with his half-numbed arm. The knife jarred loose. Hand and knife were slippery with blood; he couldn\u2019t get hold of the hilt but had got it away\u2014he turned and threw it as far as he could upstream, and it plunked into the water.</p><p>Then they were both on him, punching, kicking, and tearing at him. He staggered backward, lost his balance but not his grip on one of his attackers, and succeeded in falling into the creek with the man atop him. After that, he lost track.</p><p>He had one of the Abenaki on his back in the water, was trying earnestly to drown him, while the other rode his own back and tried to get an arm around his neck\u2014and then there was a racket on the other side of the ravine and everything stopped for a moment. A lot of men, moving in a disorganized sort of way\u2014he could hear drums, but there was a noise like the distant sea, incoherent voices.</p><p>The Abenaki stopped, too, just for an instant, but that was long enough: Ian twisted, flinging the man off his back, and bounded awkwardly through the water, slipping and sinking in the muddy bottom, but made it to shore and ran for the first thing that met his eye\u2014a tall white oak. He flung himself at the trunk and shinned up, grabbing at branches as they came in reach to pull himself higher, faster, reckless of his wounded hand, the rough bark scraping his skin.</p><p>The Indians were after him, but too late; one leapt and slapped at his bare foot but failed to get a grip, and he got a knee over a large branch and clung, panting, to the trunk, ten feet up. Safe? He thought so, but after a moment peered down cautiously.</p><p>The Abenaki were casting to and fro like wolves, glancing up at the noise above the rim of the ravine, then up at Ian\u2014then across the creek toward William, and that made Ian\u2019s wame curl up. God, what could he do if they should decide to go cut the man\u2019s throat? He hadn\u2019t even got a stone to throw at them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The one good thing was that neither of them seemed to have either a gun or a bow; must have left those with their horses, up above. They couldn\u2019t do anything but throw stones at him, and they seemed disinclined.</p><p>More noise from above\u2014a lot of men up there; what were they shouting?\u2014and the Abenaki abruptly abandoned Ian. They splashed back across the stream, their leggings clinging with water and streaked with black mud, paused briefly to turn William over and rummage his clothes\u2014evidently he\u2019d already been robbed, for they found nothing\u2014and then untied Ian\u2019s horse and with a last mocking call of \u201cMohawk!\u201d disappeared with the mare into a growth of pu**y willows downstream.</p><p>IAN HAD DRAGGED himself one-handed up the slope, crawled some distance, and then lay for a while under a fallen log on the edge of a clearing, spots coming and going before his eyes like a swarm of midgies. There was a lot going on nearby, but none of it near enough to cause him immediate concern. He closed his eyes, hoping that would make the spots go away. They didn\u2019t, instead turning from black to a horrid constellation of swimming pink and yellow blobs that made him want to vomit.</p><p>He hastily opened his eyes again, in time to see several powder-blackened Continental soldiers, stripped to their shirts, some bare to the waist, dragging a cannon down the road. They were followed in short order by more men and another cannon, all staggering with the heat and white-eyed with exhaustion. He recognized Colonel Owen, stumping along between the limbers, sooty face set in unhappy desperation.</p> <p>Some sense of stirring drew Ian\u2019s wandering eye away toward a group of men, and he realized with a faint sense of interest that it was a very large group of men, with a standard hanging limp as an unstuffed haggis against its pole.</p><p>That in turn stirred recognition. Sure enough, there was General Lee, long-nosed and frowning but looking very keen, riding out of the mass toward Owen.</p><p>Ian was too far away and there was too much noise to hear a word, but the trouble was obvious from Owen\u2019s gestures and pointings. One of his cannon was broken, burst, probably from the heat of firing, and another had broken free of its limber and was being dragged with ropes, its metal scraping on the rocks as it juddered along.</p><p>A dim sense of urgency was reasserting itself. William. He needed to tell someone about William. Plainly it wasn\u2019t going to be the British.</p><p>Lee\u2019s brows drew in and his lips thinned, but he kept his composure. He had bent down from his saddle to listen to Owen; now he nodded, spoke a few words, and straightened up. Owen wiped a sleeve across his face and waved to his men. They picked up their ropes and leaned into the weight, disconsolate, and Ian saw that three or four were wounded, cloths wrapped round heads or hands, one half-hopping with a bloody leg, a hand on one of the cannon for support.</p> <p>Ian\u2019s wame had begun to settle now, and he was desperately thirsty, despite having drunk his fill at the creek only a short time before. He\u2019d taken no notice where he was going but, seeing Owen\u2019s cannon come down the road, knew he must be near the bridge, though it was out of sight. He crawled out of his hiding place and managed to stand up, holding on to the log for a moment while his vision went black and white and black again.</p><p>William. He had to find someone to help . . . but first he had to find water. He couldn\u2019t manage without it. Everything he\u2019d drunk at the creek had run off him as sweat, and he was parched to the bone.</p><p>It took several tries, but he got water at last from an infantryman who had two canteens hanging round his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you, chum?\u201d the infantryman asked, eyeing him with interest.</p><p>\u201cHad a fight with a British scout,\u201d Ian replied, and reluctantly handed back the canteen.</p><p>\u201cHope you won it, then,\u201d the man said, and waved without waiting for an answer, moving off with his company.</p> <p>Ian\u2019s left eye was stinging badly and his vision was cloudy; a cut in his eyebrow was bleeding. He groped in the small bag at his waist and found the handkerchief wrapped round the smoked ear he carried. The cloth was a small one, but big enough to tie round his brow.</p><p>He wiped his knuckles over his mouth, already longing for more water. What ought he to do? He could see the standard now being vigorously waved, flapping heavily in the thick air, summoning the troops to follow. Plainly Lee was headed over the bridge; he knew where he was going, and his troops with him. No one would\u2014or could\u2014stop to climb down a ravine to aid a wounded British soldier.</p><p>Ian shook his head experimentally and, finding that his brains didn\u2019t seem to rattle, set off toward the southwest. With luck, he\u2019d meet La Fayette or Uncle Jamie coming up, and maybe get another mount. With a horse, he could get William out of the ravine alone. And whatever else might happen today, he\u2019d settle the hash of those Abenaki bastards.</p><p>HIGH NOON</p><p>ONE OF LA FAYETTE\u2019S men came up at this point with orders to fall back, to rejoin La Fayette\u2019s main body near one of the farms between Spotswood South Brook and Spotswood Middlebrook. Jamie was pleased to hear it; there was no reasonable way for half-armed militia companies to lay siege to the artillery entrenched in the orchard, not with rifles guarding the cannon.</p><p>\u201cGather your companies, Mr. Guthrie, and join me on the road up there,\u201d Jamie said, pointing. \u201cMr. Bixby, can ye find Captain Kirby? Tell him the same thing; I\u2019ll fetch along Craddock\u2019s troops.\u201d</p><p>Captain Craddock\u2019s companies had been badly demoralized by his death, and Jamie had brought them under his own direct command to prevent them scattering like bumblebees.</p><p>They made their way across the fields, picking up Corporal Filmer and his men at the farmhouse\u2014it was deserted; no need to leave anyone there\u2014and across the bridge over one of the creeks. He slowed a little as his horse\u2019s hooves thudded on the planks, feeling the blessed cool dampness coming up from the water thirty feet below. They should stop, he thought, for water\u2014 they hadn\u2019t, since early morning, and the canteens would be running dry\u2014but it would take too long for so many men to work their way along the ravine, down to the creek, and back up. He thought they could make it to La Fayette\u2019s position; there were wells there.</p> <p>He could see the road ahead and peeled an eye for lurking British. He wondered, with a moment\u2019s irritation, where Ian was; he would have liked to know where the British were.</p><p>He found out an instant later. A gunshot cracked nearby, and his horse slipped and fell. Jamie yanked his foot free and rolled out of the saddle as the horse hit the bridge with a thud that shook the whole structure, struggled for an instant, neighing loudly, and slid over the edge into the ravine.</p><p>Jamie scrambled to his feet; his hand was burning, all the skin taken off his palm when he\u2019d skidded on the splintered boards.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d he shouted, with what breath he had left, and waved an arm wildly, gathering the men, pointing them down the road toward a growth of trees that would cover them. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>He found himself among them, the surge of men carrying him with them, and they stumbled into cover, gasping and wheezing with the effort of running. Kirby and Guthrie were sorting out their companies, the late Captain Craddock\u2019s men were clustering near Jamie, and he nodded, breathless, to Bixby and Corporal Greenhow to count noses.</p><p>He could still hear the sound the horse had made, hitting the ground below the bridge.</p><p>He was going to vomit; he felt it rising and knew better than to try to hold it back. He made a quick staying motion toward Lieutenant Schnell, who wanted to speak to him, stepped behind a large pine, and let his stomach turn itself out like an emptied sporran. He stayed bent for a moment, mouth open and forehead pressed against the rough bark for support, letting the gush of saliva wash the taste of it from his mouth.</p><p>Cuidich mi, a Dhia . . . But his mind had lost all notion of words for the moment, and he straightened up, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. As he came out from behind the tree, though, all thought of what might be going on and what he might have to do about it vanished. Ian had come out of the trees nearby and was making his way across the open space. The lad was afoot and moving slowly, but doggedly. Jamie could see the bruises, even from a distance of forty feet.</p><p>\u201cThat one of ourn or one of theirn?\u201d a militiaman asked doubtfully, raising his musket to bear on Ian, just in case.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cDon\u2019t shoot him, aye? Ian! Ian!\u201d He didn\u2019t run\u2014his left knee hurt too much to run\u2014but made his way toward his nephew as fast as possible and was relieved to see the glassy look in Ian\u2019s eyes shatter and brighten into recognition at sight of him.</p><p>\u201cUncle Jamie!\u201d Ian shook his head as though to clear it and stopped abruptly with a gasp.</p><p>\u201cAre ye bad hurt, a bhalaich?\u201d Jamie asked, stepping back and looking for blood. There was some, but nothing dreadful. The lad wasn\u2019t clutching himself as though wounded in the vitals. . . .</p><p>\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d Ian worked his mouth, trying to get up the spit to make words, and Jamie thrust his canteen into Ian\u2019s hand. There was pitifully little water left in it, but some, enough, and Ian gulped it.</p><p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d Ian gasped, lowering the empty canteen. \u201cYour\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Jamie interrupted. There were more men coming down the road, some of them half-running, looking back. \u201cWhat?\u201d he repeated, grasping Ian\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Ian said at once, correctly gauging both intent and intensity of the question. \u201cSomeone hit him on the head and left him in the bottom of yon ravine.\u201d He gestured vaguely toward the scouts. \u201cMaybe three hundred yards west o\u2019 the bridge, aye? He\u2019s no dead, but I dinna ken how bad hurt he may be.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, making instant calculations.</p><p>\u201cAye, and what happened to you?\u201d He could only hope that William and Ian hadn\u2019t happened to each other. But if William was unconscious, it couldn\u2019t be he who\u2019d taken Ian\u2019s horse, and plainly someone had, for\u2014</p><p>\u201cTwo Abenaki scouts,\u201d Ian replied with a grimace. \u201cThe buggers have been following me for\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie was still holding Ian by the left arm and felt the impact of the arrow and the shock of its reverberation through the lad\u2019s body. Ian glanced unbelievingly at his right shoulder, where the shaft protruded, and gave at the knees, his weight pulling him from Jamie\u2019s grasp as he keeled over.</p><p>Jamie launched himself over Ian\u2019s body and hit the ground rolling, avoiding the second arrow; he heard it rip the air near his ear. Heard the militiaman\u2019s gun speak just above him and then a confusion of screaming and shouting, a group of his men breaking, running toward the source of the arrows, bellowing.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d He rolled his nephew onto his back. The lad was conscious, but as much of his face as showed under the paint was white and ghastly, his throat working helplessly. Jamie grasped the arrow; it was lodged in what Claire called the deltoid, the fleshy part of the upper arm, but it didn\u2019t budge when he shook it gently.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s struck the bone,\u201d he said to Ian. \u201cNo bad, but the tip\u2019s stuck fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too,\u201d Ian said faintly. He was struggling to sit up, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cBreak it off, aye? I canna be going about wi\u2019 it sticking out like that.\u201d</p><p>Jamie nodded, got his nephew sitting unsteadily upright, and broke the shaft between his hands, leaving a ragged stub a few inches long with which to pull the arrow out. There wasn\u2019t much blood, only a trickle running down Ian\u2019s arm. Claire could see to getting the arrowhead out later.</p><p>The shouting and confusion were becoming widespread. A glance showed him more men coming down the road, and he heard a fife signaling in the distance, thin and desperate.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye ken what\u2019s happened up there?\u201d he said to Ian, nodding toward the noise. Ian shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI saw Colonel Owen comin\u2019 down wi\u2019 his cannon all in shambles. He stopped to say a word to Lee and then came on, but he wasna running.\u201d</p><p>A few men were running, though in a heavy, clumsy way\u2014not as though pursuit was close. But he could feel alarm beginning to spread through the men around him and turned to them at once.</p><p>\u201cStay by me,\u201d he said calmly to Guthrie. \u201cKeep your men together, and by me. Mr. Bixby\u2014say that to Captain Kirby, as well. Stay by me; dinna move save on my word.\u201d</p><p>The men from Craddock\u2019s company who had run after the Abenaki\u2014he supposed that to be the source of the arrows\u2014had vanished into the woods. He hesitated for an instant, but then sent a small party after them. No Indian he\u2019d ever met would fight from a fixed position, so he doubted he was sending his men into ambush. Perhaps into the face of the oncoming British, but if that was the case, best he knew about it as soon as possible, and at least one or two would likely make it back to tell him.</p><p>Ian was getting his feet under him; Jamie bent and gave the lad an arm under his good shoulder and got him standing. His legs shook in their buckskins and sweat ran in sheets down his bare torso, but he stood.</p><p>\u201cWas it you who called my name, Uncle Jamie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did when I saw ye come out of the trees.\u201d Jamie nodded toward the wood, keeping one eye out for anyone coming back that way. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot then. Just before this\u2014\u201d He touched the ragged end of the arrow shaft gingerly. \u201cSomeone called out behind me; that\u2019s what made me move, and a good thing, too. I\u2019d ha\u2019 taken this square in the chest otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shook his head and felt that faint sense of bemusement that always attended brushes with ghosts\u2014if that\u2019s what this was. The only strangeness of it was that it never seemed strange at all.</p><p>But there was no time to think of such things; there were calls now of \u201cRetreat! Retreat!\u201d and the men behind him stirred and rippled like wheat in a rising wind.</p><p>\u201cStay by me!\u201d he said, in a loud, firm voice, and the ones nearest him took a grip of their weapons and stood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>William. Thought of his son sparked a flare of alarm in his bones. The arrow that had struck Ian had jolted the vision of William, sprawled and bloody in the mud, out of his head, but now . . . Christ, he couldn\u2019t send men after the lad, not with half the army pouring back in this direction, and the British maybe on their heels. . . . A sudden ray of hope: if the British were headed this way, they\u2019d maybe come across the lad and care for him.</p><p>He wanted badly to go himself. If William was dying . . . but he could in no circumstances leave his men, and particularly not in these circumstances. A terrible urgency seized him.</p><p>Christ, if I never speak to him\u2014never tell him\u2014</p><p>Now he saw Lee and his aides coming down the road. They were moving slowly, no air of haste about it, but deliberate\u2014and looking back now and then, almost surreptitiously, glancing quickly again to the front, sitting straight in their saddles.</p> <p>\u201cRetreat!\u201d The cry was springing up now all around them, growing stronger, and men were streaming out of the woods. \u201cRetreat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay by me,\u201d Jamie said, softly enough that only Bixby and Guthrie heard him\u2014but it was enough. They stiffened, stood by him. Their resolve would help to hold the rest. If Lee came even with him, ordered him . . . then they would have to go. But not \u2019til then.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d said one of the men behind him, surprised. Jamie glanced back, saw a staring face, then whipped round to look where the man was looking. Some of Craddock\u2019s men were coming out of the wood, looking pleased with themselves. They had Claire\u2019s mare with them, and over her saddle was the limp body of an Indian, his long, greased scalp locks nearly dragging the ground.</p><p>\u201cGot him, sir!\u201d One of the men\u2014Mortlake\u2014saluted, grinning white-toothed from the shade of a hat that he didn\u2019t think to remove. His face gleamed like oiled leather, and he nodded to Ian in a friendly fashion, jerking his thumb at the mare. \u201cHorse\u2014you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Ian said, and his Scots accent made Mortlake blink. \u201cI thank ye, sir. I think my uncle had best take the horse, though. Ye\u2019ll need her, aye?\u201d he added to Jamie, lifting an eyebrow toward the ranks of men behind them.</p> <p>Jamie wanted to refuse; Ian looked as if he could barely walk. But the lad was right. Jamie would have to lead these men, whether forward or back\u2014and he\u2019d need them to be able to see him. He nodded reluctantly, and the body of the Abenaki was dragged from the saddle and tossed carelessly into the brush. He saw Ian\u2019s eyes follow it, dark with dislike, and thought for a split second of the smoked ear his nephew carried in his sporran, and hoped that Ian wouldn\u2019t\u2014but, no, a Mohawk took no trophies from another\u2019s kill.</p><p>\u201cThere were two of them, ye said, Ian?\u201d</p><p>Ian turned from contemplation of the dead Abenaki and nodded.</p><p>\u201cSaw t\u2019other one,\u201d Mortlake answered the implied question. \u201cRan when we shot this villain.\u201d He coughed, glancing at the increasing streams of men coming down the road. \u201cBeg pardon, sir, but oughtn\u2019t we be moving, too?\u201d</p><p>The men were fidgeting, craning their necks to see, murmuring when they spotted Lee, whose aides were spreading out, trying to marshal the swarming men into some kind of orderly retreat but being roundly ignored. Then something, some change of atmosphere, made Jamie turn, and half the men with him.</p><p>And here came Washington up the road on Jamie\u2019s erstwhile white stallion, galloping, and a look on his big, rough face that would have melted brass.</p> <p>The incipient panic in the men dissolved at once as they pressed forward, urgent to learn what was afoot. There was chaos in the road. Some companies scattered, stopping abruptly to look round for their fellows, some noticing Washington\u2019s sudden appearance, others still coming down the road, colliding with those standing still\u2014and, in the midst of it, Washington pulled his horse up beside Charles Lee\u2019s and leaned toward him, flushed like an apple with heat and anger.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by this, sir?!\u201d was all that Jamie heard clearly, the words carried to him by some freak of the heavy air, before noise and dust and smothering heat settled so thickly on the scene that it was impossible to hear anything over the clishmaclaver, save the disquieting echo of musket volleys and the occasional faint popping of grenadoes in the distance.</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to shout above the noise; it wasn\u2019t necessary. His men were going nowhere, as riveted to the spectacle before them as he was.</p><p>Lee\u2019s long-nosed face was pinched with fury, and Jamie saw him for a brief instant as Punch, the furious puppet in a Punch-and-Judy show. An unhinged urge to laugh bubbled up, as the necessary corollary irresistibly presented itself: George Washington as Judy, the mobcapped shrew who belabored her husband with a stick. For an instant, Jamie feared he had succumbed to the heat and lost his mind.</p><p>Once envisioned, though, he couldn\u2019t escape the thought, and for an instant he was standing in Hyde Park, watching Punch feed his baby to the sausage machine.</p><p>For that was what Washington was very clearly doing. It lasted no more than three or four minutes, and then Washington made a furious gesture of disgust and dismissal and, wheeling his horse, set off at a trot, circling back to pass the troops who had clotted along the roadside, watching in fascination.</p><p>Emerging from his own fascination with a jolt, Jamie put a foot in the mare\u2019s stirrup and swung up.</p><p>\u201cIan\u2014\u201d he said, and his nephew nodded, putting a hand on his knee\u2014as much to steady himself, he thought, as to reassure his uncle.</p> <p>\u201cGive me a few men, Uncle Jamie,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see to . . . his lordship.\u201d</p><p>There was barely time to summon Corporal Greenhow and detail him to take five men and accompany Ian, before Washington came close enough to spot Jamie and his companies. The general\u2019s hat was in his hand and his face was afire, anger and desperation subsumed in eagerness, and the whole of his being radiating something Jamie had seldom seen, but recognized. Had felt himself, once. It was the look of a man risking everything, because there was no choice.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d Washington shouted to him, and his wide mouth stretched wider in a blazing grin. \u201cFollow me!\u201d</p><p>PATER NOSTER</p><p>WILLIAM CAME AWAKE slowly, feeling terrible. His head hurt and he wanted to vomit. He was horribly thirsty, but the thought of drinking anything made his gorge rise and he retched feebly. He was lying in grass and bugs; there were bugs crawling on him. . . . He saw, for one vivid moment, a line of tiny ants climbing busily through the dark hairs on his wrist and tried to dash his hand against the ground to dislodge them. His hand didn\u2019t move, though, and his consciousness faded.</p><p>It came back with a throbbing rush and jounce. The world was jigging dizzily up and down, and he couldn\u2019t breathe. Then he made out the dark things that went in and out of his field of view as being a horse\u2019s legs and realized that he was belly-down over a saddle, being carried somewhere. Where . . . ?</p><p>There was a lot of shouting going on nearby, and the noise hurt his head very much.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d shouted an English voice. \u201cWhat are you doing with him? Stand! Stand or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave him! Push him off! Run!\u201d A vaguely familiar voice, Scottish.</p><p>Then a confusion of noise and somewhere in it the Scottish voice again, shouting, \u201cTell my\u2014\u201d But then he hit the ground with a thud that knocked out both wit and wind, and slid back into darkness, headfirst.</p><p>IN THE END, it was simplicity itself. John Grey walked down a cattle track, following the hoofprints toward what must be water, and walked straight into a startled group of British soldiers filling their canteens at a muddy ford. Light-headed from thirst and heat, he didn\u2019t bother trying to identify or explain himself, just put his hands in the air and gave himself up with an intense feeling of relief.</p><p>The soldiers gave him water, at least, and then he was marched off under the guard of a nervous boy with a musket and into the yard of a farmhouse that appeared to be deserted. No doubt the owners had fled upon realizing that they were in the middle of twenty thousand or so armed troops bent on mayhem.</p><p>Grey was hustled over to a large wagon half filled with cut grass, made to sit down on the ground with several other captured prisoners\u2014in the shade, thank God\u2014and left there under the guard of two middle-aged privates, armed with muskets, and a nervous child of fourteen or so in a lieutenant\u2019s uniform, who twitched every time the sound of a volley echoed off the trees.</p><p>This might be his best chance. If he could shock or intimidate the boy into sending him to Cornwallis or Clinton . . .</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d he barked at the boy, who blinked at him, startled. So did the captured Americans.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name, sir?\u201d he demanded, in his command voice. That rattled the young lieutenant badly; he took two involuntary steps backward before stopping himself. He flushed, though, and rallied.</p><p>\u201cYou be quiet!\u201d he said, and, stepping forward, aimed a cuff at Grey\u2019s ear.</p><p>Grey caught him by the wrist by reflex, but before he could release the boy, one of the privates had taken a stride toward him and brought down the butt of his musket on Grey\u2019s left forearm.</p><p>\u201c\u2019E said be quiet,\u201d the private said mildly. \u201cI\u2019d do it, was I you.\u201d</p><p>Grey was quiet, but only because he couldn\u2019t speak. That arm had been broken twice before\u2014once by Jamie Fraser, once by a cannon explosion\u2014 and the third time was definitely not the charm. His vision went black for a moment, and everything inside him contracted into a ball of hot lead. Then it started to hurt, and he could breathe again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that you just said?\u201d the man sitting next him said under his breath, eyebrows raised. \u201c \u2019Tain\u2019t English, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Grey, and paused for another breath, clutching the arm against his belly. \u201cIt\u2019s German for \u2018Oh, shit.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d The man nodded understandingly and\u2014with a wary glance at the guards\u2014brought a small flask out from under his coat and pulled the cork before handing it to Grey. \u201cTry that, friend,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The scent of overripe apples surged directly into his brain and very nearly made him vomit. He managed to swallow, though, and handed back the flask with a nod of thanks. Sweat ran down his face in streams, stinging his good eye.</p><p>No one spoke. The man who\u2019d given him the applejack was a Continental regular, middle-aged, with a haggard face and only half his teeth remaining. He sat hunched, elbows on his knees, eyes fixed on the distance, where the sound of fighting was. The others were doing the same thing, he realized\u2014all craning toward the battle.</p><p>Colonel Watson Smith popped into his mind, doubtless summoned up by the fumes of applejack, but appearing so suddenly that Grey jerked a little, and one of the guards stiffened, giving him a hard look. Grey looked away, though, and the man relaxed.</p><p>Shocked with pain, exhausted and thirsty, he lay down, nursing his throbbing arm against his chest. The buzzing of insects filled his ears, and the volley of muskets retreated into the meaningless rumble of distant thunder. He let himself lapse into a not unpleasant catatonia visualizing Smith shirtless, lying on the narrow cot under a lantern, cradling Grey in his arms, stroking his back with a comforting hand. At some point, he drifted into an uneasy sleep, punctuated by the sounds of guns and shouting.</p><p>He woke suddenly, with a mouth like cotton, to find that several more prisoners had been delivered and that there was an Indian sitting beside him. Grey\u2019s working eye was gummy and bleared, and it took a moment before he recognized the face under the remnants of black and green war paint.</p><p>Ian Murray gave him a long, level look that said plainly, \u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d and he didn\u2019t. Murray raised an eyebrow at his wounded arm. Grey lifted his good shoulder in a brief shrug and focused his attention on the water cart that had come to a halt on the nearby road.</p><p>\u201cYou and you, come with me.\u201d One of the privates jerked a thumb at two of the prisoners and led them off toward the cart, from which they returned shortly, carrying buckets of water.</p><p>The water was blood-warm and tasted of sodden, half-rotted wood, but they drank greedily, spilling it down their clothes in their haste. Grey wiped a wet hand across his face, feeling somewhat more settled in his mind. He flexed his left wrist experimentally; perhaps it was only a brui\u2014no, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d drawn in his breath with a hiss, and Murray, as though in response, closed his eyes, steepled his hands together, and began to intone the Pater Noster.</p><p>\u201cWhat in b-buggery is that?\u201d the lieutenant demanded, stamping over to him. \u201cAre you talking Indian, sir?\u201d</p><p>Ian opened his eyes, regarding the child with a mild stare.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Latin. I\u2019m sayin\u2019 my prayers, aye?\u201d he said. \u201cD\u2019ye mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I\u2014\u201d The lieutenant stopped, baffled as much by being addressed in a Scottish accent as by the circumstance. He stole a glance at the privates, who looked off into the distance. He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly, and turned away, pretending absorption in the distant cloud of white powder smoke that hung low over the trees.</p><p>Murray cut his eyes at Grey and, with a slight nod, began the Pater Noster again. Grey, somewhat puzzled, joined him, stumbling a bit. The lieutenant stiffened, but didn\u2019t turn round.</p><p>\u201cDo they not know who you are?\u201d Murray asked in Latin at the end of the prayer, not varying his intonation.</p><p>\u201cI told them; they don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Grey replied, adding a random \u201cAve Maria\u201d at the end for verisimilitude.</p><p>\u201cGratia plena, Dominus tecum. Shall I tell them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what comes next. I suppose it couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedicta tu in mulieribus, et benedictus fructus ventris tui, Jesu,\u201d Murray replied, and rose to his feet.</p><p>The guards swung round immediately, raising their muskets to their shoulders. Murray ignored this, addressing the lieutenant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s maybe no my business, sir,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cBut I shouldna like to see ye ruin your career over a wee mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe qui\u2014what mistake?\u201d the lieutenant demanded. He had taken off his wig because of the heat but now crammed it back on his head, evidently thinking it might lend him authority. He was mistaken in this impression, as the wig was a good deal too large and immediately slipped sideways over one ear.</p><p>\u201cThis gentleman,\u201d Murray said, gesturing to Grey, who sat up straight and stared impassively at the lieutenant. \u201cI canna imagine what\u2019s brought him here or why he should be dressed as he is\u2014but I ken him well. This is Lord John Grey. The, ehm, brother of Colonel Grey, the Duke of Pardloe?\u201d he added delicately.</p><p>The hue of the young lieutenant\u2019s face changed noticeably. He glanced quickly back and forth between Murray and Grey, frowning, and absently shoved his wig back into place. Grey rose slowly, keeping an eye on the guards.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d the lieutenant said, but without force. \u201cWhy should Lord John Grey be here, looking like\u2014like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe exigencies of war, Lieutenant,\u201d said Grey, keeping his voice level. \u201cI see you belong to the Forty-ninth, which means that your colonel is Sir Henry Calder. I know him. If you will be so kind as to lend me paper and pencil, I will write him a short note, asking him to send an escort to fetch me. You can send the note via the water carrier,\u201d he added, seeing a wild look come into the boy\u2019s eyes, and hoping to calm him before he panicked and decided that the simplest way out of this imbroglio was to shoot Grey.</p><p>One of the privates\u2014the one who had broken Grey\u2019s arm\u2014coughed gently.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019m goin\u2019 to need more men, sir, in any case. Three of us with a dozen prisoners . . . and doubtless more comin\u2019?\u201d The lieutenant looked blank, and the private had another go. \u201cI meantersay . . . might be you\u2019d mean to send for reinforcements anyroad.\u201d The man caught Grey\u2019s eye and coughed again.</p><p>\u201cAccidents happen,\u201d Grey said, though with no great charity, and the guards relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d the lieutenant said. His voice broke on it and he repeated, \u201cAll right!\u201d in a gruff baritone, looking belligerently around. No one was foolish enough to laugh.</p><p>Grey\u2019s knees were wanting to tremble, and he sat down rather abruptly to prevent it. Murray\u2019s face\u2014well, the faces of all the prisoners\u2014were carefully blank.</p><p>\u201cTibi debeo,\u201d Grey said quietly. I acknowledge the debt.</p><p>\u201cDeo gratias,\u201d Murray murmured, and only then did Grey see the trail of blood that streaked Murray\u2019s arm and side, staining his breechclout\u2014and the stub of a broken arrow protruding from the flesh of his right shoulder.</p><p>WILLIAM CAME round again lying on something that didn\u2019t move, thank God. There was a canteen being pressed to his lips, and he drank, gulping, lips reaching for more water even as it was drawn away.</p><p>\u201cNot that fast, you\u2019ll be sick,\u201d said a familiar voice. \u201cBreathe once, and you can have more.\u201d He breathed and forced his eyes open against a glare of light. A familiar face appeared over him, and he reached up a wavering hand toward it.</p> <p>\u201cPapa . . .\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, but the next best thing,\u201d said his uncle Hal, taking a firm hold on the groping hand and sitting down beside him. \u201cHow\u2019s the head?\u201d</p><p>William closed his eyes and tried to focus on something other than the pain.</p><p>\u201cNot . . . that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull the other one, it\u2019s got bells on,\u201d his uncle murmured, cupping William\u2019s cheek and turning his head to the side. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have more water,\u201d William managed, and his uncle gave a small snort and put the canteen back to William\u2019s lips.</p><p>When William stopped to breathe again, his uncle set the canteen down and inquired, in a perfectly normal tone of voice, \u201cCan you sing, do you think?\u201d</p><p>His vision was going in and out; there were momentarily two of his uncle, then one, then two again. He closed one eye, and Uncle Hal steadied.</p> <p>\u201cYou want me to . . . sing?\u201d he managed.</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps not right this minute,\u201d the duke said. He sat back on his stool and began to whistle a tune. \u201cRecognize that, do you?\u201d he asked, breaking off.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Lillibulero,\u2019\u201d William said, beginning to feel rather cross. \u201cWhy, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew a chap once who was hit on the head with an ax and lost his ability to make out music. Couldn\u2019t tell one note from another.\u201d Hal leaned forward, holding up two fingers. \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. Stick them up your nose,\u201d William advised him. \u201cGo away, will you? I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you not to drink too fast.\u201d But his uncle had a basin under his face and a strong hand on his head, bracing him while he heaved and coughed and shot water out of his nose.</p><p>By the time he had subsided back onto his pillow\u2014it was a pillow, he was lying on a camp cot\u2014he\u2019d recovered enough of his senses to be able to look around and determine that he was in an army tent\u2014probably his uncle\u2019s, judging from the battered campaign chest and the sword that lay across it\u2014and the glare of light was coming from the low afternoon sun flooding in through the open tent flap.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you recall?\u201d Uncle Hal countered, handing him the canteen.</p><p>\u201cThe\u2014er\u2014\u201d His mind was full of confused bits and pieces. The last thing he truly remembered was Jane and her sister, laughing at him as he stood bare-arsed in the creek. He sipped water and put cautious fingers to his head, which seemed to be wrapped in a bandage. It felt sore to the touch. \u201cTaking my horse down to drink at a creek.\u201d</p><p>Uncle Hal raised one eyebrow. \u201cYou were found in a ditch, near a place called Spottiswood or some such thing. Von Knyphausen\u2019s troops were holding a bridge there.\u201d</p><p>William started to shake his head, but thought better of it and closed his eyes against the light.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will likely come back to you.\u201d His uncle paused. \u201cDo you happen to remember where you last saw your father?\u201d</p><p>William felt an unnatural calm come over him. He just bloody didn\u2019t care anymore, he told himself. The whole world was going to know, one way or another.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d he said flatly, and opened his eyes. His uncle was regarding him with interest, but no particular surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met Colonel Fraser, then?\u201d Hal asked.</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d William said shortly. \u201cHow long have you known about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoughly three seconds, in the sense of certainty,\u201d his uncle replied. He reached up and unfastened the leather stock around his neck, sighing with relief as it came off. \u201cGood Lord, it\u2019s hot.\u201d The stock had left a broad red mark; he massaged this gently, half-closing his eyes. \u201cIn the sense of thinking there was something rather remarkable in your resemblance to the aforesaid Colonel Fraser . . . since I met him again in Philadelphia recently. Prior to that, I hadn\u2019t seen him for a long time\u2014not since you were very small, and I never saw him in close conjunction with you then, in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit, gnats and black flies caroming off the canvas and falling onto William\u2019s bed like snowflakes. He became aware of the noises of a large camp surrounding them, and it occurred to him that they must be with General Clinton.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were with Sir Henry,\u201d he said at last, breaking the silence. Hal nodded, pulling his worn silver flask out of his coat pocket before tossing the coat itself over the campaign chest.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t; I\u2019ve been with Cornwallis. We\u2014the regiment, that is\u2014arrived in New York about two weeks ago. I came down to Philadelphia to see Henry and John and make inquiries about Benjamin. I arrived just in time to leave the city with the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen? What\u2019s he done that you\u2019re inquiring about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot married, had a son, and been mug enough to be captured by the Rebels, evidently,\u201d his uncle replied lightly. \u201cThought he might do with a bit of help. If I give you a sip of this, can you keep it down?\u201d</p><p>William didn\u2019t reply, but reached for the flask. It was filled with good brandy; he breathed it in cautiously, but it seemed not to trouble his wobbly stomach, and he risked a sip.</p><p>Uncle Hal watched him for a bit, not speaking. The resemblance between him and Lord John was considerable, and it gave William an odd feeling to see him\u2014something between comfort and resentment.</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d Hal said after a few moments. \u201cOr my brother, if you prefer. Do you recall when you saw him last?\u201d</p><p>Resentment sparked abruptly into anger.</p><p>\u201cYes, I bloody do. On the morning of the sixteenth. In his house. With my other father.\u201d</p><p>Hal made a low humming noise, indicating interest.</p><p>\u201cThat when you found out, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid John tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he bloody didn\u2019t!\u201d Blood surged to William\u2019s face, making his head throb with a fierce suddenness that made him dizzy. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come face-to-face with the\u2014the fellow, I don\u2019t suppose he\u2019d ever have told me!\u201d</p><p>He swayed and put out a hand to keep from falling over. Hal grabbed him by the shoulders and eased him back down onto the pillow, where he lay still, teeth clenched, waiting for the pain to ebb. His uncle took the flask from his unresisting hand, sat down again, and took a meditative sip.</p><p>\u201cYou might have done worse,\u201d his uncle observed after a moment. \u201cIn the way of sires, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d William said coldly.</p><p>\u201cGranted, he is a Scot,\u201d the duke said judiciously.</p><p>\u201cAnd a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a traitor,\u201d Hal agreed. \u201cDamned fine swordsman, though. Knows his horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a f**king groom, for God\u2019s sake! Of course he knows horses!\u201d Fresh outrage made William jerk upright again, despite the thunder in his temples. \u201cWhat am I bloody going to do?!\u201d</p><p>His uncle sighed deeply and put the cork back in the flask.</p><p>\u201cAdvice? You\u2019re too old to be given it and too young to take it.\u201d He glanced aside at William, his face very like Papa\u2019s. Thinner, older, dark brows beginning to beetle, but with that same rueful humor in the corners of his eyes. \u201cThought of blowing your brains out?\u201d</p><p>William blinked, startled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Anything else is bound to be an improvement, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He rose, stretching, and groaned with the movement. \u201cGod, I\u2019m old. Lie down, William, and go to sleep. You\u2019re in no condition to think.\u201d He opened the lantern and blew it out, plunging the tent into warm gloom.</p><p>A rustling as he raised the tent flap, and the searing light of the sinking sun outlined the duke\u2019s slender figure as he turned.</p><p>\u201cYou are still my nephew,\u201d he said in a conversational tone. \u201cDoubt that\u2019s much comfort to you, but there it is.\u201d</p><p>AMONG THE TOMBSTONES</p><p>THE SUN WAS LOW and shining directly into my eyes, but the casualties had come so fast that I couldn\u2019t take time to move my equipment round. They\u2019d fought all day; it was still going on\u2014I could hear it, close by, but saw nothing when I glanced up, blinking against the sun. Still, the shouts and banging of muskets and what I thought must be grenades\u2014I\u2019d never heard a grenade explode, but something was making a sort of irregular hollow poong! that was quite different from the boom of cannon or the slow percussion of musket fire\u2014were loud enough to drown the sounds of groaning and crying from the shade trees and the relentless buzzing of the flies.</p><p>I was swaying with weariness and heat and, for my own part, was nearly indifferent to the battle. Until, that is, a young man in militia brown staggered in, blood streaming down his face from a deep cut in his forehead. I had stanched the bleeding and half-wiped his face before I recognized him.</p><p>\u201cCorporal . . . Greenhow?\u201d I asked dubiously, and a small spurt of fear penetrated the fog of fatigue. Joshua Greenhow was in one of Jamie\u2019s companies; I\u2019d met him.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He tried to bob his head, but I stopped him, pressing firmly on the wad of lint I\u2019d slapped on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. General Fraser\u2014have you . . .\u201d My mouth dried, sticky, and I reached automatically for my cup, only to find it empty.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right, ma\u2019am,\u201d the corporal assured me, and reached out a long arm to the table, where my canteen lay. \u201cOr at least he was last time I saw him, and that was no more \u2019n ten minutes gone.\u201d He poured water into my cup, tossed it into his own mouth, breathed heavily for an instant in relief, then poured more, which he handed to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I gulped it; it was so warm that it was barely discernible as wet, but it eased my tongue. \u201cHis nephew\u2014Ian Murray?\u201d</p><p>Corporal Greenhow started to shake his head, but stopped.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen him since about noon, but I haven\u2019t seen him dead, either, ma\u2019am. Oh\u2014sorry, ma\u2019am. I meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant. Here, put your hand there and keep the pressure on.\u201d I placed his hand on the lint and fished a fresh suture needle threaded with silk out of its jar of alcohol. My hands, steady all day, trembled a little, and I had to stop and breathe for a moment. Close. Jamie was so close. And somewhere in the midst of the fighting I could hear.</p><p>Corporal Greenhow was telling me something about the fighting, but I was having trouble attending. Something about General Lee being relieved of his command and\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRelieved of command?\u201d I blurted. \u201cWhat the devil for?\u201d</p><p>He looked startled by my vehemence, but replied obligingly.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I don\u2019t quite know, ma\u2019am. Was something to do with a retreat and how he oughtn\u2019t to have told them to do it, but then General Washington come up on his horse and cursed and swore like the dickens\u2014saving your presence, ma\u2019am,\u201d he added politely. \u201cAnyway, I saw him! General Washington. Oh, ma\u2019am, it was so . . .\u201d Words failed him, and I handed him the canteen with my momentarily free hand.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I murmured under my breath. Were the Americans winning? Holding their own? Had bloody Charles Lee cocked things up after all\u2014or not?</p> <p>Corporal Greenhow luckily hadn\u2019t noticed my language, but was coming to life like a flower in the rain, enthused by his account.</p><p>\u201cAnd so we rushed straight after him, and he was all along the road and the ridgeline, shouting and waving his hat, and all the troops trudging back down . . . why, they all looked up with their eyes staring out of their heads and then they turned round and fell in with us, and the whole army, we just\u2014we just threw ourselves on the damned redcoats. . . . Oh, ma\u2019am, it was just wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d I echoed dutifully, catching a trickle of blood that threatened to run into his eye. The shadows of the tombstones in the graveyard stretched out long and violet, and the sound of the flies buzzed in my ears, louder than the ringing of the shots that still came\u2014were coming closer\u2014to the frail barrier of the dead. And Jamie with them.</p><p>Lord, keep him safe! I prayed in the silence of my heart.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something, ma\u2019am?\u201d</p> <p>JAMIE RUBBED a blood-wet sleeve across his face, the wool rasping his skin, sweat burning in his eyes. It was a church they\u2019d chased the British into\u2014or a churchyard. Men were dodging through the tombstones, vaulting them in hot pursuit.</p><p>The British had turned at bay, though, an officer shouting them into a ragged line, and the drill began, the muskets grounded, ramrods drawn . . .</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d Jamie bellowed, with all the power left in his cracked voice. \u201cFire on them! Now!\u201d</p><p>Only a few men had loaded weapons, but sometimes it took only one. A shot rang out from behind him, and the British officer who was shouting stopped shouting and staggered. He clutched himself, curling up and falling to his knees, and someone shot him again. He jerked backward, then fell over sideways.</p><p>There was a roar from the British line, which dissolved at once into a rush, some men pausing long enough to fix their bayonets, others wielding their guns like clubs. The Americans met them, mindless and shrieking, with guns and fists. One militiaman reached the fallen officer, seized him by the legs, and began to drag him away toward the church, perhaps with the notion to take him prisoner, perhaps to get him help. . . .</p><p>A British soldier threw himself upon the American, who stumbled backward and fell, loosing his hold on the officer. Jamie was running, shouting, trying to gather the men, but it was no use; they\u2019d lost their wits altogether in the madness of fighting, and whatever their original intent in seizing the British officer, they\u2019d lost that, too.</p> <p>Leaderless, so had the British soldiers, some of whom were now engaged in a grotesque tug-of-war with two Americans, each grasping the limbs of the dead\u2014for surely he must be now, if he hadn\u2019t been killed outright\u2014British officer.</p><p>Appalled, Jamie ran in among them, shouting, but his voice failed altogether under strain and breathlessness, and he realized he was making no more than faint cawing noises. He reached the fight, grasped one soldier by the shoulder, meaning to pull him back, but the man rounded on him and punched him in the face.</p><p>It was a glancing blow off the side of his jaw but made him lose his grip, and he was knocked off-balance by someone shoving past him to grab some part of the hapless officer\u2019s body.</p><p>Drums. A drum. Someone in the distance was beating something urgent, a summons.</p><p>\u201cRetreat!\u201d someone shouted in a hoarse voice. \u201cRetreat!\u201d</p><p>Something happened; a momentary pause\u2014and suddenly it was all different and the Americans were coming past him, hasty but no longer frantic, a few of them carrying the dead British officer. Yes, definitely dead; the man\u2019s head lolled like a rag doll\u2019s.</p><p>Thank God they\u2019re not dragging him through the dirt was all he had time to think. Lieutenant Bixby was at his shoulder, blood pouring down his face from an open flap of scalp.</p><p>\u201cThere you are, sir!\u201d he said, relieved. \u201cThought you was taken, we did.\u201d He took Jamie respectfully by the arm, tugging him along. \u201cCome away, sir, will you? I don\u2019t trust those wicked buggers not to come back.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie glanced in the direction Bixby was pointing. Sure enough, the British were retiring, under the direction of a couple of officers who had come forward out of a mass of redcoats forming up in the middle distance. They showed no disposition to come closer, but Bixby was right: there were still random shots being fired, from both sides. He nodded, fumbling in his pocket for his extra kerchief to give the man to stanch his wound.</p><p>The thought of wounds made him think of Claire, and he recalled suddenly what Denzell Hunter had said: \u201cTennent Church, the hospital\u2019s set up there.\u201d Was this Tennent Church?</p><p>He was already following Bixby toward the road but glanced back. Yes, the men who had the dead British officer were taking him into the church, and there were wounded men sitting near the door, more of them near a small white\u2014God, that was Claire\u2019s tent, was she\u2014</p><p>He saw her at once, as though his thought had conjured her, right there in the open. She was standing up, staring openmouthed, and no wonder\u2014there was a Continental regular on a stool beside her, holding a bloodstained cloth, and more such cloths in a basin at her feet. But why was she out here? She\u2014</p><p>And then he saw her jerk upright, clap a hand to her side, and fall.</p><p>A SLEDGEHAMMER hit me in the side, making me jerk, the needle dropping from my hands. I didn\u2019t feel myself fall but was lying on the ground, black and white spots flashing round me, a sense of intense numbness radiating from my right side. I smelled damp earth and warm grass and sycamore leaves, pungent and comforting.</p><p>Shock, I thought dimly, and opened my mouth, but nothing but a dry click came out of my throat. What . . . The numbness of the impact began to lessen, and I realized that I had curled into a ball, my forearm pressed by reflex over my abdomen. I smelled burning, and fresh blood, very fresh. I\u2019ve been shot, then.</p><p>\u201cSassenach!\u201d I heard Jamie\u2019s bellow over the roaring in my ears. He sounded far off, but I heard the terror in his voice clearly. I wasn\u2019t disturbed by it. I felt very calm.</p><p>\u201cSassenach!\u201d The spots had coalesced. I was looking down a narrow tunnel of light and spinning shadow. At the end of it was the shocked face of Corporal Greenhow, the needle dangling by its thread from the half-sewn gash in his forehead.</p><p>PART FIVE</p><p>Counting Noses</p><p>EVEN PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO TO HEAVEN DON\u2019T WANT TO DIE TO GET THERE</p><p>I SWAM DIZZILY TO the surface of consciousness, thinking, What was it Ernest Hemingway had said, about how one is supposed to pass out from the pain but you don\u2019t? I just had, but he was more or less right; the unconsciousness hadn\u2019t lasted more than a few seconds. I was curled into a tight ball, both hands pressed against my right side, and I could feel the blood welling between my fingers, hot and cold and sticky, and it was beginning to hurt . . . very much . . .</p><p>\u201cSassenach! Claire!\u201d I swam out of the fog again and managed to open one eye. Jamie was kneeling by me. He was touching me, had his hands on me, but I couldn\u2019t feel it. . . .</p><p>Sweat or blood or something ran burning into my eyes. I could hear someone gasping\u2014short, shallow, panting breaths. Me, or Jamie? I was cold. I shouldn\u2019t be cold, it was hot as blazes today. . . . I felt jellied, quivering. And it hurt. A lot.</p><p>\u201cSassenach!\u201d</p><p>Hands turned me. I screamed. Tried to. I felt it wrench my throat but couldn\u2019t hear it; there was a roaring in my ears. Shock, I thought. I couldn\u2019t feel my limbs, my feet. I felt the blood leaving my body.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>The shock\u2019s wearing off, I thought. Or is it getting worse? I could see the pain now, going off in bursts like black lightning, jagged and searing.</p><p>\u201cSassenach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said through clenched teeth. \u201cAuh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre ye dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Gutshot. The word formed unpleasantly in my mind, and I hoped vaguely that I hadn\u2019t spoken it out loud. Even if I had, though . . . surely Jamie could see the wound . . .</p><p>Someone was trying to pull my hands away, and I struggled to keep them in place, keep pressing, but my arms had no strength and I saw one hand hanging limp as they lifted it, the nails outlined black with blood, fingers coated scarlet, dripping. Someone rolled me onto my back and I thought I screamed again.</p><p>It hurt unspeakably. Jellied. Impact shock. Cells blasted to shreds and goo. No function . . . organ failure.</p><p>Tightness. Couldn\u2019t breathe. Jerking, and someone cursing above me. My eyes were open, I saw color, but the air was thick with pulsing spots.</p><p>Shouting. Talk.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t draw breath. Something tight around my middle. What\u2019s gone? How much?</p><p>God, it hurt. Oh, God.</p><p>JAMIE COULDN\u2019T take his eyes off Claire\u2019s face, lest she die in the second when he looked away. He fumbled for a kerchief, but he\u2019d given it to Bixby, and in desperation seized a fold of her skirt and pressed it hard to her side. She made a horrible sound and he nearly let go, but the ground under her was already darkening with blood and he pressed harder, shouting, \u201cHelp! Help me, Rachel! Dottie!\u201d</p><p>But no one came, and when he risked a split second\u2019s glance around, he saw nothing but clumps of wounded and dead under the trees some distance away and the flickering forms of soldiers, some running, some wandering dazed through the tombstones. If the girls had been nearby, they must have been forced to run when the skirmish rolled through the graveyard.</p><p>He felt the slow tickle of Claire\u2019s blood running over the back of his hand and shouted again, his dry throat tearing with the effort. Someone must hear.</p><p>Someone did. He heard running footsteps on the gravel and saw a doctor named Leckie whom he knew racing toward him, white-faced, hurdling a tombstone as he came.</p><p>\u201cShot?\u201d Leckie asked, breathless, collapsing onto his knees beside Jamie. Jamie couldn\u2019t speak, but nodded. Sweat was running down his face and the crease of his spine, but his hands seemed frozen to her body; he couldn\u2019t pull them away, couldn\u2019t let go until Leckie, pawing in one of Claire\u2019s baskets, seized a wad of lint and jerked Jamie\u2019s hand out of the way in order to clap it in place.</p><p>The surgeon elbowed him ruthlessly aside and he scuttled crabwise a foot or two away, then rose to his feet, swaying helplessly. Jamie couldn\u2019t look away but became slowly aware that a knot of soldiers had gathered, appalled, shuffling among themselves, not knowing what to do. Jamie gulped air, seized the nearest of these, and sent him running to the church in search of Dr. Hunter. She\u2019d want Denny. If she survived long enough for him to come\u2014</p><p>\u201cSir! General Fraser!\u201d Not even the shouting of his own name made him look away from the spectacle on the ground: the blood, so much of it, soaking her clothes, making a hideous dark red puddle that stained the knees of Leckie\u2019s breeches as he knelt over her; her hair, untied and spilling wild, full of grass and bits of leaf from the ground she lay on, her face\u2014oh, Christ, her face.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d Someone grabbed his arm to compel his attention. He drove his elbow hard into whoever it was, and the man grunted in surprise and let go.</p><p>A gabble of whispers, agitation, people telling the newcomer that it was the general\u2019s wife, hurt, shot, dead or dying . . .</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not dying!\u201d he turned and bellowed at them. He thought dimly that he must look demented; their blackened faces were aghast. Bixby stepped out and touched his shoulder gingerly, as though he were a lighted grenade that might go off in the next second. He thought he might.</p><p>\u201cCan I help, sir?\u201d Bixby said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he managed to say. \u201cI\u2014he\u2014\u201d He gestured to Leckie, busy on the ground.</p><p>\u201cGeneral,\u201d said the newcomer, at his other elbow. He turned to find a blue-clad regular, a very young man in a baggy lieutenant\u2019s uniform, face set in dogged earnestness. \u201cI dislike to intrude, sir, but as your wife\u2019s not dying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant flinched, but stood his ground.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d he said stubbornly. \u201cGeneral Lee has sent me urgently to find you. He requires that you attend him at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger Lee,\u201d said Bixby, very rudely, saving Jamie the trouble, and advanced on the newcomer, fists clenched.</p><p>The lieutenant was already flushed with heat, but at this grew redder. He ignored Bixby, though, attention focused on Jamie.</p><p>\u201cYou must come, sir.\u201d</p><p>VOICES . . . I heard words, disjointed, coming out of the fog like bullets, striking randomly.</p><p>\u201c. . . find Denzell Hunter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but you\u2019re needed at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014orders\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>And another voice, this one stiff with fear.</p><p>\u201c. . . could be shot for treason and desertion, sir!\u201d</p><p>That focused my wandering attention and I heard the reply, clearly.</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll shoot me where I stand, sir, for I will not leave her side!\u201d</p><p>Good, I thought, and, comforted, lapsed into the spinning void again.</p><p>\u201cTAKE OFF YOUR coat and waistcoat, lad,\u201d Jamie said abruptly. The boy looked completely bewildered, but\u2014stimulated by a menacing movement from Bixby\u2014did as he was told. Jamie took him by the shoulder, turned him round, and said, \u201cStand still, aye?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stooping swiftly, he scooped a handful from the horrifying puddle of bloody mud and, standing, wrote carefully on the messenger\u2019s white back with a finger:</p><p>I resign my commission. J. Fraser.</p><p>He made to fling the remnants of mud away but, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, added a smeared and reluctant Sir at the top of the message, then clapped the boy on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGo and show that to General Lee,\u201d he said. The lieutenant went pale.</p> <p>\u201cThe general\u2019s in a horrid passion, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI dassen\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked at him. The boy swallowed, said, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d shrugged on his garments, and went at a run, unbuttoned and flapping.</p><p>Rubbing his hands heedlessly on his breeches, Jamie knelt again beside Dr. Leckie, who spared him a quick nod. The doctor was pressing a wad of lint and a handful of skirt hard against Claire\u2019s side with both hands. The surgeon\u2019s hands were red to the elbow, and sweat was running down his face, dripping from his chin.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d Jamie said softly, afraid to touch her. His own clothes were sodden with sweat, but he was cold to the core. \u201cCan ye hear me, lass?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d regained consciousness, and his heart rose into his throat. Her eyes were closed, shut tight in a furious grimace of pain and concentration. She did hear him; the golden eyes opened and fixed on him. She didn\u2019t speak; her breath hissed through clenched teeth. She did see him, though, he was sure of that\u2014and her eyes weren\u2019t clouded with shock, nor dim with imminent death. Not yet.</p> <p>Dr. Leckie was looking at her face, too, intent. He let out his own breath, and the tension in his shoulders eased a little, though he didn\u2019t relax the pressure of his hands.</p><p>\u201cCan you get me more lint, a wad of bandage, anything?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think the bleeding is slowing.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s bag lay open a little way behind Leckie. Jamie lunged for it, upended it on the ground, and snatched up a double handful of rolled bandages from the litter. Leckie\u2019s hand made a sucking sound as he pulled it away from the sopping wad of cloth and grabbed the fresh bandages.</p><p>\u201cYou might cut her laces,\u201d the doctor said calmly. \u201cI need her stays off. And it will help her to breathe more easily.\u201d</p><p>Jamie fumbled his dirk free, hands shaking in his haste.</p><p>\u201cUn . . . tie . . . them!\u201d Claire grunted, scowling ferociously.</p> <p>Jamie grinned absurdly at hearing her voice, and his hands steadied. So she thought she\u2019d live to need her laces. He gulped air and set himself to undo the knot. Her stay laces were leather and as usual soaked with sweat\u2014but she used a very simple granny knot, and he got it loose with the tip of his dirk.</p><p>The knot fell free and he jerked the laces loose, wrenching the stays wide apart. Her bosom rose white as she gasped, and he felt an instant\u2019s embarrassment as he saw her ni**les stiffen through the sweat-soaked fabric of her shift. He wanted to cover her.</p><p>There were flies everywhere, black and buzzing, drawn by the blood. Leckie shook his head to dislodge one that lighted on his eyebrow. They were swarming round Jamie\u2019s own ears, but he didn\u2019t bother about them, instead brushing them away as they crawled on Claire\u2019s body, over her twitching, pallid face, her hands half curled and helpless.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Leckie said, and, seizing one of Jamie\u2019s hands, pushed it down on the fresh compress. \u201cPress hard on that.\u201d He sat back on his heels, grabbed another bandage roll, and unfurled it. With some lifting and grunting and a terrible moan from Claire, together they contrived to pass the cingulum round her body, securing the dressing in place.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Leckie swayed for a moment, then got laboriously to his feet. \u201cThe bleeding\u2019s mostly stopped\u2014for now,\u201d he said to Jamie. \u201cI\u2019ll come back when I can.\u201d He swallowed and looked directly at Claire\u2019s face, wiping his chin on his sleeve. \u201cGood luck to you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he simply strode off toward the open doors of the church, not looking back. Jamie felt such a rush of fury that he would have gone after the man and dragged him back, could he have left Claire\u2019s side. He\u2019d left\u2014just left her, the bastard! Alone, helpless!</p><p>\u201cMay the devil eat your soul and salt it well first, you whore!\u201d he shouted in G\u00e0idhlig after the vanished surgeon. Overcome by fright and the sheer rage of helplessness, he dropped to his knees beside his wife and pounded a fist blindly on the ground.</p><p>\u201cDid you just . . . call him a . . . whore?\u201d The whispered words made him open his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSassenach!\u201d He was scrambling for his discarded canteen, lost in the rubble of stuff from her bag. \u201cHere, let me get ye water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not . . . yet.\u201d She managed to raise one hand halfway, and he stopped dead, canteen in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She was the gray of rotted oats and slick with sweat, trembling like a leaf. He could see her lips beginning to crack in the heat, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . . know.\u201d She worked her mouth a moment before finding the next words. \u201cDon\u2019t . . . know where it is.\u201d The trembling hand touched the dressing\u2014already showing a stain of blood seeping through. \u201cIf it\u2019s perf . . . perf\u2019rated the . . . bowel. Drink would . . . kill me. Fast. Intestin\u2019l . . . sh-sh-shock.\u201d</p><p>He sat down by her slowly and, closing his eyes, breathed deliberately for a few seconds. For the moment, everything had disappeared: the church, the battle, the screams and shouts and the rumble of limber wheels along the rutted road through Freehold. There wasn\u2019t anything but her and him, and he opened his eyes to look on her face, to fix it in his mind forever.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, keeping his voice as steady as he could. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s the case . . . and if it didna kill ye quick . . . I\u2019ve seen men die gutshot. Balnain died that way. It\u2019s long and it\u2019s foul, and I willna have ye die like that, Claire. I won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He meant it, truly he did. But his hand squeezed the canteen hard enough to dent the tin. How could he give her the water that might kill her right before his eyes, right . . . now?</p><p>Not now, he prayed. Please, don\u2019t let it be now!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not . . . keen . . . either way,\u201d she whispered, after a long pause. She blinked away a green-bellied fly, shining like emerald, that had come to drink her tears. \u201cI need . . . Denny.\u201d A soft gasp. \u201cQuick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming.\u201d He could barely breathe, and his hands hovered over her, afraid to touch anything. \u201cDenny\u2019s coming. Hold on!\u201d</p><p>The answer to this was a tiny grunt\u2014her eyes were squinched shut and her jaw set hard\u2014but she\u2019d heard him, at least. With the vague recollection that she always said you must cover folk suffering from shock and lift their feet, he took off his coat and put it over her, then took off his waistcoat, rolled it up, and shoved it under her feet. At least the coat covered the blood that had now soaked the whole side of her dress. It terrified him to see that.</p><p>Her fists were clenched, both driven hard into her wounded side; he couldn\u2019t hold her hand. He put a hand on her shoulder, so she\u2019d know he was there, shut his eyes, and prayed with his whole being.</p><p>SUNDOWN</p><p>THE SUN WAS NEARLY down, and Denzell Hunter was laying out his knives. The air was thick with the sweetness of corn liquor; he\u2019d dipped his instruments in it, and they lay gleaming wetly on the clean napkin Mrs. Macken had put down on the sideboard.</p><p>Young Mrs. Macken herself was hovering in the doorway, a hand pressed over her mouth and her eyes big as a cow\u2019s. Jamie tried to give her a reassuring smile, but whatever his expression was, it wasn\u2019t a smile and appeared to alarm her further, for she retreated into the darkness of her pantry.</p><p>She\u2019d likely been alarmed all day, like everyone else in the village of Freehold; she was heavily pregnant and her husband was fighting with the Continentals. And still more alarmed for the last hour, ever since Jamie had pounded on her door. He\u2019d battered six doors before hers. She was the first to answer, and, in poor return for her hospitality, now found a badly injured woman lying on her kitchen table, oozing blood like a fresh-killed deer.</p><p>That image unnerved him still further\u2014Mrs. Macken was not the only one in the house who was shaken by events\u2014and he came close and took Claire\u2019s hand, as much to reassure himself as her.</p><p>\u201cHow is it, Sassenach?\u201d he said, low-voiced.</p><p>\u201cBloody awful,\u201d she replied hoarsely, and bit her lip to keep from saying more.</p><p>\u201cHad ye best have a wee nip?\u201d He moved to pick up the bottle of rough corn liquor from the sideboard, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot quite yet. I don\u2019t think it struck the bowel\u2014but I\u2019d rather die of blood loss than sepsis or shock, if I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. It was cold, and he hoped she would keep talking, though at the same time he knew he ought not to make her talk. She\u2019d need all her strength. He tried as hard as he could to will some of his own strength into her without hurting her.</p><p>Mrs. Macken edged into the room, carrying a candlestick with a fresh wax candle; he could smell the sweetness of the beeswax, and the scent of honey reminded him of John Grey. He wondered for an instant whether Grey had made it back to the British lines, but he had no real attention for anything but Claire.</p><p>Right this moment, he was busy regretting that he\u2019d ever disapproved of her making ether. He would have given anything he possessed to spare her awareness of the next half hour.</p><p>The setting sun washed the room in gold, and the blood seeping through her bandages showed dark.</p><p>\u201cALWAYS CONCENTRATE when you\u2019re using a sharp knife,\u201d I said weakly. \u201cYou might lose a finger, else. My granny used to say that, and my mother, too.\u201d</p><p>My mother had died when I was five, my granny a few years later\u2014but I hadn\u2019t seen her often, as Uncle Lamb spent at least half his time on archaeological expeditions round the world, with me as part of his baggage.</p><p>\u201cDid you frequently play with sharp knives as a child?\u201d Denny asked. He smiled, though his eyes stayed fixed on the scalpel he was carefully sharpening on a small oilstone. I could smell the oil, a soft murky scent under the tang of blood and the resinous smell of the unfinished rafters baking overhead.</p><p>\u201cConstantly,\u201d I breathed, and shifted my position as slowly as I could. I bit my lip hard and managed to ease my back without groaning aloud. It made Jamie\u2019s knuckles go white when I did.</p><p>He was standing by the window at the moment, clutching the sill as he looked out.</p><p>Seeing him there, broad shoulders outlined by the sinking sun, brought back a sudden memory, surprising in its sharpness. Or rather, memories, for the layers of experience came back altogether, in a wodge, and I was seeing Jamie rigid with his fear and grief, the slight black figure of Malva Christie leaning toward him\u2014and remembered feeling both a vague affront and a tremendous sense of peace as I began to leave my body, carried on the wings of fever.</p><p>I shook the memory off at once, frightened even to think of that beckoning peace. The fear was reassuring; I wasn\u2019t yet so close to death as to find it appealing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it went through the liver,\u201d I said to Denny, gritting my teeth. \u201cThat much blood . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure thee is right,\u201d he said, pressing gently on my side. \u201cThe liver is a great mass of densely vascularized tissue,\u201d he added, turning to Jamie, who didn\u2019t turn from the window but hunched his shoulders against the possibility of being told anything else of a horrifying nature.</p><p>\u201cBut the excellent thing about a wound to the liver,\u201d Denny added cheerfully, \u201cis that the liver, unlike the other organs of the body, will regenerate itself\u2014or so thy wife tells me.\u201d</p><p>Jamie cast me a brief, haunted look, and went back to staring out the window. I breathed as shallowly as I could, trying to ignore the pain, and trying even harder not to think about what Denny was about to do.</p><p>That little exercise in self-discipline lasted about three seconds. If we were all lucky, it would be simple, and quick. He had to widen the bullet\u2019s entrance wound enough to see the direction of its track and to insert a probe along it, in hopes of finding the bullet before he had to dig for it. Then a quick\u2014I could only hope\u2014insertion of whichever one of his jawed forceps looked most appropriate. He had three, of different lengths, plus a davier: good for grasping a rounded object, but the jaws were much bigger than the tips of a forceps and would cause more bleeding.</p><p>If it wasn\u2019t simple or quick, I\u2019d very likely be dead within the next half hour. Denny was entirely correct in what he\u2019d told Jamie: the liver is hugely vascularized, an enormous sponge of tiny blood vessels crossed by very large ones like the hepatic portal vein. That\u2019s why the wound, superficially tiny, had bled so alarmingly. None of the major vessels had been damaged\u2014yet\u2014because I would have bled to death in minutes if they had been.</p><p>I was trying to breathe shallowly, because of the pain, but had an overwhelming need to draw deep, gasping breaths; I needed oxygen, because of the blood loss.</p><p>Sally flitted through my mind, and I seized on thought of her as distraction. She\u2019d survived the amputation, screaming through a leather gag, Gabriel\u2014yes, Gabriel, that was the name of the young man with her\u2014white-eyed as a panicked horse, fighting to hold her steady and not to faint himself. She had fainted, luckily, toward the end\u2014So sucks to you, Ernest, I thought blearily\u2014and I\u2019d left them both in Rachel\u2019s care.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Rachel, Denny?\u201d I asked, suddenly thinking to wonder. I thought I\u2019d glimpsed her briefly in the churchyard after I\u2019d been shot, but couldn\u2019t be sure of anything that had happened in that blur of black and white.</p><p>Denny\u2019s hand stopped for an instant, the cautery iron he was holding suspended over a tiny brazier he\u2019d set fuming at the end of the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cShe is searching for Ian, I believe,\u201d he said quietly, and laid the iron very gently in the fire. \u201cIs thee ready, Claire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian, I thought. Oh, God. He hasn\u2019t come back.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d I managed, already imagining the stench of burning flesh. Mine.</p><p>If the bullet was resting near one of the large vessels, Denny\u2019s probing and grasping could rupture it and I\u2019d hemorrhage internally. The cauterization might cause shock suddenly to set in and assassinate me without warning. Most likely, I\u2019d survive the surgery but die of lingering infection. Consoling thought . . . At least in that case I\u2019d have time to write a brief note to Brianna\u2014and perhaps warn Jamie to be more careful about who he married next time. . . .</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Jamie said. He didn\u2019t raise his voice, but there was enough urgency in it to freeze Denny.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, rested a hand gingerly on the dressing, and tried to envision just where the damned bullet might be. Was it only in the liver, or had it gone all the way through? There was so much trauma and swelling, though, that the pain was generalized over the whole right side of my abdomen; I couldn\u2019t pick out a single, vivid line of bright pain leading to the ball.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jamie?\u201d Denny asked, impatient to be about his business.</p><p>\u201cYour betrothed,\u201d Jamie said, sounding bemused. \u201cComing up the road with a gang of soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes thee think she is under arrest?\u201d Denny asked, with a fair assumption of calm. I saw his hand tremble slightly as he picked up a linen napkin, though.</p><p>\u201cI dinna think so,\u201d Jamie said doubtfully. \u201cShe\u2019s laughing wi\u2019 a couple of them.\u201d</p> <p>Denny took his spectacles off and wiped them carefully.</p><p>\u201cDorothea is a Grey,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAny member of her family would pause on the gallows to exchange witty banter with the hangman before graciously putting the noose about his neck with his own hands.\u201d</p><p>That was so true that it made me laugh, though my humor was cut off at once by a jolt of pain that took my breath away. Jamie looked at me sharply, but I flapped a hand weakly at him, and he went to open the door.</p><p>Dorothea popped in, turning to wave over her shoulder and call goodbye to her escort, and I heard Denny sigh in relief as he put his spectacles back on.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said, going to kiss him. \u201cI hoped you hadn\u2019t started yet. I\u2019ve brought a few things. Mrs. Fraser\u2014Claire\u2014how are you? I mean, how is thee?\u201d She put down the large basket she was carrying and came at once to the table I was lying on, to take my hand and gaze sympathetically at me with her big blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been slightly better,\u201d I said, making an effort not to grit my teeth. I felt clammy and nauseated.</p> <p>\u201cGeneral La Fayette was most concerned to hear that you\u2019d been hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has all of his aides telling their rosary beads for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow kind,\u201d I said, meaning it, but rather hoping the marquis hadn\u2019t sent a complicated greeting that I might need to compose a reply to. Having got this far, I wanted to get the bloody business over with, no matter what happened.</p><p>\u201cAnd he sent this,\u201d she said, a rather smug look on her face as she held up a squat green-glass bottle. \u201cThee will want this first, I think, Denny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Denny began, reaching for the bottle, but Dorothea had pulled the cork, and the sweet cough-syrup smell of sherry rolled out\u2014with the ghost of a very distinctive herbal scent beneath it, something between camphor and sage.</p><p>\u201cLaudanum,\u201d said Jamie, and his face took on such a startling look of relief that only then did I realize how frightened he had been for me. \u201cGod bless ye, Dottie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt occurred to me that Friend Gilbert might just possibly have a few things that might be useful,\u201d she said modestly. \u201cAll the Frenchmen I know are dreadful cranks about their health and have enormous collections of tonics and pastilles and clysters. So I went and asked.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had me half sitting, with his arm braced behind my back and the bottle at my lips, before I could add my own thanks.</p><p>\u201cWait, will you?\u201d I said crossly, putting my hand over the bottle\u2019s open mouth. \u201cI haven\u2019t any idea how strong this stuff is. You won\u2019t do me any good by killing me with opium.\u201d</p> <p>It cost me something to say so; my instinct was to drain the bottle forthwith, if it would stop the beastly pain. That nitwit Spartan who allowed the fox to gnaw his vitals had nothing on me. But, come right down to it, I didn\u2019t want to die, either of gunshot, fever, or medical misadventure. And so Dottie borrowed a spoon from Mrs. Macken, who watched in grisly fascination from the door while I took two spoonfuls, lay down, and waited an interminable quarter of an hour to judge the effects.</p><p>\u201cThe marquis sent all sorts of delicacies and things to aid your recovery,\u201d Dottie said encouragingly, turning to the basket and starting to lift things out by way of distraction. \u201cPartridge in jelly, mushroom p\u00e2t\u00e9, some terrible-smelling cheese, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>My sudden desire to vomit ceased just as suddenly, and I half-sat up, causing Jamie to emit a cry of alarm and grab me by the shoulders. Just as well that he did; I would have fallen onto the floor. I wasn\u2019t attending, though, my attention fixed on Dottie\u2019s basket.</p><p>\u201cRoquefort,\u201d I said urgently. \u201cIs it Roquefort cheese? Sort of gray, with green and blue veins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, startled by my vehemence. She gingerly plucked a cloth-wrapped parcel out of the basket and held it delicately in front of me. The odor wafting from it was enough, and I relaxed\u2014very slowly\u2014back down.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I breathed. \u201cDenzell\u2014when you\u2019ve finished . . . pack the wound with cheese.\u201d</p><p>Used to me as he was, this still made Denny\u2019s jaw drop. He glanced from me to the cheese, plainly thinking that fever must have set in with unusual speed and severity.</p><p>\u201cPenicillin,\u201d I said, swallowing and waving a hand at the cheese. My mouth felt sticky from the laudanum. \u201cThe mold that makes that sort of cheese is a species of Penicillium. Use the stuff from the veins.\u201d</p><p>Denny shut his mouth and nodded, determined.</p><p>\u201cI will. But we must begin soon, Claire. The light is going.\u201d</p><p>The light was going, and the sense of urgency in the room was palpable. But Mrs. Macken brought more candles, and Denny assured me that it was a simple operation; he would do quite as well by candlelight.</p><p>More laudanum. I was beginning to feel it\u2014a not unpleasant dizzy sensation\u2014and I made Jamie lay me down again. The pain was definitely less.</p><p>\u201cGive me a bit more,\u201d I said, and my voice didn\u2019t seem to belong to me.</p><p>I took as deep a breath as I could and eased myself into a good position, looking with distaste at the leather gag that lay beside me. Someone\u2014perhaps Dr. Leckie\u2014had slit my shift up the side earlier in the proceedings. I spread the edges of the opening wide and stretched out my hand to Jamie.</p><p>The shadows grew between the smoke-stained rafters. The kitchen fire was banked, but still live, and the glow of it began to show red on the hearth. Looking up at the flickering rafters in my drugged state reminded me too much of the time I had nearly died of bacterial poisoning, and I shut my eyes.</p><p>Jamie was holding my left hand, curled on my breast, his other hand gently stroking my hair, smoothing damp wisps of it off my face.</p><p>\u201cBetter now, a nighean?\u201d he whispered, and I nodded\u2014or thought I did. Mrs. Macken murmured some question to Dottie, received an answer, and went out. The pain was still there but distant now, a small, flickering fire that I could shut out by closing my eyes. The thud of my heartbeat was more immediate, and I was beginning to experience . . . not hallucinations, quite. Disconnected images, though\u2014the faces of strangers that faded in and out behind my eyes. Some were looking at me, others seemed oblivious; they smiled and sneered and grimaced but had nothing, really, to do with me.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie whispered, lifting my head and putting the spoon to my lips, sticky with sherry and the bitter taste of opium. \u201cOne more.\u201d I swallowed and lay back. If I died, would I see my mother again? I wondered, and experienced an urgent longing for her, shocking in its intensity.</p><p>I was trying to summon her face before me, bring her out of the floating horde of strangers, when I suddenly lost my grip on my own thoughts and began to float off into a sphere of dark, dark blue.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Claire,\u201d Jamie whispered, very close to my ear. \u201cThis time, I\u2019ll beg. Dinna go from me. Please.\u201d I could feel the warmth of his face, see the glow of his breath on my cheek, though my eyes were closed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I said\u2014or thought I said\u2014and went. My last clear thought was that I\u2019d forgotten to tell him not to marry a fool.</p><p>THE SKY OUTSIDE was lavender, and Claire\u2019s skin was washed with gold. Six candles burned around the room, the flames tall and still in the heavy air.</p><p>Jamie stood by her head, a hand on her shoulder as though he could comfort her. In fact, it was the sense of her, still alive under his hand, that was keeping him on his feet.</p><p>Denny made a small sound of satisfaction behind his highwayman\u2019s mask, and Jamie saw the muscle of his bared forearm tense as he slowly drew the instrument out of Claire\u2019s body. Blood gushed from the wound, and Jamie tensed like a cat, ready to spring forward with a pledget, but no spurt followed and the blood died to a trickle, with a final small blurt of blood as the jaws of the instrument emerged, something dark clamped between them.</p><p>Denny dropped the ball into the palm of his hand and peered at it, then made an irritable noise; his glasses were fogged with the sweat of his efforts. Jamie snatched them off the Quaker\u2019s nose and rubbed them hastily on his shirttail, replacing them before Hunter could blink twice.</p><p>\u201cI thank thee,\u201d Denny said mildly, returning his attention to the musket ball. He turned it delicately and let out an audible breath.</p><p>\u201cWhole,\u201d he said. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeo gratias,\u201d Jamie echoed fervently, and reached out a hand. \u201cLet me see it, will ye?\u201d</p><p>Hunter\u2019s brows rose, but he dropped the thing in Jamie\u2019s hand. It was startlingly warm, warm from her body. Warmer even than the air or Jamie\u2019s own sweating flesh, and the feel of it made him fold his fist over it. He stole a look at Claire\u2019s chest: rising, falling, though with alarming slowness. Almost as slowly, he opened his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat is thee looking for, Jamie?\u201d Denny asked, pausing to re-sterilize his beaked probe.</p><p>\u201cMarks. A slit, a cross\u2014any mark of tampering.\u201d He rolled the ball carefully between his fingers, then relaxed, a small spurt of gratitude making him murmur, \u201cDeo gratias,\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cTampering?\u201d There were vertical lines between Denny\u2019s brows, deepening as he looked up. \u201cTo make the ball fragment, thee means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014or worse. Sometimes a man will rub something into the marks\u2014poison, say, or . . . or shit. Just in case the wound itself isna fatal, aye?\u201d</p><p>Hunter looked shocked, his appalled expression clear even behind the shielding handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cIf ye mean to kill a man, ye mean him harm,\u201d Jamie said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d Hunter looked down, laying his tool carefully on the towel as though it were made of porcelain, not metal. His breath fluttered the handkerchief tied over his mouth. \u201cBut it is one thing, surely, to kill in battle, to shoot at an enemy when it is a matter of one\u2019s own life . . . and to form the cold-blooded intent that your enemy should die a horrible and lingering death . . .\u201d</p><p>Claire made a ghastly moaning noise and twitched under his hands as Denny gently squeezed the flesh on either side of the wound. Jamie gripped her by the elbows, to keep her from turning. Denny picked up the jawed thing again.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do it yourself,\u201d Hunter said with certainty. His eyes were intent on his delicate probing, a pledget held to catch the blood that dribbled slowly from the wound. Jamie felt the loss of each drop as though it left his own veins, and felt cold; how much could she lose and still live?</p><p>\u201cNo. It would be a cowardly thing.\u201d But he spoke automatically, scarcely attending. She had gone limp; he saw her fingers uncurl, droop, and looked at her face, her throat, searching for a visible pulse. He felt one, in his thumb where it pressed the bone of her arm, but couldn\u2019t tell whether it was her heart that beat there or his own.</p><p>He was acutely conscious of Denny\u2019s breath, audible behind his mask. It stopped for an instant, and Jamie glanced up from his scrutiny of Claire\u2019s face to see the Quaker\u2019s look of intentness as he drew the thing free once more\u2014this time clutching a tiny clump of something unrecognizable. Denny opened the jaws of his forceps and dropped the clump on the towel, then used the tool to poke at it, trying to spread it, and Jamie saw the prickle of tiny dark threads as the blood soaked away into a bright red stain on the towel. Cloth.</p><p>\u201cWhat does thee think?\u201d Denny asked him, frowning at the thing. \u201cIs it a bit of her shift, or the\u2014the bodice\u2014or material from her stays? For from the hole in her stays, I should think . . .\u201d</p><p>Jamie rootled hastily in his sporran, pulled out the little silk bag in which he kept the spectacles he used for reading, and clapped these on his nose.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve at least two separate bits there,\u201d he announced, after an anxious perusal. \u201cCanvas from the stays, and a lighter bit of cloth. See?\u201d He took up a probe and delicately teased the fragments apart. \u201cI think that one bit\u2019s her shift.\u201d</p><p>Denny glanced at the disconsolate pile of bloodstained garments on the floor, and Jamie, at once divining his intent, reached in, stirred about, and pulled out the remnants of her dress.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a clean hole,\u201d Denny said, looking at the fabric Jamie spread out on the table. \u201cMaybe . . .\u201d He picked up the forceps and turned back, not finishing.</p><p>More probing, deeper, and Jamie gritted his teeth not to cry out in protest. \u201cThe liver is so vascular,\u201d she\u2019d said, talking Denny through what he must do. \u201cThe risk of hemorrhage . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Denny murmured, not looking up. The sweat had plastered the handkerchief to his face, molding itself to nose and lips, so his speech was visible. \u201cI\u2019m being . . . careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKen that,\u201d Jamie said, but so softly he didn\u2019t know whether Hunter heard him. Please. Please let her live. Blessed Mother, save her . . . saveher, saveher, saveher . . . The words all ran together in an instant and he lost the sense of them, but not the sense of desperate entreaty.</p><p>The red stain on the toweling under her had grown to alarming proportions by the time Hunter set down his tool again and sighed, shoulders slumping.</p><p>\u201cI think\u2014I hope\u2014I have it all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I\u2014what will ye do next?\u201d</p><p>He saw Denny smile a little behind the sodden cloth, olive-brown eyes soft and steady over it.</p><p>\u201cCauterize it, bind the wound, and pray, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>NIGHTFALL</p><p>IT WAS PAST DARK when Lord John Grey, accompanied by a respectful escort and a slightly damaged Indian, limped into Clinton\u2019s camp.</p> <p>Things were much as might be expected after a battle: strong currents of mingled agitation and exhaustion, the latter prevailing. No carousing amid the tents, no music. Men around the fires and camp kitchens, though, eating, getting themselves sorted, talking it over in low tones. No sense of celebration\u2014more a sense of irritation, of disgruntled surprise. The scent of roast mutton came strongly through the smells of dust, mules, and sweating humanity, and Grey\u2019s mouth watered so much that he had to swallow before replying to Captain Andr\u00e9\u2019s solicitous inquiry as to his immediate desires.</p><p>\u201cI need to see my brother,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019ll attend upon General Clinton and my lord Cornwallis later. When I\u2019ve washed and changed,\u201d he added, shucking the horrible black coat for what he sincerely hoped was the last time.</p><p>Andr\u00e9 nodded understandingly, taking the vile garment from him.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lord John. And . . . um . . . ?\u201d He nodded delicately in the direction of Ian Murray, who was attracting glances, if not stares, from pass-ersby.</p><p>\u201cAh. He\u2019d best come, too.\u201d</p><p>He followed Andr\u00e9 through the orderly aisles of tents, hearing the clinking of mess kits and feeling the comfort of the army\u2019s stolid routine settle into place around him. Murray paced at his heel, silent. He\u2019d no idea what the man was thinking and was too weary to care.</p> <p>He did feel Murray\u2019s step falter, though, and automatically looked over his shoulder. Murray had turned, all his attention focused on a nearby fire, this an open wood fire, around which sat several Indians. Grey wondered dimly whether these might be friends of Murray\u2019s . . . and corrected this impression in the next second, as Murray took three giant strides, grabbed one of the Indians with a forearm round his throat, and punched him in the side with such force as to drive the other\u2019s wind out in an audible whoop.</p><p>Murray then threw the Indian on the ground, dropped on him with both knees\u2014Grey winced at the impact\u2014and gripped the man by the throat. The other Indians lurched out of the way, laughing and making high-pitched yips of encouragement or derision, Grey couldn\u2019t tell which.</p><p>He stood there blinking, swaying slightly, and unable either to intervene or to look away. Murray had declined to let one of the field surgeons remove the arrowhead from his shoulder, and fresh blood spattered from the wound as he punched his opponent viciously\u2014and repeatedly\u2014in the face.</p><p>The Indian\u2014he had a shaved scalp and dangling earrings of shell; Grey noticed these when Murray ripped one out of the ear and stuffed it into his opponent\u2019s mouth\u2014was making a stout attempt at resistance and retaliation, in spite of his being taken at such a disadvantage.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose they are acquainted?\u201d Captain Andr\u00e9 asked Grey. He had turned back, hearing the outcries, and was now standing beside Grey, watching the affray with interest.</p><p>\u201cI think they must be,\u201d Grey replied absently. He glanced briefly at the other Indians, none of whom seemed to have any interest in assisting their fellow, though a few of them appeared to be making wagers on the result. They\u2019d plainly been drinking, but seemed no more intoxicated than the average soldier at this time of day.</p><p>The combatants were now squirming on the ground, evidently striving for possession of a large knife worn by the man Murray had attacked. The fight was attracting attention from other quarters; a number of men had hurried over from nearby fires and were clustered behind Grey and Andr\u00e9, making speculations and hasty bets, offering shouted advice.</p><p>Grey was conscious, through his fatigue, of a certain concern for Murray\u2014and not only on Murray\u2019s own account. On the off chance that he might at some point in future actually speak with Jamie Fraser again, he didn\u2019t want the first subject raised to be the demise of Fraser\u2019s nephew while more or less in Grey\u2019s custody. He couldn\u2019t think what the hell to do about it, though, and thus continued to stand there, watching.</p> <p>Like most fights, it didn\u2019t last very long. Murray gained possession of the knife, by the brutal but effective expedient of bending one of his opponent\u2019s fingers backward \u2019til it broke and grabbing the hilt as the man let go.</p><p>As Murray pressed the blade against the other man\u2019s throat, it belatedly occurred to Grey that he might really intend to kill him. The men around him certainly thought so; there was a universal gasp as Murray drew the blade across his enemy\u2019s throat.</p><p>The momentary silence engendered by this was enough for most of the assembled to hear Murray say, with a noticeable effort, \u201cI give you back your life!\u201d He rose off the Indian\u2019s body, swaying and staring as though blind drunk himself, and hurled the knife into the darkness\u2014causing considerable consternation and not a little cursing among those in whose direction he\u2019d hurled it.</p><p>In the excitement, most of the crowd likely didn\u2019t hear the Indian\u2019s reply, but Grey and Andr\u00e9 did. He sat up, very slowly, hands shaking as they pressed a fold of his shirt to the shallow cut across his throat, and said, in an almost conversational tone, \u201cYou will regret that, Mohawk.\u201d</p><p>Murray was breathing like a winded horse, his ribs visible with each gasp. Most of the paint had gone from his face; there were long smears of red and black down his glistening chest, and only a horizontal streak of some dark color remained across his cheekbones\u2014that and a smudge of white on the point of his shoulder, above the arrow wound. He nodded to himself, once, then twice. And, without haste, stepped back into the circle of firelight, picked up a tomahawk that was lying on the ground, and, swinging it high with both hands, brought it down on the Indian\u2019s skull.</p><p>The sound froze Grey to the marrow and silenced every man present. Murray stood still for a moment, breathing heavily, then walked away. As he passed Grey, he turned his head and said, in a perfectly conversational tone of voice, \u201cHe\u2019s right. I would have,\u201d before disappearing into the night.</p><p>There was a sudden, belated stir among the spectators, and Andr\u00e9 glanced at Grey, but he shook his head. The army took no official notice of what went on among the Indian scouts, save there was an incident involving regulars. And they didn\u2019t get more irregular than the gentleman who had just left them.</p><p>Andr\u00e9 cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWas he your . . . er . . . prisoner, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . no. A, erm . . . relation by marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS FULL dark before the battle ended. William gathered as much from the orderly who\u2019d brought him supper, and he could hear the sounds of a camp slowly reassembling itself as companies of soldiers came in, were dismissed, and scattered to drop their equipment and find food. Nothing like the usual sense of relaxation that lay on a camp after sunset. Everything was agitated and restless\u2014and so was William.</p><p>His head ached horribly and someone had stitched his scalp; the stitches were tender and itching. Uncle Hal hadn\u2019t come back, and he\u2019d had no news whatever beyond the orderly\u2019s sketchy report, which indicated only that there had been no clear victory over the Americans but that all three parts of Clinton\u2019s army had withdrawn in good order, though with considerable casualties.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted any further news, to be honest. There was going to be a moment of reckoning with Sir Henry about that ignored order\u2014though he supposed Sir Henry might just possibly be too preoccupied to realize . . .</p><p>Then he heard the sound of footsteps and sat up. His fretting disappeared on the instant when the tent flap lifted and he saw his father\u2014Lord John, he corrected himself, but as an absent afterthought. His father seemed surprisingly small, almost fragile, and as Lord John limped slowly into the lantern light, William saw the stained bandage round his head, the makeshift sling, and when William cast his eyes down, he saw, too, the state of his father\u2019s bare feet.</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d he began, shocked, but Lord John interrupted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said, and tried for a smile, though his face was white and creased with fatigue. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right, Willie. As long as you\u2019re alive, everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He saw his father sway, put out a hand as though to steady himself, and, finding nothing to take hold of, withdraw it and force his body upright. Lord John\u2019s voice was hoarse, and his exposed eye bloodshot and exhausted but . . . tender. William swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIf you and I have things to say to each other, Willie\u2014and of course we do\u2014let it wait until tomorrow. Please. I\u2019m not . . .\u201d He made a vague, wavering gesture that ended nowhere.</p><p>The lump in William\u2019s throat was sudden and painful. He nodded, hands clenched tight on the bedding. His father nodded, too, drew a deep breath, and turned toward the tent flap\u2014where, William saw, Uncle Hal was hovering, eyes fixed on his brother and brows drawn with worry.</p><p>William\u2019s heart seized, in a lump more painful than the one in his throat.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d His father stopped abruptly, turning to look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dead,\u201d William blurted.</p><p>A smile blossomed slowly on his father\u2019s battered face.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>IAN MADE HIS way out of the British camp, looking neither to right nor to left. The night was throbbing slowly round him. It was like being trapped inside a huge heart, he thought, feeling the thick walls squeeze him breathless, then draw away to leave him floating and weightless.</p><p>Lord John had offered to have an army surgeon tend his wound, but he couldn\u2019t bear to stay. He needed to go, to find Rachel, find Uncle Jamie. Had refused the offer of a horse, as well, unsure that he could stay on it. He\u2019d do better walking, he\u2019d told his lordship.</p><p>And he was walking all right, though obliged to admit that he didn\u2019t feel just that well in himself. His arms were still trembling from the shock of the killing blow. It had come up from his bowels and was still echoing through his bones, couldn\u2019t seem to find a way out of his body. Well, it would settle soon enough\u2014this wasn\u2019t the first time, though he hadn\u2019t killed anyone in a long while, and a longer while since he\u2019d done it with that much violence.</p><p>He tried to think who the last one had been, but couldn\u2019t. He could hear and see and feel things, but while his senses worked, they weren\u2019t joined up aright with the things he sensed. Troops were still marching past him into the camp. The battle must have ceased now with the darkness; the soldiers were coming home. He could hear the din they made, marching, their tin cups and canteens jangling against their cartridge boxes\u2014but he heard it clanging long after they\u2019d passed, and he couldn\u2019t always tell the light of distant campfires from the glow of fireflies near his feet.</p><p>The Scottish overseer. At Saratoga. The man\u2019s face was suddenly there in his memory, and just as suddenly his body remembered the feel of the blow. The violent punch of his knife, hard up under the man\u2019s back ribs, straight into the kidney. The huge, strange flexing he\u2019d felt in his own body as the man\u2019s life surged up and then rushed out.</p><p>He wondered for a dazed moment whether butchers felt it\u2014that echo\u2014when they slaughtered a beast. You did, sometimes, when you cut a deer\u2019s throat, but usually not if it was just wringing a chicken\u2019s neck or crushing a weasel\u2019s skull.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe ye just get used to it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe ye\u2019d best try not to get used to it. Canna be good for your soul, a bhalaich, bein\u2019 used to that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut ye mean when it\u2019s with your hands, aye? It\u2019s no the same wi\u2019 a gun or an arrow, now, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no. I did wonder sometimes, does it make a difference to the man ye kill, as well as yourself?\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s feet blundered into a knee-high growth of thick weed and he realized that he\u2019d stumbled off the road. It was just past the dark of the moon, and the stars still faint overhead.</p><p>\u201cDifferent,\u201d he murmured, steering back into the roadway. \u201cHow d\u2019ye mean, different? He\u2019d be dead, either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s so. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s maybe worse to feel it\u2019s personal, though. Bein\u2019 shot in battle\u2019s more like bein\u2019 struck by lightning, ken? But ye canna help it bein\u2019 personal when ye do a man to death wi\u2019 your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Ian walked a bit farther in silence, the thoughts in his head circling like leeches swimming in a glass, going this way and that.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said at last\u2014and realized suddenly that he\u2019d spoken aloud for the first time. \u201cIt was personal.\u201d</p><p>The trembling in his bones had eased with the walking. The huge throbbing of the night had shrunk and come to rest in the arrow wound, the ache of it pulsing to the beat of his own heart.</p><p>It made him think of Rachel\u2019s white dove, though, flying serene above the hurt, and his mind steadied. He could see Rachel\u2019s face now, and he could hear crickets chirping. The cannon fire in his ears had stopped and the night grew slowly peaceful. And if his da had more to say on the subject of killing, he chose to keep his silence as they walked toward home together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>JOHN GREY EASED his battered feet into the pan, teeth gritted against the expected sensation, but to his surprise found that it caused him little pain, in spite of the torn skin and ruptured blisters.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014that\u2019s not hot water, is it?\u201d he asked, leaning forward to look.</p><p>\u201cSweet oil,\u201d his brother said, his worn face relaxing a little. \u201cAnd it had better be warm, not hot, or my orderly will be crucified at dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the man trembles in his boots. Thank you, by the way,\u201d he added, gingerly dabbling. He was sitting on Hal\u2019s cot, his brother perched on the campaign chest, pouring something out of a canteen into one of the scarred pewter cups that had accompanied him for decades.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Hal said, handing him the cup. \u201cWhat the devil happened to your eye?

At first I thought my arm was broken, but I\u2019m fairly sure it\u2019s just badly bruised. As for the eye . . . Jamie Fraser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Hal looked surprised and bent forward to peer at Grey\u2019s eye, now unwrapped from the bandages and\u2014so far as Grey himself could tell\u2014much improved. The constant watering had stopped, the swelling had gone down quite a bit, and he could, with caution, move it. From the look on Hal\u2019s face, though, the redness and bruising had perhaps not quite disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWell, first Jamie, and then his wife.\u201d He touched the eye lightly. \u201cHe punched me, and then she did something excruciating to fix it and put honey in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving been subject to the lady\u2019s notions of medical treatment, I am not even faintly surprised to hear that.\u201d Hal lifted his cup in brief salute; Grey did the same and they drank. It was cider, and a dim recollection of applejack and Colonel Watson Smith floated through Grey\u2019s mind. Both seemed remote, as though they\u2019d happened years ago rather than days.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Fraser doctored you?\u201d Grey grinned at his brother. \u201cWhat did she do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . saved my life, to be perfectly frank.\u201d It was hard to tell in the lantern light, but Grey thought his brother was blushing slightly.</p><p>\u201cOh. In that case, I\u2019m doubly obliged to her.\u201d He raised the cup again ceremoniously, then drained it. The cider went down gratefully after a hot day with no food. \u201cHow the hell did you fall into her clutches?\u201d he asked curiously, extending the cup for more.</p><p>\u201cI was looking for you,\u201d Hal said pointedly. \u201cIf you\u2019d been where you were supposed to be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m supposed to be sitting somewhere waiting for you to turn up without warning and involve me in\u2014do you know you nearly got me hanged? Besides, I was busy being kidnapped by James Fraser at the time.\u201d</p><p>Hal raised one eyebrow and poured more cider. \u201cYes, you did say he\u2019d punched you. What for?\u201d</p> <p>Grey rubbed two fingers between his brows. He hadn\u2019t really noticed the headache before, only because he\u2019d had it all day. Hal was definitely making it worse, though.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t begin to explain it, Hal,\u201d he said tiredly. \u201cCan you find me a bed? I think I\u2019m going to die, and if by some unfortunate chance I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll have to speak to Willie tomorrow about . . . well, never mind.\u201d He drank the last of the cider and set down the cup, preparing reluctantly to lift his feet from the soothing oil.</p><p>\u201cI know about William,\u201d Hal said.</p><p>Grey stopped abruptly, looking dubiously at his brother, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI saw Fraser,\u201d he said simply. \u201cIn Philadelphia. And when I said something to William this afternoon, he confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Grey murmured. He was surprised but somewhat heartened by that. If Willie had calmed down sufficiently as to talk to Hal about the matter, Grey\u2019s own conversation with his son might be a trifle less fraught than he\u2019d feared.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known?\u201d Hal asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cFor certain? Since Willie was two or three.\u201d He suddenly gave an enormous yawn, then sat blinking stupidly. \u201cOh\u2014meant to ask. How did the battle go?\u201d</p> <p>Hal looked at him with something between affront and amusement. \u201cYou were bloody in it, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy part of it didn\u2019t go that well. But my perspective was somewhat limited by circumstance. That, and having only one working eye,\u201d he added, gently prodding the bad one. A good night\u2019s sleep . . . Longing for bed made him sway, narrowly catching himself before simply falling into Hal\u2019s cot.</p><p>\u201cHard to tell.\u201d Hal fished a crumpled towel out of a basket of laundry lurking disreputably in a corner and, kneeling down, lifted Grey\u2019s feet out of the oil and blotted them gently. \u201cHell of a mess. Terrible ground, chopped up by creeks, either farmland or half covered in trees . . . Sir Henry got away with the baggage train and refugees all safe. But as for Washington . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSo far as I can tell from what I saw and heard, his troops acquitted themselves well. Remarkably well,\u201d he added thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \u201cLie down, John. I\u2019ll find a bed somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Grey was much too tired to argue. He simply fell over and rolled onto his back, not bothering to undress. The bad eye felt gritty, and he wondered dimly whether to ask Hal to find some honey but decided that could wait \u2019til morning.</p><p>Hal took the lantern from its hook and turned toward the tent flap, but paused for an instant, turning back.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Mrs. Fraser\u2014by the way, tomorrow I want to know how on earth she came to marry you\u2014do you think she knows about William and James Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone with eyes who\u2019d seen the two of them would know,\u201d Grey murmured, eyes half closed. \u201cShe never mentioned it, though.\u201d</p><p>Hal grunted. \u201cApparently everyone knew\u2014save William. Little wonder he\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one word for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t found one yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Grey\u2019s eyes closed all the way. Through the drifting mists of sleep, he heard Hal\u2019s quiet voice, by the tent flap.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had word of Ben. They say he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>LONG ROAD HOME</p><p>JAMIE SAT BY THE tiny window in his shirt and breeches, watching his wife\u2019s hair dry.</p><p>It was hot as a forge in the tiny spare room Mrs. Macken had given them, and his sweat lay on him in a heavy dew that broke under its own weight and ran down his sides with any movement, but he was careful not to block any faint breath of air that might seep into the room; the air reeked of Roquefort cheese and blood.</p><p>He\u2019d soaked her hair with water from the ewer Mrs. Macken had brought and wetted her shift; it clung to her body, the round of her buttock showing pink through the fabric as it dried. It showed the thick wad of the dressing, too, and the bloody stain that spread slow upon the cloth.</p><p>Slow. His lips formed the word and he thought it passionately but didn\u2019t speak aloud. Slow! Stopping altogether would be much better, but he\u2019d settle for slow just now.</p><p>Eight pints. That\u2019s how much blood she said a human body had. It must vary some, though; clearly a man his size had more than a woman of hers. Single hairs were beginning to rise from the soaking mass, curling as they dried, delicate as an ant\u2019s feelers.</p><p>He wished he might give her some of his blood; he had plenty. She\u2019d said it was possible, but not in this time. Something to do with things in the blood that mightn\u2019t match.</p><p>Her hair was a dozen colors, brown, molasses, cream and butter, sugar, sable . . . gleams of gold and silver where the dying light touched it. A broad streak of pure white at her temple, nearly the shade of her skin. She lay on her side facing him, one hand curled against her bosom, the other loose, upturned, so the inside of her wrist showed pure white, too, the blue veins heartbreaking.</p><p>She\u2019d said she thought of cutting her wrists when she believed him dead. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d do it that way, if she died. He\u2019d seen it: Toby Quinn with his wrist cut to the bone and all his blood run out across the floor, the room stinking of butchery and the word \u201cteind\u201d written on the wall above him in blood, his confession. A tithe to hell, it meant, and he shuddered in spite of the heat and crossed himself.</p><p>She\u2019d said it was maybe the blood that had made Young Ian\u2019s bairns all die\u2014the blood not matching betwixt him and his Mohawk wife\u2014and that maybe it would be different with Rachel. He said a quick Ave, that it might be so, and crossed himself again.</p><p>The hair that lay upon her shoulders was coiling now, sinuous, slow as rising bread. Ought he rouse her to drink again? She needed the water, to help make more blood, to cool her with sweat. But while she slept, the pain was less. A few moments longer, then.</p><p>Not now. Please, not now.</p><p>She shifted, moaning, and he saw that she was different; restless now. The stain on her bandage had changed color, darkened from scarlet to rust as it dried. He laid a hand softly on her arm and felt the heat.</p><p>The bleeding had stopped. The fever had begun.</p><p>NOW THE TREES were talking to him. He wished they\u2019d stop. The only thing Ian Murray wanted just now was silence. He was alone for the moment, but his ears buzzed and his head still throbbed with noise.</p><p>That always happened for a bit after a fight. You were listening so hard, to start with, for the sounds of the enemy, the direction of the wind, the voice of a saint behind you . . . you began to hear the voices of the forest, like you did hunting. And then you heard the shots and shouting, and when there were moments when that stopped, you heard the blood pounding round your body and beating in your ears, and, all in all, it took some time for the racket to die down afterward.</p><p>He had brief flashes of things that had happened during the day\u2014milling soldiers; the thud of the arrow that struck him; the face of the Abenaki he\u2019d killed by the fire; the look of George Washington on his big white horse, racing up the road, waving his hat\u2014but these came and went in a fog of confusion, appearing as though revealed to him by a stroke of lightning, then disappearing into a buzzing mist.</p><p>A wind went whispering through the branches over him, and he felt it on his skin as though he\u2019d been brushed with sandpaper. What might Rachel say, when he told her what he\u2019d done?</p><p>He could still hear the sound when the tomahawk caved in the Abenaki\u2019s skull. He could still feel it, too, in the bones of his arms, in the bursting pain of his wound.</p><p>Dimly, he realized that his feet were no longer keeping to the road; he was stumbling over clumps of grass, stubbing his moccasin-clad toes on rocks. He looked back to find his path\u2014he saw it, plain, a wavering line of black . . . Why was it wavering?</p><p>He didn\u2019t want silence, after all. He wanted Rachel\u2019s voice, no matter what she might say to him.</p><p>It came to him dimly that he couldn\u2019t go any farther. He was aware of a faint sense of surprise but was not afraid.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember falling but found himself on the ground, his hot cheek pressed against the cool prickle of pine needles. Laboriously, he got to his knees and scraped away the thick layer of fallen needles. Then he was lying with his body on damp earth, the blanket of needles half pulled over him; he could do no more and said a brief prayer to the tree, that it might protect him through the night.</p><p>And as he fell headlong into darkness, he did hear Rachel\u2019s voice, in memory.</p><p>\u201cThy life\u2019s journey lies along its own path, Ian,\u201d she said, \u201cand I cannot share thy journey\u2014but I can walk beside thee. And I will.\u201d</p><p>His last thought was that he hoped she\u2019d still mean it when he told her what he\u2019d done.</p><p>IN WHICH ROSY-FINGERED DAWN SHOWS UP MOB-HANDED</p><p>GREY WOKE TO THE drums of reveille, not startled by the accustomed rattle but with no clear idea where he was. In camp. Well, that much was obvious. He swung his legs out of the cot and sat up slowly, taking stock. His left arm hurt a lot, one of his eyes was stuck shut, and his mouth was so dry he could barely swallow. He\u2019d slept in his clothes, smelled rank, and needed badly to piss.</p><p>He groped under the cot, found a utensil, and used it, noting in a rather dreamy way that his urine smelled of apples. That brought back the taste of cider and, with it, full recollection of the day and night before. Honey and flies. Artillery. Jamie, blood down his face. Rifle butt and the crack of bone. William . . . Hal . . .</p><p>Almost full recollection. He sat down and remained quite still for a moment, trying to decide whether Hal had really told him that his eldest son, Benjamin, was dead. Surely not. It must have been a shred of nightmare, lingering in his mind. And yet he had the dreadful feeling of doomed certainty that comes down like a curtain on the mind, smothering disbelief.</p><p>He stood up, staggering a little, determined to go and find his brother. He hadn\u2019t yet found his shoes, though, when the flap was thrown back and Hal came in, followed by an orderly with a basin, a steaming pitcher, and shaving implements.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Hal said, in a completely ordinary voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wear one of my uniforms, and you\u2019re not doing it smelling like that. What the devil happened to your hair?\u201d</p><p>Grey had forgotten his hair and flattened a palm on top of his head, surprised at the bristly stubble there.</p><p>\u201cOh. A ruse de guerre.\u201d He sat down slowly, eyes on his brother. The bad eye had come open, though it was unpleasantly crusty, and so far as Grey could see, Hal looked much as he usually did. Tired, of course, worn, and a little haunted, but everyone looked like that the day after a battle. Surely if it were true, he\u2019d look different. Worse, somehow.</p><p>He would have asked, but Hal didn\u2019t linger, going off and leaving John in the hands of the orderly. Before the ablutions were complete, a young Scottish surgeon with freckles appeared, yawning as though he hadn\u2019t slept all night, and blinked blearily at Grey\u2019s arm. He prodded this in a professional manner, pronounced the bone cracked but not broken, and put it in a sling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sling had to be removed almost at once, in order for him to dress\u2014another orderly arrived with a uniform and a tray of breakfast\u2014and by the time he was made tidy and had been forcibly fed, he was wild with impatience.</p><p>He would have to wait for Hal to reappear, though; no point going out to scour the camp for him. And he really must talk to his brother before seeking out William. A small dish of honey had been provided with his toast, and he was dipping a dubious finger into it, wondering whether he ought to try dabbing it into his eye, when at last the flap opened again and his brother was with him.</p><p>\u201cDid you actually tell me that Ben is dead?\u201d he blurted at once. Hal\u2019s face contracted a bit, but his jaw was set.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hal said evenly. \u201cI told you that I\u2019d had news of Ben, and they said he was dead. I don\u2019t believe it.\u201d He gave John a stare defying him to contradict this belief.</p> <p>\u201cOh. Good,\u201d Grey said mildly. \u201cThen I don\u2019t believe it, either. Who told you, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Hal replied, turning to lift the tent flap and peer out\u2014evidently to be sure of not being overheard, and the thought made Grey\u2019s belly flutter a little. \u201cIt was Ezekiel Richardson who brought me the news, and I wouldn\u2019t trust that fellow if he told me I had a hole in the seat of my breeches, let alone something like that.\u201d</p><p>The flutter in Grey\u2019s belly became a full-blown beating of wings.</p><p>\u201cYour instincts haven\u2019t led you amiss there,\u201d he said. \u201cSit down and have a piece of toast. I have a few things to tell you.\u201d</p><p>WILLIAM WOKE with a shattering headache and the conviction that he had forgotten something important. Clutching his head, he discovered a bandage wound round it, chafing his ear. He pulled it off impatiently; there was blood on it, but not much and all dried. He recalled vague bits of things from the night before\u2014pain, nausea, his head swimming, Uncle Hal . . . and then an image of his father, white-faced and fragile . . . \u201cIf you and I have things to say to each other . . .\u201d Christ, had he dreamed that?</p> <p>He said something bad in German, and a young voice repeated it, rather doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean, sir?\u201d asked Zeb, who had popped up beside his cot with a covered tray.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to know, and don\u2019t repeat it,\u201d William said, sitting up. \u201cWhat happened to my head?\u201d</p><p>Zeb\u2019s brow creased.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, would I be asking you?\u201d</p> <p>Zeb\u2019s brow creased in concentration, but the logic of this question escaped him, and he merely shrugged, set down the tray, and answered the first one.</p><p>\u201cColonel Grey said you was hit on the head by deserters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesert\u2014oh.\u201d He stopped to consider that. British deserters? No . . . there was a reason why German profanity had sprung to his mind. He had a fleeting memory of Hessians, and . . . and what?</p><p>\u201cColenso\u2019s got over the shits,\u201d Zeb offered helpfully.</p><p>\u201cGood to know the day\u2019s starting out well for somebody. Oh, Jesus.\u201d Pain crackled inside his skull, and he pressed a hand to his head. \u201cHave you got anything to drink on that tray, Zeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir!\u201d Zeb uncovered the tray, triumphantly revealing a dish of coddled eggs with toast, a slice of ham, and a beaker of something that looked suspiciously murky but smelled strongly of alcohol.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno, sir, but Colonel Grey says it\u2019s a hair-of-the-dog-what-bit-you sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d So it hadn\u2019t been a dream. He shoved that thought aside for the moment and regarded the beaker with a cautious interest. He\u2019d had the first of his father\u2019s restoratives when he was fourteen and had mistaken the punch being prepared for Lord John\u2019s dinner party as the same sort that ladies had at garden parties. He\u2019d had a few more in the years since and found them invariably effective, if rather startling to drink.</p><p>\u201cRight, then,\u201d he said, and, taking a deep breath, picked up the beaker and drained it, swallowing heroically without pausing for breath.</p><p>\u201cCor!\u201d said Zeb, admiring. \u201cThe cook said he could send some sausages, was you up to eating \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>William merely shook his head\u2014being momentarily incapable of speech\u2014and picked up a piece of toast, which he held for a moment, not quite ready to consider actually inserting it into his mouth. His head still hurt, but the restorative had jarred loose a few more bits from the detritus in his brain.</p><p>\u201c. . . Advice? You\u2019re too old to be given it and too young to take it. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . Er spricht Deutsch. Er geh\u00f6rt! . . .\u201d He speaks German. He heard.</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cWhat did I hear?\u201d</p><p>Zeb appeared to think this another rhetorical question and, instead of trying to answer it, asked one of his own.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Goth, sir?\u201d His thin face was solemn, as though he expected to receive bad news.</p><p>\u201cGoth,\u201d William repeated blankly. \u201cHas something happened to Goth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s gone, sir,\u201d Zeb said, apparently trying to be tactful. \u201cThat is\u2014when the regulars took you and the Indian away from the Rebels, you wasn\u2019t on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the . . . what Indian?\u2014what the devil happened yesterday, Zeb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Zeb said, affronted. \u201cWasn\u2019t there, was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course\u2014bloody hell. Is my uncle\u2014the Duke of Pardloe\u2014in camp? I need to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>Zeb looked dubious.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can go and look for him, I s\u2019pose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo, please. Now.\u201d William waved him off, then sat still for a moment, trying to stick the jagged fragments of his memory back together. Rebels? Goth . . . He did recall something about Goth, but what was it? Had he run into Rebels, who took the horse? But what was this about Indians and deserters, and why did he keep hearing echoes of German speech in the back of his brain?</p><p>And who, come to think of it, was the Colonel Grey that Zeb had referred to? He\u2019d assumed it was Uncle Hal\u2014but his father\u2019s rank was lieutenant colonel, and he\u2019d also be addressed as \u201cColonel\u201d in common use. He glanced at the tray and the empty beaker. Uncle Hal certainly knew about the hair of the dog, but . . .</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re alive, everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He put the untouched toast down, a sudden lump in his throat. Again. He\u2019d had the lump last night, when he saw Papa. When he\u2019d said to his father\u2014yes, God damn it, his father!\u2014\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not dead.\u201d</p><p>He maybe wasn\u2019t quite ready to talk to Papa\u2014or Papa to him\u2014and he didn\u2019t quite agree that everything was all right, but . . .</p><p>A shaft of brilliant sunlight lanced into his face as the tent flap was shoved aside, and he sat bolt upright, swinging his legs out of bed to be ready to meet\u2014</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t either his uncle or his father who appeared out of the eye-watering blur of sunlight. It was Banastre Tarleton, in uniform but wigless and unbuttoned, looking indecently cheerful for someone whose face seemed to have been beaten badly not too long ago.</p><p>\u201cAlive, are you, Ellesmere?\u201d Ban spotted the dish and, scooping up a coddled egg in his fingers, gulped it. He licked his buttery fingers, making pleased noises.</p><p>\u201cChrist, I\u2019m hungry. Been up since dawn. Killing on an empty stomach leaves you rare sharp-set, I\u2019ll say that. Can I have the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe my guest. Who\u2019ve you been killing for breakfast? Rebels?\u201d</p><p>Tarleton looked surprised, arrested with a mouthful of toast. He chewed this imperfectly and bolted the bite before answering with a shower of crumbs.</p><p>\u201cNo, Washington\u2019s troops withdrew to the south, so far as I know. Hessian deserters. The same lot that crowned you and left you for dead, or so I assume. They had your horse; recognized him.\u201d He reached for another egg, and William thrust a spoon into his hand.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, eat like a Christian. Do you have my horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. He\u2019s lame in the right fore, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad. Mmm . . . have you got your own cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s my uncle\u2019s. Tell me about the deserters. They knocked me on the head, and my memory\u2019s a bit spotty.\u201d More than a bit, but chunks of it were beginning to come back pretty fast now.</p><p>Between bites, Tarleton gave him the story. A company of mercenaries under von Knyphausen had made up their minds to desert during the battle, but not all the men were of the same mind. Those in favor of desertion had drawn away a bit and were quietly discussing whether it was necessary to kill the dissenters, when William had shown up unexpectedly in their midst.</p><p>\u201cThat knocked them a bit skew-ways, as you might surmise.\u201d Tarleton, having finished the eggs and most of the toast, picked up the beaker and looked disappointed at finding it empty.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably water in that canteen,\u201d William said, motioning toward the battered tin-and-leather object hanging from the tent pole. \u201cSo that\u2019s it. . . . They looked a bit nervous, but when I asked one of them in German whether there was a farrier nearby\u2014that was it! Goth threw a shoe, that\u2019s why he\u2014but then I heard someone whispering, sounding frantic, and he was saying, \u2018He heard! He knows!\u2019 Must\u2019ve meant he thought I\u2019d overheard them plotting and knew what they were up to.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out in relief at having this much of the previous day restored to him.</p><p>Tarleton nodded. \u201cImagine so. They did kill some of the dissenters\u2014gather a barney broke out after they bashed you on the head and threw you into the ravine\u2014but not all of them.\u201d</p><p>A few of the mercenaries had escaped and headed for von Knyphausen, who, upon hearing the news, had sent a dispatch to Clinton asking for assistance in dealing with the miscreants.</p><p>William nodded at this. It was always better to have matters like desertion or treason dealt with by troops outside the affected companies. And knowing Ban Tarleton, he would have leapt at the chance to track down the deserters and\u2014</p><p>\u201cWere you told to kill them?\u201d he asked, striving for casualness.</p><p>Tarleton gave him an eggy grin and wiped a few lingering crumbs off his chin.</p><p>\u201cNot specifically. Got the impression that as long as I brought a few back to tell the tale, no one much cared how many. And there was a hint of pour encourager les autres in my orders.\u201d</p><p>Politely suppressing his shock at the revelation that Tarleton could read, let alone read Voltaire, William nodded.</p><p>\u201cI see. My orderly said something rather curious: mentioned that I\u2019d been found by Rebels\u2014with an Indian. D\u2019you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>Tarleton looked surprised, but shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing. Oh\u2014\u201d He\u2019d sat down on the stool and now rocked back a little, hands clasped about one knee, looking pleased with himself. \u201cI do know something, though. Recall you asked me about Harkness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarkness . . . oh, yes!\u201d William\u2019s exclamation had less to do with mention of Captain Harkness and more to do with the important thing he\u2019d forgotten, which had just come back to him: Jane and her sister.</p><p>He had an immediate impulse to get up and go find her, make sure they were all right. The fugitive Loyalists and camp followers would have been well clear of the actual battle, of course\u2014but the violence and agitation that attended fighting didn\u2019t simply stop when the fighting did. And it wasn\u2019t only deserters and scavengers who looted, raped, and hunted among the hapless sheep.</p><p>He spared a flickering thought for Anne Endicott and her family\u2014but they did at least have a man to protect them, however ill-equipped. Jane and Fanny . . . but surely Zeb would have known, if anything\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looked blankly at Tarleton. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat knock on the head affected your hearing, too, did it?\u201d Ban took a swig from the canteen. \u201cI said I made inquiries. Harkness never joined his regiment. For all anyone knows, he\u2019s still in Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s mouth felt dry. He reached for the canteen and took a swallow; the water was warm and tin-tasting, but wet.</p><p>\u201cAbsent without leave, do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much without leave,\u201d Tarleton assured him. \u201cLast anyone recalls seeing him, he was promising to go back to some brothel and give some whore a proper seeing-to. Maybe she saw to him, instead!\u201d He laughed heartily at the thought.</p><p>William stood up abruptly, then\u2014for something to do\u2014reached to replace the canteen on its nail. The tent flap was down, but a stray beam of dust-filled sunlight still fell through the gap, catching the glitter of metal. His officer\u2019s gorget hung from the nail, its silver gleaming in the sun.</p><p>\u201cPERCIVAL WAINWRIGHT?\u201d John hadn\u2019t seen Hal so disconcerted since the events concerning their father\u2019s death\u2014which had also involved Percy, come to think of it.</p><p>\u201cIn the\u2014very fashionable\u2014flesh. He\u2019s apparently an adviser to the Marquis de La Fayette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA flash young frog with a lot of money,\u201d Grey said with a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cRebel general. Said to be very close to Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d Hal repeated, with a sharp look at Grey. \u201cClose to Wainwright, too, you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not that way,\u201d he replied calmly, though his heart beat a little faster. \u201cI gather you\u2019re not altogether surprised that he isn\u2019t dead. Percy, I mean.\u201d He was vaguely affronted; he\u2019d gone to a lot of trouble to make it appear that Percy had died in prison while awaiting trial for sodomy.</p><p>Hal merely snorted. \u201cMen like that never die so conveniently. Why the bloody hell is he telling you this, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Grey suppressed the vivid memory of bergamot, red wine, and petitgrain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I do know he\u2019s deeply involved with French interests, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWainwright\u2019s never been involved with any interests other than his own,\u201d Hal interrupted brusquely. He gave John a sharp look. \u201cYou\u2019d do well to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt I shall ever see the fellow again,\u201d John replied, overlooking the implication that his brother considered him gullible\u2014or worse. He was entirely aware that while Hal was treating Richardson\u2019s news of Ben with scorn, and was very likely right to do so, neither of them could completely ignore the possibility that the man had been telling the truth.</p><p>Hal verified this assumption by smacking his fist down on the campaign chest, making the pewter cups jump and fall over. He stood abruptly.</p> <p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he muttered. \u201cStay here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Hal paused at the tent flap for an instant. His face was still haggard, but John recognized the battle light in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTo arrest Richardson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t arrest him yourself, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d Grey was on his feet, too, reaching for Hal\u2019s sleeve.</p> <p>\u201cWhich regiment does he belong to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Fifth, but he\u2019s detached. I told you he was an intelligencer, did I not?\u201d The word \u201cintelligencer\u201d dripped with contempt.</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014I\u2019ll speak to Sir Henry first.\u201d</p><p>John had got a grip on Hal\u2019s arm and tightened his hold at this. \u201cI should have thought you\u2019d had enough of scandal by now,\u201d he said, trying for calmness. \u201cTake a breath and imagine what will likely happen if you do that. Assuming that Sir Henry would take the time to consider your request. Today, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d He could hear the army moving outside; there was no danger of pursuit from Washington\u2019s troops, but Clinton was not going to hang about. His division, with its baggage and refugees under its wing, would be on the road within the hour.</p><p>Hal\u2019s arm was hard as marble under John\u2019s hand and stayed that way. But he did stop, breathing with a slow, deep regularity. At last he turned his head and looked into his brother\u2019s eyes. A beam of sunlight threw every line in his face into stark relief.</p><p>\u201cName one thing you think I wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cin order not to have to tell Minnie that Ben is dead.\u201d</p> <p>Grey drew one long, deep breath of his own and nodded, letting go.</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. Whatever you mean to do, I\u2019ll help. But first I have to find William. What Percy said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Hal blinked and his face relaxed a fraction. \u201cYes, of course. Meet you here in half an hour.\u201d</p><p>WILLIAM HAD BARELY finished dressing before the message he\u2019d been halfway expecting arrived from Sir Henry, delivered by Lieutenant Foster, whom he knew slightly. Foster grimaced sympathetically when handing it over.</p><p>William observed Sir Henry Clinton\u2019s personal seal: not a good sign. On the other hand, if he was to be arrested for being absent without leave the previous day, Harry Foster would have brought an armed escort and taken him off without a by-your-leave. That was mildly heartening, and he broke the seal without hesitation.</p><p>In the event, it was a terse note advising him that he was relieved of duty until further notice\u2014but that was all. He exhaled, only then realizing that he\u2019d been holding his breath.</p><p>But of course Sir Henry wouldn\u2019t imprison him\u2014how and where, with the army on the move? Short of putting him in irons and transporting him by wagon . . . Realistically, Clinton couldn\u2019t even confine him to quarters; the quarters in question were beginning to shake overhead as his uncle\u2019s orderly set to dismantling the tent.</p><p>All right, then. He stuffed the note into his pocket, stuffed his feet into his boots, seized up his hat, and went out, feeling not that bad, all things considered. He had a headache, but it was bearable, and he\u2019d managed to eat what breakfast Tarleton had left.</p> <p>When things settled down and Sir Henry got round to taking official notice of his disobedience of orders, William could fish up Captain Andr\u00e9 and have him explain about going to find Tarleton, and all would be well. Meanwhile, he\u2019d go down to the camp followers\u2019 area and find Jane.</p><p>There was a strong bitter smell of fresh cabbage floating over the sprawl of makeshift shelters and human detritus, and a scatter of farm wagons drawn up along the road, with women crowding round them. The army cooks fed the refugees, but rations were sparse\u2014and had doubtless been disrupted by the battle.</p><p>He walked along the road, keeping an eye out for Jane or Fanny, but didn\u2019t spot either one. His eye attuned for a young girl, though, he did see Peggy Endicott, trudging down the road with a bucket in either hand.</p><p>\u201cMiss Peggy! May I offer my assistance, ma\u2019am?\u201d He smiled down at her and was warmed to see her own face\u2014somewhat anxious before\u2014bloom into delight under her cap.</p><p>\u201cCaptain!\u201d she cried, nearly dropping her buckets in her excitement. \u201cOh, I\u2019m so happy to see you! We were all so worried for you, you know, in the battle, and we all said a prayer for your safety, but Papa told us you would surely prevail over the wicked Rebels and God would see you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lovely prayers were to great effect,\u201d he assured her gravely, taking the buckets. One was full of water and the other of turnips, their green tops wilting over the rim. \u201cAre your mama and papa well, then, and your sisters?\u201d</p><p>They walked along together, Peggy dancing on her toes and chattering like an affable small parrot. William kept an eye peeled for Jane or Fanny among the laundresses; it was safer near those redoubtable ladies than in some other parts of the camp. There were no kettles boiling this morning, of course, but the scent of lye soap floated on the humid air like scum on a cauldron full of dirty clothes.</p><p>There was no sign of Jane and Fanny by the time he\u2019d reached the Endicotts\u2019 wagon\u2014still on all four wheels, he was glad to see. He was greeted warmly by all the Endicotts, though the girls and Mrs. Endicott made a great fuss of the lump on his head when he took his hat off to help with the loading of their wagon.</p><p>\u201cNothing, ma\u2019am, the merest bruise,\u201d he assured Mrs. Endicott for the ninth time, when she urged him to sit down in the shade and drink some water with the tiniest bit of brandy in it, for they still had some, thank goodness. . . .</p><p>Anne, who had maneuvered herself close to him, passing him items to be loaded, leaned in with a tea chest and let her hand brush his\u2014deliberately, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay in New York, do you think?\u201d she asked, stooping to pick up a portmanteau. \u201cOr perhaps\u2014you must excuse my prying, but people will talk\u2014go back to England? Miss Jernigan said that you might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss . . . oh, of course.\u201d He recalled Mary Jernigan, a very flirtatious blond piece with whom he\u2019d danced at a ball in Philadelphia. He glanced over the throng of Loyalist refugees. \u201cIs she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Anne replied, a little tersely. \u201cDr. Jernigan has a brother in New York; they will stay with him for a time.\u201d She collected herself\u2014he could see that she was regretting having recalled his attention to Mary Jernigan\u2014and smiled at him, deeply enough as to invoke the dimple in her left cheek. \u201cYou needn\u2019t take refuge with reluctant relatives, though, need you? Miss Jernigan said that you have a great vast estate awaiting you in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he said noncommittally. His father had warned him early on about marriage-minded young women with an eye to his fortune, and he\u2019d met quite a few of them. Still, he liked Anne Endicott and her family and was inclined to think they had a real regard for him, as well, despite his position and the pragmatical considerations that must now afflict Anne and her sisters, with their father\u2019s affairs so precarious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, taking the portmanteau from her. \u201cI truly have no idea what\u2019s to become of me. Who does, in wartime?\u201d He smiled, a little ruefully, and she seemed to feel his sense of uncertainty, for she impulsively laid a hand on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWell, be assured that you have friends, at least, who care what becomes of you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, and turned his face toward the cart, lest she see how much that touched him.</p><p>In turning, though, his eye caught a purposeful movement, someone threading toward him through the crowd, and Anne Endicott\u2019s soft dark eyes disappeared abruptly from his mind.</p><p>\u201cSir!\u201d It was his groom Colenso Baragwanath, gasping from the effort of running. \u201cSir, have you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are, Baragwanath! What the devil are you doing here, and where have you left Madras? Good news, though: Goth\u2019s come back. Colonel Tarleton has him and\u2014what, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d For Colenso was squirming as though he had a snake in his breeches, his square Cornish face contorted with information.</p><p>\u201cJane and Fanny\u2019re gone, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone? Gone where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunno, sir. But they\u2019ve gone. I came back to get my jacket and the shelter was still up, but their things were gone and I couldn\u2019t find \u2019em and when I asked the folk who camps near us, they said as the girls had rolled up their bundles and sneaked off!\u201d</p><p>William didn\u2019t waste time inquiring how one could possibly sneak out of an open camp of several thousand people, let alone why that should be necessary.</p><p>\u201cWhich way did they go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat way, sir!\u201d Colenso pointed down the road.</p><p>William rubbed a hand over his face and stopped abruptly when he inadvertently touched the bruised swelling on his left temple.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Well, bloody hell\u2014oh, I beg your pardon, Miss Endicott.\u201d For at this point he became aware of Anne Endicott at his elbow, eyes round with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWho are Jane and Fanny?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAhh . . . two young ladies who are traveling under my protection,\u201d he said, knowing exactly what effect that information was likely to have, but there wasn\u2019t much help for it. \u201cVery young ladies,\u201d he added, in the vain hope of improving things. \u201cDaughters of a . . . um, distant cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, looking distinctly unconvinced. \u201cBut they\u2019ve run off? Whyever should they do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I\u2014er, beg pardon, ma\u2019am. I don\u2019t know, but I must go and find out. Will you make my excuses to your parents and sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014of course.\u201d She made a small, abortive gesture toward him, putting out her hand and then withdrawing it. She looked both startled and slightly affronted. He regretted it, but there wasn\u2019t time to do anything about it.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, and, bowing, left her.</p><p>IN THE END, it was half a day, rather than half an hour, before John saw Hal again. He found his brother, quite by chance, standing by the road that led northward, watching the marching columns go past. Most of the camp had already left; only the cook wagons and laundry kettles were trundling past now, the disorderly sprawl of camp followers spreading out behind them like the plague of lice over the land of Egypt.</p><p>\u201cWilliam\u2019s gone,\u201d he said to Hal without preamble.</p><p>Hal nodded, face somber. \u201cSo is Richardson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>Hal\u2019s groom was standing by, holding two horses. Hal jerked his head at a dark-bay mare and took the reins of his own horse, a light-bay gelding with a blaze and one white stocking.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think we\u2019re going?\u201d John inquired, seeing his brother turn the gelding\u2019s head south.</p><p>\u201cPhiladelphia,\u201d Hal replied, tight-lipped. \u201cWhere else?\u201d</p><p>Grey could himself think of any number of alternatives, but recognized a rhetorical question when he heard one and contented himself with asking, \u201cHave you got a clean handkerchief?\u201d</p><p>Hal gave him a blank look, then rummaged in his sleeve, pulling out a crumpled but unused linen square.</p><p>\u201cApparently. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect we\u2019re going to need a flag of truce at some point. The Continental army lying presently between us and Philadelphia, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d Hal stuffed the handkerchief back up his sleeve and said no more until they had negotiated their way past the last trailing remnants of the horde of refugees and found themselves more or less alone on the road leading south.</p><p>\u201cNo one could be sure, in the confusion,\u201d he said, as though he\u2019d last spoken ten seconds before. \u201cBut it looks very much as though Captain Richardson has deserted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad moment to choose, really,\u201d Hal said reflectively. \u201cNo one would have noticed he was gone for days, had I not come looking for him. He was in camp last night, though, and unless he\u2019s disguised himself as a teamster or a laundress, he\u2019s not here any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contingency seems remote,\u201d Grey said. \u201cWilliam was here this morning\u2014both your orderly and his young grooms saw him, and so did a Colonel Tarleton of the British Legion, who breakfasted with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Oh, him.\u201d Hal waved off Tarleton as a distraction. \u201cClinton values him, but I never trust a man with lips like a girl\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless, he seems to have had nothing to do with William\u2019s disappearance. The groom Baragwanath thinks that William went off to see about a couple of . . . young women among the camp followers.\u201d</p><p>Hal glanced at him, one brow raised.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of young women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the sort you\u2019re thinking,\u201d John replied, a little tersely.</p><p>\u201cAt that hour of the morning, after being bashed on the head the night before? And young women, plural? The boy\u2019s got stamina, I\u2019ll say that for him.\u201d</p><p>Grey could have said a number of other things about William at this point, but didn\u2019t. \u201cSo you think Richardson\u2019s deserted.\u201d That would explain Hal\u2019s focus on Philadelphia; if Percy was right and Richardson was in fact an American agent, where else might he go at this point? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt seems the most likely possibility. Also . . .\u201d Hal hesitated for a moment, but then his mouth firmed. \u201cIf I believed that Benjamin was dead, what might I be expected to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and make inquiries into his death,\u201d Grey replied, suppressing the queasy feeling the notion induced. \u201cClaim his body, at the least.\u201d</p><p>Hal nodded. \u201cBen was\u2014or is\u2014being held at a place in New Jersey called Middletown Encampment. I\u2019ve not been there, but it\u2019s in the middle of Washington\u2019s strongest territory, in the Watchung Mountains. Nest of Rebels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be unlikely to undertake that sort of journey with a large armed guard,\u201d John observed. \u201cYou\u2019d go alone, or perhaps with an orderly, an ensign or two. Or me.\u201d</p> <p>Hal nodded. They rode for a bit, each alone with his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not going to the Watchung Mountains,\u201d Grey said at last. His brother sighed deeply and set his jaw.</p><p>\u201cNot immediately. If I can catch up with Richardson, I may find out what\u2019s really happened\u2014or not happened\u2014to Ben. After that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a plan for proceeding once we reach Philadelphia?\u201d Grey inquired. \u201cGiven that it\u2019s in the hands of the Rebels?\u201d</p><p>Hal\u2019s lips compressed. \u201cI will have, by the time we get there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI daresay. I have one now, though.\u201d</p><p>Hal looked at him, thumbing a hank of damp hair behind his ear. His hair was carelessly tied back; he\u2019d not bothered to have it plaited or clubbed this morning, a sure sign of his agitation. \u201cDoes it involve anything patently insane? Your better plans always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. We\u2019re certain to encounter the Continentals, as I said. Assuming we aren\u2019t shot on sight, we produce your flag of truce\u201d\u2014he nodded at his brother\u2019s sleeve, from which the edge of the handkerchief was drooping\u2014\u201cand demand to be taken to General Fraser.\u201d</p><p>Hal gave him a startled look.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d Grey\u2019s knotted stomach clenched a little tighter at the thought. At both the thought of speaking to Jamie again\u2014and the thought of telling him that William was missing. \u201cHe fought with Benedict Arnold at Saratoga, and his wife is friendly with the man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod help General Arnold, in that case,\u201d Hal murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd who else has a better reason for helping us in this matter than does Jamie Fraser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho indeed?\u201d They rode for some time in silence, Hal apparently lost in thought. It wasn\u2019t until they paused to find a creek and water the horses that he spoke again, water streaming down his face where he\u2019d splashed it.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve not only somehow married Fraser\u2019s wife, but you\u2019ve accidentally been raising his illegitimate son for the last fifteen years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so,\u201d Grey said, in a tone that he hoped indicated complete unwillingness to talk about it. For once, Hal took the hint.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said, and, with no further questions, wiped his face with the flag of truce and mounted up.</p><p>MOONRISE</p><p>IT HADN\u2019T BEEN a peaceful day. Apparently Jamie had somehow retained sufficient presence of mind last night to write a brief note\u2014though he didn\u2019t recall doing so\u2014to La Fayette, explaining what had happened and confiding care of his troops to the marquis. This he had sent with Lieutenant Bixby, with instructions to notify the captains and militia commanders of his companies. After which, he\u2019d forgotten everything but Claire.</p> <p>Everything had not forgotten him, though. The sun was barely up before a stream of officers appeared at Mrs. Macken\u2019s door, in search of General Fraser. Mrs. Macken took every arrival as being the possible bearer of bad news concerning her still-missing husband, and the reek of burnt porridge rose through the house, seeping into the walls like the smell of fear.</p><p>Some came with questions, some with news or gossip\u2014General Lee was relieved of duty, was under arrest, had gone to Philadelphia, had turned his coat and joined Clinton, had hanged himself, had challenged Washington to a duel. A messenger arrived from General Washington with a personal note of sympathy and good wishes; another came from La Fayette with an enormous hamper of food and a half-dozen bottles of claret.</p><p>Jamie couldn\u2019t eat, but gave the food to Mrs. Macken. He retained a couple of bottles of the wine, though, which he\u2019d opened and kept by him through the day, taking occasional gulps to sustain him as he sponged and watched and prayed.</p><p>Judah Bixby came and went like a helpful ghost, appearing and disappearing, but always seeming to be there if something was needed.</p><p>\u201cThe militia companies . . .\u201d Jamie began, but then couldn\u2019t think what he\u2019d meant to ask concerning them. \u201cAre they . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them have gone home,\u201d Bixby told him, unloading a basket full of beer bottles. \u201cTheir enlistment ends on the thirtieth\u2014that\u2019s tomorrow, sir,\u201d he added gently, \u201cbut they mostly set off first thing this morning.\u201d</p><p>Jamie let out a breath he hadn\u2019t known he was holding and felt a small measure of peace.</p><p>\u201cI reckon it\u2019ll be months before anyone knows was it a victory or not,\u201d Bixby remarked. He drew the cork from one bottle, then another, and handed one to Jamie. \u201cBut it surely wasn\u2019t defeat. Shall we drink to it, sir?\u201d</p><p>Jamie was worn out with worry and praying, but managed a smile for Judah and a quick word of thanks to God for the boy.</p><p>Once Judah had left, a somewhat longer prayer on behalf of his nephew. Ian hadn\u2019t returned, and none of Jamie\u2019s visitors had had any word of him. Rachel had come back late the night before, white-faced and silent, and had gone out again at daybreak. Dottie had offered to go with her, but Rachel had refused; the two of them were needed to deal with the wounded still being brought in and those sheltering in the houses and barns of Freehold.</p><p>Ian, Jamie thought in anguish, addressing his brother-in-law. For God\u2019s sake, have an eye to our lad, because I canna do it. I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>Claire\u2019s fever had risen fast during the night, then seemed to fall a little with the coming of the light; she was conscious now and then and capable of a few words, but for the most part she lay in a uneasy doze, her breath coming in shallow pants punctuated by sudden deep, tearing gasps that woke her\u2014she dreamed that she was being suffocated, she said. He would give her as much water as she would take and douse her hair again, and she would drop back into fever dreams, muttering and moaning.</p><p>He began to feel as though he were living in a fever dream himself: trapped in endless repetitions of prayer and water, these broken by visitations from some vanished, alien world.</p><p>Perhaps this was purgatory, he thought, and gave a wan smile at memory of himself, waking on Culloden Moor so many years ago, his eyelids sealed with blood, thinking himself dead and grateful for it, even if his immediate prospect was a spell in purgatory\u2014that being a vague, unknown circumstance, probably unpleasant but not one he feared.</p><p>He feared the one that might be imminent.</p><p>He had come to the conclusion that he couldn\u2019t kill himself, even if she died. Even could he bring himself to commit a sin of that magnitude, there were people who needed him, and to abandon them would be a greater sin even than the willful destruction of God\u2019s gift of life. But to live without her\u2014he watched her breathe, obsessively, counting ten breaths before he would believe she hadn\u2019t stopped\u2014that would certainly be his purgatory.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d taken his eyes off her, and maybe he hadn\u2019t, but he came out of his reverie to see that her own eyes were open, a soft smudged black in the white of her face. The light had faded to the final cusp of twilight and all color had washed from the room, leaving them in a luminous dusty haze that wasn\u2019t daylight any longer but not yet night. He saw that her hair was nearly dry, curling in masses over the pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve . . . decided . . . not to die,\u201d she said, in a voice little more than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh. Good.\u201d He was afraid to touch her, for fear of hurting her, but couldn\u2019t bear not to. He laid a hand as lightly as he could over hers, finding it cool in spite of the heat trapped in the small attic.</p><p>\u201cI could, you know.\u201d She closed one eye and looked accusingly at him with the other. \u201cI want to; this is . . . bloody horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he whispered, and brought her hand to his lips. Her bones were frail, and she hadn\u2019t the strength to squeeze his hand; her fingers lay limp in his.</p><p>She closed her eyes and breathed audibly for a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d she said suddenly, opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d thought of making some jesting remark about her needing to write down her receipt for making ether, but her tone was dead serious, and he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, and stopped with a small grimace that squeezed his heart. \u201cBecause,\u201d she said through clenched teeth, \u201cI know what it felt . . . like when I . . . thought you were dead, and\u2014\u201d A small gasp for breath, and her eyes locked on his. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d Her bosom fell and her eyes closed.</p><p>It was a long moment before he could speak.</p><p>\u201cThank ye, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered, and held her small, cold hand between his own and watched her breathe until the moon rose.</p><p>I COULD SEE the moon through the tiny window; we were in the attic of the house. It was the first breath of the new moon, but the whole of it was visible, a perfect ball of violet and indigo cupped in a sickle of light, luminous among the stars. \u201cThe new moon with the old,\u201d country folk called it in England. On the Ridge, people called it \u201cholding water.\u201d</p><p>The fever had left me. It had also left me drained, light-headed, and weak as a newborn mouse. My side was swollen from hip to oxter, hot and tender to the touch, but I was sure this was only surgical trauma. There wasn\u2019t any significant infection, only a little inflammation near the surface of the incision.</p><p>I felt rather like the new moon: the shadow of pain and death was still clearly visible to me\u2014but only because the light was there to throw it into perspective. On the other hand, there were still small practicalities and indignities to be dealt with. I had to pee, and I couldn\u2019t sit up by myself, let alone squat over a chamber pot.</p><p>I had no idea what time it was, though with the moon like that, it couldn\u2019t be the middle of the night. The house was still, though\u2014Lieutenant Macken had returned safely in late afternoon, bringing with him several other men, but they had been too exhausted for celebration; I could hear faint snoring from the floor below. I couldn\u2019t disturb everyone by calling out for Loretta Macken\u2019s assistance. With a sigh, I leaned gingerly over the side of the bed and cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cSassenach? Are ye all right?\u201d A segment of the darkness on the floor moved suddenly and resolved itself into a Jamie-shaped shadow.</p><p>\u201cYes. Are you?\u201d</p><p>That got me the breath of a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do, Sassenach,\u201d he said softly, and I heard the rustle of his movement as he got his feet under him. \u201cI\u2019m glad ye feel well enough to ask. D\u2019ye need water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . rather the opposite, really,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh? Oh.\u201d He stooped, a pale blur in his shirt, to reach under the bed. \u201cD\u2019ye need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t have waked you up,\u201d I said, a little testily. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could wait for Mrs. Macken or Dottie, though.\u201d He snorted a little and got me under the arms, lifting me into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s no like ye\u2019ve not done this\u2014and a good many worse things\u2014for me.\u201d</p><p>While this was true, it didn\u2019t make matters easier.</p><p>\u201cYou can let go now,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps leave the room?\u201d \u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he said, still mildly, but with a tone indicating that his mind was made up on the subject. \u201cIf I let go, ye\u2019ll fall on your face, and ye ken that perfectly well, so stop talkin\u2019 and be about your business now, aye?\u201d</p><p>It took some time\u2014anything that put pressure on my abdomen, including the act of urinating, hurt remarkably\u2014but the business was accomplished and I was eased back down onto the pillow, gasping. Jamie bent and picked up the chamber pot, clearly intending to hurl the contents out the window in customary Edinburgh fashion.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d I said. \u201cKeep that \u2019til morning.\u201d</p><p>He paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d he asked cautiously. Clearly he suspected I might still be unhinged from fever and be contemplating some grossly irrational use of the pot\u2019s contents, but he didn\u2019t like to say so, in case I had something logical, if bizarre, in mind. I would have laughed, but it hurt too much.</p><p>\u201cI need to check, once there\u2019s light, to be sure there\u2019s no blood,\u201d I said. \u201cMy right kidney\u2019s very sore; I want to be sure there\u2019s no damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He set the utensil down carefully and, to my surprise, opened the door and glided out, moving soft-footed as a hunting fox. I heard one squeak as he stepped on a stair tread, but nothing more until a glow betokened his return with a candlestick.</p><p>\u201cHave a look, then,\u201d he said, picking up the pot again and bringing it to me. \u201cI kent ye\u2019d just fret about it did ye have to wait for daybreak.\u201d</p><p>He sounded resigned, but this small thoughtfulness brought me close to tears. He heard the catch in my breathing and leaned close, alarmed, bringing the light up to my face.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach? Is it bad, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and wiped my eyes hastily on a corner of the sheet. \u201cNo\u2014it\u2014it\u2019s fine. I just\u2014oh, Jamie, I love you!\u201d I did give way to tears, then, snuffling and blubbering like an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, trying to get hold of myself. \u201cI\u2019m all right, there\u2019s nothing wrong, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, I ken fine what it\u2019s just,\u201d he said, and, setting the candle and pot on the floor, lay down on the bed beside me, balancing precariously on the edge.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re hurt, a nighean,\u201d he said softly, smoothing my hair off my wet cheeks. \u201cAnd fevered and starved and worn to a shadow. There\u2019s no much of ye left, is there, poor wee thing?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and clung to him. \u201cThere\u2019s not much of you left, either,\u201d I managed to say, mumbling wetly into the front of his shirt.</p><p>He made a small amused noise and rubbed my back, very gently. \u201cEnough, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m enough. For now.\u201d</p> <p>I sighed and fumbled under the pillow for a hankie to blow my nose.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t go, though.\u201d I put a hand on his leg, hard and warm under my hand. \u201cCan you lie with me a minute? I\u2019m awfully cold.\u201d I was, though I realized from the damp and salt on his skin that the room was quite hot. But loss of so much blood had left me chilled and gasping; I couldn\u2019t get through a sentence without stopping to breathe, and my arms were permanently goose-pimpled.</p><p>\u201cAye. Dinna move; I\u2019ll go round.\u201d He came round the bed and edged carefully in behind me. It was a narrow bed, barely wide enough to hold us closely pressed together.</p><p>I exhaled gingerly and relaxed against him in slow motion, reveling in the feel of his warmth and the solid comfort of his body.</p> <p>\u201cElephants,\u201d I said, drawing the shallowest possible breath compatible with speaking. \u201cWhen a female elephant is dying, sometimes a male will try to mate with her.\u201d</p><p>There was a marked silence behind me, and then a big hand came round and rested assessingly on my forehead.</p><p>\u201cEither ye\u2019re fevered again, Sassenach,\u201d he said in my ear, \u201cor ye have verra perverse fancies. Ye dinna really want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said hastily. \u201cNot right this minute, no. And I\u2019m not dying, either. The thought just came to me.\u201d</p><p>He made an amused Scottish noise and, lifting the hair off my neck, kissed my nape.</p><p>\u201cSince ye\u2019re no dying,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe that will do for the moment?\u201d</p> <p>I took his hand and placed it on my breast. Slowly I grew warmer, and my chilly feet, pressed against his shins, relaxed. The window now was filled with stars, hazy with the moistness of the summer night, and I suddenly missed the cool, clear, black-velvet nights of the mountains, the stars blazing huge, close enough to touch from the highest ridge.</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d I whispered. \u201cCan we go home? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said softly. He held my hand and the silence filled the room like moonlight, both of us wondering where home might be.</p><p>A WHIFF OF ROQUEFORT</p><p>I HADN\u2019T SEEN ANY of the previous day\u2019s flock of visitors, though Jamie had told me about them. This day, though, brought one for me. Mrs. Macken brought him up the stairs, in spite of her advanced state of pregnancy, and showed him into my tiny room with great respect.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in uniform and was\u2014for him\u2014quite subfusc, in a coat and breeches of the dull gray that was referred to (with accuracy) as \u201csad-colored,\u201d though he had taken the trouble to wear a dove-gray waistcoat with it that flattered his coloring.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, my dear?\u201d he asked, taking off his hat. Not waiting for an answer, he came down on one knee by the bed, took my hand, and kissed it lightly. His blond hair had been washed, I saw\u2014I smelled his bergamot soap\u2014and trimmed to a uniform length. As that length was roughly an inch, the overall effect reminded me irresistibly of a fuzzy duckling. I laughed, then gasped and pressed a hand to my side.</p><p>\u201cDinna make her laugh!\u201d Jamie said, glowering at John. His tone was cold, but I saw him take in John\u2019s aspect, and the corner of his own mouth twitched.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d John said ruefully to me, passing a hand over his head and ignoring Jamie completely. \u201cIsn\u2019t it dreadful? I ought really to wear a wig for the sake of public decency, but I couldn\u2019t bear it in the heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know that I blame you,\u201d I told him, and ran a hand through the damp mass of my own hair, drying on my shoulders. \u201cThough I haven\u2019t yet got to the point of wanting to shave my head,\u201d I added pointedly, not quite turning my head toward Jamie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. It wouldn\u2019t suit you at all,\u201d John assured me.</p><p>\u201cHow is your eye?\u201d I asked, gingerly trying to raise myself on the pillow. \u201cLet me have a look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d he said, and, leaning over me, opened both eyes wide. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite good. It\u2019s still a bit tender to the touch and gets the odd twinge when I move it too far up or to the right, but\u2014do you smell French cheese?\u201d He sounded slightly startled.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d I was gently prodding the flesh around the orbit, which showed only a slight residual swelling. The sclera was still quite bloodshot, but the bruising was much better. I thumbed down the lower lid to inspect the conjunctiva: a nice slippery pink, no sign of infection. \u201cDoes it water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in strong sunlight, and not very much,\u201d he assured me, straightening up. He smiled at me. \u201cThank you, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t say anything, but the way he breathed had a distinctly edgy feel about it. I ignored him. If he chose to make a fuss, I couldn\u2019t bloody stop him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye doing here?\u201d he asked abruptly. John looked up at him, one brow raised, as though surprised to see him looming on the other side of my bed. John rose slowly to his feet, holding Jamie\u2019s eyes with his own.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m doing?\u201d he asked quietly. There was no hint of challenge in the question, and I could see Jamie suddenly check his own hostility, frowning slightly as he looked John over, considering.</p><p>One side of John\u2019s mouth turned up a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019ve come to fight you for the favors of this lady? Or to seduce her from your side?\u201d</p><p>Jamie didn\u2019t laugh, but the line between his brows smoothed out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cAnd as ye dinna seem to be much damaged, I doubt ye\u2019ve come to be doctored.\u201d</p><p>John gave an amiable bob of the head, indicating that this line of reasoning was correct.</p><p>\u201cAnd I doubt, as well,\u201d Jamie continued, an edge creeping into his voice, \u201cthat ye\u2019ve come to continue our previous discussion.\u201d</p><p>John inhaled slowly, and exhaled even slower, regarding Jamie with a level gaze. \u201cIs it your opinion that anything remains to be said, regarding any part of that discussion?\u201d</p><p>There was a marked silence. I glanced from one to the other, Jamie\u2019s eyes narrowed and John\u2019s eyes wide, both with fixed blue stares. All it lacked was growling and the slow lashing of tails.</p><p>\u201cAre you armed, John?\u201d I inquired pleasantly.</p><p>He glanced at me, startled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, grunting slightly as I struggled to sit up. \u201cThen you obviously aren\u2019t going to kill him\u201d\u2014I nodded at Jamie, standing over me with fists half curled\u2014\u201cand if he didn\u2019t break your neck the first time, he isn\u2019t going to do it now. Are you?\u201d I inquired, arching a brow at Jamie.</p><p>He looked down his nose at me, but I saw the slight relaxation of his mouth. And his hands. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d I brushed the hair back from my face. \u201cNo point in hitting each other. And harsh language would detract from the pleasant nature of this visit, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Neither of them chose to answer this.</p><p>\u201cThat was not actually a rhetorical question,\u201d I said. \u201cBut let that go.\u201d I turned to John, folding my hands in my lap. \u201cFlattered as I am by the attention, I don\u2019t think you came solely to inquire after my well-being. So if you\u2019ll pardon my vulgar curiosity . . . why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He finally relaxed and, at my nod, took the stool, linking his fingers round his knee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to ask your help,\u201d he said directly to Jamie. \u201cBut also\u201d\u2014it was slight, but I noticed the hesitation\u2014\u201cto make you an offer. Not as quid pro quo,\u201d he added. \u201cThe offer is not contingent on your assistance.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a Scottish noise indicating deep skepticism but willingness to listen.</p><p>John nodded and took a breath before continuing. \u201cYou once mentioned to me, my dear, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna be calling her that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d John amended, and, with a polite bow to me, turned his attention to Jamie, \u201conce mentioned that she\u2014and you, I would imagine\u2014had some acquaintance with General Arnold.\u201d</p><p>Jamie and I exchanged puzzled looks. He shrugged and folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cAye, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What I\u2014and my brother\u201d\u2014I felt, rather than saw, Jamie\u2019s start at mention of Hal\u2014\u201cwould ask of you is a note of introduction to Arnold, with your personal request that the general allow us official entrance into the city\u2014and whatever aid he might find it convenient to give us\u2014for the purpose of making a search for my son.\u201d</p><p>John let out the rest of his breath and sat, head down, not moving. Nobody moved.</p><p>At last, Jamie let out a long sigh and sat down on the room\u2019s other stool.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he said, resigned. \u201cWhat\u2019s the wee bastard done now?\u201d</p><p>THE STORY FINISHED, John inhaled, made to rub his bad eye, and luckily stopped in time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put a bit more honey in that before you leave,\u201d I told him. \u201cIt will ease the grittiness.\u201d This non sequitur helped to bridge the awkward gap in the conversation left by Jamie\u2019s being struck momentarily speechless.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said, and rubbed a hand hard over his face. He was still wearing the bloodstained shirt and breeches in which he\u2019d fought; he hadn\u2019t shaved in three days, had barely slept or eaten, and looked like something you wouldn\u2019t want to meet in broad daylight, let alone a dark alley. He took a deep breath and shook his head like a dog shedding water.</p><p>\u201cSo ye think the two of them have gone to Philadelphia\u2014William and this Richardson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not together\u2014or at least not to begin with,\u201d John said. \u201cWilliam\u2019s groom said he left to find a couple of . . . er . . . girls who had gone from the camp. But we strongly suspect that this was a ploy by Richardson, to decoy William out of camp and intercept him on the road.\u201d</p><p>Jamie made an irascible noise.</p><p>\u201cI should like to think the lad\u2019s no such a fat-heided gomerel as to go off wi\u2019 this Richardson. Not after the man sent him into the Great Dismal last year and nearly killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. He didna tell ye that?\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice might possibly have held a shade of scorn, had one been listening closely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m damned sure he didn\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d John replied, with an edge. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t seen you for years before he met you at Chestnut Street, I\u2019d bet money he hasn\u2019t seen you since, and I\u2019m reasonably sure I would have noticed had he mentioned Richardson in the hallway there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said briefly. \u201cHe told my nephew, Ian Murray. Or at least,\u201d he amended, \u201cIan got it from what he said, raving wi\u2019 fever when Ian got him out of the swamp. Richardson sent him wi\u2019 a message for some men in Dismal Town\u2014men he said were Loyalists. But half the men in Dismal Town are named Washington.\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s appearance of pugnacity had vanished. He looked pale, and the fading bruises stood out like leprosy against his skin. He took a deep breath, glanced round the room, and, seeing a half-empty bottle of claret on the table, picked it up and drank a quarter of it without stopping.</p><p>He set it down, stifled a belch, rose with a brief nod and a \u201cwait a moment,\u201d and went out, leaving Jamie and me staring at each other in bafflement.</p><p>This was not significantly assuaged by the reappearance of John, followed by the Duke of Pardloe. Jamie said something remarkably creative in G\u00e0idhlig, and I gave him a look of startled appreciation.</p><p>\u201cAnd a good day to you, too, General Fraser,\u201d Hal said, with a correct bow. Like John, he was dressed in civvies, though with a rather loud mulberry striped waistcoat, and I did wonder where he\u2019d got it from.</p><p>\u201cI have resigned my commission,\u201d Jamie said coldly. \u201c \u2018Mr. Fraser\u2019 will do. May I ask to what we owe the honor of your presence, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Hal\u2019s lips pressed tight together, but, with a glance at his brother, he obliged with a brief pr\u00e9cis of his personal concern with Captain Richardson.</p><p>\u201cAnd I do, of course, wish to retrieve my nephew, William\u2014should he in fact be with Richardson. My brother informs me that you have doubts as to the probability of this being the case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Jamie said shortly. \u201cMy son is not a fool, nor a weakling.\u201d I caught the faint emphasis on \u201cmy son,\u201d and so did both Greys, who stiffened slightly. \u201cHe wouldna go off on some feeble pretext, nor would he allow someone of whom he was suspicious to take him captive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a bloody lot of faith in a boy you haven\u2019t seen since he was six,\u201d Hal observed conversationally.</p><p>Jamie smiled, with considerable rue.</p><p>\u201cI had the making of him until he was six,\u201d he said, and turned his gaze on John. \u201cI ken what he\u2019s made of. And I ken who shaped him after that. Tell me I\u2019m wrong, my lord.\u201d</p><p>There was a marked silence, broken only by Lieutenant Macken\u2019s voice below, calling plaintively to his wife about the location of his clean stockings.</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Hal said with a sigh. \u201cWhere do you think William\u2019s gone, if he\u2019s not with Richardson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone after the girls he spoke of,\u201d Jamie said, lifting one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cHe told his groom so, did he not? D\u2019ye ken who these lassies are?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Greys exchanged looks of muted chagrin, and I coughed, very carefully, holding a pillow to my stomach.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case,\u201d I said, \u201cthen presumably he\u2019ll come back, once he\u2019s either found them or given up looking for them. Wouldn\u2019t he? Would he go AWOL over them\u2014er . . . absent without leave, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have to risk that,\u201d Hal said. \u201cHe\u2019s been relieved of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d John exclaimed, rounding on his brother. \u201cWhat the devil for?\u201d</p> <p>Hal sighed, exasperated. \u201cLeaving camp when he was ordered to stay there in the middle of a battle, what else? Getting into a fight with another officer, ending up at the bottom of a ravine with a dent in his skull through being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and in general being a bloody nuisance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, he is your son,\u201d I said to Jamie, amused. He snorted, but didn\u2019t look altogether displeased.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of nephews,\u201d Jamie said to Hal, \u201cye seem remarkably well informed, Your Grace. Might ye know anything of an Indian scout named Ian Murray?\u201d</p><p>Hal looked blank, but John\u2019s head turned quickly in Jamie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI do. He was taken prisoner late on the day of battle and walked with me into camp, whereupon he killed another scout with a tomahawk and walked out again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBlood will tell,\u201d I murmured, though privately both shocked and worried. \u201cEr . . . was he injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he was,\u201d Jamie answered brusquely. \u201cHe\u2019d been shot wi\u2019 an arrow, in the shoulder. I couldna pull it, but I broke the shaft for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . no one\u2019s seen him since the night of the battle?\u201d I asked, striving to keep my voice steady. The men exchanged glances, but none of them would meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI, um, did give him a canteen of water mixed with brandy,\u201d John said, a little diffidently. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel will find him,\u201d Jamie said, as firmly as he could. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve asked Ian M\u00f2r to watch out for the lad. He\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust your faith in your blood will be justified, sir,\u201d Hal said with a sigh, evidently meaning it. \u201cBut as we can do nothing about Murray, and the question of William\u2019s whereabouts is apparently moot for the moment . . . I hesitate to intrude my concerns regarding my blood, but I have stringent reasons for finding Captain Richardson, quite apart from anything he may have done or not done with William. And to that end . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jamie said, and the tension in his shoulders relaxed. \u201cAye, of course, Your Grace. Sassenach, will ye have the goodness not to die whilst I go and ask Mrs. Macken for paper and ink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have some,\u201d John said, reaching into the leather pouch he\u2019d been carrying under his arm. \u201cAllow me.\u201d And proceeded to lay out paper, an inkhorn, a small bundle of quills, and a stub of red sealing wax.</p><p>Everyone watched as Jamie mixed the ink, trimmed a quill, and began. Knowing how laborious writing was for him and how much he\u2019d hate being watched, I pushed myself up a little more, stifling a groan, and turned to Hal.</p><p>\u201cJohn mentioned that you wanted to make us an offer,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course we\u2019re happy to help, regardless. But out of curiosity\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hal blinked but changed gears rapidly, fixing his gaze on me. \u201cYes. The offer I had in mind has nothing to do with Mr. Fraser\u2019s kind accommodation,\u201d he said. \u201cJohn suggested it, as a matter of convenience for all concerned.\u201d He turned to his brother, who smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cMy house on Chestnut Street,\u201d John said. \u201cPlainly I shan\u2019t be living there for the foreseeable future. And I understand that you had taken refuge with the printer\u2019s family in Philadelphia. Given your present fragile state of health\u201d\u2014he nodded delicately at the small heap of bloody dressings in the corner\u2014\u201cclearly it would be more comfortable for you to resume residence at my house. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>A deep Scottish noise interrupted him, and he looked up at Jamie, startled.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I was compelled to accept assistance from your brother, my lord,\u201d Jamie said precisely, staring at John, \u201cI was your prisoner and incapable of caring for my own family. Now I am no man\u2019s prisoner, nor ever will be again. I shall make provision for my wife.\u201d</p> <p>In dead silence, with all eyes fixed on him, he bent his head to the paper and slowly signed his name.</p><p>ONE DAY, COCK OF THE WALK\u2014NEXT DAY, A FEATHER DUSTER</p><p>HE\u2019D GONE BY INSTINCT to fetch Madras, but paused to think on the way. If he found the girls, he couldn\u2019t bring them both back with him on the horse. He changed direction and plunged into the teamsters\u2019 park, emerging a brief time later with an ammunition cart, now sans ammunition, pulled by a large, rugged gray mule with half of one ear missing.</p><p>The mule was disinclined to move fast, but still made better time than two girls on foot might. How long a head start did they have? Maybe an hour, from what Zebedee had said, maybe longer.</p><p>\u201cHeya!\u201d he shouted, and snapped the whip over the mule\u2019s rump. The animal was surly, but not a fool, and lurched into a faster pace\u2014though William suspected that this effort might be as much to outrun the swarming flies as in response to his own urging.</p><p>Once solidly in motion, though, the mule seemed able to keep it up without noticeable effort, and they trotted down the road at a tooth-rattling pace, easily passing farm carts, foragers, and a couple of scouting parties. Surely he would catch the girls up in no time.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He drove nearly ten miles, by his estimation, before concluding that there was no way the girls could possibly have outrun him, and he turned back, searching carefully along the few farm roads that led off into fields. To and fro he went, inquiring of everyone he saw, growing hotter and more irritated by the moment.</p><p>Midway through the afternoon, the army caught up with him, marching columns overtaking the mule, which had slowed to a walk by now. Reluctantly, he turned about and continued with the army to camp. Perhaps Colenso had been wrong; maybe the girls hadn\u2019t left at all. In which case, he\u2019d find them once the camp settled for the night.</p><p>He did not. He did find Zeb, though, and Colenso with him. Both were adamant that the girls were indeed gone\u2014and William found no trace of them, though he made stubborn inquiries among the laundresses and cooks.</p><p>At last, he trudged through the camp in search of either Papa or Uncle Hal. Not that he expected either man to have any notion regarding the girls\u2014but he somehow felt that he could not abandon his search without at least soliciting their help in putting out word of the girls. Two half-grown girls couldn\u2019t possibly outstrip an army, and\u2014</p><p>He stopped dead in the middle of camp, letting men on their way to supper flow around him.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he said, too hot and tired even to make it an exclamation. \u201cColenso, you left-handed little bugger.\u201d And barely containing his exasperation\u2014with himself as much as with his groom\u2014he set off grimly to find Colenso Baragwanath.</p><p>Because Colenso was a left-handed little bugger. William had noticed that immediately, as he suffered from the same affliction himself. Unlike Colenso, though, William could tell the difference between his right hand and his left\u2014and had a sense of direction. Colenso . . . didn\u2019t, and William wanted to kick himself for not remembering that.</p><p>\u201cYou bloody idiot,\u201d he muttered, wiping a sleeve across his sweating, dusty face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you think of that?\u201d</p><p>Because it made little sense\u2014once he paused to think about it\u2014for the girls to have run off ahead of the army. Even if they were afraid of someone in the army, and even if they meant to reach New York, they would have been better served to have gone the other way, at least temporarily. Let the army march on well ahead, and then make their way wherever they meant to go.</p><p>He glanced at the sun, just barely still above the horizon, and heaved a deep, exasperated breath. Whatever else she might be, Jane wasn\u2019t a fool. First he\u2019d find some supper, and then Colenso\u2014but he\u2019d give good odds that the morrow would find him on the road back toward Middletown.</p><p>HE FOUND THEM, just before noon. They saw him coming, but he\u2019d seen them first: the two of them walking down the side of the road, each with a bundle in either hand. They glanced over their shoulders at the sound of his wheels, saw nothing alarming, turned back\u2014and then Jane whirled round again, her face aghast as she realized who she\u2019d just seen.</p><p>She dropped one of her bundles, clutched her younger sister by the wrist, and jerked her off the road. The road led through farmland here, with open fields on either side\u2014but there was a sizable chestnut grove a few hundred yards ahead, and, despite William\u2019s shout, the girls ran for this as though the devil himself were after them.</p><p>Muttering under his breath, he pulled up, dropped the reins, and leapt out. Long-legged as he was, he failed to catch them before they reached the edge of the wood.</p><p>\u201cStop, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you!\u201d</p><p>Fanny, hearing this, seemed disposed to stop, but Jane yanked her urgently on and they vanished among the rustling leaves.</p><p>William snorted and slowed down. Jane could make up her own mind\u2014if she had one, which he was strongly inclined to doubt at the moment\u2014but she hadn\u2019t any business to be dragging her little sister off through land that had been a battlefield only two days ago.</p><p>Broken trails and big crushed patches marred the fields, from soldiers running or artillery being dragged through it. He could smell death when he drew a deep breath; it made him uneasy. The stink of uncollected corpses swelling in the sun, bursting open, weltering with flies and maggots . . . On the one hand, he hoped the girls wouldn\u2019t stumble over such a sight. On the other, if they did, they\u2019d likely come haring back out into his arms, screaming.</p><p>And corpses might not be the only things hiding in the folds and furrows of the countryside. His hand went automatically to his waist, groping for the hilt of his knife\u2014which, of course, wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cFucking buggering shit-fucking hell!\u201d</p><p>As though this had been a signal, a sudden racket broke out in the trees. Not a corpse; he could hear male voices, cursing, cajoling, and high-pitched shrieks. He snatched up a fallen branch and charged into the grove, shouting at the top of his lungs. He could hear them; they could certainly hear him, and the tone of the shouting changed. The girls were still shrieking, but less frantically, and the men\u2014yes, more than one . . . two, three? Not more\u2014were arguing, agitated, fearful. Not English . . . not speaking English . . .</p><p>\u201cMistkerle!\u201d he bellowed at the top of his lungs. Bloody stinking Hessians! \u201cFeiglinge!\u201d Shit-eating cowards!</p><p>A great thrashing of leaves and snapping branches, and, peering through the trees, he saw that the lot of them\u2014judging by the noise, the girls were still with them\u2014were heading for the road.</p><p>He stopped yelling and instantly altered his own course, charging back toward the road, crashing heedless through brush and low-hanging branches, half-ripe chestnuts thumping off his head and shoulders. There! He saw a man push out of the trees, stumbling onto the road, and lunge back, grabbing. A louder shriek and Fanny came stumbling out in turn, the man gripping her by the neck.</p><p>William veered toward them and burst out running, shouting incoherent curses, brandishing his makeshift club. He must nonetheless have looked frightening in his uniform, for the man holding Fanny let go of her at once, turned, and ran like a rabbit, dust spurting from his feet. Fanny staggered and fell to her knees, but there was no blood, she was all right. . . .</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d He shouted. \u201cJane! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere! He\u2014\u201d Her voice was cut off suddenly, but he could see where she was, no more than ten feet from him, and dived for the wildly waving branches.</p><p>There were two men with her, one with a hand over her mouth, the other struggling to detach the bayonet from a brown Bess musket. William kicked the gun out of his hands, then lunged at the man, and in moments was on the ground, grappling with a burly man who might not know what to do with a bayonet but certainly was acquainted with battle of a more primitive sort.</p><p>They rolled to and fro, panting and gouging, twigs breaking with a sound like gunshots, cracking beneath their bodies. He heard dimly a screech from the other man\u2014perhaps Jane had bitten him; good girl!\u2014but had no attention to spare for anything but the man who was trying earnestly to throttle him. He had a grip on the man\u2019s wrists, and, with a faint memory of Ban Tarleton, jerked the man closer and butted him in the face.</p><p>It worked again; there was a horrible crunch, hot blood spattered his face, and the man\u2019s grip relaxed. William squirmed away, his head swimming, only to find himself facing the other man, who had evidently succeeded in freeing the bayonet, for he had a foot of sharpened steel in his hand.</p><p>\u201cHere! Here!\u201d Jane popped out of a bush right beside William, startling him, and shoved something into his hand. It was, thank God, a knife. Nothing to rival the bayonet, but a weapon.</p><p>Jane was still by him; he grasped her arm and began to walk backward, knife held low and threatening in his other hand. The Hessian\u2014Christ, was it one of the sons of bitches who\u2019d hit him in the head? He couldn\u2019t tell; there were spots floating in front of his eyes, and the men had thrown away their telltale green coats. Did all sons of bitches wear green coats? he wondered muzzily.</p><p>Then they were on the road, and things became confused. He thought he\u2019d stuck one of the men, and the girls were screaming again, and once he found himself in the roadway, choking on dust, but came up again before one of the bastards could kick him in the face . . . and then there was a shout and the pounding of hooves, and he let go of the man whose arm he was gripping and whirled round to see Rachel Hunter on a mule, coming fast down the road, swinging her bonnet from its strings and shouting, \u201cUncle Hiram! Cousin Seth! Hurry! Come on! Come on! Help me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mule jerked its head up from the grass and, seeing Rachel\u2019s mount, brayed in greeting. This seemed to be the last straw for the deserters, who stood gaping for one stunned moment, then turned and galloped down the road after their vanished fellow.</p><p>William stood swaying for a moment, gasping for breath, then dropped his knife and sat down abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he said, in a voice that sounded petulant even to his own ears, \u201care you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Rachel ignored him. She swung down from her mule, landing with a small thump, and led it to William\u2019s mule, tethering it to the cart. Only then did she walk over to where William sat, slowly brushing dirt from his knees and counting his limbs.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have seen a couple of girls, would you?\u201d he asked, tilting his head back to look up at Rachel.</p><p>\u201cYes. They ran into the trees,\u201d she said, nodding toward the chestnut grove. \u201cAs for what I am doing here, I have been up and down this road three times, looking for thy cousin, Ian Murray.\u201d She gave him a hard look as she said this, as though daring him to contradict her assertion regarding his kinship with Murray. Under other circumstances, he might have taken offense, but at the moment he hadn\u2019t the energy. \u201cI assume that if thee had seen him, dead or alive, thee would tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. There was a swollen knot between his eyes, where he had butted the deserter, and he rubbed this gingerly.</p><p>She drew a deep breath, sighed loudly, and wiped her sweating face on her apron, before replacing her bonnet. She looked him over, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThee is a rooster, William,\u201d Rachel said mournfully. \u201cI saw this in thee before, but now I know it for certain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA rooster,\u201d he repeated coldly, brushing dirt from his sleeve. \u201cIndeed. A vain, crowing, gaudy sort of fellow\u2014that\u2019s what you think me?\u201d</p><p>Her brows went up. They were not the level brows of classic beauty; they quirked up at the ends, even when her face was at rest, giving her a look of interested intelligence. When she was not at rest, they slanted with a sharp, wicked sort of look. They did this for an instant now, but then relaxed. A little.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cHas thee ever kept chickens, William?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for some years,\u201d he said, examining the hole torn in the elbow of his coat, the hole ripped in the shirt beneath, and the bloody scrape upon his bare elbow. Bloody hell, one of the buggers had come close to taking his arm off with that bayonet. \u201cWhat with one thing and another, my recent acquaintance with chickens has been limited largely to breakfast. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, a rooster is a creature of amazing courage,\u201d Rachel said, rather reproachful. \u201cHe will throw himself into the face of an enemy, even knowing he will die in the attack, and thus buy his hens time to escape.\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s head jerked up.</p> <p>\u201cMy hens?\u201d he said, outrage bringing the blood to his face. \u201cMy hens?\u201d He glanced in the direction Jane and Fanny had taken, then glared back at Rachel. \u201cDo you not realize that they are whores?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him in exasperation. She bloody rolled her eyes at him!</p><p>\u201cI expect I have been living with an army for somewhat longer than thee has thyself,\u201d she said, making a decided effort to look down her nose at him. \u201cI am familiar with women who lack both property and protection and are thus reduced to the dreadful expedient of selling their bodies, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dreadful expedient\u2019?\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou realize that I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stamped a foot and glared at him.</p><p>\u201cWill thee stop repeating everything I say?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI was attempting to pay thee a compliment\u2014while, as thy friend, lamenting the end thy roosterishness will surely bring thee to. Whether thy companions are whores or not\u2014and whether thee pays for their company\u2014is irrelevant to the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrre\u2014\u201d William began in indignation, but choked the word off before he could be further accused of repetition. \u201cI don\u2019t bloody pay them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrrelevant,\u201d she repeated, doing it herself, by God! \u201cThee has behaved in exactly the same way on my own behalf, after all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cI have?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled strongly, eyeing him in a manner suggesting that she would have kicked him in the shins or stamped on his toes if not reminded of her Quaker principles.</p><p>\u201cTwice,\u201d she said, elaborately polite. \u201cThe occasions were so negligible, I suppose\u2014or I was\u2014that thee has forgotten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me,\u201d he said dryly, and, ripping a chunk from the torn lining of his coat, used it to wipe the mud\u2014and blood, he saw\u2014from his face.</p><p>She snorted briefly, but obliged. \u201cDoes thee not recall the odious creature who attacked us in that dreadful place on the road in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d His belly clenched in recollection. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly do it on your account. Nor did I have much choice in the matter. He bloody tried to cave my head in with an ax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph. I think thee has some fatal attraction for ax-wielding maniacs,\u201d she said, frowning at him. \u201cThat Mr. Bug actually did hit thee in the head with an ax. But when thee killed him later, it was to protect Ian and me from a similar fate, was it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, indeed,\u201d he said, a little crossly. \u201cHow do you know it wasn\u2019t just revenge for his attacking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee may be a rooster, but thee is not a vengeful rooster,\u201d she said reprovingly. She pulled a kerchief from her pocket and blotted her face, which was growing shiny with perspiration again. \u201cShould we not look for thy . . . companions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should,\u201d he said, with a degree of resignation, and turned toward the grove. \u201cI think they\u2019ll run if I go in after them, though.\u201d</p><p>Rachel made an impatient noise and, pushing past him, stomped into the woods, rustling through the brush like a hungry bear. The thought made him grin, but a sudden yelp wiped the smile off his face. He started after her, but she was already backing out, yanking Jane by one arm, meanwhile trying to avoid the wild swipes Jane was making with her free hand, fingers clawed and slashing toward Rachel\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d William said sharply, and, stepping forward, grabbed Jane by the shoulder and jerked her out of Rachel\u2019s grasp. She turned blindly on him, but he had longer arms than Rachel and could easily hold her at bay.</p><p>\u201cWill you quit that?\u201d he said crossly. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you. Not now.\u201d</p><p>She did stop, though she looked back and forth between him and Rachel like a cornered animal, panting and the whites of her eyes showing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Rachel said, edging cautiously toward her. \u201cThee is quite safe now. What is thy name, Friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s called Jane,\u201d William said, gradually loosing his hold, ready to grab her again if she bolted. \u201cI don\u2019t know her surname.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bolt, but didn\u2019t speak, either. Her dress was torn at the neck, and she put a hand to the torn edge automatically, trying to fit it back in place.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my bundle?\u201d she said, in an almost ordinary voice. \u201cI have a housewife in it. I need a needle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look for it,\u201d Rachel said soothingly. \u201cDid thee drop it in the wood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThir!\u201d Fanny spoke quite sharply behind William, and he became aware that she\u2019d been there for a few moments; she\u2019d said it once or twice before.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said impatiently, half-turning toward her while trying to keep both Jane and Rachel in view.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019th an Indian in there,\u201d she said, and pointed toward the woods.</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>Rachel ran across the road, fleet as a snipe, and vanished into the trees. William followed hastily, hand on his knife. There was likely more than one Indian in these woods, and if it wasn\u2019t Murray . . .</p><p>But he could tell from Rachel\u2019s exclamation of mingled horror and relief from the depths of the wood that it was.</p><p>Murray was crumpled into a heap in the deep shadow at the base of a big pine tree, needles half-scuffled over him; evidently he\u2019d tried to disguise himself but had passed out before managing the job.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s breathing,\u201d Rachel said, and he heard the catch in her voice.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d William said briefly, and, squatting beside her, put a hand on Murray\u2019s shoulder to turn him over. The apparently insensible body gave a shriek, contorted violently, and ended on his knees, swaying and glaring wildly round, clutching the shoulder William had seized. Only then did William see the dried blood streaked down the arm and the fresh dribbles running down from the broken shaft of an arrow embedded in the swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIan, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s all right now. I have thee.\u201d Her voice was steady, but her hand trembled as she touched him.</p><p>Murray gulped air, and his bleared gaze seemed to clear, traveling from Fanny and Jane, who had come into the grove after William, pausing briefly with a frown at William\u2019s face, then settling and easing as he saw Rachel. He closed his eyes and let out a long breath.</p><p>\u201cTaing do Dhia,\u201d he said, and sank back on his haunches.</p><p>\u201cWater,\u201d Rachel said urgently, shaking the empty canteen that lay on the ground beside Ian. \u201cHas thee got any water, William?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d said Jane, stirring out of her trance and groping for the canteen round her neck. \u201cWill he be all right, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t answer but helped Murray to drink, her face pale with anxiety. Murray\u2019s own face bore the remnants of war paint, William saw with interest, and a brief ripple raised the hairs on his scalp, wondering whether Murray had killed any of the British soldiers. At least the bugger wasn\u2019t sporting any scalps on his belt, British or otherwise.</p><p>Rachel was conversing now in low tones with Murray, glancing now and then at William, a certain speculation in her gaze.</p><p>William was mildly surprised to find that he knew exactly what she was thinking. Though perhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising; he\u2019d been wondering much the same thing: could Murray ride the mule? Plainly he couldn\u2019t walk far. And if he couldn\u2019t . . . could Rachel persuade William to take Murray and her into the city in the wagon?</p><p>He felt his stomach clench at the thought of going back to Philadelphia.</p><p>His own gaze flicked toward Jane\u2014only to discover that she wasn\u2019t there. Neither was Fanny.</p><p>He was halfway to his feet when he heard Rachel\u2019s mule bray in protest, and he made it to the road in seconds, to find Jane engaged in a futile struggle to push Fanny up into the saddle. The younger girl was trying valiantly, clutching at the mule\u2019s bristly mane and attempting to get a leg up, but the mule was objecting strenuously to this sort of interference, tossing his head and backing away from Jane, leaving Fanny\u2019s legs kicking desperately in the air.</p><p>William reached her in three paces and clasped her about the waist.</p><p>\u201cLet go, sweetheart,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d Fanny was surprisingly solid, given her fragile appearance. She smelled sweet, too, though her neck was grubby and her clothes grimed with mud and road dust.</p><p>He put her down and turned a firm eye on Jane, who was looking defiant. He\u2019d been acquainted with her long enough now, though, to see that the uplifted chin and tight jaw were covering fear, and, in consequence, spoke more gently than he might have.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you planning to go?\u201d he asked, in a tone of mild interest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014well, New York,\u201d she answered, but uncertainly, and her eyes were darting to and fro, as though expecting some threat to manifest itself from the peaceful countryside.</p><p>\u201cWithout me? I\u2019m hurt, madam, that you should have conceived a sudden dislike of my company. What have I done to offend you, pray?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips tight together, but he could see that his jesting tone had settled her a little; she was still red in the face from exertion, but not breathing in that jerky way.</p><p>\u201cI think we must part, Lord Ellesmere,\u201d she said, with a touchingly absurd attempt at formality. \u201cI\u2014we\u2014shall make our own way now.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms, leaned back against the wagon, and looked down his nose at her.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he inquired. \u201cYou haven\u2019t any money, you don\u2019t have a mount, and you wouldn\u2019t get five miles on foot without running into someone else like those German fellows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014have a little money.\u201d She smoothed a hand over her skirt, and he saw that there was indeed a bulge where her pocket lay. Despite his intent to remain calm, there was still a spring of anger in him, and it burst forth at this.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d he demanded, straightening up and grabbing her by the wrist. \u201cDid I not forbid you to whore?\u201d</p><p>She yanked her hand smartly free and took two quick steps back.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t any right to forbid me to do any damned thing I want!\u201d she snapped, color burning high in her cheeks. \u201cAnd it\u2019s none of your business, but I didn\u2019t make this money on my back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, then? Pimping your sister?\u201d</p><p>She slapped him, hard. He shouldn\u2019t have said it and knew it, but the knowledge\u2014and his stinging cheek\u2014only made him angrier.</p><p>\u201cI should bloody leave you here, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! That\u2019s just what I want you to do! You\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before either of them could decide upon an epithet, Rachel and Ian emerged from the wood, the tall Scot leaning heavily on her. William gave Jane a final glare and went to help, taking Murray\u2019s weight on one side. The man stiffened, resisting for a moment, but then yielded; he had to.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d William asked, nodding at the broken arrow shaft. \u201cA private quarrel or just bad aim?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That made Murray\u2019s mouth twitch, reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cFortunes of war,\u201d he said hoarsely, and sat down at the open tailboard of the wagon. He was breathing like a winded ox, but had possession of himself. He gave William a brief glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye doing here, a fang Sassunaich?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, but a good job I was,\u201d William replied, just as briefly. He turned to Rachel, having made up his mind on the moment.</p> <p>\u201cTake the wagon and see the girls somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Rachel began, but then looked round, startled, as Jane and Fanny ran past her, crossed the road, and dived into the wood. \u201cWhere are they going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bloody hell,\u201d William said, already striding across the road. \u201cWait here.\u201d</p><p>THEY COULDN\u2019T outrun him, and they had nothing in the way of woodcraft that would enable them to lie hidden. He caught Fanny\u2014again the slower of the two\u2014by the back of her pinafore as she was scrambling over a log. To his astonishment, she squirmed round in his grasp and launched herself at him, scratching at his face and screaming, \u201cWun, Janie, wun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you bloody stop that?\u201d he said crossly, holding her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cOw!\u201d For she had sunk her teeth into his wrist, and he dropped her.</p> <p>She eeled over the log and bounded away like a rabbit, still screaming her head off. He started to follow her, and then thought better. On the one hand, he had a strong impulse to abandon them, but on the other . . . He remembered Mac telling him about plovers one day as they sat near Watendlath Tarn, eating bread and cheese, watching the birds.</p><p>\u201cBugger off, Mac,\u201d he said under his breath, and shoved thought of both Helwater and the groom ruthlessly away. But remembered, whether he wanted to or not.</p><p>\u201cThey run about and call out as though wounded, see?\u201d Mac\u2019s arm had been round him, keeping him from going too close to the fluttering bird. \u201cBut it\u2019s to draw ye away from their nest, lest ye crush the eggs or damage the young. Look canny, though, and ye\u2019ll see them.\u201d</p><p>William stood quite still, calming his own breath and looking round, slow and careful, barely moving his head. And there indeed was the plover\u2019s nest: alas for Jane, she had worn her pink calico today, and her rosy bu**ocks rounded smoothly up out of the grass ten feet away, quite like a pair of eggs in a nest, at that.</p><p>He walked quietly, without haste. Nobly resisting the strong urge to smack her beguilingly curved behind, he instead laid a hand flat on her back.</p><p>\u201cTag,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re it.\u201d</p> <p>She wriggled out from under his hand and shot up onto her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the bloody hell do you mean?\u201d She was wild-eyed and nervy, but cross, as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never played tag?\u201d he asked, feeling foolish even as he said it.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and let out her breath a little. \u201cIt\u2019s a game. I see. Yes, but not for a long time.\u201d</p><p>He supposed one didn\u2019t play tag in a brothel.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said tersely, \u201cwe want to go. I\u2014I appreciate what you\u2019ve done for me\u2014for us. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said, and compelled her to do so, leading her to the log over which her sister had escaped and pressing on her shoulder until she reluctantly sat. He then sat down beside her and took her hand in his. It was very small, cold and damp from the grass where she\u2019d hidden.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, firmly but not\u2014he hoped\u2014unkindly, \u201cI\u2019m not letting you run off. That\u2019s flat. If you want to go to New York with the army, I\u2019ll take you; I\u2019ve already said so. If you want to return to Philadelphia\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Her terror at the thought was clear now. She pulled desperately at her hand, but he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cIs it because of Captain Harkness? Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gave a cry that might have come from the throat of a wild bird caught in a trap, and he tightened his grip on her wrist. It was fine-boned and slender, but she was surprisingly strong.</p><p>\u201cI know you stole the gorget back\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. No one\u2019s going to find out. And Harkness won\u2019t touch you again; I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>She made a small bubbling noise that might have been a laugh or a sob.</p><p>\u201cColonel Tarleton\u2014you know, the green dragoon that made advances to you?\u2014he told me that Harkness was absent without leave, hasn\u2019t come back to his regiment. Do you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me go. Please!\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer this, a small, clear voice piped up from the trees a few yards away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best tew him, Janie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFanny!\u201d Jane swung round toward her sister, momentarily forgetting that she was pinioned. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Fanny stepped out of the shadows, wary but curiously composed.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, I wiw,\u201d she said, her big brown eyes fixed on William\u2019s face. \u201cHe won\u2019t thtop.\u201d She came a little closer, cautious but not afraid. \u201cIf I tew you,\u201d she said, \u201cdo you pwomise not to take us back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Phiwadelphia,\u201d she said. \u201cOr the army.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, exasperated, but short of torturing the answer out of one of the girls, clearly no progress would be made unless he agreed. And he was beginning to have a cold feeling under the ribs about just what the answer might be.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he said, but Fanny hung back, distrustful.</p><p>\u201cSweaw,\u201d she said, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cSw\u2014oh. Bloody hell. All right, then\u2014I swear on my honor.\u201d</p><p>Jane made a small, dreary noise that was still a laugh. That stung.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I haven\u2019t got any?\u201d he demanded, turning on her.</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d she countered, sticking out her chin. It wobbled, but she stuck it out. \u201cWhat does honor look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your sake, you\u2019d better hope it looks a lot like me,\u201d he told her, but then turned to Fanny. \u201cWhat do you want me to swear on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mudder\u2019s head,\u201d she said promptly.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour favver, den.\u201d</p><p>He drew a long, deep breath. Which one?</p><p>\u201cI swear on my father\u2019s head,\u201d he said evenly.</p><p>And so they told him.</p><p>\u201cI KNEW HE\u2019D come back,\u201d Jane said. She was sitting on the log, hands clasped between her thighs and eyes on her feet. \u201cThey always do. The bad ones.\u201d She spoke with a sort of dull resignation, but her lips tightened at the memory. \u201cThey can\u2019t stand to think you\u2019ve got away without . . . without. I thought it would be me, though.\u201d</p><p>Fanny was sitting beside her sister, as close as she could get, and now she put her arms around Jane and hugged her, her face in Jane\u2019s calico shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sowwy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, lovie,\u201d Jane said, and patted Fanny\u2019s leg. A fierce look came into her face, though. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, and don\u2019t ever\u2014ever\u2014think so.\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s throat felt thick with disgust at the thought. That beautiful, flower-faced little girl, taken by\u2014</p><p>\u201cHer maidenhead\u2019s worth ten pound,\u201d Jane reminded him. \u201cMrs. Abbott was saving her, waiting for a rich man with a taste for new-hatched chicks. Captain Harkness offered her twenty.\u201d She looked directly at William for the first time. \u201cI wasn\u2019t having that,\u201d she said simply. \u201cSo I asked Mrs. Abbott to send us up together; I said I could help keep Fanny from making a fuss. I knew what he was like, see,\u201d she said, and pressed her lips involuntarily together for an instant. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the sort to plow you like a bull and have it done. He\u2019d play with you, making you undress a bit at a time and\u2014and do things\u2014while he told you all about what he meant to do.\u201d</p><p>And so it had been easy to come behind him while he was watching Fanny, with the knife she\u2019d taken from the kitchen hidden in the folds of her petticoats.</p><p>\u201cI meant to stab him in the back,\u201d she said, looking down again. \u201cI saw a man stabbed that way once. But he saw on Fanny\u2019s face what I\u2014it wasn\u2019t her fault, she couldn\u2019t help it showing,\u201d she added quickly. \u201cBut he turned round quick and there wasn\u2019t any choice.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d plunged the knife into Harkness\u2019s throat and wrenched it free, intending to stab again. But that hadn\u2019t been necessary. \u201cThere was blood everywhere.\u201d She\u2019d gone pale in the telling, her hands wrapped in her apron.</p><p>\u201cI frew up,\u201d Fanny added matter-of-factly. \u201cIt was a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect it was,\u201d William said dryly. He was trying not to envision the scene\u2014the candlelight, the spraying blood, the panicked girls\u2014with remarkably little success. \u201cHow did you get away?\u201d</p><p>Jane shrugged. \u201cIt was my room, and he\u2019d bolted the door. And nobody was surprised when Fanny started screaming,\u201d she added, with a trace of bitterness.</p><p>There was a basin and pitcher of water, the usual rags for mess; they\u2019d washed themselves hastily, changed clothes, and climbed out the window.</p><p>\u201cWe found a ride on a farmer\u2019s wagon, and . . . you know the rest.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment, as though reliving \u201cthe rest,\u201d and then opened them and looked up at him, her gaze dark as shadowed water.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>WILLIAM HAD BEEN asking himself that question for the last several moments of Jane\u2019s story. Having met Harkness himself, he had considerable sympathy for Jane\u2019s action, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou planned it,\u201d he said, giving her a sharp look. Her head was bent, her unbound hair hiding her face. \u201cYou took the knife, you had clothes to change into, you knew how to get down from the window and get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTho?\u201d said Fanny, in a remarkably cold voice for a girl of her age.</p><p>\u201cSo why kill him?\u201d he asked, transferring his attention to Fanny, but keeping a wary eye on Jane. \u201cYou were going to leave anyway. Why not just escape before he came?\u201d</p><p>Jane raised her head and turned it, looking him directly in the eye.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to kill him,\u201d she said, in a perfectly reasonable voice that chilled him despite the warmth of the day.</p><p>\u201cI . . . see.\u201d</p><p>He saw more than the vision of Jane, with her delicate white wrists, plunging a knife into Captain Harkness\u2019s thick red throat while her little sister screamed. He saw Rachel\u2019s face, pale among the leaves, six feet away. From her expression, it was apparent that she had heard everything.</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cIs, um, Mr. Murray all right?\u201d he asked politely. Jane and Fanny whirled, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cHe fainted,\u201d Rachel replied. She was eyeing the younger girls in much the same way that they were looking at her, with a gaze of fascinated horror. \u201cHis shoulder is badly inflamed. I came to see if thee had any brandy.\u201d</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket and withdrew a small silver flask with the Grey family arms engraved upon it.</p><p>\u201cWhisky do for you?\u201d he asked, handing it over. Rachel looked surprised; whisky wasn\u2019t a popular drink, but Lord John had always had a taste for it and William had taken to it himself\u2014though now, knowing the truth about his disgraceful taint of Scottish blood, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever be able to drink the stuff again.</p><p>\u201cIt will, I thank thee.\u201d She stood holding it for a moment, clearly wanting to go to Murray but also hesitant to leave. He felt rather grateful to her for that hesitancy; he would as soon not be alone with Jane and Fanny\u2014or, rather, he didn\u2019t want to be alone with the decision as to what the devil to do about them.</p><p>Rachel appeared to correctly interpret this feeling, for with a brief \u201cI\u2019ll bring it right back,\u201d she disappeared in the direction of the road.</p><p>No one spoke. After that one direct look, Jane had bent her head again and sat quietly, though one hand restlessly smoothed the fabric of her skirt across one round thigh, over and over.</p><p>Fanny ran a hand over the crown of Jane\u2019s head in a protective gesture, while staring at William with a complete lack of expression. He found it unnerving.</p><p>What was he to do with them? Of course they couldn\u2019t go back to Philadelphia. And he dismissed as unworthy the impulse simply to abandon them to their own devices. But\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy not go to New York with the army?\u201d he asked, his voice seeming unnaturally loud, harsh to his own ears. \u201cWhat made you run yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jane looked up slowly, her eyes a little unfocused, as though she had been dreaming. \u201cI saw him again. The green dragoon. He\u2019d wanted me to go with him the night before, and I wouldn\u2019t. But I saw him again yesterday morning and thought he was looking for me.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI told you\u2014I know the ones who don\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery perceptive of you,\u201d he said, eyeing her with some respect. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t. You misliked him on sight, then?\u201d Because he didn\u2019t think for an instant that his having forbidden her to ply her trade would have stopped her, had she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that,\u201d she said, and flicked Banastre Tarleton away with the sort of abrupt gesture one uses to shoo insects. \u201cBut he\u2019d come to the brothel before, last year. He didn\u2019t go with me then, he chose another girl\u2014but I knew if he spent much time with me, he\u2019d likely remember why I seemed familiar to him. He said I did,\u201d she added, \u201cwhen he came up to me in the bread line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He paused. \u201cSo you did want to go to New York\u2014but not with the army. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>Jane shrugged, angry. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the devil shouldn\u2019t it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen has it ever mattered what a whore wants?\u201d She sprang up and stamped across the clearing, leaving him staring after her in astonishment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d he demanded, turning to Fanny. The younger girl eyed him dubiously, lips pressed together, but then gave a little shrug.</p><p>\u201cShe thinks you might give her to a conthable or a magith-trate,\u201d she said, struggling a bit with \u201cmagistrate.\u201d \u201cOr maybe to the army. It was a tholdier she killed.\u201d</p><p>William rubbed a hand over his face. In fact, the thought of delivering Jane to justice had flitted through his mind, in the wake of the shock of learning of her crime. The thought hadn\u2019t outlasted its birth, though.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said to Fanny, striving to sound reasonable. She looked at him skeptically, under level dark brows.</p> <p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent question,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t got an answer. But I suppose I don\u2019t need one.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow at her, and she gave a small snort of a laugh. Jane was edging along the far side of the clearing, glancing back toward Fanny every few seconds; her intent was clear\u2014but she wouldn\u2019t go without her sister. He was sure of that much.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re here with me,\u201d he observed, \u201cand not over there with your sister . . . you don\u2019t want to run, and you know she won\u2019t go without you. Ergo, I conclude that you don\u2019t think I\u2019d give her up to justice.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, slow and solemn as an owl.</p> <p>\u201cJane says I don\u2019 know anyting about men yed, but I do.\u201d</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cGod help me, Frances, you do.\u201d</p><p>THERE WAS NO further conversation until Rachel returned a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lift him,\u201d she said directly to William, ignoring the girls for the moment. \u201cWill thee help me?\u201d</p><p>He rose at once, relieved by the prospect of physical action, but glanced over his shoulder at Jane, still hovering by the far side of the clearing like a hummingbird.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be heah,\u201d Fanny said quietly. He gave her a nod, and went.</p><p>He found Murray lying by the side of the road, near the wagon. The man wasn\u2019t unconscious, but the influence of the fever upon him was clear; his gaze was bleared and his speech slurring.</p><p>\u201cI c\u2019n walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you can,\u201d William said briefly. \u201cHold on to my arm.\u201d</p><p>He got the man sitting upright and had a look for himself at the wounded shoulder. The wound itself wasn\u2019t that bad; it was apparent no bones were broken and it hadn\u2019t bled a lot. On the other hand, the flesh was red and swollen and starting to suppurate. He leaned close and took an unobtrusive sniff\u2014not unobtrusive enough: Rachel noticed.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no gangrene,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there will not\u2014I think things will be well, so long as we can get him to a doctor soon. What does thee mean to do about thy girls?\u201d she added abruptly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother telling her again that they weren\u2019t his. Evidently they were, at least in terms of immediate responsibilities.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted, rising to his feet. He glanced into the woods, but the clearing was far enough in that there was no flicker of garment or movement visible.</p> <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t go to Philadelphia, and I can\u2019t take them back to the army. The best I can think of just now is to find them some place of refuge in one of the little villages hereabouts and cache them there until I can make some provision to get them to . . . to someplace safer.\u201d Wherever the hell that might be. Canada? he wondered wildly.</p><p>Rachel shook her head decidedly.</p><p>\u201cThee has no notion how people talk in small places\u2014or how quickly news and rumor spread.\u201d She glanced down at Murray, who was still sitting upright but swaying, his eyes half closed.</p><p>\u201cThey have no other profession,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it would be quickly apparent to anyone what that profession is. They require not only refuge but refuge with people who will not cast them out once that becomes known.\u201d</p><p>She was brown with the sun\u2014her blue calico bonnet had fallen off in the struggle with Jane and hung back over her shoulders\u2014but her face paled when she looked at Murray. She clenched her fists, closed her eyes for an instant, then opened them, straightening to her full height, and looked William in the eye.</p><p>\u201cThere is a small settlement of Friends, perhaps two hours\u2019 travel from here. No more than three or four farms. I know of it from one of the women who came to Valley Forge with her husband. The girls could be kept safe there, for a while, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Murray said. \u201cYe canna be . . .\u201d He paused, eyes going out of focus, and braced himself on his sound arm, still swaying. He swallowed thickly. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNot . . . safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d William agreed. \u201cThree young women on the road, alone? And without even a pistol to defend yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had a pistol I would not use it,\u201d Rachel pointed out with some asperity. \u201cNor a cannon, come to that.\u201d</p><p>Murray laughed\u2014or at least made a noise that might pass for amusement.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he managed, and stopped to breathe before getting the next words out. \u201cYou take them,\u201d he said to William. \u201cI\u2019ll . . . do here, fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee bloody won\u2019t,\u201d Rachel said fiercely. She grabbed William\u2019s arm and pulled him closer to Murray. \u201cLook at him! Tell him, since he professes not to believe me.\u201d</p><p>William looked, reluctantly, glancing at Murray\u2019s face, pale as suet and slick with an unhealthy sweat. Flies clustered thick on Murray\u2019s shoulder; he lacked the strength to brush them away.</p><p>\u201cMerde,\u201d William muttered under his breath. Then louder, though still with reluctance, \u201cShe\u2019s right. You need a doctor, if you\u2019re to have a chance of keeping your arm.\u201d</p><p>That thought evidently hadn\u2019t struck Murray; death, yes\u2014amputation, no. He turned his head and frowned at the wound.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d William said, and turned to Rachel.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me where this settlement is. I\u2019ll take them.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced, fists balling up at her sides. \u201cEven Friends may not take well to the sudden appearance of a stranger who asks them to give indefinite sanctuary to a murderess. I am not a stranger and can plead the girl\u2019s case better than thee can.\u201d She drew a breath that swelled her bosom noticeably and looked at Murray, then turned her head to give William a piercing look.</p><p>\u201cIf I do this, thee must see him safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d Murray said hoarsely, but she ignored him.</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019ll have to take the wagon, the girls and I.\u201d</p><p>William drew a breath of his own, but he could see that she was right. He could also see just what the decision to save Jane was costing her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said tersely. He reached up and took the gorget from his neck and handed it to her. \u201cGive Jane this. She may need it, if they find themselves on their own.\u201d Oddly, the removal of the gorget seemed a weight off his mind, as well. Even the possibility of being arrested if anyone in Philadelphia recognized him didn\u2019t trouble him overmuch.</p><p>He was about to remove his incriminating coat and waistcoat\u2014he\u2019d have to hide those somewhere\u2014when Rachel stepped close to him and laid a hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cThis man is my heart and my soul,\u201d she said simply, looking up into his face. \u201cAnd he is thy own blood, whatever thee may presently feel about the fact. I trust thee to see him safe, for all our sakes.\u201d</p><p>William gave her a long look, thought of several possible replies, and made none of them, but gave a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cWhere should I take him?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo my\u2014to Lady J\u2014I mean, to Mrs. F\u2014I mean, God damn it,\u201d he amended, feeling the blood rise in his cheeks, \u201cto his aunt?\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked at him, startled.</p><p>\u201cThee doesn\u2019t know? Of course thee doesn\u2019t, how could thee?\u201d She waved off her own denseness, impatient. \u201cHis aunt was shot in the course of the battle, outside Tennent Church, where she was tending the wounded.\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s annoyance was doused at once, as though ice water had been poured on his head, flooding his veins.</p><p>\u201cIs she dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the grace of our Lord, no,\u201d she said, and he felt the tightness in his chest relax a little. \u201cOr at least she wasn\u2019t yesterday,\u201d she amended with a frown. \u201cThough very badly hurt.\u201d The tightness returned.</p><p>\u201cShe is in the Macken house in the village of Freehold\u2014about six miles in that direction.\u201d She nodded down the road. \u201cMy brother is likely there, as well, or nearby; there are still wounded from the battle there. He can deal with I-Ian\u2019s wound.\u201d For the first time, her voice lost its steadiness as her eyes went to her betrothed.</p><p>Murray\u2019s eyes were sunken and glazed with fever, but he had sufficient command of himself to reach out his good hand to her. The movement put weight on the bad arm and he grimaced, but Rachel was kneeling beside him in an instant, arms around him.</p><p>William coughed and turned discreetly away to leave them a moment\u2019s privacy in which to make their farewells. Whatever his own feelings, they deserved that. He\u2019d seen many wounds go bad, and reckoned Murray\u2019s chances as no better than even. On the other hand, the man was apparently both a bloody Scot and a Mohawk, and both races were notoriously hard to kill.</p><p>He had walked away from the road, and his eye now caught the flutter of pink fabric behind a bush.</p><p>\u201cJane!\u201d he called. \u201cIs that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. She stepped out into the open, folded her arms, and pointed her chin at him. \u201cWhat do you mean to do? With me, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Hunter is going to take you and Fanny to a safe place,\u201d he said, as gently as he could. In spite of her brave fa\u00e7ade, she reminded him of a fawn, dappled light coming through the trees mottling her face and gown, making her seem shy and insubstantial, as though she might fade into the forest in the next breath. \u201cI\u2019ll send word to you there when I\u2019ve made some . . . suitable arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d Jane shot a surprised glance toward the road. \u201cWhy? Why can\u2019t you take us? Doesn\u2019t she want to stay with her\u2014the Indian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Hunter will have time to explain everything to you on the way.\u201d He hesitated, unsure what else to say to her. From the road, he heard the distant murmur of voices, Rachel and Ian Murray. He couldn\u2019t make out the words, but it didn\u2019t matter; what they were saying to each other was plain. He felt a small, sharp pain under his third waistcoat button and coughed, trying to dislodge it.</p><p>\u201cThank you, thir,\u201d said a soft voice behind him, and he turned to find Fanny at his elbow. She took his hand, turned it palm upward, and planted a small, warm kiss in the center.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you\u2019re most welcome, Miss Fanny,\u201d he said, smiling at her in spite of everything. She nodded to him, very dignified, and walked out to the road, leaving him with Jane.</p><p>For a moment, they stood staring at each other.</p><p>\u201cI offered you a lot more than a kiss,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want it. I haven\u2019t got anything else to give you in thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d And then stopped, desperately sorry but helpless to think of anything he could possibly say in reply. \u201cSafe travels, Jane,\u201d he said at last, his throat tight. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>IT\u2019S A WISE CHILD WHO KNOWS HIS FATHER</p><p>IT WAS APPARENT that, while sound, Rachel\u2019s mule wasn\u2019t up to the weight of two men the size of William and Ian Murray. No matter; they couldn\u2019t go any faster than a walk in any case; Murray could ride, and William would walk alongside to make sure the bastard didn\u2019t fall off.</p><p>Murray managed to get up into the saddle, in spite of having only one functional hand; Rachel had roughly bandaged his wounded arm and put it into a sling torn from her underpetticoat. William didn\u2019t offer him assistance, feeling reasonably sure that such an offer would be neither welcomed nor accepted.</p><p>Watching the laborious process, though, William was interested to note that while the fabric of the sling was much-laundered and faded, it had been embroidered with small blue and yellow sunbursts along one edge. Did Quaker women commonly wear attractive undergarments beneath their sober gowns?</p><p>As they set off at a cautious walk, the sound of the wagon was still audible, though fading into the rush of trees.</p><p>\u201cAre ye armed?\u201d Murray asked suddenly.</p><p>\u201cSlightly.\u201d He still had the knife Jane had pushed into his hand, now wrapped in a handkerchief and tucked in his pocket, as he had no sheath for it. He fingered the wooden handle, wondering whether it was the same knife that she . . . Well, of course it was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Will ye find me a club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me to see you safe?\u201d William asked sarcastically.</p><p>Murray\u2019s shoulders were slumped and his head thrust forward, nodding a little with the mule\u2019s gait, but he turned and gave William a look that was heavy-eyed with fever, but still surprisingly alert.</p><p>\u201cOh, I trust ye fine. It\u2019s men like the ones ye just fought I dinna trust.\u201d</p><p>This was a fair point; the roads were far from safe, and the knowledge gave William a severe pang of conscience on behalf of the women he\u2019d just dispatched, unarmed and unprotected, to drive miles over those very roads with a valuable mule and cart. I should have gone with them, insisted we all go together . . .</p><p>\u201cMy mam always says there\u2019s no one more stubborn than my uncle Jamie,\u201d Murray observed mildly, \u201cbut a Quaker lass wi\u2019 her mind made up could give Uncle Jamie a run for his money, I\u2019ll tell ye. I couldna have stopped her\u2014and neither could you.\u201d</p><p>William wasn\u2019t in a mood to discuss any of the persons mentioned, nor yet engage in philosophical discussions of relative stubbornness. He put a hand on the bridle and pulled the mule to a halt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStay here. I see something that might do.\u201d He\u2019d already seen that there was little in the way of fallen branches near the road; there never was, when an army\u2019s foragers had recently passed through. But he saw an orchard of some kind, a little way from the road, with a farmhouse beyond.</p><p>As he made his way toward the orchard, he could see that artillery had been hauled through it; there were deep furrows in the ground, and many of the trees had broken limbs, hanging like jackstraws.</p><p>There was a dead man in the orchard. American militia, by his hunting shirt and homespun breeches, lying curled among the gnarled roots of a big apple tree.</p><p>\u201cShould have culled that one,\u201d William said aloud, keeping his voice steady. Old apple trees never yielded much; you took them out after fifteen, twenty years and replanted. He turned away from the body, but not fast enough to avoid seeing the greedy flies rise up in a buzzing cloud from what was left of the face. He walked three paces away and threw up.</p> <p>No doubt it was the cloying smell of rotting apples that rose above the ghost of black powder; the whole orchard hummed with the noise of wasps gorging themselves on the juices. He unwrapped the handkerchief from Jane\u2019s knife and thrust the knife through his belt without looking to see if there were bloodstains on it. He wiped his mouth, then, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, went and laid the handkerchief over the Rebel\u2019s face. Someone had stripped the body; he had neither weapons nor shoes.</p><p>\u201cTHIS DO YOU?\u201d He laid a three-foot length of applewood across the saddlebow. He\u2019d broken it at both ends, so it made a serviceable club, about the thickness of his own forearm.</p><p>Murray seemed to wake from a doze; he drew himself slowly upright, took hold of the club, and nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019ll do,\u201d he said softly. His voice sounded thick, and William looked at him sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best drink some more,\u201d he said, handing up the canteen again. It was getting low; probably no more than a quarter full. Murray took it, though moving sluggishly, drank, and gave it back with a sigh.</p> <p>They walked without conversation for a half hour or so, leaving William time at last to sort through the events of the morning. It was well past noon now; the sun was pressing on his shoulders like a heated flatiron. How far did Rachel say it was it to Freehold? Six miles?</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye want me to tell ye, or no?\u201d Murray said suddenly.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief sound that might have been either amusement or pain.</p><p>\u201cWhether ye\u2019re much like him.\u201d</p><p>Possible responses to this came so fast that they collapsed upon themselves like a house of cards. He took the one on top.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you suppose I should wonder?\u201d William managed, with a coldness that would have frozen most men. Of course, Murray was blazing with such a fever, it would take a Quebec blizzard to freeze him.</p><p>\u201cI would, if it was me,\u201d Murray said mildly.</p><p>That defused William\u2019s incipient explosion momentarily.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you think so,\u201d he said, not trying to hide his annoyance. \u201cYou may know him, but you know nothing whatever about me.\u201d</p><p>This time, the sound was undeniably amusement: laughter, of a hoarse, creaking sort.</p><p>\u201cI helped fish ye out of a privy ten years ago,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThat was when I first kent it, aye?\u201d</p><p>Shock struck William almost dumb, but not quite.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014that . . . that place in the mountains\u2014Fraser\u2019s Ridge . . . ?!\u201d He\u2019d succeeded, for the most part, in forgetting the incident of the snake in the privy, and with it, most of a miserable journey through the mountains of North Carolina.</p> <p>Murray took William\u2019s choler for confusion, though, and chose to elucidate.</p><p>\u201cThe way ye came out o\u2019 the muck, your eyes bleezin\u2019 blue and your face set for murder\u2014that was Uncle Jamie to the life, when he\u2019s roused.\u201d Murray\u2019s head bobbed forward alarmingly. He caught himself and straightened up with a muffled groan.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to fall off,\u201d William said, with elaborate courtesy, \u201cdo it on the other side, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d</p><p>They paced another hundred yards before Murray came to life again, resuming the conversation\u2014if it could be called that\u2014as though there had been no pause.</p><p>\u201cSo when I found ye in the swamp, I kent who ye were. I dinna recall ye thankin\u2019 me for saving your life that time, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me for not strapping you into a travois with a dead panther and dragging you for miles through the dirt now,\u201d William snapped.</p><p>Murray laughed, gasping a little.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d likely do it, if ye had a dead panther.\u201d The effort of laughing seemed to deprive him of balance, and he swayed alarmingly.</p><p>\u201cFall off and I\u2019ll do it anyway,\u201d William said, grabbing him by the thigh to steady him. \u201cDead panther or not.\u201d Christ, the man\u2019s skin was so hot he could feel it through the buckskin leggings.</p><p>Despite his fog, Murray noticed his reaction.</p><p>\u201cYou lived through the fever,\u201d he said, and took a deep breath. \u201cI will, too; dinna fash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by that expression you mean that I ought not to be concerned that you\u2019ll die,\u201d William said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no worrit, either,\u201d Murray assured him. The man wobbled slightly, reins held loose in one hand, and William wondered if he could be sunstruck. \u201cYe promised Rachel, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d William said, adding almost involuntarily, \u201cI owe her and her brother my life, as much as I do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d Murray said agreeably, and fell silent. He seemed to be going a nasty grayish color under the sun-browned skin. This time he stayed silent for a good five minutes before coming suddenly to life again.</p><p>\u201cAnd ye dinna think I ken much about ye, after listening to ye rave wi\u2019 fever for days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not,\u201d William said. \u201cNo more than I think I\u2019ll know a great deal about you by the time I get you to Freehold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe more than ye think. Stop, aye? I\u2019m going to puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d The mule obligingly halted, though it clearly didn\u2019t like either the sound or the smell of what was going on behind its head, and kept sidling round in circles, trying to escape it.</p><p>William waited \u2019til it was over, then handed up his canteen without comment. Murray drained it and handed it back. His hand was shaking, and William began to be worried.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop as soon as I find water,\u201d he said. \u201cGet you into the shade.\u201d Neither of them had a hat; he\u2019d left his in the copse, rolled up with his uniform coat under a bush.</p><p>Murray didn\u2019t reply to this; he was not precisely raving, but seemed to be pursuing a separate conversation in his head.</p><p>\u201cI maybe dinna ken ye that well, but Rachel does.\u201d</p><p>That was undeniably true and gave William an oddly mixed sense of shame, pride, and anger. Rachel and her brother did know him well; they\u2019d saved his life and nursed him back to health, had traveled with him for weeks and shared both food and danger.</p><p>\u201cShe says ye\u2019re a good man.\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s heart squeezed a little.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m obliged for her good opinion,\u201d he said. The water hadn\u2019t helped that much; Murray was definitely swaying in the saddle, his eyes half closed.</p><p>\u201cIf you die,\u201d William said loudly, \u201cI\u2019ll marry her.\u201d</p><p>That worked; Murray\u2019s eyelids lifted at once. He smiled, very slightly.</p><p>\u201cKen that,\u201d he said. \u201cKen I\u2019m no going to die? And, besides, ye owe me a life, Englishman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I saved your bloody life, too; I saved the both of you from that maniac\u2014Bug, was he?\u2014with the ax in Philadelphia. We\u2019re quits.\u201d</p><p>Some interminable time later, Murray roused himself again.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said.</p><p>KEEPING SCORE</p><p>JAMIE SAW THE GREYS out of the house and came back with an air of grim satisfaction. I would have laughed if it hadn\u2019t hurt to do it, but settled for smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cYour son, your nephew, your wife,\u201d I said. \u201cFraser, three; Grey, nil.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a startled look, but then his face truly relaxed for the first time in days. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling better, then,\u201d he said, and, coming across the room, bent and kissed me. \u201cTalk daft to me some more, aye?\u201d He sat down heavily on the stool and sighed, but with relief.</p><p>\u201cMind,\u201d he said, \u201cI havena the slightest idea how I\u2019m going to keep ye, with no money, no commission, and no profession. But keep ye I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo profession, forsooth,\u201d I said comfortably. \u201cName one thing you can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, besides that.\u201d</p><p>He spread his hands on his knees, looking critically at the scars on his maimed right hand.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I could make a living as a juggler or a pickpocket, either. Let alone a scribe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got to write,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have a printing press\u2014Bonnie, by name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aye,\u201d he admitted, a certain light coming into his eyes. \u201cI do. But she\u2019s in Wilmington at the moment.\u201d His press had been shipped from Edinburgh in the care of Richard Bell, who was\u2014presumably\u2014keeping her in trust until her real owner should come to repossess her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go and get her. And then\u2014\u201d But I stopped, afraid to jinx the future by planning too far. It was an uncertain time for everyone, and no telling what the morrow might bring.</p><p>\u201cBut first,\u201d I amended, reaching out to squeeze his hand, \u201cyou should rest. You look as though you\u2019re about to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna talk that sort of daft,\u201d he said, and laughed and yawned simultaneously, nearly breaking his jaw.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cSleep\u2014at least until Lieutenant Bixby shows up again with more cheese.\u201d The American army had withdrawn to Englishtown, some seven miles away, only an hour\u2019s ride. The British army had decamped entirely, but as many of the militia units\u2019 enlistments had expired soon afterward, the roads were still very busy with men going home, mostly afoot.</p><p>He did lie down on his pallet, with surprisingly little protest\u2014a good indication of just how exhausted he really was\u2014and was asleep in seconds.</p><p>I was very tired myself, still very weak and easily exhausted, even by something like the Greys\u2019 visit, and I lay back and dozed, stirring to wakefulness every so often when some sound roused me, but Jamie slept deeply, and it eased my heart to hear his soft, regular snore.</p><p>I woke some time later, hearing a distant knocking below. As I raised my head blearily off the pillow, I heard a voice shouting, \u201cHallo, the house!\u201d and snapped into instant alertness. I knew that voice.</p><p>I glanced quickly down, but Jamie was dead asleep, curled up like a hedgehog. With excruciating slowness, I managed to swing my legs off the bed and\u2014moving like a geriatric tortoise and clinging to the bed frame\u2014took the two steps that brought me to the window, where I clung to the sill.</p><p>There was a handsome bay mule in the dooryard, with a half-naked body laid over the saddle. I gasped\u2014and immediately doubled in pain, but didn\u2019t let go the sill. I bit my lip hard, not to call out. The body was wearing buckskins, and his long brown hair sported a couple of bedraggled turkey feathers.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I breathed, through gritted teeth. \u201cPlease, God, don\u2019t let him be\u2014\u201d But the prayer was answered before I\u2019d finished speaking it; the door below opened, and in the next moment William and Lieutenant Macken walked out and lifted Ian off the mule, put his arms about their shoulders, and carried him into the house.</p><p>I turned, instinctively reaching for my medical bag\u2014and nearly fell. I saved myself by a grab at the bed frame but let out an involuntary groan that brought Jamie up into a crouch, staring wildly about.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . all right,\u201d I said, willing my belly muscles into immobility. \u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s\u2014Ian. He\u2019s come back.\u201d</p><p>Jamie sprang to his feet, shook his head to clear it, and at once went to the window. I saw him stiffen and, clutching my side, followed him. William had come out of the house and was preparing to mount the mule. He was dressed in shirt and breeches, very grubby, and the sun licked his dark chestnut hair with streaks of red. Mrs. Macken said something from the door, and he turned to answer her. I don\u2019t think I made a noise, but something made him look up suddenly and he froze. I felt Jamie freeze, too, as their eyes met.</p><p>William\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, and after a long moment he turned to the mule again, mounted, and rode away. After another long moment, Jamie let out his breath.</p><p>\u201cLet me put ye back to bed, Sassenach,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go and find Denny to put Ian right.\u201d</p><p>I WILL NOT HAVE THEE BE ALONE</p><p>SOMEONE HAD GIVEN HIM laudanum before setting to work on his shoulder. Strange stuff, that. He\u2019d had it before, he thought, a long time ago, though he hadn\u2019t known the name at the time. Now Ian lay on his back, blinking slowly as the drug ebbed from his mind, trying to decide where he was and what was real. He was pretty sure most of what he was looking at right now wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Pain. That was real and something to use as an anchor. It hadn\u2019t entirely gone away\u2014he\u2019d been aware of it, but remotely, as a disagreeable muddy green strand like a stream of dirty water meandering through his dreams. Now that he was awake, though, it was becoming more disagreeable by the minute. His eyes didn\u2019t want to focus yet, but he forced them to roll about in search of something familiar.</p><p>He found it at once.</p><p>Girl. Lass. Ifrinn, what was her\u2014\u201cRachel,\u201d he croaked, and she rose instantly from what she was doing and came to him, her face worried but alight.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d he said again, uncertain, and she took hold of his good hand, pressing it to her bosom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThee is awake, I see,\u201d she said softly, her eyes searching his face. \u201cBut still much fevered, from the heat of thy skin. How does thee feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter for seein\u2019 ye, lass.\u201d He tried to lick his dry lips. \u201cIs there maybe water?\u201d</p><p>She made a small sound of distress that he\u2019d had to ask, and hurried to bring a cup to his lips. It was perhaps the best thing he\u2019d ever tasted, made better by her holding his head in her hand as he drank\u2014he was very dizzy. He didn\u2019t want to stop, but she took the cup away.</p><p>\u201cMore presently,\u201d she promised. \u201cThee must not drink too much, too fast, or thee will vomit. And between the dirt and the blood, thee has made enough mess already,\u201d she said, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cMmphm,\u201d he said, lying back. He was mostly clean, he discovered. Someone had washed away the last of the deer fat and paint, and a good deal of sweat and blood with it. His shoulder was bound up with a poultice of some kind; it smelled tangy and familiar, but his hazy mind was a long way yet from allowing him to think of the name of the herb.</p><p>\u201cDid Auntie Claire bind my arm?\u201d he asked. Rachel glanced at him, her brows furrowing.</p><p>\u201cThy aunt is ill,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cThee remembers I told thee that she was wounded\u2014shot\u2014in the battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, feeling blank and confused. He had no recollection of the last couple of days or of battle. \u201cNo. What\u2014is she all right, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenny removed the ball, and thy uncle Jamie is with her. Both of them say very firmly that she will be well.\u201d Her mouth twitched a bit, halfway between a smile and worry. He did his best to smile back.</p> <p>\u201cThen she\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cUncle Jamie\u2019s a verra stubborn man. Can I have more water?\u201d</p><p>This time he drank more slowly and got more down before she took it away. There was a regular clanging noise somewhere; for a time he had taken it for some phantom of hearing left over from the dreams, but now it ceased for a moment, punctuated by a loud curse.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014where are we?\u201d he asked, beginning to be able to look at things again. His wavering sight convinced him that he was indeed in a tiny cow byre; it was new hay he\u2019d been smelling, and the warm scent of fresh cow dung. He was lying on a blanket spread over a mound of hay, but the cow was absent for the moment.</p><p>\u201cA place called Freehold. The battle was fought nearby; Washington and the army have withdrawn to Englishtown, but a good many wounded soldiers have been given refuge by the inhabitants here. We currently enjoy the hospitality of the local smith, a gentleman named Heughan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The forge. That was the source of the clanging and cursing. He closed his eyes; that helped with the dizziness, but he could see shadows of his dreams on the inside of his eyelids and opened them again. Rachel was still there; that was good.</p><p>\u201cWho won the battle?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>She shrugged, impatient. \u201cSo far as anyone has said anything sensible about it, no one. The Americans are cock-a-hoop at not having been defeated, to be sure\u2014but the British army surely wasn\u2019t, either. All I care about is thee. And thee will be fine,\u201d she said, and laid her hand gently on his forehead. \u201cI say so. And I am as stubborn as any Scot thee cares to name\u2014including thyself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to tell ye something, lass.\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to say that, but the words felt familiar in his mouth, as though he\u2019d said them before.</p><p>\u201cSomething different?\u201d She had been turning away but paused now, looking wary.</p><p>\u201cDifferent? Did I tell ye things while I was . . .\u201d He tried to wave a hand in illustration, but even his good arm was heavy as lead.</p><p>Rachel caught her upper lip between her teeth, regarding him.</p><p>\u201cWho is Geillis?\u201d she asked abruptly. \u201cAnd what in the name of\u2014of goodness did she do to thee?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, startled and yet relieved to hear the name. Yes, that was what he\u2019d been dreaming\u2014oh, Jesus. The relief departed at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d he asked warily.</p> <p>\u201cIf thee doesn\u2019t recall it, I don\u2019t wish to bring it back to thee.\u201d She knelt down by him, skirts rustling.</p><p>\u201cI remember what happened\u2014I just want to ken what I said about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened,\u201d she repeated slowly, watching his face. \u201cIn thy dreams, thee means? Or\u2014\u201d She broke off, and he saw her throat move as she swallowed.</p><p>\u201cLikely both, lass,\u201d he said softly, and managed to reach for her hand. \u201cI spoke of Geillis Abernathy, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee only said \u2018Geillis,\u2019\u201d she said, and covered his hand with both of hers, holding fast. \u201cThee was afraid. And thee called out in pain\u2014but of course thee was in pain, so . . . but then . . . it\u2014whatever thee saw, it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Color rose slowly up her neck and washed her face, and with a slight relapse into the dream, he saw her for an instant as an orchid with a dusky throat into which he could plunge his\u2014He cut that vision off and found that he was breathing fast.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed that thee experienced something other than pain,\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cAye, I did,\u201d he said, and swallowed. \u201cCan I have a bit more water?\u201d</p><p>She gave it to him, but with a fixed look indicating that she didn\u2019t mean to be distracted from his story by his physical needs.</p><p>He sighed and lay back again. \u201cIt was a long time agone, a nighean, and nothing to fash about now. I was taken\u2014kidnapped\u2014for a brief time, when I was maybe fourteen or so. I stayed wi\u2019 a woman named Geillis Abernathy, on Jamaica, until my uncle found me. It wasna very pleasant, but I wasna damaged, either.\u201d</p><p>Rachel raised an elegant brow. He loved to watch her do that, but sometimes more than others.</p><p>\u201cThere were other lads there,\u201d he said, \u201cand they were not so lucky.\u201d For a long time afterward, he\u2019d been afraid to close his eyes at night, because he saw their faces. But they\u2019d faded away, little by little\u2014and now he felt a spasm of guilt because he\u2019d let them go into darkness.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d Rachel said softly, and her hand stroked his cheek. He felt the rasp of his beard stubble as she touched him, and a pleasant gooseflesh ran down his jaw and shoulder. \u201cThee needn\u2019t speak of it. I would not bring it back to thee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said, and swallowed a little easier. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ye\u2014but later. It\u2019s an old story, and one ye dinna need to hear just now. But\u2014\u201d He stopped short and she raised the other brow.</p><p>\u201cBut what I do have to tell ye, lass . . .\u201d And he told her. Much of the previous two days\u2019 events was still a blur, but he recalled vividly the two Abenaki who had hunted him. And what he\u2019d finally done, in the British camp.</p><p>She was silent for so long that he began to wonder whether he\u2019d really waked and had this conversation or was still dreaming.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d he said, shifting uneasily on his bed of prickly hay. The door of the byre was open and there was light enough, but he couldn\u2019t read her face at all. Her gaze rested on his own face, though, hazel-eyed and distant, as though she were looking through him. He was afraid she was.</p><p>He could hear Heughan the smith outside, walking to and fro and making clanking sounds, pausing to apostrophize some uncooperative implement in coarse terms. He could hear his own heart beating, too, an uncomfortable, jerky thump.</p><p>Finally a shiver went over Rachel, as though she shook herself awake, and she put a hand on his forehead, smoothing back his hair as she looked into his eyes, her own now soft and fathomless. Her thumb came down and traced the tattooed line across his cheekbones, very slowly.</p><p>\u201cI think we can\u2019t wait any longer to be married, Ian,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI will not have thee face such things alone. These are bad times, and we must be together.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and all the air went out of him. When he drew breath again, it tasted of peace.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as thee can walk without help,\u201d she said, and kissed him, lightly as a falling leaf.</p><p>THE HOUSE ON CHESTNUT STREET</p><p>THE HOUSE WAS occupied; there was smoke drifting from the west chimney. The door was locked, though, and bolted to boot.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what happened to the old door?\u201d John said to Hal, trying the knob again, just in case. \u201cIt used to be green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knock on this one, you might conceivably get someone to come out and tell you,\u201d Hal suggested. They weren\u2019t in uniform, but Hal was noticeably on edge, and had been since their call on General Arnold.</p><p>The general had been understandably reserved, but civil, and after reading Fraser\u2019s letter over three or four times, had agreed to give them passes to remain in the city and to make such inquiries as they saw fit.</p><p>\u201cWith the understanding,\u201d Arnold had said, a flash of his reputed arrogance showing through the fa\u00e7ade of governorship, \u201cthat if I hear of anything untoward, I\u2019ll have you both arrested and ridden out of the city on a rail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a what?\u201d Hal had said incredulously, he having not encountered this peculiarly American method of making guests feel unwelcome.</p><p>\u201cA rail,\u201d Arnold had repeated, smiling genially. \u201cLong piece of wood? Used for fences, I believe?\u201d</p><p>Hal had turned to John, one eyebrow raised, as though inviting him to translate the speech of some Hottentot randomly encountered. John sighed internally, but did so.</p><p>\u201cAn undesirable person is mounted on the object in question,\u201d he said, \u201cstraddling it. Whereupon a party of men lift either end and set off through the streets with it, decanting the rider outside the city. I believe tar and feathers are sometimes applied as a preliminary gesture, though the physical effects of the rail are generally presumed to be sufficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatten your ball sac like a horse stepped on it,\u201d Arnold said, still smiling. \u201cWon\u2019t do your arse any good, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should imagine not,\u201d Hal said politely. His color was somewhat higher than usual, but he gave no other indication of offense, which Grey thought a reasonable indication\u2014not that he needed one\u2014of the importance of their mission to Hal.</p><p>The sound of the bolt grating free interrupted his recollection. The door swung open, revealing his housekeeper and cook, Mrs. Figg, fowling piece in hand.</p><p>\u201cLord John!\u201d she exclaimed, dropping the gun with a clatter.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d he said, stepping in and picking it up. He smiled, feeling affection well up in his bosom at sight of her\u2014substantial, tidy, and beribboned as always. \u201cIt\u2019s very good to see you again, Mrs. Figg. Allow me to make you acquainted with my brother, the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d Hal said, a wry edge to his voice. \u201cHow do you do, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than Your Grace, by the looks of you,\u201d Mrs. Figg replied, narrowing her eyes at him. \u201cStill breathing, though, I see.\u201d She sounded as though this was not entirely a desirable state of affairs, but Hal smiled broadly at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you manage to bury the silver in time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she replied with dignity, and, turning to John, asked, \u201cYou come to get it, my lord? I can have it dug up right smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not just yet,\u201d John said. He looked round, noting the missing banister railing on the upper landing, the smudged and pockmarked wall by the staircase, and\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to the chandelier?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg sighed and shook her head darkly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be Master William,\u201d she said. \u201cHow is he, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know, Mrs. Figg. I was in some hopes that he might have been here\u2014but I gather not?\u201d</p><p>She looked disturbed at this.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. We\u2019ve not seen him since\u2014well, since the day you went away yourself.\u201d She looked hard at him, taking in everything from the cropped hair to the fading bruises and the undistinguished suit, shook her head and sighed, but then straightened her broad shoulders, determined to be cheerful. \u201cAnd glad we are to see you, sir! And Your Grace,\u201d she added as a definite afterthought. \u201cGo sit yourselves down and I\u2019ll have you up a nice cup of tea in two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have tea?\u201d Hal said, brightening.</p><p>\u201cWe buried the tea chest first thing,\u201d she informed him. \u201cBut I just brought in a brick for Miss Dottie, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDottie\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Mrs. Figg, pleased to be the bearer of good news. \u201cI\u2019ll just step out to the kitchen and fetch her.\u201d</p><p>This proved to be unnecessary, as the sound of the back door opening betokened Dottie\u2019s entrance, carrying an apronful of lumpy objects. These proved to be vegetable marrows from the kitchen garden, which cascaded over the floor in a bouncing flood of green and yellow as she let go the apron in order to leap at her father and embrace him.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d</p><p>For an instant, Hal\u2019s face changed entirely, soft with love, and Grey was surprised and disconcerted to feel tears come to his own eyes. He turned away, blinking, and wandered over to the sideboard, meaning to give them a private moment.</p><p>The silver tea service was gone, of course, but his Meissen porcelain plates were in their accustomed spots on the plate rail. He touched the cool gilt-ribboned border of one, feeling oddly disembodied. And his place shall know him no more.</p><p>But Dottie was talking now to both of them; Grey turned round to her, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re both safe and both here!\u201d Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes sparkling\u2014and Grey\u2019s heart misgave him at the knowledge that this state of happiness would be quenched within the next minute, as soon as Hal told her the reason for their presence. Before any such doom could fall, though, Dottie had seized the reins of the conversation and driven it off in another direction entirely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSince you are here\u2014Uncle John, could we possibly use your house? For the wedding, I mean. Please, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding?\u201d Hal disengaged himself gently and cleared his throat. \u201cYour wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I mean my wedding, Papa. Don\u2019t be silly.\u201d She beamed at her uncle, placing a coquettish hand on his sleeve. \u201cMay we, Uncle John? We cannot be married in a meetinghouse, but we must have witnesses for a proper marriage of Friends, and, really, I\u2019m sure Papa wouldn\u2019t want to see me married in the public room of a tavern. Would you?\u201d she appealed, turning to Hal, whose expression had reverted to its earlier guardedness.</p><p>\u201cWell, certainly you may, my dear,\u201d John said, glancing round his parlor. \u201cAssuming that I retain possession of this place long enough for the marriage to take place. When is the ceremony to be, and how many witnesses will we need to accommodate?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated, tapping a fingernail against her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure. There will be some of the conscientious Friends who, like Denny, have been put out of meeting for joining the Continental army. And some friends\u2014friends in the lowercase, meaning no disrespect\u2014if any are left in Philadelphia. And . . . family?\u201d She hesitated again, looking at her father sideways, from under her lashes. John suppressed a smile.</p><p>Hal closed his eyes and sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll come to your wedding,\u201d he said, opening them with resignation. \u201cAnd so will Henry, if I have to drag him by the scruff of the neck. I suppose Mrs. Woodcock must be invited, too,\u201d he added, with a marked lack of enthusiasm. \u201cBut of course Adam . . . and\u2014and Ben\u2014\u201d</p><p>John thought for a moment that he must tell her now, but his brother\u2019s lips closed, firmed with determination. He didn\u2019t look at John, but John caught the \u201cNot now, for God\u2019s sake. Let her be happy for a bit longer,\u201d as clearly as if it had been spoken aloud.</p> <p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Dottie said with regret, and met her father\u2019s eyes directly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Mama. I did write to her, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you, sweetheart?\u201d Hal said, sounding almost normal. \u201cThat was thoughtful.\u201d He tilted his head at her, though, eyes narrowing a bit. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her color, which had returned to normal, rose again, and she began absently pleating her apron with one hand. \u201cWell. Did you know that Rachel\u2014Denzell\u2019s sister\u2014is affianced to Ian Murray? That\u2019s Mr. James\u2014no, no, we don\u2019t use \u2018Mister,\u2019 sorry\u2014he\u2019s the nephew of James Fraser. You know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d Hal said, in a tone cutting off further amendation. \u201cWho he is, I mean. What are you saying, Dottie? Without embroidery, if you please.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed at him but didn\u2019t appear to be discomposed in the least.</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Rachel and Ian wish to be married as soon as they can, and so do Denny and I. As all the witnesses will be present, why not have both marriages at the same time?\u201d</p> <p>This time, Hal did look at John. Who returned the look, somewhat taken aback.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . well. I suppose that would mean additional guests? Including the aforementioned Mr. Fraser? I\u2019m sure you will excuse my using his title, my dear; I\u2019m accustomed to such social excesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. Rachel says that Mrs. Fraser is enough recovered that they will return to Philadelphia tomorrow or next day. And then of course there\u2019s Fergus and his wife, Marsali, and perhaps the children, and I don\u2019t know if there are other friends who\u2014I don\u2019t think Ian has any Mohawk relations nearby, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three, four, five . . .\u201d John turned and began counting the small gilt chairs that stood rigidly to attention beneath the wainscoting. \u201cI think we shall be somewhat cramped, Dottie, but if\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg cleared her throat. The sound was sufficiently impressive that everyone else stopped talking and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon, gentlemen,\u201d she said, and a faint flush was visible on her round face. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be forward or presuming . . . but so happens that I mentioned to the Reverend Figg about Miss Dottie and Friend Denzell needing a place to be married in.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat, the blush growing deeper beneath her dark skin, so that she bore a surprising resemblance to a just-fired cannonball, Grey thought, charmed by the notion.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . well, the long and the short of it, ma\u2019am and gentlemen, is that the reverend and his congregation would be pleased was you to consider being married in the new church building, you having been so kind as to contribute to it. \u2019Tain\u2019t anyways fancy, mind, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Figg, you are a marvel.\u201d Grey clasped her hands in his, an attention that flustered her to the point of speechlessness. Seeing this, he let go, though this allowed Dottie to swoop in and kiss the housekeeper, exclaiming in gratitude. That was all right, but when Hal took Mrs. Figg by the hand and kissed it, the poor lady was reduced nearly to the point of suffocation and, snatching back her hand, retreated in haste, muttering disjointedly about tea and narrowly avoiding tripping on a marrow.</p><p>\u201cIs it all right to be married in a church?\u201d Hal asked Dottie, once Mrs. Figg had retired to a safe distance. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Jews, is it? We needn\u2019t be circumcised in order to attend? Because if so, I think your guest list may be substantially reduced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not . . .\u201d Dottie began rather vaguely, but her attention was distracted by something seen through the front window. \u201cGoodness, is that . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Not bothering to complete her thought, she flew to the unbolted door and yanked it open, revealing a startled William on the stoop.</p><p>\u201cDottie!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d And then caught sight of John and Hal. William\u2019s face underwent a lightning shift that made a frisson run straight down John\u2019s back to his tailbone. He\u2019d seen that exact expression on Jamie Fraser\u2019s face a hundred times, at least\u2014but had never before seen it on William\u2019s.</p><p>It was the look of a man who doesn\u2019t like his immediate prospects one bit\u2014but who feels himself entirely capable of dealing with them. William stepped inside, repelling by force of will Dottie\u2019s abortive attempt to embrace him. He removed his hat and bowed to Dottie, then, punctiliously, to John and Hal.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am. Sirs.\u201d</p><p>Hal snorted, looking his nephew over from head to toe. William was dressed much as John and Hal were, in ordinary clothes\u2014though clothes of good cut and quality, John observed; clearly his own.</p><p>\u201cAnd where the devil have you been for the last three days, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you mayn\u2019t,\u201d William replied briefly. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for you, for one thing,\u201d John replied equably, before Hal could stick his oar in again. He\u2019d put the fowling piece on the mantel, easily within Hal\u2019s reach, but was reasonably sure it wasn\u2019t loaded. \u201cAnd for Captain Richardson, for another. Have you seen him recently?\u201d</p><p>William\u2019s expression of surprise made John heave an internal sigh of relief. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d William glanced shrewdly from one man to the other. \u201cIs that what you were doing at Arnold\u2019s headquarters? Looking for Richardson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d John answered, surprised. \u201cHow did you\u2014oh. You were watching the place.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI did wonder how you happened to appear here so fortuitously. You followed us from General Arnold\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>William nodded and, stretching out a long arm, drew out one of the chairs from the wall. \u201cI did. Sit down. Things need to be said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds rather ominous,\u201d Dottie murmured. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019d best fetch the brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do, Dottie,\u201d John said. \u201cTell Mrs. Figg we want the \u201957, if you would. If it isn\u2019t buried, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everything of an alcoholic nature is in the well, actually. I\u2019ll fetch it.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg herself arrived at this point with a rattling tea tray, apologizing for the lowly earthenware pot in which the beverage was brewing, and within a few moments, everyone was provided with a steaming cup and a small glass of the \u201957.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sweetheart,\u201d Hal said, accepting a glass from Dottie, then adding pointedly, \u201cYou needn\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you did, Dottie,\u201d William said quietly, but with an overt stare at Hal. \u201cThere are things you ought to know, I think.\u201d</p><p>With no more than a brief glance at her father, Dottie, who had been picking up the scattered squash, sat down on the ottoman, opposite her cousin.</p><p>\u201cTell me, then,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cNothing out of the way,\u201d he assured her, with an assumption of casualness. \u201cI\u2019ve recently discovered that I am the natural son of one James Fraser, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and looked at him with renewed interest. \u201cI did think General Fraser reminded me of someone! Of course, that\u2019s it! Goodness, Willie, you do look like him!\u201d</p><p>William looked flabbergasted, but quickly pulled himself together.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a general?\u201d he asked Hal.</p><p>\u201cHe was,\u201d Hal said. \u201cHe\u2019s resigned his commission.\u201d</p><p>William made a small, humorless noise. \u201cHas he? Well, so have I.\u201d</p><p>After a long silent moment, John placed his cup carefully on its saucer with a small clink.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked mildly, at the same moment that Hal, frowning, said, \u201cCan you do such a thing while technically a prisoner of war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d William said tersely, and evidently in answer to both questions. \u201cBut I\u2019ve done it. Now, as to Captain Richardson . . .\u201d and he recounted his astonishing encounter with Denys Randall-Isaacs on the road.</p><p>\u201cOr, rather, Denys Randall, as he now calls himself. Evidently his stepfather\u2019s a Jew, and he wishes to avoid the association.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSensible,\u201d Hal said briefly. \u201cI don\u2019t know him. What else do you know about him, William? What\u2019s his connection with Richardson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea,\u201d William said, and, draining his cup, reached for the pot and poured another. \u201cThere is one, obviously, and prior to this, I would have assumed that Randall perhaps worked with, or for, Richardson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he still does,\u201d John suggested, a slight edge in his voice. He\u2019d been a spy himself for some years and was disinclined to take things said by known intelligencers at face value.</p><p>That seemed to take William aback for a moment, but he nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he conceded. \u201cBut tell me\u2014why the devil are you two interested in Richardson?\u201d</p><p>They told him.</p><p>At the conclusion, Hal was perched anxiously on the ottoman beside Dottie, an arm round her shaking shoulders. She was weeping silently, and he was dabbing at her face with his handkerchief, this now a grubby rag following its service as a flag of truce.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he was repeating doggedly, for the sixth or seventh time. \u201cDo you hear me, darling, I do not believe it, and I won\u2019t have you believe it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no,\u201d she said obediently. \u201cNo . . . I won\u2019t. Oh, Ben!\u201d</p><p>In some hopes of distracting her, John turned back to William.</p><p>\u201cAnd what business brought you to Philadelphia, may I ask? You can\u2019t have come in search of Captain Richardson, because when you left camp, you didn\u2019t know he\u2019d disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came on a personal matter,\u201d William said, in a tone suggesting that the matter was still personal and was going to remain that way. \u201cBut also . . .\u201d He pressed his lips together for a moment, and again John had that odd sense of dislocation, seeing Jamie Fraser. \u201cI was going to leave this here for you, in case you came back to the city. Or ask Mrs. Figg to send it to New York, if . . .\u201d His voice trailed away, as he pulled a letter from the breast of his dark-blue coat.</p><p>\u201cBut I needn\u2019t now,\u201d he concluded firmly, and put it away again. \u201cIt\u2019s only saying what I\u2019ve already told you.\u201d A slight flush touched his cheekbones, though, and he avoided John\u2019s eye, turning instead to Hal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and find out about Ben,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI\u2019m not a soldier any longer; there\u2019s no danger of my being taken up as a spy. And I can travel much more easily than you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, William!\u201d Dottie took the handkerchief from her father and blew her nose with a small, ladylike honk. She looked at him with brimming eyes. \u201cWill you, really? Oh, thank you!\u201d</p><p>That was not, of course, the end of it. But it was no revelation to Grey that William possessed a stubbornness so obviously derived from his natural father that no one but Hal would even have thought of arguing with him. And even Hal didn\u2019t argue long.</p><p>In due course, William rose to go.</p><p>\u201cGive Mrs. Figg my love, please,\u201d he said to John, and, with a small bow to Dottie, \u201cGoodbye, cousin.\u201d</p><p>John followed him to the door to let him out, but at the threshold put a hand on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cWillie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cGive me the letter.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, William looked a little less than certain. He put his hand to his breast, but left it there, hesitant.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t read it\u2014unless you don\u2019t come back. But if you don\u2019t . . . I want it. To keep.\u201d</p><p>William drew breath, nodded, and, reaching into his coat, removed a sealed cover and handed it over. Grey saw that it had been sealed with a thick daub of candle wax and that William hadn\u2019t used his signet, preferring instead to stamp it with his thumbprint, firm in the hot wax.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said through the lump in his throat. \u201cGodspeed.

I heard Rachel let out her breath as she stopped just inside, looking around.</p><p>\u201cNo flowers?\u201d Mrs. Figg had said the day before, scandalized. \u201cI understand plain, but God made flowers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Friends\u2019 meetinghouse would not have flowers,\u201d Rachel had said, smiling. \u201cWe think them somewhat pagan, and a distraction to worship. But we are thy guests, and surely a guest must not tell his host how to keep his own house.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Figg blinked at the word \u201cpagan,\u201d but then made a low humming noise and settled back into benignity.</p><p>\u201cWell and good, then,\u201d she said. \u201cHis lordship has three good rosebushes, and there\u2019s sunflowers in every yard in town. Lot of honeysuckle, too,\u201d she added thoughtfully. There was; everyone planted honeysuckle by the privy.</p><p>As a nod to the Quakers\u2019 sensibilities, though, there was only one vase of flowers\u2014a very plain glass vase\u2014between the two wooden benches that had been set at the front of the room, and the faint perfume of honeysuckle and pink cabbage roses mingled with the turpentine smell of hot pine boards and the pungent scents of fairly clean but very hot people.</p><p>Rachel and I stepped outside again, joining the rest of what I supposed might be called the wedding party, in the shade under a big lime tree. People were still arriving in ones and twos, and I caught a good many curious looks directed at us\u2014though these were not aimed at the two brides.</p><p>\u201cYou are being married in . . . that?\u201d Hal said, eyeing Dottie\u2019s Sunday-best gown of soft gray muslin with a white fichu and a bow at the back of the waist. Dottie raised one smooth blond brow at him.</p> <p>\u201cHa,\u201d she said. \u201cMummy told me what she wore when you married her in a tavern in Amsterdam. And what your first wedding was like. Diamonds and white lace and St. James\u2019s Church didn\u2019t help all that much, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorothea,\u201d Denzell said mildly. \u201cDon\u2019t savage thy father. He has enough to bear.\u201d</p><p>Hal, who had flushed at Dottie\u2019s remarks, went somewhat redder at Denny\u2019s and breathed in a menacing rasp, but didn\u2019t say anything further. Hal and John were both wearing full dress uniform and far outshone the two brides in splendor. I thought it rather a pity that Hal wouldn\u2019t get to walk Dottie down the aisle, but he had merely inhaled deeply when the form of the marriage was outlined to him and said\u2014after being elbowed sharply in the ribs by his brother\u2014that he was honored to witness the event.</p><p>Jamie, by contrast, did not wear uniform, but his appearance in full Highland dress made Mrs. Figg\u2019s eyes bulge\u2014and not only hers.</p><p>\u201cSweet Shepherd of Judea,\u201d she muttered to me. \u201cIs that man wearing a woolen petticoat? And what sort of pattern is that cloth? Enough to burn the eyes out your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey call it a F\u00e8ileadh beag,\u201d I told her. \u201cIn the native language. In English, it\u2019s usually called a kilt. And the pattern is his family tartan.\u201d</p> <p>She eyed him for a long moment, the color rising slowly in her cheeks. She turned to me with her mouth open to ask a question, then thought better and shut it firmly.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cHe isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cEither way, he\u2019s like to die of the heat,\u201d she predicted, \u201cand so are those two gamecocks.\u201d She nodded at John and Hal, glorious and sweating in crimson and gold lace. Henry had also come in uniform, wearing his more modest lieutenant\u2019s apparel. He squired Mercy Woodcock on his arm and gave his father a stare daring him to say anything.</p><p>\u201cPoor Hal,\u201d I murmured to Jamie. \u201cHis children are rather a trial to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, whose aren\u2019t?\u201d he replied. \u201cAll right, Sassenach? Ye look pale. Had ye not best go in and sit down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m quite all right,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI just am pale, after a month indoors. It\u2019s good to be in the fresh air.\u201d I had a stick, as well as Jamie, to lean on but was feeling quite well, bar a slight stitch in my side, and was enjoying the sensations of mobility, if not the sensation of wearing stays and petticoats in hot weather again. It was going to be even hotter, sitting packed together once the meeting began; the Reverend Mr. Figg\u2019s congregation was there, of course, it being their church, and the benches were filled with bodies.</p><p>The church had no bell, but a few blocks away the bell of St. Peter\u2019s began to toll the hour. It was time, and Jamie, I, and the Grey brothers made our way inside and found our places. The air hummed with murmured conversation and curiosity\u2014the more so at the British uniforms and Jamie\u2019s plaid, though both he and the Greys had left their swords at home, in deference to the Friends\u2019 meeting.</p><p>Both curiosity and conversation rose to a much higher pitch when Ian walked in. He wore a new shirt, white calico printed with blue and purple tulips, his buckskins and breechclout, moccasins\u2014and an armlet made of blue and white wampum shells, which I was reasonably sure that his Mohawk wife, Works With Her Hands, had made for him.</p> <p>\u201cAnd here, of course, is the best man,\u201d I heard John whisper to Hal. Rollo stalked in at Ian\u2019s heel, disregarding the further stir he caused. Ian sat down quietly on one of the two benches that had been set at the front of the church, facing the congregation, and Rollo sat at his feet, scratched himself idly, then collapsed and lay panting gently, surveying the crowd with a yellow stare of lazy estimation, as though judging them for eventual edibility.</p><p>Denzell came in, looking a little pale, but walked up and sat down on the bench beside Ian. He smiled at the congregation, most of whom murmured and smiled back. Denny wore his best suit\u2014he owned two\u2014a decent navy broadcloth with pewter buttons, and while he was both shorter and less ornamental than Ian, did not by any means disappear beside his outlandish brother-in-law-to-be.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no going to be sick, lass?\u201d Jamie said to Rachel. She and Dottie had come in, but hovered near the wall. Rachel\u2019s hands were clenched in the fabric of her skirt. She was white as a sheet, but her eyes glowed. They were fastened on Ian, who was looking at no one but her, his own heart in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCome with me, Dottie.\u201d She held out a hand, and the two girls walked together to the other bench and sat down. Dottie\u2019s color was high, and so was her head. Rachel folded her hands in her lap and resumed looking at Ian. I felt Jamie sigh a little and relax. On Jamie\u2019s far side, Jenny craned to see round him, then smiled with gratification.</p><p>She\u2019d made Rachel\u2019s dress herself, for after the exigencies of recent months, Rachel owned nothing that wasn\u2019t near rags. And while Jenny was generally in favor of modesty in dress, she knew her way around a bustline. The dress was a pale-green chintz with a small pattern of dark-green curling vines, and fitted like a glove. With her dark-brown hair shining loose on her shoulders and hazel eyes huge in her face, Rachel looked like some denizen of the forest\u2014perhaps a tree nymph.</p><p>I was about to share this fancy with Jamie when the Reverend Mr. Figg walked up to the front of the church, turned, and smiled at the congregation.</p><p>\u201cBlessings to you all this day, brothers and sisters!\u201d he said, and was answered by a genial rumble of \u201cBlessings to you, brother!\u201d and discreet \u201cAmens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now.\u201d He glanced from Ian and Denny to the girls, then back to the congregation. \u201cWe\u2019re gathered here for a wedding today. But the ladies and gentlemen being married belong to the Society of Friends, so it will be a Quaker wedding\u2014and that\u2019s maybe a little different from ones you\u2019ve seen before, so I take the liberty of telling you how it goes.\u201d</p><p>A little hum of interest and speculation, which he quieted with one hand. Mr. Figg was small and dapper in black suit and high white stock, but had immense presence, and every ear was tuned attentively to his explanations.</p><p>\u201cWe have the honor to host this meeting\u2014for that\u2019s what the Friends call their worship. And for them, a wedding is just a normal part of meeting. There\u2019s no priest or minister involved; the lady and the gentleman just . . . marry each other, when they feel like it\u2019s the right time.\u201d</p><p>That caused a ripple of surprise, perhaps a little disapproval, and I could see the color rise in Dottie\u2019s cheeks. Mr. Figg turned to smile at the girls, then back to his congregation.</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps one of our Quaker friends might tell us a little bit about their notion of meeting, as I\u2019m sure they know more about it than I do.\u201d He turned expectantly toward Denzell Hunter\u2014but it was Rachel who rose to her feet. Mr. Figg didn\u2019t see her and started with surprise when she spoke behind him, making everyone laugh.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, soft-spoken but clear, when the laughter had died down. \u201cI thank you all for your presence here. For Christ said, \u2018Wherever two or more of you are gathered in my name, there am I.\u2019 And that is all the essence of a meeting of Friends: that Christ may make His presence known among us\u2014and within us.\u201d She spread her hands a little. \u201cSo we gather, and we listen\u2014both to one another and to the light within us. When a person is moved of the spirit to speak, he or she does speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr sing, if thee likes,\u201d Dottie put in, dimpling at John.</p><p>\u201cOr sing,\u201d Rachel agreed, smiling. \u201cBut we do not fear silence, for often God speaks loudest in the quiet of our hearts.\u201d And with that, she sat down again, composed.</p><p>A moment of shuffling and blinking among the crowd was succeeded in fact by an expectant silence\u2014this broken by Denny, who rose deliberately and said, \u201cI am moved to tell you how grateful I am for your gracious use of us. For I was put out of meeting, and my sister with me, for my stated intent to join the Continental army. And for the same reason, we are not welcome as members of Philadelphia meeting.\u201d He glanced at Rachel, light glinting from his spectacles.</p><p>\u201cThis is a grievous thing to a Friend,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFor our meeting is where our lives and souls abide, and when Friends marry, the whole of their meeting must approve and witness the marriage, for the community itself will support the marriage. I have deprived my sister of this approval and support, and I beg she will forgive me.\u201d</p><p>Rachel gave an unladylike snort. \u201cThee followed thy conscience, and if I hadn\u2019t thought thee right, I would have said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my responsibility to take care of thee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee has taken care of me!\u201d Rachel said. \u201cDo I look malnourished? Am I naked?\u201d</p><p>A ripple of amusement ran through the congregation, but neither of the Hunters was noticing.</p><p>\u201cI took thee from thy home and from the meeting that cared for thee and obliged thee to follow me into violence, into an army full of violent men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be me, I expect,\u201d Ian interrupted, clearing his throat. He looked at Mr. Figg, who seemed somewhat stunned, then at the rapt assemblage on the benches. \u201cI\u2019m no a Friend myself, ye ken. I\u2019m a Highlander and a Mohawk, and they dinna come much more violent than that. By rights, I shouldna wed Rachel, and her brother shouldna let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to see him stop me!\u201d said Rachel, sitting bolt upright with her fists curled on her knees. \u201cOr thee, either, Ian Murray!\u201d</p><p>Dottie appeared to be finding the conversation amusing; I could see her struggling not to laugh\u2014and, glancing sideways along the bench in front of me, I could see precisely the same expression on her father\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s on my account that ye couldna be wed in a proper Quaker meeting,\u201d Ian protested.</p><p>\u201cNo more than on mine,\u201d Denny said, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cMea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa,\u201d Jamie murmured in my ear. \u201cD\u2019ye think I should say it\u2019s all my fault, for leaving Ian wi\u2019 the Indians and bein\u2019 a bad example to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if the spirit moves you,\u201d I said, not taking my eyes off the show. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d advise you and the spirit to stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Figg was not disposed to stay out of it. She cleared her throat loudly.</p><p>\u201cNow, pardon me for interrupting, but from what I understand, you Friends think a woman\u2019s equal to a man, is that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Rachel and Dottie said firmly together, and everyone laughed.</p><p>Mrs. Figg flushed like a ripe black plum, but kept her composure. \u201cWell, then,\u201d she said. \u201cIf these ladies want to marry with you gentlemen, why do you think you got any business trying to talk them out of it? Have you maybe got your own reservations about the matter?\u201d</p><p>A distinctly feminine murmur of approval came from the congregation, and Denny, who was still standing, seemed to be struggling for his own composure.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a cock?\u201d came a French-accented whisper from behind me and an unhinged giggle from Marsali in response. \u201cYou can\u2019t get married without a cock.\u201d</p><p>This reminiscence of Fergus and Marsali\u2019s unorthodox wedding on a Caribbean beach made me stuff my lace handkerchief into my mouth. Jamie shook with suppressed laughter.</p><p>\u201cI do have reservations,\u201d Denzell said, taking a deep breath. \u201cThough not,\u201d he added hastily, with a glance at Dottie, \u201cregarding my desire to wed Dorothea or the honor of my intentions toward her. My reservations\u2014and perhaps Friend Ian\u2019s, though I must not speak for him\u2014lie entirely the other way. That is, I\u2014we, perhaps\u2014feel that we must lay bare our failings and limitations as . . . as husbands\u2014\u201d And for the first time, he, too, blushed. \u201cThat Dorothea and Rachel may . . . may come to a proper\u2014er . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they know what they may be getting into?\u201d Mrs. Figg finished for him. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a fine sentiment, Dr. Hunter\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFriend,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cFriend Hunter,\u201d she said, with a minimal roll of the eyes. \u201cBut I tell you two things. One, your young lady probably knows more about you than you do.\u201d More laughter. \u201cAnd two\u2014speaking as a woman with some experience\u2014I can tell you that nobody knows what being married\u2019s going to be like until you find yourself in the midst of it.\u201d She sat down with an air of finality, to a hum of approbation.</p><p>There was a certain amount of glancing to and fro and a sense of movement on the left side of the church, where several men sat together. I had seen them come in, with women who were plainly their wives; the women had separated, though, and gone to sit on the right side of the church, which made me think that they might be Quakers, though there was nothing in their dress that differentiated them from the other workmen and merchants in the congregation. I could see them come to some sort of silent consensus now, and one of them rose.</p><p>\u201cI am William Sprockett,\u201d he said formally, and cleared his throat. \u201cWe have come to speak in support of Friend Hunter. For we also are Friends who have followed the dictates of our conscience to involvement with rebellion and other matters that a Friend would normally seek to avoid. And in consequence . . . have been read out of meeting.\u201d</p> <p>He paused, brow furrowed, evidently not sure how to go on. A small woman in yellow rose on the other side and spoke clearly.</p><p>\u201cWhat my husband seeks to say, friends, is that a man who would not do as his inner light tells him to is no man. And that while a man of conscience can be mighty inconvenient at times, it don\u2019t make him a bad husband.\u201d She smiled at Mr. Sprockett and sat down.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Sprockett gratefully. \u201cAs my wife is kind enough to say, going to fight don\u2019t unfit us for marriage. So we\u2019ve all come\u201d\u2014he swept a broad hand around him, indicating his companions and the wives across the aisle\u2014\u201cto approve and witness thy marriage, Friend Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will support thy marriage, Dorothea,\u201d Mrs. Sprockett put in, with a bob of her head. \u201cAnd thine, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Denny Hunter had remained standing while all this colloquy was going on.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . thank you, Friends,\u201d he said, and sat down abruptly, followed more slowly by the Sprocketts.</p><p>A hush fell upon the room, and for a little while there was no sound but the remote noise of the streets outside. Here and there a cough, the clearing of a throat, but, overall, silence. Jamie laid a hand on mine, and my fingers turned to intertwine with his. I could feel his pulse in my own fingertips, the solid bones of knuckle and phalanges. His right hand, battered and marked with the scars of sacrifice and labor. Marked also with the signs of my love, the crude repairs done in pain and desperation.</p><p>Blood of my blood, bone of my bone . . .</p><p>I wondered whether people who are unhappily married think of their own nuptials when they witness a wedding; I thought that those who are happy always do. Jenny\u2019s head was bowed, her face calm and inward but peaceful; did she think now of Ian and her wedding day? She did; her head turned a little to one side, she laid a hand lightly on the bench and smiled at the ghost who sat by her side.</p><p>Hal and John sat on the bench in front of us, a little to the side, so I could catch glimpses of their faces, so much alike and yet so different. Both of them had been married twice.</p><p>It was a slight shock, in fact, to recall that John\u2019s second marriage had been to me, for he felt entirely separate from me now, our brief partnership seeming so removed in time as almost to be unreal. And then . . . there was Frank.</p> <p>Frank. John. Jamie. Sincerity of intention wasn\u2019t always enough, I thought, looking at the young people on the benches at the front of the church, none of them now looking at one another but staring at their folded hands, the floor, or sitting with closed eyes. Perhaps realizing that, as Mrs. Figg had said, a marriage is made not in ritual or in words but in the living of it.</p><p>A movement pulled me out of my thoughts; Denny had risen to his feet and held out a hand to Dottie, who rose as though mesmerized and, reaching out, clasped both his hands in hers, hanging on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cDoes thee feel the sense of the meeting clear, Dorothea?\u201d he asked softly, and at her nod, spoke:</p><p>\u201cIn the presence of the Lord, and before these our Friends, I take thee, Dorothea, to be my wife, promising, with divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful husband so long as we both shall live.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was low but clearly audible as, face shining, she replied:</p><p>\u201cIn the presence of the Lord, and before these our Friends, I take thee, Denzell, to be my husband, promising, with divine assistance, to be unto thee a loving and faithful wife so long as we both shall live.\u201d</p><p>I heard Hal catch his breath, in what sounded like a sob, and then the church burst into applause. Denny looked startled at this but then broke into a brilliant smile and led Dottie, beaming on his arm, out through the congregation to the back of the church, where they sat close together on the last bench.</p><p>People murmured and sighed, smiling, and the church gradually quieted\u2014but not to its former sense of contemplation. There was now a vibrant sense of expectation, tinged perhaps with a little anxiety, as attention focused on Ian and Rachel\u2014no longer looking at each other but down at the floor.</p> <p>Ian took a breath audible to the back benches, raised his head, and, taking the knife from his belt, laid it on the bench beside him.</p><p>\u201cAye, well . . . Rachel kens I was once married, to a woman of the Wolf clan of the Kahnyen\u2019kehaka. And the Mohawk way of marriage is maybe none so different from the way Friends do it. We sat beside each other before the people, and our parents\u2014they\u2019d adopted me, ken\u2014spoke for us, sayin\u2019 what they kent of us and that we were of good character. So far as they knew,\u201d he added apologetically, and there was a breath of laughter.</p><p>\u201cThe lass I was to wed had a basket on her lap, filled wi\u2019 fruit and vegetables and other bits o\u2019 food, and she said to me that she promised to feed me from her fields and care for me. And I\u2014\u201d He swallowed and, reaching out, laid a hand on his knife. \u201cI had a knife, and a bow, and the skins of some otters I\u2019d taken. And I promised to hunt for her and keep her warm wi\u2019 my furs. And the people all agreed that we should be married, and so . . . we were.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, biting his lip, then cleared his throat and went on.</p><p>\u201cBut the Mohawk dinna take each other for as long as they live\u2014but only for as long as the woman wishes. My wife chose to part wi\u2019 me\u2014not because I hurt or mistreated her, but for . . . for other reasons.\u201d He cleared his throat again, and his hand went to the wampum armlet round his biceps.</p><p>\u201cMy wife was called Wakyo\u2019teyehsnonhsa, which means \u2018Works With Her Hands,\u2019 and she made this for me, as a love token.\u201d Long brown fingers fumbled with the strings, and the strip of woven shells came loose, slithering into his hand. \u201cNow I lay it down, as witness that I come here a free man, that my life and my heart are once more mine to give. And I hope I may be allowed now to give them forever.\u201d</p><p>The blue and white shells made a soft clicking noise as he laid them on the bench. He let his fingers rest on them for a moment, then took his hand away.</p><p>I could hear Hal\u2019s breathing, steady now but with a faint rasp. And Jamie\u2019s, thick in his throat.</p><p>I could feel all sorts of things moving like wraiths in the thick, still air of the church. Sentiment, sympathy, doubt, apprehension . . . Rollo growled very softly in his throat and fell silent, yellow-eyed and watchful at his master\u2019s feet.</p><p>We waited. Jamie\u2019s hand twitched in mine, and I looked up at him. He was looking at Ian, intent, his lips pressed tight, and I knew he was wondering whether to stand up and speak on Ian\u2019s behalf, to assure the congregation\u2014and Rachel\u2014of Ian\u2019s character and virtue. He caught my glance, though, shook his head very slightly, and nodded toward the front. It was Rachel\u2019s part to speak, if she would.</p><p>Rachel sat still as stone, face bleached as bone and her eyes on Ian, burning. But she said nothing.</p><p>Neither did she move, but something moved in her; I could see the knowledge of it cross her face, and somehow her body changed, straightening and settling. She was listening.</p><p>We all listened with her. And the silence kindled slowly into light.</p><p>There was a faint throb in the air then, not quite a sound, and people began to look up, called from the silence. A blur appeared between the benches at the front, and a hummingbird materialized, drawn through the open window, a tiny blur of green and scarlet hovering beside the coral trumpets of the native honeysuckle.</p><p>A sigh came from the heart of the church, and the sense of the meeting was made clear.</p><p>Ian rose, and Rachel came to meet him.</p><p>A CODA IN THREE-TWO TIME</p><p>DENZELL AND DOROTHEA</p><p>IT WAS THE BEST party that Dorothea Jacqueline Benedicta Grey had ever attended. She had danced with earls and viscounts in the most beautiful ballrooms in London, eaten everything from gilded peacock to trout stuffed with shrimp and riding on an artful sea of aspic with a Triton carved of ice brandishing his spear over all. And she\u2019d done these things in gowns so splendid that men blinked when she hove into view.</p><p>Her new husband didn\u2019t blink. He stared at her so intently through his steel-rimmed spectacles that she thought she could feel his gaze on her skin, from across the room and right through her dove-gray dress, and she thought she might burst with happiness, exploding in bits all over the taproom of the White Camel tavern. Not that anyone would notice if she did; there were so many people crammed into the room, drinking, talking, drinking, singing, and drinking, that a spare gallbladder or kidney underfoot would pass without notice.</p><p>Just possibly, she thought, one or two whole people might pass without notice, too\u2014right out of this lovely party.</p><p>She reached Denzell with some difficulty, there being a great many well-wishers between them, but as she approached him, he stretched out a hand and seized hers, and an instant later they were outside in the night air, laughing like loons and kissing each other in the shadows of the Anabaptist Meeting House that stood next door to the tavern.</p><p>\u201cWill thee come home now, Dorothea?\u201d Denny said, pausing for a momentary breath. \u201cIs thee . . . ready?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let go of him but moved closer, dislodging his glasses and enjoying the scent of his shaving soap and the starch in his linen\u2014and the scent of him underneath.</p><p>\u201cAre we truly married now?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI am thy wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Thee is,\u201d he said, his voice slightly husky. \u201cAnd I am thy husband.\u201d</p><p>She thought he\u2019d meant to speak solemnly, but such an uncontainable smile of joy spread across his face at the speaking that she laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t say \u2018one flesh\u2019 in our vows,\u201d she said, stepping back but keeping hold of his hand. \u201cBut does thee think that principle obtains? Generally speaking?\u201d</p><p>He settled his glasses more firmly on his nose and looked at her with intense concentration and shining eyes. And, with one finger of his free hand, touched her breast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it, Dorothea.\u201d</p><p>SHE\u2019D BEEN IN his rooms before. But first as a guest, and then as an assistant, coming up to pack a basket with bandages and ointments before accompanying him to some professional call. It was quite different now.</p><p>He\u2019d opened all the windows earlier and left them so, careless of flying insects and the butcher\u2019s shop down the street. The second floor of the building would have been suffocating after the day\u2019s heat\u2014but with the gentle night breeze coming through, the air was like warm milk, soft and liquid on the skin, and the meaty smells of the butcher\u2019s shop were now overborne by the night perfume of the gardens at Bingham House, two streets over.</p><p>All trace of his profession had been cleared away, and the light of the candle he lit shone serenely on a plainly furnished but comfortable room. Two small wing chairs sat beside the hearth, a single book on the table between them. And, through the open door, a bed fresh-made with a smooth counterpane and plump white pillows beckoned enticingly.</p><p>The blood still thrummed through her body like wine, though she\u2019d had very little to drink. Still, she felt unaccountably shy and stood for a moment just inside the door, as though waiting to be invited in. Denny lit two more candles and, turning, saw her standing there.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said softly, stretching out a hand to her, and she did. They kissed lingeringly, hands roaming slowly, clothes beginning to loosen. Her hand drifted casually down and touched him through his breeches. He drew breath and would have said something, but wasn\u2019t quick enough.</p><p>\u201cOne flesh,\u201d she reminded him, smiling, and cupped her hand. \u201cI want to see thy half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHEE HAS SEEN such things before,\u201d Denny said. \u201cI know thee has. Thee has brothers, for one thing. And\u2014and in the course of . . . of treating wounded men . . .\u201d He was lying naked on the bed, and so was she, fondling the object in question, which seemed to be enjoying the attention immensely. His fingers were sliding through her hair, playing with her earlobes.</p><p>\u201cI hope thee doesn\u2019t think I ever did this to any of my brothers,\u201d she said, sniffing him with pleasure. \u201cAnd those of wounded men aren\u2019t generally in a condition to be appreciated at all.\u201d</p><p>Denny cleared his throat and stretched himself a little, not quite squirming.</p><p>\u201cI think thee should allow me to appreciate thy own flesh for a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf thee expects me to be able to make thee a wife tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked down at his c**k and then at herself, surprised. \u201cWhat do\u2014does thee\u2014mean? Why wouldn\u2019t thee be able to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He looked pleased and eager\u2014he was so young without his glasses\u2014and bounced off the bed, going into the outer room, his bottom pale and tidy in the candlelight. To Dottie\u2019s astonishment, he came back with the book she\u2019d noticed on the table and handed it to her. It was bristling with bookmarks, and as she took it, it fell open in her hands, displaying several drawings of a naked man in cross section, his private parts in various stages of operation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up at Denny in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014I know thee is a virgin; I didn\u2019t want thee to be frightened, or unprepared.\u201d He was blushing like a rose, and instead of collapsing in howls of laughter, which she badly wanted to do, she shut the book gently and took his face between her hands.</p><p>\u201cIs thee a virgin, too, Denny?\u201d she said softly. His blush grew fierce, but he kept her gaze.</p><p>\u201cYes. But\u2014I do know how. I\u2019m a physician.\u201d</p> <p>That was too much, and she did laugh, but in small, half-stifled blurts of giggling, which infected him, and in seconds they were in each other\u2019s arms on the bed, shaking silently, with occasional snorts and repetitions of \u201cI\u2019m a physician,\u201d which sent them into fresh paroxysms.</p><p>At last she found herself on her back, breathing heavily, Denny lying on top of her, and a slick of perspiration oiling them. She lifted a hand and touched his chest, and gooseflesh rippled over him, the dark hairs of his body curly and bristling. She was trembling, but not with either fear or laughter.</p><p>\u201cIs thee ready?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOne flesh,\u201d she whispered back. And they were.</p><p>THE CANDLES had burned down nearly to their sockets, and the naked shadows on the wall moved slowly.</p> <p>\u201cDorothea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee should probably be quiet,\u201d she advised him, briefly removing her mouth in order to talk. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before. Thee wouldn\u2019t want to distract me, now, would thee?\u201d Before he could summon a single word, she had resumed her alarming actions. He groaned\u2014he couldn\u2019t help it\u2014and laid his hands gently, helplessly, on her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called fellatio, did thee know that?\u201d she inquired, pausing momentarily for breath.</p><p>\u201cI did. How . . . I mean . . . Oh. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Her face was beautiful, so flushed that the color showed even by candlelight, her lips deep rose and wet . . .</p><p>\u201cI said\u2014oh, God.\u201d</p> <p>A smile lit her shadowed face with happiness, and her already firm grip on him tightened. His shadow jerked.</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d she said, and with a small, triumphant crow of laughter, bent to slay him with her sharp white teeth.</p><p>IAN AND RACHEL</p><p>IAN LIFTED THE GREEN gown off in a whuff of fabric, and Rachel shook her head hard, shedding hairpins in all directions with little pinging sounds. She smiled at him, her dark hair coming damply down in chunks, and he laughed and plucked out a few more of the little wire hoops.</p><p>\u201cI thought I should die,\u201d she said, running her fingers through her loosened hair, which Jenny had put up before the party at the White Camel tavern. \u201cBetween the pins sticking into my head and the tightness of my stays. Unlace me, will thee\u2014husband?\u201d She turned her back to him but looked over her shoulder, eyes dancing.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought it possible to be more moved in his feelings or more excited in body\u2014but that one word did both. He wrapped one arm around her middle, making her squeak, pulled the knot of her laces loose, and gently bit the back of her neck, making her squeak much louder. She struggled, and he laughed, holding her tighter as he loosened the laces. She was slim as a willow sapling and twice as springy; she squirmed against him, and the small struggle heated his blood still further. If he had had no self-control, he would have had her pinned to the bed in seconds, stays and shift and stockings be damned.</p><p>But he did and let her go, easing the stay straps off her shoulders and the stays themselves over her head. She shook herself again, smoothing down the damp shift over her body, then stood tall, preening for him. Her ni**les stood out hard against the limp fabric.</p><p>\u201cI won thy wager for thee,\u201d she said, passing a hand over the delicate blue satin ribbon threaded through the neck of her shift and fluttering the hem, adorned with embroidered flowers in blue and yellow and rose.</p> <p>\u201cHow did ye hear about that?\u201d He reached for her, pulled her close, and clasped both hands on her arse, bare under the shift. \u201cChrist, ye\u2019ve got a sweet round wee bum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlasphemy, on our wedding night?\u201d But she was pleased, he could tell.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not blasphemy, it\u2019s a prayer of thanksgiving. And who told ye about the wager?\u201d Fergus had bet him a bottle of stout that a Quaker bride would have plain linen undergarments. He hadn\u2019t known, himself, but had had hopes that Rachel wouldn\u2019t feel that pleasing her husband was the same thing as making a vain show for the world.</p><p>\u201cGermain, of course.\u201d She put her own arms around him and clasped him in similar manner, smiling up. \u201cThine is neither wee nor round, but no less sweet, I think. Does thee need help with thy fastenings?\u201d</p><p>He could tell she wanted to, so he let her kneel and unbutton the flies of his breeches. The sight of the top of her dark, disheveled head, bowed earnestly to the task, made him put his hand gently on it, feeling her warmth, wanting the touch of her skin.</p><p>His breeches fell and she stood up to kiss him, her hand caressing his standing c**k as though by afterthought.</p><p>\u201cThy skin is so soft there,\u201d she said against his mouth. \u201cLike velvet!\u201d</p><p>Her touch wasn\u2019t tentative but very light, and he reached down and wrapped his fingers round hers, showing her the way of it, how to grasp it firmly and work it a bit.</p><p>\u201cI like it when thee moans, Ian,\u201d she whispered, pressing closer and working it more than a bit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thee is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only breathin\u2019 a bit. Here . . . I like that . . . but . . . here.\u201d Swallowing, he picked her up\u2014she made a little whoop\u2014and carried her the two steps to the bed. He dropped her onto the mattress\u2014she made a louder whoop\u2014and landed beside her, scooping her into his arms. There was a certain amount of writhing, giggling, and inarticulate noises, and she got him out of his calico shirt, while he had her shift pulled up at the bottom and down at the top but still puddled round her waist.</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d she said, wiggling the wadded shift down over her hips and kicking it off.</p><p>\u201cYe think that, do ye?\u201d He bent his head and took her nipple in his mouth. She made a very gratifying noise and clutched his head. He butted her gently under the chin, then lowered his head and sucked harder, flicking his tongue like an adder\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI like it when ye moan, Rachel,\u201d he said, pausing for breath and grinning down at her. \u201cD\u2019ye want me to make ye scream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, breathless, one hand on her wet nipple. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bit.\u201d He\u2019d paused to breathe, lifting himself above her to let a bit of air in between them\u2014it was a small room, and hot\u2014and she reached up to feel his chest. She rubbed a thumb lightly over his nipple, and the sensation shot straight down to his cock.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d she said softly, and lifted herself, a hand round his neck, and suckled him, very gently.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said hoarsely, bracing himself against her weight. \u201cHarder. Teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeeth?\u201d she blurted, letting go.</p><p>\u201cTeeth,\u201d he said breathlessly, rolling onto his back and pulling her on top. She drew breath and lowered her head, hair spilling across his chest.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee said teeth.\u201d She sat up anxiously. \u201cOh, Ian, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt thee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014ye didn\u2019t . . . well, ye did, but . . . I mean\u2014do it again, aye?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, dubious, and it occurred to him that when Uncle Jamie told him to go slow and gentle with his virgin, it might not have been all to do with sparing the virgin.</p><p>\u201cHere, mo nighean donn,\u201d he said, drawing her down beside him. His heart was hammering and he was sweating. He brushed the hair back from her temple and nuzzled her ear. \u201cSlow for a bit, aye? Then I\u2019ll show ye what I mean by teeth.\u201d</p><p>IAN SMELLED OF wine and whisky and musky male skin\u2014he burned astonishingly under her hands and smelled now something like a distant skunk, but in a much better way. She pressed her face into the curve of his shoulder, breathing him in with pleasure. She had his c**k in her hand, gripping firmly . . . but curiosity made her loose her hold and grope lower, fingers probing through the thickness of his pubic hair. He breathed out very suddenly when she cupped his scrotum, and she smiled against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDoes thee mind, Ian?\u201d she whispered, rolling the lovely egg-like shapes of his balls in her palm. She\u2019d seen male scrota many times, baggy and wrinkled, and while she wasn\u2019t disgusted, had never thought them more than mildly interesting. This was wonderful, drawn up tight, the skin so soft and so hot. Daring, she scooted down a little and felt farther back between his legs.</p><p>He had an arm about her shoulders and it tightened, but he didn\u2019t tell her to stop, instead spreading his legs a little, allowing her to explore him. She\u2019d wiped men\u2019s arses hundreds of time, and the fleeting thought occurred to her that not all of them took great care . . . but his hair was curly and very clean, and her hips moved against him involuntarily as her fingertip slid tentatively between his bu**ocks. He twitched, tensing involuntarily, and she stopped, feeling him shiver. Then she realized that he was laughing, shaking silently.</p><p>\u201cAm I tickling thee?\u201d she asked, raising up on one elbow. The light of the single candle flickered over his face, hollowing his cheeks and making his eyes shine as he smiled up at her.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s one word for it.\u201d He ran a hand half roughly up her back and gripped her by the nape. He shook his head slowly, looking at her. His hair had come loose from its binding and spread out dark behind his head. \u201cHere I am, tryin\u2019 to go slow, tryin\u2019 to be gentle . . . and next thing I ken, ye\u2019re squeezin\u2019 my balls and stickin\u2019 your fingers up my arse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that wrong?\u201d she asked, feeling a slight qualm. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be . . . er, too . . . bold?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her down and hugged her close.</p><p>\u201cYe canna be too bold wi\u2019 me, lass,\u201d he whispered in her ear, and ran his own hand down her back\u2014and down farther. She gasped.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he whispered, and went on\u2014slowly. \u201cI thought\u2014ye\u2019d maybe be scairt at first. But ye\u2019re no scairt a bit, are ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m t-terrified.\u201d She felt the laughter bubble up through her chest, but there was some truth in it, too\u2014and he heard that. His hand stopped moving and he drew back enough to look at her, squinting a little.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . not terrified, exactly. But\u2014\u201d She swallowed, suddenly embarrassed. \u201cI just\u2014this is so nice. But I know when you\u2014when we\u2014well, it does hurt, the first time. I\u2014I\u2019m somewhat afraid that . . . well, I don\u2019t want to stop what we\u2019re doing, but I . . . I\u2019d like to get that part over with, so I needn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver with,\u201d he repeated. His mouth twitched a bit, but his hand was gentle on the small of her back. \u201cWell, then.\u201d He eased his other hand down and cupped her, very delicately, between the legs.</p><p>She was swollen there, and slippery\u2014had been growing more so ever since he\u2019d lifted her gown off over her head. His fingers moved, one and then two, playing, stroking . . . and . . . and . . .</p><p>It took her entirely by surprise, a feeling she knew but bigger, bigger, and then she gave way to it entirely, washed through with ecstasy.</p><p>She settled slowly into limpness, throbbing. Everywhere. Ian kissed her lightly.</p><p>\u201cWell, that didna take verra long, did it?\u201d he murmured. \u201cPut your hands on my arms, mo chridhe, and hold on.\u201d He moved over her, agile as a big cat, and eased his c**k between her legs, sliding slow but firm. Very firm. She flinched, clenching involuntarily, but the way was slick and her flesh swollen in welcome and no amount of resistance would keep him out.</p><p>She realized that her fingers were digging into his arms, but didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting ye?\u201d he said softly. He\u2019d stopped moving, his full length inside her, stretching her in a most unnerving way. Something had torn, she thought; it burned a little.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, breathless. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . mind.\u201d</p><p>He lowered himself very slowly and kissed her face, her nose, her eyelids, lightly. And all the time the awareness of it\u2014him\u2014inside her. He pulled back a little and moved. She made a small, breathless noise, not quite protest, a little pain, not quite encouragement . . .</p><p>But he took it as that and moved more strongly.</p><p>\u201cDinna be worrit, lass,\u201d he said, a little breathless, too. \u201cI won\u2019t take long, either. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>ROLLO WAS snoring in the corner, lying on his back for coolness, legs folded like a bug\u2019s.</p><p>She tasted faintly sweet, of her own musk and a trace of blandness with an animal tang that he recognized as his own seed.</p><p>He buried his face in her, breathing deep, and the slight salt taste of blood made him think of trout, fresh-caught and barely cooked, the flesh hot and tender, pink and slick in his mouth. She jerked in surprise and arched up into him, and he tightened his hold on her, making a low hmmm of reassurance.</p><p>It was like fishing, he thought dreamily, hands under her hips. Feeling with your mind for the sleek dark shape just under the surface, letting the fly come down just so . . . She drew her breath in, hard. And then engagement, the sudden sense of startlement, and then a fierce awareness as the line sprang taut, you and the fish so focused on each other that there was nothing else in the world . . .</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he whispered, and ceased to think, only feeling the small movements of her body, her hands on his head, the smell and taste of her, and her feelings washed through him with her murmured words.</p><p>\u201cI love thee, Ian. . . .\u201d</p><p>And there was nothing else in the world but her.</p><p>JAMIE AND CLAIRE</p><p>THE LIGHT OF a low yellow half-moon shone through gaps in the trees, glimmering on the dark rushing waters of the Delaware. So late at night, the air was cool by the river, very welcome to faces and bodies heated by dancing, feasting, drinking, and generally being in close proximity to a hundred or so other hot bodies for the last six or seven hours. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bridal couples had escaped fairly early: Denzell and Dottie very inconspicuously, Ian and Rachel to the raucous shouts and indelicate suggestions of a roomful of festive wedding guests. Once they\u2019d left, the party had settled down to serious merrymaking, the drinking now unhampered by the interruption of wedding toasts.</p><p>We\u2019d taken our leave of the Grey brothers\u2014Hal, as father of one of the brides, was hosting the party\u2014sometime after midnight. Hal had been sitting in a chair near a window, very drunk and wheezing slightly from the smoke, but sufficiently composed as to stand and bow over my hand.</p><p>\u201cYou want to go home,\u201d I advised him, hearing the faint squeak of his breathing over the winding-down noises of the party. \u201cAsk John if he\u2019s got any more ganja, and if he does, smoke it. It will do you good.\u201d And not only in a physical way, I thought.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your kind advice, madam,\u201d he said dryly, and, too late, I recalled our conversation the last time he had been exposed to ganja: his worry over his son Benjamin. If he thought of it, too, though, he said nothing, and merely kissed my hand and nodded to Jamie in farewell.</p> <p>John had stood by his brother\u2019s side most of the evening and stood behind him now as we took our leave. His eyes met mine briefly, and he smiled but didn\u2019t step forward to take my hand\u2014not with Jamie at my shoulder. I wondered now briefly if I should ever see either of the Greys again.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t gone back to the printshop but had wandered down by the river, enjoying the coolness of the night air and chatting about the young couples and the excitements of the day.</p><p>\u201cI imagine their nights are bein\u2019 a bit more exciting still,\u201d Jamie remarked. \u201cReckon the lassies will be sore come morning, poor wee things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it may not be just the girls,\u201d I said, and he sniffed with amusement.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, ye may be right about that. I seem to recall wakin\u2019 the next morning after our wedding and wondering for a moment whether I\u2019d been in a fight. Then I saw you in the bed wi\u2019 me and knew I had.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t slow you down any,\u201d I remarked, dodging a pale stone in my path. \u201cI seem to recall being rather rudely awakened next morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude? I was verra gentle with ye. More than ye were with me,\u201d he added, a distinct grin in his voice. \u201cI told Ian so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Ian what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he wanted advice, and so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvice? Ian?\u201d To my certain knowledge, the boy had begun his sexual career at the age of fourteen, with a prostitute of similar age in an Edinburgh brothel, and hadn\u2019t looked back. Besides his Mohawk wife, there were at least half a dozen other liaisons that I knew of, and I was sure I didn\u2019t know them all.</p><p>\u201cAye. He wanted to know how to deal kindly wi\u2019 Rachel, her bein\u2019 virgin. Something new to him,\u201d he added wryly.</p> <p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019ll be having an interesting night of it, then\u2014all of them.\u201d I told him about Dottie\u2019s request in camp, Rachel\u2019s advent, and our ad hoc session of premarital counseling.</p><p>\u201cYe told them what?\u201d He snorted with amusement. \u201cYe make me say, \u2018Oh, God,\u2019 all the time, Sassenach, and it\u2019s mostly not to do wi\u2019 bed at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it if you\u2019re naturally disposed to that expression,\u201d I said. \u201cYou do say it in bed with no little frequency. You even said it on our wedding night. Repeatedly. I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, little wonder, Sassenach, wi\u2019 all the things ye did to me on our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I did to you?\u201d I said, indignant. \u201cWhat on earth did I do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe bit me,\u201d he said instantly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I did not! Where?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere and there,\u201d he said evasively, and I elbowed him. \u201cOh, all right\u2014ye bit me on the lip when I kissed ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall doing that at all,\u201d I said, eyeing him. His features were invisible, but the moonglow off the water as he walked cast his bold, straightnosed profile in silhouette. \u201cI remember you kissing me for quite a long time while you were trying to unbutton my gown, but I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t bite you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully, and ran a hand lightly down my back. \u201cIt was later. After I went out to fetch ye some food, and Rupert and Murtagh and the rest all chaffed me. I know, because it was when I drank some o\u2019 the wine I\u2019d fetched back, I noticed it burned the cut in my lip. And I bedded ye again before I got round to the wine, so it must ha\u2019 been that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d I said. \u201cBy that time, you wouldn\u2019t have noticed if I\u2019d bitten your head off like a praying mantis. You\u2019d got it properly up your nose and thought you knew everything.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm round my shoulders, pulled me close, and whispered in my ear, \u201cI\u2019d got it properly up you, a nighean. And ye weren\u2019t noticing all that much yourself, besides what was goin\u2019 on between your legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather hard to ignore that sort of carry-on,\u201d I said primly.</p><p>He gave the breath of a laugh and, stopping under a tree, gathered me in and kissed me. He had a lovely soft mouth.</p><p>\u201cWell, I willna deny ye taught me my business, Sassenach,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd ye made a good job of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou caught on reasonably quickly,\u201d I said. \u201cNatural talent, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was a matter of special training, Sassenach, the human race would ha\u2019 died out long since.\u201d He kissed me again, taking more time over it.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think Denny kens what he\u2019s about?\u201d he asked, letting go. \u201cHe\u2019s a virtuous wee man, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure he knows everything he needs to,\u201d I protested. \u201cHe\u2019s a physician, after all.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave a cynical laugh.</p><p>\u201cAye. While he may see the odd whore now and then, it\u2019s likely in the way of his profession, not hers. Besides . . .\u201d He moved close and, putting his hands through the pocket slits in my skirt, took a firm and interesting grip on my bottom. \u201cDo they teach ye in medical college how to spread your wife\u2019s wee hams and lick her from tailbone to navel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t teach you that one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed ye didn\u2019t. And you\u2019re a physician, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014I\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t make any sense. Are you drunk, Jamie?\u201d \u201cDinna ken,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure you are, Sassenach. Let\u2019s go home,\u201d he whispered, leaning close and drawing his tongue up the side of my neck. \u201cI want ye to make me say, \u2018Oh, God,\u2019 for ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat . . . could be arranged.\u201d I\u2019d cooled down during our walk, but the last five minutes had lit me like a candle, and if I\u2019d wanted to go home and take off my stays before, I was now wondering whether I could wait that long.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, pulling his hands out of my skirt. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll see what I can make you say, mo nighean donn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee if you can make me say, \u2018Don\u2019t stop.\u2019\u201d</p><p>PART SIX</p><p>The Ties That Bind</p><p>THE BODY ELECTRIC</p><p>Redondo Beach, CA</p><p>December 5, 1980</p><p>IF SHE HADN\u2019T NEEDED stamps, she wouldn\u2019t have stopped in at the post office. She\u2019d have clipped this batch of letters to the mailbox for the postman to collect, or posted them in the corner mailbox when she took the kids down to the beach to look for pelicans.</p><p>But she did need stamps; there were at least a dozen more niggling things to deal with: things needing notarization or photocopies or tax returns or . . .</p><p>\u201cS-word,\u201d she muttered, sliding out of the car. \u201cBloody F-wording S-word!\u201d This was small relief to her feelings of anxiety and oppression. It really wasn\u2019t fair. Who needed the relief of occasional bad language more than a mother of small children?</p><p>Maybe she should start using her mother\u2019s \u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ!\u201d instead. Jem had incorporated that one into his own collection of expletives before he turned four and had long since taught it to Mandy; they wouldn\u2019t be warped by hearing it.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been this hard, last time. Well, no, she corrected herself. It had been a lot harder, in the most important respect. But this . . . this . . . this quagmire of pettifogging details\u2014property, bank accounts, leases, notifications . . . She flicked the sheaf of sealed envelopes in her hand against her thigh with irritation. Some days, she would have taken Jem and Mandy by their hands and run, not walked, straight into the stones with no feeling save relief at abandoning all this bloody Stuff.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t really had much Stuff when she did it the first time. And, of course, she\u2019d had someone to leave it with. Her heart squeezed a little, remembering the day she\u2019d nailed down the lid on the wooden shipping crate that held her family\u2019s modest history: the silver passed down through her father\u2019s family, cabinet photographs of her mother\u2019s parents, the collection of her father\u2019s first editions, her mother\u2019s World War II Queen Alexandra uniform cap, still with a faint but detectible odor of iodine about it. And taken such pains in writing the note to Roger to go with it: You told me once that . . . everyone needs a history. This is mine. . . .</p><p>Almost sure then that she\u2019d never see Roger again, let alone the silverware.</p><p>She blinked hard and shoved the door of the post office open with so much force that it crashed into the wall, and everyone in the lobby turned to stare at her. Hot-faced, she grabbed the doorframe and closed it with exaggerated care, then crossed the lobby soft-footed, avoiding all eyes.</p><p>She shoved the envelopes through the collection-box slot one by one, with a certain feeling of grim satisfaction at each tedious thing disposed of. Preparing to disappear into the past, leaving all Stuff behind, was one thing; preparing to disappear while thinking that you might eventually come back and need that Stuff again\u2014or that your children might come back twenty years later, without you . . . She swallowed. That was something else again, as her father was inclined to say. She couldn\u2019t just dump it all on Uncle Joe; he didn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>She turned, glancing across the lobby automatically at her PO box, and stopped, seeing the letter. She felt the hairs rising on her forearm as she strode across the grubby linoleum and reached for the knob, even before her mind had consciously registered the fact that it didn\u2019t look like a utility bill, a credit-card application, or any other sort of official mail.</p><p>G-H-I-D-E-I . . . the tumblers of the combination lock fell and the heavy little door swung open. And right there in the post office, she smelled heather and peat smoke and the breath of the mountains, so strongly that her eyes blurred and her own breath caught in her throat.</p><p>It was a regular white envelope, addressed to her in Joe Abernathy\u2019s round, capable hand. She could feel something inside it, another envelope, this one with a lump on it\u2014a seal of some kind? She made it to her rented car before ripping it open.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an envelope but a sheet of paper, folded and sealed with wax, blurs of black ink bleeding through the paper where a quill had scratched too deep. An eighteenth-century letter. She pressed it to her face, inhaling, but the scent of smoke and heather was gone\u2014if it had ever been there. It smelled now only of age and brittle paper; not even the tang of the iron-gall ink was left.</p><p>There was a brief note from Uncle Joe, a slip of paper folded next to the letter.</p><p>Bree, darlin\u2019\u2014</p><p>Hope this catches you in time. It came from the estate agent in Scotland. He said when the new tenant at Lallybroch went to put the furniture in storage, they couldn\u2019t get that big old desk through the door of the study. So they called an antiques guy to take the thing apart\u2014very carefully, he assured me. And when they did, they found three Queen Victoria stamps and this.</p><p>I didn\u2019t read it. If you haven\u2019t left yet, let me know if you want the stamps; Lenny Jr. collects them and will give them a good home, if not.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Uncle Joe</p><p>She folded the note carefully, pressing the creases, tucking it into her handbag. She felt as though she ought to go somewhere else to read the letter, somewhere private and quiet, so she could go to pieces without anyone noticing. The seal was sooty gray candle wax, not sealing wax, and Roger had sealed it with his thumbprint. It wasn\u2019t necessary\u2014she\u2019d recognized the writing immediately\u2014but there was no doubt of the tiny hook-shaped scar left when a scaling knife had slipped while he was cleaning a salmon he and Jem had caught in Loch Ness. She\u2019d kissed it while the cut was healing, and a dozen times since.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t wait and, hands trembling, opened her pocketknife and carefully pried off the seal, trying not to break it. It was old and brittle; the candle grease had seeped into the paper over the years, making a shadow around the glob of wax, and it shattered in her hand. She clutched the fragments convulsively and turned the folded paper over.</p><p>Brianna Randall Fraser MacKenzie, he\u2019d written on the front. To be kept until called for.</p><p>That made her laugh, but the sound came out as a sob, and she dashed the back of her hand across her eyes, desperate to read.</p><p>The very first words made her drop the letter as though it were on fire.</p><p>November 15, 1739</p><p>She snatched it back up. Lest she somehow miss it, he\u2019d underlined 1739.</p><p>\u201cHow in bloody hell did you\u2014\u201d she said aloud, and clapped a hand over her mouth, where she kept it as she read the rest.</p><p>My Dearest Heart,</p><p>I know what you\u2019re thinking, and I don\u2019t know.

I recognized the information on them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We (Buck is still with me) have been searching for Jem since our arrival and have found no sign at all.

She\u2019d been composing bits of this in her mind all day and so began with no difficulty.</p> <p>There was no telling how old the kids might be when\u2014or if\u2014they read it, so she made no effort to simplify things. It wasn\u2019t a simple matter.</p><p>A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR TIME TRAVELERS\u2014PART II</p><p>Right. Dad\u2019s written down what we think we know about this, in terms of observation of occurrence, physical effects, and morality. This next part could best be described as preliminary hypotheses of cause: how time travel might work. I\u2019d call it the scientific part, but you can\u2019t actually apply the scientific method very far with the scanty data we have available.</p><p>Any scientific approach starts with observations, though, and we have enough of those to maybe construct a rough series of hypotheses. Testing those . . .</p><p>The idea of testing those made Brianna\u2019s hand shake so badly that she was obliged to set down her pen and breathe slowly for two or three minutes, until the black spots stopped swarming in front of her eyes. Gritting her teeth, she wrote:</p><p>Hypothesis 1: That the time passages/vortices/whatever the bloody hell they are/ are caused by or occur at the crossing of ley lines. (Defined here as lines of geomagnetic force, rather the folkloric definition of straight map lines drawn between ancient structures like hill forts, henges, or places of ancient worship, like saints\u2019 pools. Supposition is that folkloric lines may be identical or parallel with geomagnetic lines, but no hard evidence to this effect.)</p> <p>Evidence in Support of Hypothesis: Some. But to start with, we don\u2019t know whether the standing stones are part of the vortex thingy or just markers set up when ancient people saw other ancient people step on the grass right . . . there . . . and poof!</p><p>\u201cPoof,\u201d she muttered to herself, and reached for the glass of wine. She\u2019d planned to drink it as a reward when she\u2019d finished, but at the moment felt more in need of first aid than reward. \u201cI wish it was just poof.\u201d One sip, two, then she set it down, the citric edge of the wine lingering pleasantly on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhere were we? Oh, poof . . .\u201d</p><p>Dad was able to connect a lot of the folkloric leys to standing stone circles. It would theoretically be possible to check the geomagnetic polarity of the rock around standing stone circles; that should actually go some way toward supporting Hypothesis 1, but might be a little difficult to execute. That is, you can measure the earth\u2019s magnetic field\u2014Carl Friedrich Gauss figured out how to do it back in 1835 or so\u2014but it isn\u2019t the sort of thing individuals do much.</p><p>Governments that do geological surveys have the equipment for it; I know the British Geological Survey\u2019s Eskdalemuir Observatory does, because I saw a write-up on them. And I quote: \u201cSuch observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther human activities,\u201d she muttered. \u201cRiiight . . .\u201d</p><p>The army does this sort of thing, too, she wrote as an afterthought. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll get the army right on that. . . .\u201d</p><p>The pen hovered over the page as she thought, but she couldn\u2019t add anything else useful there, and so went on:</p> <p>Hypothesis 2: That entering a time vortex with a gemstone (preferably faceted, vide remarks made by Geillis Duncan to this effect) offers some protection to the traveler in terms of physical effect.</p><p>Query: why facets? We used mostly unfaceted ones coming back through Ocracoke, and we know of other travelers using plain unfaceted ones.</p><p>Speculation: Joe Abernathy told me about one of his patients, an archaeologist who told him about some study done on standing stones up in Orkney, where they discovered that the stones have interesting tonal qualities; if you strike them with wooden sticks or other stones, you get a kind of musical note. Any kind of crystal\u2014and all gems have a crystalline interior structure\u2014has a characteristic vibration when struck; that\u2019s how quartz watches work.</p><p>So what if the crystal you carry has vibrations that respond to\u2014or stimulate, for that matter\u2014vibrations in the standing stones nearby? And if they did . . . what might be the physical effect? D.B.K.*</p><p>She made a swift note at the bottom of the page: *D.B.K.\u2014Don\u2019t Bloody Know, and returned to her writing.</p><p>Evidence: There really isn\u2019t any, other than the aforesaid remarks from Geillis Duncan (though she may have noted some anecdotal material in her journals, which you\u2019ll find in the large safe-deposit box at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh. Uncle Joe will have the key or will have made provisions for you to get it).</p><p>NB: Grannie Claire traveled the first two times without any stones (though note that she was wearing a gold wedding ring the first time, and a gold and a silver ring on the second journey).</p><p>Grannie said that going with a stone seemed slightly easier\u2014but given the subjectivity of the experience, I don\u2019t know how much weight to put on that. Doing it with a stone is the most horrible thing I . . .</p><p>Maybe better not to say that. She hesitated for some time, but, after all, her own experiences were data, and given how little there was of it . . . She finished the sentence, then went on.</p><p>Hypothesis 3: That traveling with a gemstone allows one better control in choosing where/when to emerge.</p><p>She stopped, frowning, and crossed out where. There wasn\u2019t any indication of people traveling between sites. Be bloody handy if they could, though. . . . She sighed and went on.</p><p>Evidence: Pretty sketchy, owing to lack of data. We know of a few travelers other than ourselves, and of these, five Native Americans (part of a political group called the Montauk Five) traveled with the use of stones. One of these is known to have died in the attempt, one survived and traveled back about 200 years, and another, a man named Robert Springer (aka \u201cOtter-Tooth\u201d), traveled back more than the usual distance, arriving (approximately) 250\u2013260 years prior to his year of departure. We don\u2019t know what happened to the two other members of this group; they may have traveled to a different time and we haven\u2019t found any mention of them (difficult to track down a time traveler, if you don\u2019t know when they may have gone, what their real names are, or what they look like), may have been blown out of the time vortex for unknown reasons, or may have died inside it.</p><p>That little possibility unnerved her so much that she set down the pen and took several large swallows of wine before resuming.</p><p>By the evidence of Otter-Tooth\u2019s journal, these men all did travel with gemstones, and he procured a large opal with which he intended to make the return trip. (This is the stone Jemmy made explode, in North Carolina, presumably because fire opals have a high water content.)</p><p>It hadn\u2019t\u2014and, thinking back, she couldn\u2019t imagine how it hadn\u2019t\u2014occurred to her at the time to see whether Jemmy could make water boil by touching it. Well, she could see why it hadn\u2019t occurred to her, in retrospect; the last thing she\u2019d wanted was any more dangerous peculiarity near her children, much less dangerous peculiarities being inherent in them.</p><p>\u201cI wonder how often it happens that two time travelers marry each other?\u201d she said aloud. No telling what the frequency of the gene\u2014if it was a gene, but that looked to be a decent bet\u2014in the general population was, but it couldn\u2019t be very common, or people would be walking into Stonehenge and Callanish and going poof! on a daily basis. . . . \u201cSomebody would have noticed,\u201d she concluded, and sat twiddling the pen for a bit in meditation.</p><p>Might she have met and married Roger if it weren\u2019t for the time-traveling thing? No, because it was her mother\u2019s need to find out what had happened to the men of Lallybroch that had led them to Scotland.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sorry,\u201d she said aloud to Roger. \u201cIn spite of . . . everything.\u201d</p><p>She flexed her fingers and picked up the pen, but didn\u2019t write at once. She hadn\u2019t thought further with her hypotheses and wanted them to be clear in her mind, at least. She had vague notions about how a time vortex might be explained in the context of a unified field theory, but if Einstein couldn\u2019t do it, she didn\u2019t think she was up to it right this minute.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be in there somewhere, though,\u201d she said aloud, and reached for the wine. Einstein had been trying to form a theory that dealt both with relativity and electromagnetism, and plainly they were dealing with relativity here\u2014but a sort in which it maybe wasn\u2019t the speed of light that was limiting. What, then? The speed of time? The shape of time? Did electromagnetic fields crisscrossing in some places warp that shape?</p><p>What about the dates? Everything they thought they knew\u2014precious little as it was\u2014indicated that travel was easier, safer, on the sun feasts and fire feasts; the solstices and equinoxes. . . . A little ripple ran up her back. A few things were known about standing stone circles, and one of the common things was that many had been built with astronomical prediction in mind. Was the light striking a specific stone the signal that the earth had reached some planetary alignment that affected the geomagnetism of that area?</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d she said, and sipped, flipping back over the pages she\u2019d written. \u201cWhat a hodgepodge.\u201d This wouldn\u2019t do anyone much good: nothing but disconnected thoughts and things that didn\u2019t even qualify as decent speculation.</p><p>Still, her mind wouldn\u2019t let go of the matter. Electromagnetism . . . Bodies had electric fields of their own, she knew that much. Was that maybe why you didn\u2019t just disintegrate when you traveled? Did your own field keep you together, just long enough to pop out again? She supposed that might explain the gemstone thing: you could travel on the strength of your own field, if you were lucky, but the energy released from the molecular bonds in a crystal might well add to that field, so perhaps . . . ?</p><p>\u201cBugger,\u201d she said, her overworked mental processes creaking to a halt. She glanced guiltily at the hallway that led to the kids\u2019 room. They both knew that word, but they oughtn\u2019t to think their mother did.</p><p>She sank back to finish the wine and let her mind roam free, soothed by the sound of the distant surf. Her mind wasn\u2019t interested in water, though; it seemed still concerned with electricity.</p><p>\u201cI sing the Body Electric,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThe armies of those I love engirth me.\u201d</p><p>Now, there was a thought. Maybe Walt Whitman had been onto something . . . because if the electric attraction of the armies of those I love had an effect on time-traveling, it would explain the apparent effect of fixing your attention on a specific person, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>She thought of standing in the stones of Craigh na Dun, thinking of Roger. Or of standing on Ocracoke, mind fixed fiercely on her parents\u2014she\u2019d read all the letters now; she knew exactly where they were. . . . Would that make a difference? An instant\u2019s panic, as she tried to visualize her father\u2019s face, more as she groped for Roger\u2019s . . .</p><p>The expression of the face balks account. The next line echoed soothingly in her head. But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;</p><p>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists;</p><p>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees\u2014dress does not hide him;</p><p>The strong, sweet supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel;</p><p>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;</p><p>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember any more, but didn\u2019t need to; her mind had calmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d know you anywhere,\u201d she said softly to her husband, and lifted the remains of her glass. \u201cSl\u00e0inte.\u201d</p><p>NAY GREAT SHORTAGE OF HAIR IN SCOTLAND</p><p>MR. CUMBERPATCH proved to be a tall, ascetic person with an incongruous crop of red curls that sat on his head like a small, inquisitive animal. He had, he said, taken the disks in trade for a sucking pig, along with a tin pan whose bottom had been burnt through but could easy be patched, six horseshoes, a looking glass, and half a dresser.</p><p>\u201cNot really a tinker by trade, see?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t travel much. But things come and find me, they do.\u201d</p><p>Evidently they did. Mr. Cumberpatch\u2019s tiny cottage was crammed to its rafters with items that had once been useful and might be so again, once Mr. Cumberpatch got round to fixing them.</p><p>\u201cSell much?\u201d Buck asked, raising an eyebrow at a disassembled carriage clock that sat on the hearth, its internal organs neatly piled into a worn silver comfit dish.</p><p>\u201cHappen,\u201d Mr. Cumberpatch said laconically. \u201cSee anything ye like?\u201d</p><p>In the interests of cooperation, Roger haggled politely for a dented canteen and a canvas bed sack with only a few small charred holes at one end, these the result of some soldier taking his rest too close to a campfire. And received in turn the name and general direction of the person from whom Mr. Cumberpatch had got the disks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFlimsy sort of jewel,\u201d his host said, with a shrug. \u201cAnd t\u2019old woman said she wouldn\u2019t have it in t\u2019house, all those numbers might be to do with magic, aye? Her not holdin\u2019 with sorcery and t\u2019like.\u201d</p><p>The old woman in question was possibly twenty-five, Roger thought, a tiny, dark-eyed creature like a vole, who\u2014summoned to provide tea\u2014sized them up with a shrewd glance and proceeded to sell them a small, flabby-looking cheese, four turnips, and a large raisin tart, at an extortionate price. But the price included her own observations on her husband\u2019s transaction\u2014well worth it, so far as Roger was concerned.</p><p>\u201cThat ornament\u2014strange thing, no?\u201d she said, narrowing her eyes at the pocket where Roger had replaced it. \u201cMan what sold it to Anthony said he\u2019d had it from a hairy man, one of them as lives on the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich wall would this be, missus?\u201d Buck asked, draining his cup and holding it out for more. She gave him a look from her bead-bright eyes, obviously thinking him a simpleton, but they were paying customers, after all. . . .</p> <p>\u201cWhy, the Roman one, to be sure,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say the old king o\u2019 the Romes put it up, so as to keep the Scots from coming into England.\u201d The thought made her grin, small teeth gleaming. \u201cAs though anybody\u2019d want to be a-going there in t\u2019first place!\u201d</p><p>Further questions elicited nothing more; Mrs. Cumberpatch had no idea what was meant by \u201ca hairy man\u201d; that was what the man said, and she hadn\u2019t wondered about it. Declining an offer from Mr. Cumberpatch for his knife, Roger and Buck took their leave, the food wrapped in the bed sack. But as they did so, Roger saw a pottery dish containing a tangle of chains and tarnished bracelets, and a stray gleam of rainy light struck a tiny red glow.</p><p>It must have been Cumberpatch\u2019s description of the disks as a jewel\u2014a common way to refer to a pendant ornament\u2014that had made his mind sensitive. He stopped and, stirring the dish with a forefinger, drew out a small pendant, blackened, cracked, and with a broken chain\u2014it looked as though it had been in a fire\u2014but set with a fairly large garnet, caked with grime but faceted.</p><p>\u201cHow much for this?\u201d he said.</p><p>IT WAS DARK by four o\u2019clock, and long cold nights to be sleeping out of doors, but Roger\u2019s sense of urgency drove them on, and they found themselves benighted on a lonely road, with nothing but a wind-gnarled Caledonian pine for shelter. Starting a fire with tinder and damp pine needles was no joke, but after all, Roger reflected, grimly bashing steel and flint for the hundredth time\u2014and his finger for the twentieth\u2014they had nothing but time.</p> <p>Buck had, with a forethought born of painful experience, brought a sack of peats, and after a quarter hour of frantic blowing on sparks and thrusting grass-stems and pine needles into the infant flame, they succeeded in getting two of these miserable objects to burn with sufficient heat as to roast\u2014or at least sear\u2014the turnips and warm their fingers, if not the rest of them.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been any conversation since they\u2019d left the Cumberpatch establishment: impossible to talk with the cold wind whistling past their ears as they rode, and no breath with which to do it during the struggle with fire and food.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you do if we find him?\u201d Buck asked suddenly, mid-turnip. \u201cIf J. W. MacKenzie really is your father, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve speg\u201d\u2014Roger\u2019s throat was clogged from the cold and he coughed and spat, resuming hoarsely\u2014\u201cspent the last three days wondering that, and the answer is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Buck grunted and unwrapped the raisin tart from the bed sack, divided it carefully, and handed Roger half.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t bad, though Mrs. Cumberpatch couldn\u2019t be said to have a light hand with pastry.</p> <p>\u201cFilling,\u201d Roger remarked, thriftily dabbing crumbs off his coat and eating them. \u201cD\u2019ye not want to go, then?\u201d</p><p>Buck shook his head. \u201cNay, I canna think of anything better to do. As ye say\u2014it\u2019s the only clue there is, even if it doesna seem to have aught to do with the wee lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. And there\u2019s the one good thing\u2014we can head straight south to the wall; we needn\u2019t waste time looking for the man Cumberpatch got the disks from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Buck said dubiously. \u201cAnd then what? Walk the length of it, askin\u2019 after a hairy man? How many o\u2019 those do ye think there might be? Nay great shortage of hair in Scotland, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we have to,\u201d Roger said shortly. \u201cBut if J. W. MacKenzie\u2014and not just his identity disks\u2014was anywhere in the neighborhood, I\u2019m thinking he would have caused a good bit of talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. And how long\u2019s this wall, d\u2019ye know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yes. Or, rather,\u201d Roger corrected, \u201cI know how long it was when it was built: eighty Roman miles. A Roman mile being just slightly shorter than an English one. No idea how much of it\u2019s still there now, though. Most of it, likely.\u201d</p><p>Buck grimaced. \u201cWell, say we can walk fifteen, twenty miles in a day\u2014the walkin\u2019 will be easy, if it\u2019s along a bloody wall\u2014that\u2019s only four days to cover the lot. Though . . .\u201d A thought struck him and he frowned, pushing his damp forelock back. \u201cThat\u2019s if we could walk from end to end. If we hit it midway, though, what then? We might cover half and find nothing, and then have to go all the way back to where we started.\u201d He looked accusingly at Roger.</p> <p>Roger rubbed a hand over his face. It was coming on to rain, and the mizzle was misting on his skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it tomorrow, aye?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have plenty of time to make plans on our way.\u201d He reached for the canvas bed sack, shook out a limp turnip frond and ate it, then pulled the sack over his head and shoulders. \u201cWant to join me under this, or are ye for bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019m all right.\u201d Buck pulled his slouch hat lower and sat hunched, toes as close to the remnants of the fire as he could get.</p><p>Roger drew his knees up and tucked in the ends of the bed sack. The rain made a gentle pittering on the canvas, and in the fatigue of exhaustion and cold, but with the comfort of a full stomach, he allowed himself the further comfort of imagining Bree. He did this only at night but looked forward to it with a greater anticipation than he did supper.</p><p>He envisioned her in his arms, sitting between his knees, her head lying back on his shoulder, snug under the canvas with him and her soft hair span-gled with raindrops that caught the faint light of the fire. Warm, solid, breathing against his chest, his heart slowing to beat with hers . . .</p><p>\u201cI wonder what I\u2019d say to my own father,\u201d Buck said suddenly. \u201cHad I ever kent him, I mean.\u201d He blinked at Roger from under the shadowed brim of his hat. \u201cDid yours\u2014does he, I mean\u2014know about you?\u201d</p><p>Roger suppressed his annoyance at being disturbed in his fantasy, but answered shortly. \u201cYes. I was born before he disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Buck rocked back a little, looking meditative, but said no more. Roger found, though, that the interruption had made his wife vanish. He concentrated, trying to bring her back, imagining her in the kitchen at Lallybroch, the steam of cooking rising up around her, making wisps of red hair curl round her face and moisture gleam on the long straight bridge of her nose . . .</p><p>What he was hearing, though, was her arguing with him about whether he should tell Buck the truth of his begetting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think he has a right to know?\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you want to know something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I would,\u201d he\u2019d said at the time. But now . . .</p><p>\u201cDo you know who your father was?\u201d Roger asked suddenly. The question had been in his mind for months, he unsure whether he had any right to ask it.</p><p>Buck gave him a baffled, faintly hostile glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil d\u2019ye mean by that? Of course I do\u2014or did. He\u2019s dead now.\u201d His face twisted suddenly, realizing. \u201cOr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s not, since ye\u2019re not born yet. Aye, it gets to ye after a bit, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Apparently, it had just gotten to Buck. He stood up abruptly and stalked off. He stayed gone for a good ten minutes, giving Roger time to regret saying anything. But at last Buck came out of the dark and sat down again by the smoldering peat. He sat with his knees pulled up, arms locked round them.</p><p>\u201cWhat did ye mean by that?\u201d he asked abruptly. \u201cDid I ken my father, and that.\u201d</p><p>Roger took in a deep breath of damp grass, pine needles, and peat smoke. \u201cI mean ye werena born to the house ye grew up in. Did ye ken that?\u201d</p><p>Buck looked wary and slightly bewildered. \u201cAye,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cOr\u2014 not kent it straight out, I mean. My parents didna have any bairns besides me, so I thought there was maybe\u2014well, I thought I was likely a bastard born to my father\u2019s sister. She died, they said, about the time I was born, and she wasna marrit, so . . .\u201d He shrugged, one-shouldered. \u201cSo, no.\u201d He turned his head and looked at Roger, expressionless. \u201cHow d\u2019ye come to know, yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrianna\u2019s mother.\u201d He felt a sharp, sudden longing for Claire and was surprised at it. \u201cShe was a traveler. But she was at Leoch, about that time. And she told us what happened.\u201d He had the hollow-bellied feel of one about to jump off a precipice into water of unknown depth, but there was no way to stop now.</p><p>\u201cYour father was Dougal MacKenzie of Castle Leoch\u2014war chieftain of the clan MacKenzie. And your mother was a witch named Geillis.\u201d</p><p>Buck\u2019s face was absolutely blank, the faint firelight shimmering on the broad cheekbones that were his father\u2019s legacy. Roger wanted suddenly to go and take the man in his arms, smooth the hair back from his face, comfort him like a child\u2014like the child he could so plainly see in those wide, stunned green eyes. Instead, he got up and went off into the night, giving his four-times great-grandfather what privacy he could in which to deal with the news.</p><p>IT HADN\u2019T HURT. Roger woke coughing, and drops of moisture rolled tickling down his temples, dislodged by the motion. He was sleeping under the empty canvas bed sack rather than on it, valuing its water-resilience more than its potential comfort when stuffed with grass, but he hadn\u2019t been able to bear having it over his head.</p><p>He put a hand cautiously to his throat, feeling the thickened line of the rope scar cutting across the lower swell of his larynx. He rolled over, lifted himself on one elbow, and cleared his throat experimentally. It didn\u2019t hurt this time, either.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what a hyoid bone is?\u201d He did; as a result of a number of medical consultations about his damaged voice, he understood the anatomy of his throat quite well. And thus had known what Dr. McEwan meant; his own hyoid was placed slightly higher and farther back than the usual, a fortunate circumstance that had saved his life when he was hanged, as the crushing of that wee bone would have suffocated him.</p><p>Had he been dreaming of McEwan? Or of being hanged? Yes, that. He\u2019d had dreams like that often in the months afterward, though they\u2019d grown less frequent in later years. But he remembered looking up through the lacy branches of the tree, seeing\u2014in the dream\u2014the rope tied to the branch above him, and the desperate struggle to scream a protest through the gag in his mouth. Then the ineluctable sliding under him as the horse he sat on was led away . . . but this time it hadn\u2019t hurt. His feet had struck the ground and he waked\u2014but waked without the choking or the burning, stabbing sensations that left him gasping and gritting his teeth.</p><p>He glanced across; yes, Buck was still there, huddled up under the ragged plaid he\u2019d bought from Cumberpatch. Wise purchase.</p><p>He lay back down on his side, hauling the canvas up to shield his face while still allowing him to breathe. He\u2019d admit to a feeling of relief at seeing Buck; he\u2019d half-expected the man to decamp and head straight back to Castle Leoch after hearing the truth about his own family. Though, in justice to Buck, he wasn\u2019t a sneak. If he\u2019d made up his mind to do that, he\u2019d likely say so\u2014after punching Roger in the nose for not telling him sooner.</p><p>As it was, he\u2019d been there, staring into the ashes of the fire when Roger came back. He hadn\u2019t looked up, and Roger hadn\u2019t said anything to him but had sat down and taken out needle and thread to mend a rip in the seam of his coat.</p><p>After a bit, though, Buck had stirred himself.</p><p>\u201cWhy wait to tell me now?\u201d he\u2019d asked quietly. His voice held no particular note of accusation. \u201cWhy not tell me while we were still near Leoch and Cranesmuir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t made up my mind to tell ye at all,\u201d Roger had said bluntly. \u201cIt was just thinking about\u2014well, about what we\u2019re doing and what might happen. I thought of a sudden that maybe ye should know. And . . .\u201d He hesitated for a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan it, but it\u2019s maybe better so. Ye\u2019ll have time to think, maybe, whether ye want to find your parents before we go back.\u201d</p><p>Buck had merely grunted in reply to that and said no more. But it wasn\u2019t Buck\u2019s response that was occupying Roger\u2019s mind at the moment.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t hurt when he\u2019d cleared his throat while talking to Buck, though he hadn\u2019t noticed consciously at the time.</p><p>McEwan\u2014was it what he\u2019d done, his touch? Roger wished he\u2019d been able to see whether McEwan\u2019s hand shed blue light when he\u2019d touched Roger\u2019s damaged throat.</p><p>And what about that light? He thought that Claire had mentioned something like it once\u2014oh, yes, describing how Master Raymond had healed her, following the miscarriage she\u2019d had in Paris. Seeing her bones glow blue inside her body was how she\u2019d put it, he thought.</p><p>Now, that was a staggering thought\u2014was it a familial trait, common to time travelers? He yawned hugely and swallowed once more, experimentally. No pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He couldn\u2019t keep track of his thoughts any longer. Felt sleep spreading through his body like good whisky, warming him. And let go, finally, wondering what he might say to his father. If . . .</p><p>A MAN TO DO A MAN\u2019S JOB</p><p>Boston, MA</p><p>December 8, 1980</p> <p>GAIL ABERNATHY provided a quick but solid supper of spaghetti with meatballs, salad, garlic bread, and\u2014after a quick, penetrating look at Bree\u2014a bottle of wine, despite Brianna\u2019s protests.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending the night here,\u201d Gail said, in a tone brooking no opposition, and pointed at the bottle. \u201cAnd you\u2019re drinking that. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve been doing to yourself, girl, and you don\u2019t need to tell me\u2014but you need to stop doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could.\u201d But her heart had risen the moment she walked through the familiar door, and her sense of agitation did subside\u2014though it was far from disappearing. The wine helped, though.</p><p>The Abernathys helped more. Just the sense of being with friends, of not being alone with the kids and the fear and uncertainty. She went from wanting to cry to wanting to laugh and back again in the space of seconds, and felt that if Gail and Joe had not been there, she might have had no choice but to go into the bathroom, turn on the shower, and scream into a folded bath towel\u2014her only safety valve in the last few days.</p><p>But now there was at least someone to talk to. She didn\u2019t know whether Joe could offer anything beyond a sympathetic ear, but at the moment that was worth more to her than anything.</p> <p>Conversation over dinner was light and kid-oriented, Gail asking Mandy whether she liked Barbies and whether her Barbie had a car, and Joe talking soccer versus baseball\u2014Jem was a hard-core Red Sox fan, being allowed to stay up to ungodly hours to listen to rare radio broadcasts with his mother. Brianna contributed nothing more than the occasional smile and felt the tension slowly leave her neck and shoulders.</p><p>It came back, though with less force, when dinner was over and Mandy\u2014half-asleep with her arm in her plate\u2014was carried off to bed by Gail, humming \u201cJesu, Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring\u201d in a voice like a cello. Bree rose to pick up the dirty plates, but Joe waved her back, rising from his chair.</p><p>\u201cLeave them, darlin\u2019. Come talk to me in the den. Bring the rest of the wine,\u201d he added, then smiled at Jem. \u201cJem, whyn\u2019t you go up and ask Gail can you watch TV in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Jem had a smudge of spaghetti sauce at the corner of his mouth, and his hair was sticking up on one side in porcupine spikes. He was a little pale from the journey, but the food had restored him and his eyes were bright, alert.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said respectfully, and pushed back his own chair. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with my mam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that, honey,\u201d she said. \u201cUncle Joe and I have grown-up things we need to talk about. You\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a hard look, but recognized instantly, with a combination of horror and fascination, a Fraser male with his mind made up.</p><p>His lower lip was trembling, just a little. He shut his mouth hard to stop it and looked soberly from her to Joe, then back.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s not here,\u201d he said, and swallowed. \u201cAnd neither is Grandda. I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t speak. Joe nodded, though, as soberly as Jem, took a can of Coke from the refrigerator, and led the way to the den. She followed them, clutching the wine bottle and two glasses.</p><p>\u201cBree, darlin\u2019?\u201d Joe turned back for a moment. \u201cGet another bottle from the cupboard over the stove. This is gonna take some talking.\u201d</p><p>It did. Jemmy was on his second Coke\u2014the question of his going to bed, let alone to sleep, was clearly academic\u2014and the second bottle of wine was one-third down before she\u2019d finished describing the situation\u2014all the situations\u2014and what she thought of doing about them.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Joe said, quite casually. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but you need to decide whether to go through some rocks in North Carolina or in Scotland and end up in the eighteenth century either way, is that it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . most of it.\u201d She took a swallow of wine; it seemed to steady her. \u201cBut that\u2019s the first thing, yes. See, I know where Mama and Da are\u2014were\u2014at the end of 1778, and that\u2019s the year we\u2019d go back to, if everything works the way it seems to have worked before. They\u2019ll either be back on Fraser\u2019s Ridge or on their way there.\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s face lightened a little at that, but he didn\u2019t say anything. She met his eyes directly.</p><p>\u201cI was going to take you and Mandy through the stones on Ocracoke\u2014where we came through before, you remember? On the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVroom,\u201d he said very softly, and broke into a sudden grin, reliving his first exposure to automobiles.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling back despite herself. \u201cThen we could go to the Ridge, and I was going to leave you with Grannie and Grandda while I went to Scotland to find Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s smile faded, and his red brows drew together.</p><p>\u201cPardon my pointing out the obvious,\u201d Joe said. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t there a war going on in 1778?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was,\u201d she said tersely. \u201cAnd, yes, it might be a little bit difficult to get a ship from North Carolina to Scotland, but believe you me, I could do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do,\u201d he assured her. \u201cIt would be easier\u2014and safer, I reckon\u2014than going through in Scotland and searching for Roger with Jem and Mandy to look after at the same time, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need looking after!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Joe told him, \u201cbut you got about six years, sixty pounds, and another two feet to grow before you can look after your mama. \u2019Til you get big enough that nobody can just pick you up and carry you off, she\u2019s got to worry about you.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked as if he wanted to argue the point, but he was at the age where logic did sometimes prevail, and happily this was one of those times. He made a small \u201cmmphm\u201d sound in his throat, which startled Bree, and sat back on the ottoman, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t go to where Grannie and Grandda are,\u201d he pointed out. \u201c \u2019Cuz Dad\u2019s not where\u2014I mean when\u2014you thought. He\u2019s not in the same time they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo,\u201d she said briefly, and, reaching into the pocket of her sweater, carefully withdrew the plastic bag protecting Roger\u2019s letter. She handed it to Joe. \u201cRead that.\u201d</p><p>He whipped his reading glasses out of his own pocket and, with them perched on his nose, read the letter carefully, looked up at her, wide-eyed, then bent his head and read it again. After which he sat quite still for several minutes, staring into space, the letter open on his knee.</p><p>At last, he heaved a sigh, folded the letter carefully, and handed it back to her.</p><p>\u201cSo now it\u2019s space and time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ever watch Doctor Who on PBS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said dryly, \u201con the BBC. And don\u2019t think I wouldn\u2019t sell my soul for a TARDIS.\u201d</p><p>Jem made the little Scottish noise again, and Brianna looked sideways at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you doing that on purpose?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, surprised. \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. When you are fifteen, I\u2019m locking you in the cellar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d he demanded indignantly.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s when your father and grandfather started getting into real trouble, and evidently you\u2019re going to be just like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He seemed pleased to hear this, and subsided.</p><p>\u201cWell, putting aside the possibility of getting hold of a working TARDIS . . .\u201d Joe leaned forward, topping up both glasses of wine. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to travel farther than you thought, because Roger and this Buck guy just did it. So you think you could do it, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to,\u201d she said simply. \u201cHe won\u2019t try to come back without Jem, so I have to go find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how he did it? You told me it took gemstones to do it. Did he have, like, a special kind of gem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She frowned, remembering the effort of using the kitchen shears to snip apart the old brooch with its scatter of chip-like diamonds. \u201cThey each had a few tiny little diamonds\u2014but Roger went through before with a single biggish diamond. He said it was like the other times we know about; it exploded or vaporized or something\u2014just a smear of soot in his pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Joe took a sip of wine and held it meditatively in his mouth for a moment before swallowing. \u201cHypothesis one, then: number is more important than size\u2014i.e., you can go farther if you have more stones in your pocket.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a moment, somewhat taken aback.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cThe first time he tried it, though . . . he had his mother\u2019s locket; that had garnets on it. Definitely garnets, plural. But he didn\u2019t get through\u2014he was thrown back, on fire.\u201d She shuddered briefly, the sudden vision of Mandy flung on the ground, burning . . . She gulped wine and coughed. \u201cSo\u2014so we don\u2019t know whether he might have gone farther if he had gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a thought,\u201d Joe said mildly, watching her. \u201cNow . . . Roger\u2019s mentioning Jeremiah here, and it sounds like he means there\u2019s somebody besides Jemmy who\u2019s got that name. Do you know what he means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d A skitter of something between fear and excitement ran down her back with icy little feet, and she took another swallow of wine and a deep breath before telling him about Jerry MacKenzie. The circumstances of his disappearance\u2014and what her mother had told Roger.</p><p>\u201cShe thought he was very likely an accidental traveler. One who\u2014who couldn\u2019t get back.\u201d She took another quick sip.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my other grandda?\u201d Jemmy asked. His face flushed a little at the thought and he sat forward, hands clutched between his thighs. \u201cIf we go where Dad is, will we get to meet him, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even think about that,\u201d she told him honestly, though the suggestion made her insides curl up. Among the million alarming contingencies of the current situation, the possibility of meeting her deceased father-in-law face-to-face was about 999,999th on the list of Things to Be Worried About\u2014but apparently it was on the list.</p><p>\u201cBut what did Roger mean about seeking Jeremiah?\u201d Joe asked, clinging stubbornly to the point.</p><p>\u201cWe think that\u2019s how you . . . steer,\u201d Brianna said. \u201cFocusing your thoughts on a particular person who\u2019s in the time you want to go to. We don\u2019t know that for sure, though,\u201d she added, and stifled a small belch. \u201cEach time we\u2014or Mama\u2014did it, it was always two hundred and two years. And it was when Mama went back the first time\u2014though come to think of it,\u201d she added, frowning, \u201cshe thought it might have been because Black Jack Randall\u2014Daddy\u2019s ancestor\u2014was there. He was the first person she met when she came through the stones. She said he looked a lot like Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Joe poured another half glass and stared at it for a moment, as though hypnotized by the soft reddish light glowing in its bowl. \u201cBut.\u201d He stopped, marshaling his thoughts. \u201cBut other people did go farther. This Geillis your mother mentioned, and Buck? Did he\u2014never mind. Roger and Buck did do it this time, for sure. So it\u2019s possible; we just don\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was forgetting Geillis,\u201d Bree said slowly. She\u2019d seen the woman only once, and very briefly. A tall, slender figure, fair hair flying in the wind of a murderous fire, her shadow thrown onto one of the standing stones, enormous, elongated.</p><p>\u201cNow that I think, though . . . I don\u2019t believe she had gemstones when she went back. She thought it took . . . er . . . sacrifice.\u201d She glanced at Jem, then looked at Joe, lowering her brows with a meaningful look that said, \u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d \u201cAnd fire. And she never came back the other way, though she planned to, with stones.\u201d And suddenly a penny that she hadn\u2019t known was there dropped. \u201cShe told Mama about using stones\u2014not the other way around. So somebody . . . somebody else told her.\u201d</p><p>Joe digested that one for a moment, but then shook his head, dismissing the distraction.</p><p>\u201cHuh. Okay, Hypothesis two: focusing your thoughts on a particular person helps you go to where they are. That make sense to you, Jem?\u201d he asked, turning to Jemmy, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cSure. If it\u2019s somebody you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then\u2014\u201d Joe stopped abruptly, looking at Jem. \u201cIf it\u2019s somebody you know?\u201d</p><p>The icy centipede came rippling up Bree\u2019s backbone and into her hair, making her scalp contract.</p><p>\u201cJem.\u201d Her voice sounded odd to her own ears, husky and half breathless. \u201cMandy says she can hear you\u2014in her head. Can you . . . hear her?\u201d She swallowed, hard, and her voice came clearer. \u201cCan you hear Daddy that way?\u201d</p><p>The small red brows drew together in a puzzled frown.</p><p>\u201cSure. Can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>THE DEEP LINE between Uncle Joe\u2019s eyebrows hadn\u2019t gone away since the night before, Jem saw. He still looked friendly; he nodded at Jem and pushed a cup of hot chocolate across the counter to him, but his eyes kept going back to Mam, and every time they did, the line got deeper.</p><p>Mam was buttering Mandy\u2019s toast. Jem thought she wasn\u2019t as worried as she had been, and felt a little better himself. He\u2019d slept all night, for the first time in a long time, and he thought maybe Mam had, too. No matter how tired he was, he usually woke up every couple of hours, listening out for noises, and then listening harder to be sure Mandy and Mam were still breathing. He had nightmares where they weren\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Jem,\u201d Uncle Joe said. He put down his coffee cup and patted his lips with a paper napkin left over from Halloween; it was black with orange jack-o\u2019-lanterns and white ghosts on it. \u201cUm . . . how far can you . . . er . . . you know, when your sister\u2019s not with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far?\u201d Jem said uncertainly, and looked at Mam. It hadn\u2019t ever occurred to him to wonder.</p><p>\u201cIf you went in the living room right now,\u201d Uncle Joe said, nodding at the door. \u201cCould you tell she was in here, even if you didn\u2019t know she was in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I mean, yes, sir. I think so.\u201d He stuck his finger in the hot chocolate: still too hot to drink. \u201cWhen I was in the tunnel, in the train\u2014I knew she was . . . somewhere. It\u2019s not like science fiction or anything, I mean,\u201d he added, trying to explain. \u201cNot like X-rays or phasers or like that. I just . . .\u201d He struggled for an explanation and finally jerked his head at Mam, who was staring at him with a serious kind of look that bothered him a little. \u201cI mean, if you closed your eyes, you\u2019d still know Mam was here, wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s like that.\u201d</p> <p>Mam and Uncle Joe looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cWant toast?\u201d Mandy thrust her half-gnawed piece of buttered toast at him. He took it and had a bite; it was good, squidgy white bread, not the home-baked brown kind Mam made, with gritty bits in it.</p><p>\u201cIf he could hear her\u2014sense her\u2014from the tunnel while she was at home, he can do it for a good long way,\u201d Mam said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know for sure that she was at home then\u2014I was driving all over with her, looking for Jem. And Mandy could sense him while we were in the car that night. But\u2014\u201d Now her eyebrows went together. He didn\u2019t like seeing a line there. \u201cShe was telling me she was getting colder, when we drove toward Inverness, but I don\u2019t know if she meant she couldn\u2019t hear him at all, or . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can feel her when I\u2019m at school,\u201d Jem said, anxious to be helpful. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure, \u2019cause I don\u2019t think about her at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far\u2019s the school from your place?\u201d Uncle Joe asked. \u201cYou want a Pop-Tart, princess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d Mandy\u2019s buttery round face lighted up, but Jem glanced at Mam. Mam looked as if she wanted to kick Uncle Joe under the counter for a second, but then she glanced down at Mandy and her face went all soft.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and Jem felt a fluttery, excited sort of feeling in his middle. Mam was telling Uncle Joe how far the school was, but Jem wasn\u2019t paying attention. They were going to do it. They were really going to do it!</p><p>Because the only reason Mam would let Mandy eat Pop-Tarts without a fuss was because she figured she\u2019d never get to eat another one.</p><p>\u201cCan I have one, too, Uncle Joe?\u201d he asked. \u201cI like the blueberry ones.\u201d</p><p>THE WALL</p><p>HADRIAN\u2019S WALL looked very much as Roger recalled it from a long-ago school trip. A huge thing, standing nearly fifteen feet high and eight feet wide, double stone walls filled with rubble in between, winding off into the distance.</p> <p>The people were not that much different, either\u2014at least in terms of speech and livelihood. They raised cattle and goats, and the Northumberland dialect had apparently not developed much since Geoffrey Chaucer\u2019s time. Roger and Buck\u2019s Highland accents elicited slit-eyed looks of suspicious incomprehension, and they were for the most part reduced to basic gestures and sign language in order to obtain food and\u2014occasionally\u2014shelter.</p><p>With a bit of trial and error, Roger did work out an approximate Middle English for \u201cHast come here a stranger?\u201d From the looks of the place\u2014and the looks he and Buck were getting\u2014he would have said the contingency was remote, and so it proved. Three days of walking, and they were still plainly the strangest men anyone near the wall had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cSurely a man dressed in RAF uniform would look even more peculiar than we do?\u201d he said to Buck.</p><p>\u201cHe would,\u201d Buck replied logically, \u201cif he was still wearing it.\u201d</p><p>Roger grunted in chagrin. He hadn\u2019t thought of the possibility that Jerry might have discarded his uniform on purpose\u2014or been deprived of it by whomever came across him first.</p><p>It was on the fourth day\u2014the wall itself had rather surprisingly changed, being no longer built of stone and rubble but of stacked turves\u2014that they met a man wearing Jerry MacKenzie\u2019s flight jacket.</p><p>The man was standing at the edge of a half-plowed field, staring morosely into the distance, apparently with nothing on his mind save his hair. Roger froze, hand on Buck\u2019s arm, compelling him to look.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Buck whispered, grabbing Roger\u2019s hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s it! Isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, turning to Roger, brows raised. \u201cI mean\u2014the way ye described it . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. It is.\u201d Roger felt his throat tighten with excitement\u2014and fear. But there was only the one thing to be done, regardless, and, dropping Buck\u2019s hand, he forged through the dead grass and scattered rock toward the farmer, if that\u2019s what he was.</p><p>The man heard them coming and turned casually\u2014then stiffened, seeing them, and looked wildly round for help.</p><p>\u201cEevis!\u201d he shouted, or so Roger thought. Looking over his shoulder, Roger saw the stone walls of a house, evidently built into the wall.</p><p>\u201cPut up your hands,\u201d Roger said to Buck, throwing up his own, palm out, to show his lack of threat. They advanced slowly, hands up, and the farmer stood his ground, though watching them as though they might explode if they got too close.</p><p>Roger smiled at the man and elbowed Buck in the ribs to make him do likewise.</p><p>\u201cGud morn,\u201d he said clearly and carefully. \u201cHast cum a stranger here?\u201d He pointed to his own coat\u2014and then to the flight jacket. His heart was thumping hard; he wanted to knock the man over and strip it off his back, but that wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cNaow!\u201d said the man quickly, backing away, holding on to the edges of the jacket. \u201cBegone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe mean ye no harm, daftie,\u201d Buck said, in as conciliating a tone as he could manage. He patted the air in a soothing manner. \u201cKenst du dee mann . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell is that?\u201d Roger asked, out of the side of his mouth. \u201cAncient Norse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I heard an Orkneyman say it once. It means\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell what it means. Does this look like Orkney to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But if you can tell what it means, maybe he can, too, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaow!\u201d the man repeated, and bellowed, \u201cEEVIS!\u201d again. He began to back away from them.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d said Roger. \u201cLook.\u201d He fumbled quickly in his pocket and withdrew the little oilcloth packet holding his father\u2019s identity disks. He pulled them out, dangling them in the chilly breeze. \u201cSee? Where is the man who wore these?\u201d</p><p>The farmer\u2019s eyes bulged, and he turned and ran clumsily, his clogs hindering him through the clods of the field, shouting, \u201cEevis! Hellup!\u201d and several other, less comprehensible things.</p><p>\u201cDo we want to wait for Eevis to turn up?\u201d Buck said, shifting uneasily. \u201cHe may not be friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we do,\u201d Roger said firmly. The blood was high in his chest and face, and he flexed his hands nervously. Close. They were so close\u2014and yet . . . his spirits went from exhilaration to plunging fear and back within seconds. It hadn\u2019t escaped him that there was a strong possibility that Jerry MacKenzie had been killed for that jacket\u2014a possibility that seemed much more likely in view of their interlocutor\u2019s precipitate flight.</p><p>The man had disappeared into a windbreak of small trees, beyond which some sheds were visible. Perhaps Eevis was a stockman or dairyman?</p><p>Then the barking started.</p><p>Buck turned to look at Roger.</p><p>\u201cEevis, ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d</p><p>A huge, broad-headed, barrel-chested brown dog with a broad, toothy jaw to match came galloping out of the trees and made for them, its proprietor bringing up the rear with a spade.</p><p>They ran for it, circling the house with Eevis on their heels, baying for blood. The broad green bank of the wall loomed up in front of Roger and he leapt for it, jamming the toes of his boots into the turf and scrabbling with fingers, knees, elbows\u2014and likely his teeth, too. He hurled himself over the top and bounced down the far side, landing with a tooth-rattling thud. He was fighting to draw breath when Buck landed on top of him.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d his ancestor said briefly, rolling off him. \u201cCome on!\u201d He jerked Roger to his feet and they ran, hearing the farmer shouting curses at them from the top of the wall.</p><p>They found refuge in the lee of a crag a few hundred yards beyond the wall and collapsed there, gasping.</p><p>\u201cThe Emp . . . Emperor Had . . . rian kent what the blood . . . y hell he . . . was about,\u201d Roger managed, at last.</p><p>Buck nodded, wiping sweat from his face. \u201cNo . . . very hospitable,\u201d he wheezed. He shook his head and gulped air. \u201cWhat . . . now?\u201d</p><p>Roger patted the air, indicating the need for oxygen before he could formulate ideas, and they sat quiet for a bit, breathing. Roger tried to be logical about it, though spikes of adrenaline kept interfering with his thought processes.</p><p>One: Jerry MacKenzie had been here. That was all but certain; it was beyond the bounds of probability that there should be two displaced travelers wearing RAF flight jackets.</p><p>Two: he wasn\u2019t here now. Could that be safely deduced? No, Roger concluded reluctantly, it couldn\u2019t. He might have traded the jacket to Eevis\u2019s owner for food or something, in which case he\u2019d likely moved on. But if that were the case, why had the farmer not simply said so, rather than setting the dog on them?</p><p>And if he\u2019d stolen the jacket . . . either Jerry was dead and buried somewhere nearby\u2014that thought made Roger\u2019s stomach clench and the hairs prickle on his jaw\u2014or he\u2019d been assaulted and stripped but perhaps had escaped.</p><p>All right. If Jerry was here, he was dead. And if so, the only way of finding out was to subdue the dog and then beat the information out of Eevis\u2019s owner. He didn\u2019t feel quite up to it at the moment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d Roger said hoarsely. His breathing was still hard, but regular now.</p><p>Buck gave him a quick look, but then nodded. There was a long streak of muddy green down his cheek, smeared moss from the wall that echoed the green of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAye. What next, then?\u201d</p><p>The sweat was cooling on Roger\u2019s neck; he wiped it absently with the end of the scarf that had somehow made it over the wall with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea. Given the reaction of our friend there\u201d\u2014he nodded in the direction of the farmstead, invisible beyond the green mass of the wall\u2014\u201cI\u2019m thinking that asking for a stranger might be not the wisest thing. But what about the stones?\u201d</p><p>Buck blinked at him in incomprehension.</p><p>\u201cStones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Standing stones. Jerry did travel, we ken that much. What\u2019re the odds he came through a circle? And if so . . . they\u2019re likely none so far away. And folk wouldn\u2019t be threatened, I think, by two dafties asking after stones. If we find the place he likely came through, then we can start to cast out from there and ask at the places nearest to the stones. Cautiously.\u201d</p><p>Buck tapped his fingers on his knee, considering, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cA standing stone isna like to bite the arses out of our breeks. All right, then; let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>RADAR</p><p>Boston</p><p>December 9, 1980</p><p>JEM FELT NERVOUS. Mam and Uncle Joe were both trying to act as if everything was okay, but even Mandy could tell something was up; she was squirming around in the backseat of Uncle Joe\u2019s Cadillac like she had ants in her pants, pulling up her buttoned sweater over her head so her black curls fluffed out of the neckhole like something boiling over.</p><p>\u201cSit still,\u201d he muttered to her, but he didn\u2019t expect her to, and she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Uncle Joe was driving, and Mam had a map open in her lap. \u201cWhat are you doing, Mandy?\u201d Mam said absently. She was making marks on the map with a pencil.</p><p>Mandy unbuckled her seat belt and popped up on her knees. She\u2019d pulled her arms out of her sweater so they flopped around, and now just her face was poking out of the neckhole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an ottopus!\u201d she said, and shook herself so the sweater\u2019s arms danced. Jem laughed, in spite of himself. So did Mam, but she waved Mandy back down.</p><p>\u201cOctopus,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd put your seat belt back on right now. Octo means eight in Latin,\u201d she added. \u201cOctopuses have eight legs. Or arms, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only got four,\u201d Jem said to Mandy. \u201cDoes that make her a tetrapus, Mam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d But Mam had gone back to her map. \u201cThe Common, do you think?\u201d she said to Uncle Joe. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more than a quarter mile across the longest axis. And we could go down into the Public Garden, if . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good idea. I\u2019ll let you and Jem off on Park Street, then drive along Beacon to the end of the Common and back around.\u201d</p><p>It was cold and cloudy, with just a few flakes of snow in the air. He remembered Boston Common and was kind of glad to see it again, even with the trees leafless and the grass brown and dead. There were still people there; there always were, and their winter hats and scarves looked happy, all different colors.</p><p>The car stopped on Park Street, across from the tourist trolleys that stopped every twenty minutes. Dad had taken them all on one once\u2014one of the orange ones, with the open sides. It had been summer then.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your mittens, sweetheart?\u201d Mam was already out on the sidewalk, peering through the window. \u201cYou stay with Uncle Joe, Mandy\u2014just for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jem got out and stood with Mam on the sidewalk, putting on his mittens while they watched the gray Caddy pull away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cClose your eyes, Jem,\u201d Mam said quietly, and took his hand, squeezing it. \u201cTell me if you can feel Mandy in your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I mean, yes. She\u2019s there.\u201d He hadn\u2019t thought of Mandy as a little red light before the business in the tunnel with the train, but now he did. It kind of made it easier to concentrate on her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You can open your eyes if you want to,\u201d Mam said. \u201cBut keep thinking about Mandy. Tell me if she gets too far away for you to feel.\u201d</p><p>He could feel Mandy all the way, until the Caddy pulled up next to them again\u2014though she had got a little fainter, then stronger again.</p> <p>They did it again, with Uncle Joe and Mandy going all the way down to Arlington Street, on the far side of the Public Garden. He could still do it and was getting kind of cold and bored, standing there on the street.</p><p>\u201cShe can hear him fine,\u201d Uncle Joe reported, rolling down his window. \u201cHow \u2019bout you, sport? You hear your sister okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cI mean\u2014I can tell where she is, kind of. She doesn\u2019t talk in my head or anything like that.\u201d He was glad she didn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t want Mandy chattering away in his head all the time\u2014and he didn\u2019t want her listening to his thoughts, either. He frowned at her; he hadn\u2019t actually thought of that before.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hear what I\u2019m thinking, can you?\u201d he demanded, shoving his face in the open window. Mandy was riding up front now and looked up at him, surprised. She\u2019d been sucking her thumb, he saw; it was all wet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, kind of uncertainly. He could see she was sort of scared by this. So was he, but he figured he wouldn\u2019t let her\u2014or Mam\u2014know that. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said, and patted her on the head. She hated being patted on the head and swiped at him with a ferocious snarl. He stepped back out of reach and grinned at her.</p> <p>\u201cIf we have to do it again,\u201d he said to his mother, \u201cmaybe Mandy can stay with you, and I\u2019ll go with Uncle Joe?\u201d</p><p>Mam glanced uncertainly at him, then at Mandy, but seemed to get what he was really saying and nodded, opening the door for Mandy to bounce out, relieved.</p><p>Uncle Joe hummed softly to himself as they turned around, went right, and headed down past the big theater and the Freemasons\u2019 building. Jem could see Uncle Joe\u2019s knuckles showing through his skin, though, where he was clutching the wheel.</p><p>\u201cYou nervous, sport?\u201d Uncle Joe said, as they passed the Frog Pond. It was drained for the winter; it looked sort of sad.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jem swallowed. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Uncle Joe glanced at him, kind of startled, then smiled as he turned back to keep his eyes on the road.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s gonna be okay. You\u2019ll take good care of your mom and Mandy, and you\u2019ll find your dad. You\u2019ll be together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jem said, and swallowed again.</p><p>They drove in silence for a little bit, and the snow made little scratchy noises on the windshield, like salt being shaken on the glass.</p><p>\u201cMam and Mandy are gonna be pretty cold,\u201d Jem ventured.</p><p>\u201cYeah, this\u2019ll be our last try today,\u201d Uncle Joe assured him. \u201cStill got her? Mandy?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been paying attention; he\u2019d been thinking about the stone circles. And the thing in the tunnel. And Daddy. His stomach hurt.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said blankly. \u201cNo! I can\u2019t feel her!\u201d The idea suddenly panicked him and he stiffened in his seat, pushing back with his feet. \u201cDrive back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, pal,\u201d Uncle Joe said, and made a U-turn right in the middle of the street. \u201cGloucester Street. Can you remember that name? We need to tell your mom, so she can work out the distance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Jem said, but he wasn\u2019t really listening to Uncle Joe. He was listening hard for Mandy. He\u2019d never thought about it at all before this, never paid any attention to whether he could sense her or not. But now it was important, and he balled up his fists and shoved one into his middle, under his ribs, where the hurt was.</p><p>Then there she was, just as though she\u2019d always been there, like one of his toenails or something, and he let his breath out in a gasp that made Uncle Joe look sharply at him.</p><p>\u201cYou got her again?\u201d</p><p>Jem nodded, feeling inexpressible relief. Uncle Joe sighed and his big shoulders relaxed, too.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>BRIANNA PICKED UP Esmeralda the rag doll from the floor of the Abernathys\u2019 guest room and tucked her carefully in next to Mandy. Four miles. They\u2019d spent the morning driving round Boston in circles, and now they knew roughly how far the kids\u2019 mutual radar went. Jem could sense Mandy at a little over a mile, but she could sense him at nearly four. Jem could sense Brianna, too, but only vaguely and only for a short distance; Mandy could sense her mother almost as far as she could detect Jem.</p><p>She should write that down in the guide, she thought, but she\u2019d spent the afternoon in frenzied arrangements, and right now the effort of finding a pencil felt like searching for the source of the Nile or climbing Kilimanjaro. Tomorrow.</p><p>The thought of tomorrow jolted her out of her exhausted torpor with a zap of adrenaline. Tomorrow, it would start.</p><p>They\u2019d talked, after the kids had gone to bed. She and Joe, with Gail listening in the corner, the whites of her eyes showing now and then, but saying not a word.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be Scotland,\u201d she\u2019d explained. \u201cIt\u2019s December; ships can\u2019t sail until the springtime. If we crossed in North Carolina, we couldn\u2019t travel from the colonies before April and wouldn\u2019t get to Scotland before the summer. And putting aside the fact that I know what ocean travel in the eighteenth century is like and I wouldn\u2019t do that with children unless the alternative was being shot . . . I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d taken a gulp of wine and swallowed, but the knot in her throat didn\u2019t go down, any more than it had with the last half-dozen swallows. Anything could happen to him in six months. Anything. \u201cI\u2014have to find him.\u201d</p><p>The Abernathys glanced at each other, and Gail\u2019s hand touched Joe gently on the knee.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou sure about Scotland, though? What about the people that tried to take Jem from you? Won\u2019t they be waiting, if you go back?\u201d</p><p>Bree laughed\u2014shakily, but a laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnother reason to go right away,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the eighteenth century, I can stop looking over my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anybody\u2014\u201d Joe started, frowning, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot in California. And not here. But I keep watching.\u201d She\u2019d taken a few other precautions, too, things she\u2019d recalled from her father\u2019s brief\u2014and discreet\u2014memoir of his World War II experiences, but no need to go into those.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have some idea how to keep the kids safe in Scotland?\u201d Gail was perched uneasily on the edge of her seat, as though wanting to spring up and go check on the kids. Brianna knew the feeling.</p><p>She sighed and wiped a straggle of hair out of her eye.</p><p>\u201cThere are two people\u2014well, three\u2014there that I think I can trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think,\u201d Joe echoed, sounding skeptical.</p><p>\u201cThe only people I know I can trust are right here,\u201d she said simply, and lifted her wineglass to them. Joe looked away and cleared his throat. Then he glanced at Gail, who nodded at him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go with you,\u201d he said firmly, turning back to Bree. \u201cGail can mind the kids, and I can make sure nobody bothers you \u2019til you\u2019re set to go.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip to quell the rising tears.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, then cleared her own throat hard, to kill the quaver in her voice\u2014caused as much by the vision of the two Drs. Abernathy strolling the streets of Inverness as by gratitude. It wasn\u2019t that there were no black people in the Highlands of Scotland, but they were sufficiently infrequent as to cause notice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated, and took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to Edinburgh to start; I can get the things we need there, without attracting attention. We won\u2019t go up to the Highlands until everything is ready\u2014and I\u2019ll only get in touch with my friends there at the last minute. There won\u2019t be time for anyone else to realize we\u2019re there, before we\u2014before we go . . . through.\u201d</p><p>That one word, \u201cthrough,\u201d hit her like a blow in the chest, freighted as it was with memory of the howling void that lay between now and then. Between herself and the kids\u2014and Roger.</p><p>The Abernathys hadn\u2019t given up easily\u2014or altogether; she was sure there would be another attempt at breakfast\u2014but she had faith in her own stubbornness and, pleading exhaustion, had escaped from their kind worries in order to be alone with her own.</p><p>She was exhausted. But the bed she\u2019d share with Mandy didn\u2019t draw her. She needed just to be alone for a bit, to decompress before sleep would come. She could hear going-to-bed noises on the floor below; taking off her shoes, she padded silently down to the first floor, where a light had been left on in the kitchen and another at the end of the hallway by the den, where Jem had been put to bed on the big couch.</p><p>She turned to go and check on him, but her attention was diverted by a familiar metallic chunk! The kitchen had a pocket door, slid half across. She stepped up to it and glanced through the opening, to discover Jem standing on a chair next to the counter, reaching to pull a Pop-Tart out of the toaster.</p><p>He looked up, wide-eyed at the sound of her step, held the hot pastry for a second too long, and dropped it as it burned his fingers.</p><p>\u201cIfrinn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d she told him, coming to retrieve the fallen tart. \u201cWe\u2019re about to go where people would understand it. Here\u2014do you want some milk with that?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for an instant, surprised, then hopped down like a towhee, both feet together, and landed with a light thud on the tiled floor. \u201cI\u2019ll get it. You want some, too?\u201d Suddenly, nothing on earth sounded better than a hot blueberry Pop-Tart with melting white icing and a glass of cold milk. She nodded and broke the hot tart in two, putting each half on a paper towel.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d she finally said, after they\u2019d eaten their snack in companionable silence. He shook his head, red hair ruffled up in porcupine spikes.</p><p>\u201cWant me to read you a story?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what made her say that; he was much too old to be read to, though he was always somewhere nearby when she read to Mandy. He gave her a jaundiced look, but then, surprisingly, nodded and scampered up to the third floor, coming back with the new copy of Animal Nursery Tales in hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to lie down right away but sat very close to her on the sofa while she read, her arm round his shoulders and his weight growing warm and heavy against her side as his breathing slowed.</p><p>\u201cMy dad used to read to me if I woke up and couldn\u2019t go back to sleep,\u201d she said softly, turning the last page. \u201cGrandpa Frank, I mean. It was a lot like this; everything quiet.\u201d And themselves cozy and bonelessly content, alone together in a puddle of warm yellow light, with the night far away.</p><p>She felt Jem\u2019s sleepy interest rise.</p><p>\u201cWas he like Grandda? Grandpa Frank?\u201d She\u2019d told the kids little things about Frank Randall, not wanting him to be forgotten, but she knew he\u2019d never be much more than a faint ghost beside the vivid warmth of their other grandfather\u2014the grandfather they might have back. She felt a sudden small tearing in her heart, a vivid second of understanding for her mother.</p><p>Oh, Mama . . .</p><p>\u201cHe was different,\u201d she said softly, her mouth brushing his bright hair. \u201cHe was a soldier, though\u2014they had that in common. And he was a writer, a scholar\u2014like Daddy. All of them were\u2014are\u2014alike, though: they\u2019d all take care of people. It\u2019s what a good man does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She could feel him falling asleep, struggling to keep a hold on consciousness, the dreams beginning to walk through his waking thoughts. She eased him down into the nest of blankets and covered him, smoothing the cowlick on the crest of his head.</p><p>\u201cCould we see him?\u201d Jem said suddenly, his voice drowsy and soft.</p><p>\u201cDaddy? Yes, we\u2019ll see him,\u201d she promised, making her own voice solid with confidence.</p><p>\u201cNo, your daddy . . .\u201d he said, his eyes half open, glazed with sleep. \u201cIf we go through the stones, could we see Grandpa Frank?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open, but she still hadn\u2019t found an answer when she heard him start to snore.</p><p>BE THOSE THY BEASTS?</p><p>WHILE IT WAS undeniably true that standing stones didn\u2019t bite, Roger thought, that didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t dangerous.</p><p>It had taken them only a day and a half to find the stone circle. He\u2019d made a quick sketch of standing stones on the back of his hand with a bit of charcoal, to assist communication, and it had worked surprisingly well. While the scattered people they\u2019d found had regarded them with immense curiosity\u2014and not a few private glances accompanied by whirling motions of the forefinger beside the head\u2014no one had found the visitors more than odd, and everyone had known where the stones were.</p><p>They\u2019d come across a tiny village, in fact\u2014consisting of a church, a public house, a smithy, and several houses\u2014where the last household they\u2019d approached had even sent one of their younger sons along to guide Buck and Roger to their goal.</p><p>And there they were now: a scatter of stumpy, lichened, wind-scored pillars beside a shallow lake filled with reeds. Ageless, harmless, part of the landscape\u2014and the sight of them filled Roger with a fear that shivered as coldly over his skin as though he stood there naked to the wind.</p><p>\u201cCan ye hear them?\u201d Buck muttered under his breath, his own eyes fixed on the stones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger muttered back. \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d But Buck shuddered suddenly, as though something had walked across his grave.</p><p>\u201cBe those thy be-asts?\u201d the boy asked, grinning at Roger. He pointed at the stones, explaining\u2014Roger thought\u2014the local legend that the stones were in fact faery cattle, frozen in place when their drover had too much drink betaken and fell into the lake.</p><p>\u201cSooth,\u201d the boy assured them solemnly, making a cross over his heart. \u201cMester Hacffurthe found es whip!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Buck asked sharply. \u201cAnd where liveth Mester Hacffurthe?\u201d</p><p>A week ago, maybe twa, said the boy, waving a hand to indicate that the date was not important. And he would take them to Mester Hacffurthe, if they liked to see the thing.</p><p>Despite his name, Mester Hacffurthe proved to be a slight, light-haired young man, the village cobbler. He spoke the same impenetrable Northumbrian dialect, but with some effort and the helpful intervention of the boy\u2014whose name, he said, was Ridley\u2014their desire was made clear, and Hacffurthe obligingly fetched the faery whip out from under his counter, laying it gingerly before them.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d Roger said at sight of it\u2014and, with a raised brow at Hacffurthe to ask permission, touched the strip carefully. A machine-woven, tight-warped strip some three inches wide and two feet long, its taut surface gleaming even in the dim light of the cobbler\u2019s shop. Part of the harness of an RAF flier. They had the right stones, then.</p><p>Careful questioning of Mr. Hacffurthe, though, elicited nothing else helpful. He had found the faery lash lying in the shallows of the lake, washing to and fro among the reeds, but had seen nothing else of note.</p> <p>Roger noticed, though, that Ridley twitched slightly when Mr. Hacffurthe said this. And after they had left the cobbler\u2019s house, he paused at the edge of the village, hand in his pocket.</p><p>\u201cI thank \u2019ee, Master Ridley,\u201d he said, and pulled out a broad tuppenny piece that made the boy\u2019s face light up. Roger put it into Ridley\u2019s hand, but, when the boy would have turned to go, laid his own hand on the lad\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cOne thing more, Master Ridley,\u201d he said, and, with a glance at Buck, drew out the identity disks.</p><p>Ridley jerked in Roger\u2019s grasp, his round face going pale. Buck made a small sound of satisfaction and took Ridley by his other arm.</p><p>\u201cTell us about the man,\u201d Buck suggested pleasantly. \u201cAnd I might not break thy neck.\u201d</p><p>Roger shot Buck a glance of annoyance, but the threat was effective. Ridley gulped as though he\u2019d swallowed a mushroom whole, but then began to talk. Between Ridley\u2019s dialect and his distress, the tale took some time to piece together, but at last Roger was fairly sure they had the gist of it.</p> <p>\u201cLet him go,\u201d he said, letting go of Ridley himself. He groped in his pocket and came out with another copper penny, which he offered to the boy. Ridley\u2019s face flexed between fear and outrage, but after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he snatched the penny and made off, glancing over his shoulder as he ran.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell his family,\u201d Buck observed. \u201cWe\u2019d best hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had. But not on that account\u2014it\u2019s getting dark.\u201d The sun was very low, a brilliant band of yellow light showing at the foot of a cold ochre sky. \u201cCome on. We need to take the direction while we can.\u201d</p><p>So far as Roger had been able to follow Ridley\u2019s story, the strangely dressed man (some said he was a faerie, some thought him a northerner, though there was confusion as to whether this meant a Scot, a Norseman, or something else) had had the ill luck to show up at a farm two or three miles from the stones, where he had been set upon by the inhabitants, these being an antisocial clan called Wad.</p><p>The Wads had taken everything of apparent value off the man, beaten him, and tossed him into a ravine\u2014one of the Wads had boasted of it to a drover passing through, who had mentioned the stranger in the village.</p><p>The village had of course been interested\u2014but not sufficiently so as to go looking for the man. When Hacffurthe the cobbler had found the peculiar strip of cloth, though, rumors had started to fly thick and fast. Excitement had reached a higher pitch this very afternoon, when one of Mester Quarton\u2019s cowmen had come into the village to have a boil lanced by Granny Racket and revealed that a stranger with incomprehensible speech had tried to steal a pie from Missus Quarton\u2019s sill and was even now held captive whilst Mester Quarton thought what best to do with him.</p><p>\u201cWhat might he do?\u201d Roger had asked. Ridley had pushed out his lips portentously and shaken his head.</p><p>\u201cMight kill \u2019un,\u201d he said. \u201cMight take \u2019un\u2019s hand off. Mester Quarton don\u2019t hold with thievin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2014aside from a vague direction regarding the location of the Quarton farm\u2014was that.</p><p>\u201cThis side of the wall, two miles west and a little south, below a ridge and along the stream,\u201d Roger said grimly, lengthening his stride. \u201cIf we can find the stream before full dark . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Buck fell in beside him as they turned toward where they\u2019d left the horses. \u201cSuppose Quarton keeps a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody here keeps a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p><p>JUST ONE CHANCE</p><p>THERE WAS NO MOON. Undeniably a good thing, but it had its drawbacks. The farmhouse and its outbuildings lay in a pocket of darkness so profound that they mightn\u2019t have known it was there, had they not seen it before the light was quite gone. They\u2019d waited, though, for full dark and the dousing of the dim candlelight inside the house, and then an extra half hour or so to ensure that the inhabitants\u2014and their dogs\u2014were well asleep.</p><p>Roger was carrying the dark lantern, but with the slide still closed; Buck ran into something lying on the ground, let out a startled cry, and fell headlong over it. The something proved to be a large sleeping goose, which let out a startled whonk! somewhat louder than Buck\u2019s cry, and promptly set about him with beak and thrashing wings. There was a sharp, inquiring bark in the distance.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d Roger hissed, coming to his ancestor\u2019s aid. \u201cYe\u2019ll wake the dead, let alone them in the house.\u201d He dropped his cloak over the goose, which shut up and began waddling around in confusion, a mobile heap of dark cloth. Roger clapped a hand to his mouth, but couldn\u2019t help snorting through his nose.</p><p>\u201cAye, right,\u201d Buck whispered, getting to his feet. \u201cIf ye think I\u2019m getting your cloak back for ye, think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get out of it soon enough,\u201d Roger whispered back. \u201cHe\u2019s no need of it. Meanwhile, where the devil d\u2019ye think they\u2019ve got him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeplace that\u2019s got a door ye can bolt.\u201d Buck rubbed his palms together, brushing off the dirt. \u201cThey\u2019d no keep him in the house, though, would they? It\u2019s no that big.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. You could have fitted about sixteen farmhouses that size into Lallybroch, Roger thought, and felt a sudden sharp pang, thinking of Lallybroch as it was when he had\u2014he would\u2014own it.</p><p>Buck was right, though: there couldn\u2019t be more than two rooms and a loft, maybe, for the kids. And given that the neighbors thought Jerry\u2014if it was Jerry\u2014was a foreigner at best, a thief and/or supernatural being at worst, it wasn\u2019t likely that the Quartons would be keeping him in the house.</p><p>\u201cDid ye see a barn, before the light went?\u201d Buck whispered, changing to Gaelic. He had risen onto his toes, as though that might help him see above the tide of darkness, and was peering into the murk. Dark-adapted as Roger\u2019s eyes now were, he could at least make out the squat shapes of the small farm buildings. Corncrib, goat shed, chicken coop, the tousled shape of a hayrick . . .</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roger replied in the same tongue. The goose had extricated itself and gone off making disgruntled small honks; Roger bent and retrieved his cloak. \u201cSmall place; they likely haven\u2019t more than an ox or a mule for the plowing, if that. I smell stock, though . . . manure, ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKine,\u201d Buck said, heading abruptly off toward a square-built stone structure. \u201cThe cow byre. That\u2019ll have a bar to the door.\u201d</p><p>It did. And the bar was in its brackets.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear any kine inside,\u201d Buck whispered, drawing close. \u201cAnd the smell\u2019s old.\u201d</p><p>It was near-on winter. Maybe they\u2019d had to slaughter the cow\u2014or cows; maybe they\u2019d driven them to market. But, cow or no, there was something inside; he heard a shuffling noise and what might have been a muffled curse.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, there\u2019s something inside.\u201d Roger raised the dark lantern, groping for the slide. \u201cGet the bar, will you?\u201d</p><p>But before Buck could reach for the bar, a shout of \u201cHoy!\u201d came from inside, and something fell heavily against the door. \u201cHelp! Help me! Help!\u201d</p><p>The voice spoke English, and Buck changed back at once. \u201cWill ye for God\u2019s sake hush your noise?\u201d he said to the man inside, annoyed. \u201cYe want to have them all down on us? Here, then, bring the light closer,\u201d he said to Roger, and drew the bar with a small grunt of effort.</p><p>The door swung open as Buck set down the bar, and light shot out of the lantern\u2019s open slide. A slightly built young man with flyaway fair hair\u2014the same color as Buck\u2019s, Roger thought\u2014blinked at them, dazzled by the light, then closed his eyes against it.</p><p>Roger and Buck glanced at each other for an instant, then, with one accord, stepped into the byre.</p><p>He is, Roger thought. It\u2019s him. I know it\u2019s him. God, he\u2019s so young! Barely more than a boy. Oddly, he felt no burst of dizzying excitement. It was a feeling of calm certainty, as though the world had suddenly righted itself and everything had fallen into place. He reached out and touched the man gently on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, mate?\u201d he said softly, in English.</p><p>\u201cMacKenzie, J. W.,\u201d the young man said, shoulders straightening as he drew himself up, sharp chin jutting. \u201cLieutenant, Royal Air Force. Service Number\u2014\u201d He broke off, staring at Roger, who belatedly realized that, calmness or no, he was grinning from ear to ear. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d Jerry MacKenzie demanded, belligerent.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Roger assured him. \u201cEr . . . glad\u2014glad to see you, that\u2019s all.\u201d His throat was tight, and he had to cough. \u201cHave ye been here long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just a few hours. Ye wouldn\u2019t have any food on ye, I don\u2019t suppose?\u201d He looked hopefully from one man to the other.</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Buck said, \u201cbut this isna the time to stop for a bite, aye?\u201d He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Aye, we should.\u201d But Roger spoke automatically, unable to stop looking at J. W. MacKenzie, RAF, aged twenty-two.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jerry asked, staring back. \u201cWhere d\u2019ye come from? God knows ye\u2019re not from here!\u201d</p><p>Roger exchanged a quick look with Buck. They hadn\u2019t planned what to say; Roger hadn\u2019t been willing to jinx the enterprise by thinking that they\u2019d really find Jerry MacKenzie, and as for Buck\u2014</p><p>\u201cInverness,\u201d Buck said abruptly. He sounded gruff.</p><p>Jerry\u2019s eyes flicked back and forth between them, and he caught Roger\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYe know what I mean!\u201d he said, and gulped air, bracing himself. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Roger touched Jerry\u2019s hand, cold and dirty, the fingers long like his own. The question caught at his throat and thickened his voice too much to speak.</p><p>\u201cA lang way from you,\u201d Buck said quietly, and for the first time, Roger caught a note of desolation in his voice. \u201cFrom now. Lost.\u201d</p><p>That struck him to the heart. He\u2019d truly forgotten their situation for a little, driven by the urgency of finding this man. But Buck\u2019s answer made Jerry\u2019s face, already drawn with hunger and strain, go white under the dirt.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Jerry whispered. \u201cWhere are we now? And\u2014and when?\u201d</p><p>Buck stiffened. Not at Jerry\u2019s question, but at a noise from outside. Roger didn\u2019t know what had made it, but it wasn\u2019t the wind. Buck made a low, urgent noise in his throat, shifting.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s part of Northumbria now,\u201d Roger said. \u201cLook, there\u2019s no time. We have to go, before someone hears\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, right. Let\u2019s go, then.\u201d Jerry had a filthy silk scarf round his neck; he tugged the ends straight and shoved them into his shirt.</p><p>The air outside was wonderful after the smells of the cow byre, fresh with new-turned earth and dying heather. They made their way as quickly as they could through the yard, skirting the farmhouse. Jerry was lame, he saw, limping badly, and Roger took his arm to help. A shrill yap came from the darkness, some distance away\u2014then another bark, in a deeper tone.</p><p>Roger hastily licked a finger and held it up to gauge the direction of the breeze. A dog barked again, and another echoed it.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d he whispered to his companions, tugging Jerry\u2019s arm. He led them away from the house as fast as possible, trying to keep his bearings, and they found themselves stumbling through a plowed field, dirt clods crumbling under their boots.</p><p>Buck stumbled and swore under his breath. They lurched from furrow to ridge, half-legged and clumsy, Roger clinging to Jerry\u2019s arm to keep him upright; one of Jerry\u2019s legs seemed gammy and wouldn\u2019t take his weight. He\u2019s been wounded. I saw the medal. . . .</p><p>Then the dogs began to bark, voices suddenly clear\u2014and much closer.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Roger stopped for an instant, breathing hard. Where the bloody hell was the wood they\u2019d hidden in? He\u2019d swear they\u2019d been heading for it, but\u2014the beam from the lantern swung crazily, showing meaningless patches of field. He shut the slide; they\u2019d be better off without it.</p><p>\u201cThis way!\u201d Buck lurched away and Roger and Jerry followed perforce, hearts thumping. Christ, it sounded like a half-dozen dogs at least had been let loose, all barking. And was that a voice, calling to the dogs? Yes, it bloody was. He couldn\u2019t understand a word, but the meaning was as clear as ice water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They ran, stumbling and panting. Roger couldn\u2019t tell where they were; he was following Buck. He dropped the lantern at one point; it fell over with a clank and he heard the oil inside gurgle out of its reservoir. With a soft whoosh, it flowered into brilliant flame.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d They ran. It didn\u2019t matter where, what direction. Just away from the burning beacon and the irate voices\u2014more than one now.</p><p>Suddenly they were into a scrim of trees\u2014the low, wind-crabbed grove they\u2019d lurked in earlier. But the dogs were on their track, barking eagerly, and they didn\u2019t linger but fought their way through the brush and out again, up a steep hill turfed with heather. Roger\u2019s foot sank through the spongy growth into a puddle, soaking him to the ankle, and he nearly lost his balance. Jerry set his feet and yanked Roger upright, then lost his own balance when his knee gave way; they clung together, wobbling precariously for an instant, then Roger lurched forward again and they were out of it.</p><p>He thought his lungs would burst, but they kept going\u2014not running any longer; you couldn\u2019t run up a hill like this\u2014slogging, planting one foot after another, after another . . . Roger began to see bursts of light at the edges of his vision; he tripped, staggered, and fell, and was hauled to his feet by Jerry.</p> <p>They were all three half sopping and smeared head to foot with mud and heather scratchings when they lurched at last to the crest of the hill and stopped for a moment, swaying and gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cWhere . . . are we going?\u201d Jerry wheezed, using the end of his scarf to wipe his face.</p><p>Roger shook his head, still short of breath\u2014but then caught the faint gleam of water.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking you . . . back. To the stones by the lake. Where . . . you came through. Come on!\u201d</p><p>They pelted down the far side of the hill, headlong, almost falling, now exhilarated by the speed and the thought of a goal.</p> <p>\u201cHow . . . did you find me?\u201d Jerry gasped, when at last they hit bottom and stopped for breath.</p><p>\u201cFound your tags,\u201d Buck said, almost brusque. \u201cFollowed their trail back.\u201d</p><p>Roger put a hand to his pocket, about to offer them back\u2014but didn\u2019t. It had struck him, like a stone to the middle of his chest, that, having found Jerry MacKenzie against substantial odds, he was about to part from him, likely forever. And that was only if things went well. . . .</p><p>His father. Dad? He couldn\u2019t think of this young man, white-faced and lame, nearly twenty years his junior, as his father\u2014not the father he\u2019d imagined all his life.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Buck took Jerry\u2019s arm now, nearly holding him up, and they began to forge their way across the dark fields, losing their way and finding it again, guided by the light of Orion overhead.</p><p>Orion, Lepus. Canis major. He found a measure of comfort in the stars, blazing in the cold black sky. Those didn\u2019t change; they\u2019d shine forever\u2014or as close as made no difference\u2014on him and on this man, no matter where each one might end up.</p> <p>End up. The cold air burned in his lungs. Bree . . .</p><p>And then he could see them: squatty pillars, no more than blotches on the night, visible only because they showed dark and immobile against the sheet of moving water stirred by the wind.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said hoarsely, and, swallowing, wiped his face on his sleeve. \u201cThis is where we leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe do?\u201d Jerry panted. \u201cBut\u2014but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen ye came . . . through. Did ye have anything on you? A gemstone, any jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jerry said, bewildered. \u201cI had a raw sapphire in my pocket. But it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s like it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it burnt up,\u201d Buck finished for him, grim-voiced. \u201cAye. Well, so?\u201d This last was clearly addressed to Roger, who hesitated. Bree . . . No more than an instant, though\u2014he stuck a hand into the leather pouch at his waist, pulled out the tiny oilcloth package, fumbled it open, and pressed the garnet pendant into Jerry\u2019s hand. It was faintly warm from his body, and Jerry\u2019s cold hand closed over it in reflex.</p><p>\u201cTake this; it\u2019s a good one. When ye go through,\u201d Roger said, and leaned toward him, trying to impress him with the importance of his instructions, \u201cthink about your wife, about Marjorie. Think hard; see her in your mind\u2019s eye, and walk straight through. Whatever the hell ye do, though, don\u2019t think about your son. Just your wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jerry was gobsmacked. \u201cHow the bloody hell do you know my wife\u2019s name? And where\u2019ve ye heard about my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Roger said, and turned his head to look back over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d said Buck softly. \u201cThey\u2019re still coming. There\u2019s a light.\u201d</p><p>There was: a single light, bobbing evenly over the ground, as it would if someone carried it. But look as he might, Roger could see no one behind it, and a violent shiver ran over him.</p><p>\u201cThaibhse,\u201d said Buck, under his breath. Roger knew that word well enough\u2014spirit, it meant. And usually an ill-disposed one. A haunt.</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe.\u201d He was beginning to catch his breath. \u201cAnd maybe not.\u201d He turned again to Jerry. \u201cEither way, ye need to go, man, and now. Remember, think of your wife.\u201d</p><p>Jerry swallowed, his hand closing tight around the stone.</p><p>\u201cAye. Aye . . . right. Thanks, then,\u201d he added awkwardly.</p><p>Roger couldn\u2019t speak, could give him nothing more than the breath of a smile. Then Buck was beside him, plucking urgently at his sleeve and gesturing at the bobbing light, and they set off, awkward and lumbering after the brief cooldown.</p><p>Bree . . . He swallowed, fists clenched. He\u2019d got a stone once, he could do it again. . . . But the greater part of his mind was still with the man they had just left by the lake. He looked over his shoulder and saw Jerry beginning to walk, limping badly but resolute, thin shoulders squared under his pale khaki shirt and the end of his scarf fluttering in the rising wind.</p><p>Then it all rose up in him. Seized by an urgency greater than any he\u2019d ever known, he turned and ran. Ran heedless of footing, of dark, of Buck\u2019s startled cry behind him.</p><p>Jerry heard his footsteps on the grass and whirled round, startled himself. Roger grabbed him by both hands, squeezed them hard enough to make Jerry gasp, and said fiercely, \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>That was all there was time for\u2014and all he could possibly say. He let go and turned away fast, his boots making a shoof-shoof noise in the dry lake grass. He glanced up the hill, but the light had vanished. Likely it had been someone from the farmhouse, satisfied now that the intruders were gone.</p><p>Buck was waiting, shrouded in his cloak and holding Roger\u2019s; he must have dropped it coming down the hill. Buck shook it out and folded it round Roger\u2019s shoulders; Roger\u2019s fingers shook, trying to fasten the brooch.</p><p>\u201cWhy did ye tell him a daft thing like that?\u201d Buck asked, doing it for him. Buck\u2019s head was bent, not looking at him.</p><p>Roger swallowed hard, and his voice came clear but painful, the words like ice shards in his throat.</p><p>\u201cBecause he isn\u2019t going to make it back. It\u2019s the only chance I\u2019ll ever have. Come on.\u201d</p><p>POSTPARTUM</p><p>THE NIGHT SHIVERED. The whole night. The ground and the lake, the sky, the dark, the stars, and every particle of his own body. He was scattered, instantly everywhere and part of everything. And part of them. There was one moment of an exaltation too great for fear and then he vanished, his last thought no more than a faint, I am . . . voiced more in hope than declaration.</p><p>Roger came back to a blurred knowledge of himself, flat on his back under a clear black sky whose brilliant stars seemed pinpoints now, desperately far away. He missed them, missed being part of the night. Missed, with a brief rending sense of desolation, the two men who\u2019d shared his soul for that blazing moment.</p><p>The sound of Buck throwing up returned him to a sense of his body. He was lying in cold, wet grass, half soaked, smelling of mud and old manure, chilled to the bone, and bruised in a number of uncomfortable places.</p><p>Buck said something horrible in Gaelic and retched again. He was on his hands and knees a few feet away, a blot on the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d Roger croaked, rolling onto his side. He\u2019d remembered, suddenly, the trouble with Buck\u2019s heart when they\u2019d made their passage at Craigh na Dun. \u201cIf your heart\u2019s giving you bother again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it was, damn-all ye could do about it, is there?\u201d Buck said. He hawked a glob of something nasty into the grass and sat down heavily, wiping his sleeve across his mouth. \u201cChrist, I hate that! Didna ken we\u2019d feel it, this far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Roger sat up slowly. He wondered whether Buck had felt the same thing he had, but it didn\u2019t seem the moment for metaphysical discussion. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to go and make sure of it?\u201d Buck said disagreeably. \u201cGod, my head!\u201d</p><p>Roger rose to his feet, staggering a little, and went and got Buck under one arm, levering him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go find the horses. We\u2019ll get away a bit, make a wee camp, get some food into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bloody am.\u201d In fact, he was ravenous. Buck swayed but appeared able to stand on his own. Roger released him and turned briefly to look back at the distant lake and the standing stones. For an instant, he recaptured the sense of being part of them, and then it was gone; the gleaming water and the stones were no more than part of the craggy landscape.</p><p>There was no way of knowing what time it was, but the night was still pitch-dark by the time they\u2019d retrieved the horses, made their way to a sheltered spot under a cliff face, found water, made fire, and toasted some bannocks to eat with their dried salt herring.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk, both exhausted. Roger pushed away the obvious \u201cSo now what?\u201d and let his thoughts come randomly as they would; time enough for plans tomorrow.</p><p>After a bit, Buck got up abruptly and went off into the dark. He stayed gone for some time, during which time Roger sat gazing into the fire, replaying every moment he\u2019d spent with Jerry MacKenzie in his mind, trying to fix it all. He wished passionately that it had been daylight, that he\u2019d been able to see more of his father\u2019s face than the brief glimpses he\u2019d had in the beam of the dark lantern.</p><p>Whatever his regrets, though, and the cold knowledge that Jerry wouldn\u2019t make it back\u2014or not back to where he\u2019d started from, at least (God, what if he ended up lost in yet another strange time? Was that possible?)\u2014there was the one small, warm thing. He\u2019d said it. And wherever his father had gone, he\u2019d carry that with him.</p><p>He wrapped himself in his cloak, lay down by the embers of the fire, and carried it with him into sleep.</p><p>WHEN ROGER WOKE in the morning, thickheaded but feeling reasonably okay, Buck had already built up the fire and was frying bacon. The smell of it got Roger into a sitting position, rubbing the last of the sleep from his eyes.</p><p>Buck blotted a slice of thick bacon out of the pan with a bannock and handed it to him. He seemed to have recovered from the aftereffects of Jerry\u2019s leaving; he was disheveled and unshaven, but clear-eyed, and gave Roger an assessing look.</p><p>\u201cAre ye in one piece?\u201d It wasn\u2019t asked as a rhetorical question, and Roger nodded, taking the food. He started to say something in reply, but his throat was constricted, and nothing much came out. He cleared his throat hard, but Buck shook his head, indicating that no effort need be made on his part.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking we\u2019ll head north again,\u201d Buck said, without preamble. \u201cYe\u2019ll want to keep looking for your lad, I suppose\u2014and I want to go to Cranesmuir.\u201d</p><p>So did Roger, though likely for other reasons. He eyed Buck closely, but his ancestor avoided his eye.</p><p>\u201cGeillis Duncan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Buck\u2019s tone was belligerent.</p><p>\u201cI just did,\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cAye, of course ye do.\u201d This didn\u2019t come as a surprise. He chewed his makeshift butty slowly, wondering just how much to tell Buck about Geillis. \u201cYour mother,\u201d he began, and cleared his throat again.</p><p>When Roger had finished, Buck sat in silence for some time, blinking at the last slice of bacon, drying in the pan.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said, but not in tones of shock. More a deep interest, Roger thought, with some unease. Buck glanced up at Roger, speculation in his moss-green eyes. \u201cAnd what d\u2019ye ken about my father, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I can tell ye in a few minutes, and we should be on our way.\u201d Roger got up, brushing crumbs off his knees. \u201cI don\u2019t want to try explaining our presence to any of those hairy buggers. My Old English isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Sumer is icumen in,\u2019\u201d Buck said, with a glance at the leafless, wind-blasted saplings precariously rooted in the cliff\u2019s crevices. \u201c \u2018Lhude sing cuccu.\u2019 Aye, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>SOLSTICE</p><p>December 19, 1980</p><p>Edinburgh, Scotland</p><p>A PRACTICAL GUIDE FOR TIME TRAVELERS\u2014PART II</p><p>It\u2019s almost time. The winter solstice is day after tomorrow. I keep imagining that I can feel the earth shifting slowly in the dark, tectonic plates moving under my feet and . . . things . . . invisibly lining up. The moon is waxing, nearly a quarter full. Have no idea whether that might be important.</p><p>In the morning, we\u2019ll take the train to Inverness. I\u2019ve called Fiona; she\u2019ll meet us at the station, and we\u2019ll eat and change at her house\u2014then she\u2019ll drive us to Craigh na Dun . . . and leave us there. Keep wondering if I should ask her to stay\u2014or at least to come back in an hour, in case one or more of us should still be there, on fire or unconscious. Or dead.</p><p>After dithering for an hour, I called Lionel Menzies, too, and asked him to keep an eye on Rob Cameron. Inverness is a small town; there\u2019s always the chance that someone will see us coming off the train, or at Fiona\u2019s. And word spreads fast. If anything\u2019s going to happen, I want warning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have these brief lucid moments when everything seems okay and I\u2019m filled with hope, almost trembling with anticipation. Most of the time, I keep thinking I\u2019m insane, and then I\u2019m really shaking.</p><p>THE SUCCUBUS OF CRANESMUIR</p><p>Cranesmuir, Scotland</p><p>ROGER AND BUCK stood at the far side of the tiny square in the middle of Cranesmuir, looking up at the fiscal\u2019s house. Roger cast a bleak look at the plinth in the middle of the square, with its wooden pillory. At least there were holes for only one miscreant; no crime waves in Cranesmuir.</p> <p>\u201cThe attic, ye said?\u201d Buck was staring intently at the windows of the top story. It was a substantial house, with leaded windows, and even the attic had some, though smaller than the ones in the lower stories. \u201cI can see plants hanging from the ceiling, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Claire said, aye. That she keeps her . . . her\u201d\u2014the word \u201clair\u201d came to mind, but he discarded this in favor of\u2014\u201cher surgery up there. Where she makes up her potions and charms.\u201d He inspected his cuffs, which were still damp after a hasty sponge bath at the village horse trough to remove the worst stains of travel, and checked to see that his hair ribbon was in order.</p><p>The door opened and a man came out\u2014a merchant, maybe, or a lawyer, well dressed, with a warm coat against the mizzle. Buck shifted to one side, peering to get a look before the door closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a servant at the door,\u201d he reported. \u201cI\u2019ll knock, then, and ask if I can see\u2014Mrs. Duncan, is that her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment, aye,\u201d Roger said. He sympathized entirely with Buck\u2019s need to see his mother. And in all truth, he was curious to meet the woman himself; she was his five-times great-grandmother\u2014and one of the few time travelers he knew about. But he\u2019d also heard enough about her that his feelings were of excitement mixed with considerable unease.</p> <p>He coughed, fist to his mouth. \u201cD\u2019ye want me to come up with you? If she\u2019s to home, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Buck opened his mouth to reply, then closed it, considered a moment, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d he said quietly. He shot Roger a sidelong look, though, with a gleam of humor in it. \u201cYe can help keep the conversation going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy to help,\u201d Roger said. \u201cWe\u2019re agreed, though: ye dinna mean to tell her who ye are. Or what.\u201d</p><p>Buck nodded again, though his eyes were now fixed on the door, and Roger thought he wasn\u2019t attending.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on, then,\u201d and strode across the square, head up and shoulders squared.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Duncan? Well, I dinna ken, gentlemen,\u201d the maid said. \u201cShe\u2019s to hame the day, but Dr. McEwan\u2019s with her just noo.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s heart jumped.</p><p>\u201cIs she ill?\u201d Buck asked sharply, and the maid blinked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cOch, no. They\u2019re takin\u2019 tea in the parlor. Would ye like to step in oot the rain and I\u2019ll go and see what she says?\u201d She stepped back to let them in, and Roger took advantage of this to touch her arm.</p><p>\u201cDr. McEwan\u2019s a friend of ours. Would ye maybe be giving him our names? Roger and William MacKenzie\u2014at his service.\u201d</p><p>They discreetly shook as much water as possible off their hats and coats, but within a few moments the maid was back, smiling.</p><p>\u201cCome up, gentlemen, Mrs. Duncan says, and welcome! Just up the stair there. I\u2019ll just be fetching ye a bit o\u2019 tea.\u201d</p><p>The parlor was one floor above, a small room, rather crowded, but warm and colorful. Neither of the men had eyes for the furnishings, though.</p> <p>\u201cMr. MacKenzie,\u201d Dr. McEwan said, looking surprised but cordial. \u201cAnd Mr. MacKenzie.\u201d He shook hands with them and turned to the woman who had risen from her seat beside the fire. \u201cMy dear, allow me to make you acquainted with an erstwhile patient of mine and his kinsman. Gentlemen, Mrs. Duncan.\u201d</p><p>Roger felt Buck stiffen slightly, and no wonder. He hoped he wasn\u2019t staring himself.</p><p>Geillis Duncan was maybe not a classic beauty, but that didn\u2019t matter. She was certainly good-looking, with creamy-blond hair put up under a lace cap, and\u2014of course\u2014the eyes. Eyes that made him want to close his own and poke Buck in the back to make him do the same, because surely she or McEwan would notice. . . .</p><p>McEwan had noticed something, all right, but it wasn\u2019t the eyes. He was eyeing Buck with a small frown of displeasure, as Buck took a long stride forward, seized the woman\u2019s hand, and boldly kissed it.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Duncan,\u201d he said, straightening up and smiling right into those clear green eyes. \u201cYour most humble and obedient servant, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back, one blond brow raised, with an amused look that met Buck\u2019s implied challenge\u2014and raised it. Even from where he was standing, Roger felt the snap of attraction between them, sharp as a spark of static electricity. So had McEwan.</p><p>\u201cHow is your health, Mr. MacKenzie?\u201d McEwan said pointedly to Buck. He pulled a chair into place. \u201cDo sit down and let me examine you.\u201d</p><p>Buck either didn\u2019t hear or pretended not to. He was still holding Geillis Duncan\u2019s hand, and she wasn\u2019t pulling it away.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas kind of you to receive us, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd certainly we don\u2019t mean to disturb your tea. We\u2019d heard of your skill as a healer and meant to call in what you might say is a professional way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessional,\u201d she repeated, and Roger was surprised at her voice. It was light, almost girlish. Then she smiled again and the illusion of girlishness vanished. She drew her hand away now, but with a languid air of reluctance, her eyes still fixed on Buck with obvious interest. \u201cYour profession, or mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I\u2019m naught but a humble solicitor, ma\u2019am,\u201d Buck said, with a gravity so patently mock that Roger wanted to punch him. Then he added, turning to Roger, \u201cand my kinsman here is a scholar and musician. But as ye see, he\u2019s suffered a sad accident to his throat, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now Roger truly wanted to punch him. \u201cI\u2014\u201d he began, but with the cruel whim of fate, his throat chose that moment to constrict, and his protest ended in a gurgle like a rusty pipe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d heard of ye, mistress, as I said,\u201d Buck went on, putting a sympathetic hand on Roger\u2019s shoulder and squeezing hard. \u201cAnd as I say, we wondered . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d she said, and came to stand in front of Roger, her face suddenly a few inches from his. Behind her, McEwan was growing red in the face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen this man,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt\u2019s a permanent injury, though I was able to offer some small relief. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanent, indeed.\u201d She\u2019d undone his neckcloth in seconds and spread his shirt open, her fingers warm and light on his scar. She shifted her gaze and looked directly into his eyes. \u201cBut a lucky one, I\u2019d say. You didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse but at least serviceable again. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d God, she was unsettling. Claire had described her vividly\u2014but Claire was a woman. She was still touching him, and while her touch was not in any way improper, it was damned intimate.</p><p>Buck was growing restive; he didn\u2019t like her touching Roger any more than McEwan did. He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cI wonder, mistress\u2014might ye have any simples, medicines, perhaps? Not only for my kinsman here, but . . . well . . .\u201d He coughed in a way meant to indicate that he harbored more-delicate ailments that he didn\u2019t wish to mention before others.</p><p>The woman smelled of sex. Very recent sex. It rose from her like incense.</p><p>She stayed in front of Roger for a moment, still looking intently into his face, but then smiled and took her hand away, leaving his throat feeling suddenly cool and exposed.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, switching smile and attention to Buck. \u201cCome up to my wee attic, sir. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve something there that will cure what ails ye.\u201d</p><p>Roger felt gooseflesh ripple across his chest and shoulders, in spite of the good fire on the hearth. Buck and McEwan had both twitched slightly, and she bloody well knew it, though her face was entirely composed. Roger fixed a glare on Buck, willing his ancestor to look at him. Buck didn\u2019t but moved to take Geillis\u2019s arm, pulling her hand through his elbow. A slow, hot flush burned up the back of his neck.</p><p>McEwan made a very small noise in his throat.</p><p>Then Buck and Geillis were gone, the sound of their footsteps and animated voices dying away as they climbed the stairs to the attic, leaving Roger and McEwan both silent, each for his own reasons.</p><p>ROGER THOUGHT that the good doctor might be about to suffer an apoplexy, if that was the correct medical term for \u201cblow a gasket.\u201d Whatever his own feelings about the abrupt departure of Buck and Geillis\u2014and those were vivid\u2014they paled beside the hue of Hector McEwan\u2019s face.</p><p>The doctor was panting slightly, his complexion puce. Plainly he wanted to follow the errant pair but just as clearly was constrained by the fact that he had no idea what he might conceivably do when he caught up with them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Roger said, commending his soul to God and hoping that it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>McEwan swung round to glare at him. \u201cThe devil it\u2019s not,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlainly not as well as you do, no,\u201d Roger said pointedly, and raised one brow.</p><p>McEwan said something blasphemous in reply, took up the poker, and stabbed viciously at the smoking bricks of peat in the hearth. He half-turned toward the door, the poker still in his hand, and the look on his face was such that Roger leapt to his feet and grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>\u201cStop, man,\u201d he said, keeping his voice pitched as low and evenly as he could, in hopes of soothing McEwan. \u201cYe\u2019ll do yourself no good. Sit down, now. I\u2019ll tell ye why it\u2014why he\u2014why the man\u2019s interested in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason every dog in the village is interested in a bitch in heat,\u201d McEwan said venomously. But he let Roger take the poker from his hand, and while he wouldn\u2019t sit down, he did at least take several deep breaths that restored a semblance of calm.</p><p>\u201cAye, tell me, then\u2014for all the good it will do,\u201d he said.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a situation that allowed for diplomacy or euphemism.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s his mother, and he knows it,\u201d Roger said bluntly.</p><p>Whatever McEwan had been expecting, that wasn\u2019t it, and for an instant, Roger was gratified to see the man\u2019s face go absolutely blank with shock. Only for an instant, though. It was likely going to be a tricky bit of pastoral counseling, at best.</p><p>\u201cYe know what he is,\u201d Roger said, taking the doctor by the arm again and pulling him toward a brocaded wing chair. \u201cOr, rather, what we are. Cognosco te?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d McEwan\u2019s voice died, though he opened and closed his mouth a few times, helplessly looking for words.</p><p>\u201cAye, I know,\u201d Roger said soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult. But ye do know, don\u2019t ye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes.\u201d McEwan sat down abruptly. He breathed for a moment, blinked once or twice, and looked up at Roger.</p><p>\u201cHis mother. His mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have it on good authority,\u201d Roger assured him. A thought struck him, though.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . ye did know about her, didn\u2019t ye? That she\u2019s . . . one of us?\u201d</p><p>McEwan nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s never admitted it. Just\u2014just laughed at me when I told her where I\u2019d come from. And I didn\u2019t know for a long time. Not until I\u2014\u201d His lips clamped abruptly into a tight line.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing ye didn\u2019t have occasion to heal her of anything,\u201d Roger said carefully. \u201cDoes she . . . er . . . has it got anything to do with blue light, by chance?\u201d</p><p>He was trying hard to avoid the mental picture of Geillis and Dr. McEwan, naked and sweating, both bathed in a faint blue glow. The woman was his several-times great-grandmother, whatever else you liked to say about her.</p><p>McEwan gave him a bleak look and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot . . . exactly. She\u2019s a very fine herbalist and not bad at diagnosis, but she can\u2019t\u2014do that.\u201d He twiddled his fingers briefly in illustration, and Roger felt a faint memory of the warmth when McEwan had touched his throat.</p><p>The doctor sighed and rubbed a hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cNo point in evasion, I suppose. I got her with child. And I could\u2014\u2018see\u2019 is not quite the right word, but I can\u2019t think of a better one. I could see the moment when my . . . seed . . . reached her ovum. The . . . er . . . the fetus. It glowed inside her womb; I could sense it when I touched her.\u201d</p><p>A certain heat rose in Roger\u2019s face. \u201cForgive me for asking, but\u2014how do you know that happened because she\u2019s . . . what she is? Might it not be the case with a normal woman?\u201d</p><p>McEwan smiled\u2014very bleakly\u2014at the word \u201cnormal,\u201d and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI had two children by a woman in Edinburgh, in\u2014in my own time,\u201d he said quietly, and looked down at his feet. \u201cThat . . . was one of the reasons I didn\u2019t try to return.\u201d</p><p>Roger made a sound in his damaged throat that was meant to be regretful and compassionate, but whether his feelings or his larynx had got the better of him, it emerged as a rather stern \u201cHrmph!\u201d and McEwan\u2019s color began to rise again.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said wretchedly. \u201cI don\u2019t seek to\u2014to excuse it.\u201d</p><p>Just as well, Roger thought. I\u2019d like to see ye try, you\u2014you\u2014 But recriminations would do no one any good just now, and he stifled whatever else he might have said on the subject, instead returning to Geillis.</p><p>\u201cYe said ye got her\u201d\u2014jerking his chin upward, to where the sounds of footsteps and bumpings were audible overhead\u2014\u201cwith child. Where is the child?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>McEwan drew a long, trembling breath. \u201cI said . . . she is a very fine herb-alist . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lord,\u201d Roger said. \u201cDid ye know she meant to do it?\u201d</p><p>McEwan swallowed audibly, but kept silent.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Roger said.</p> <p>\u201cMy God. I know it\u2019s not my place to judge you\u2014but if it was, man, you\u2019d burn in hell.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he went downstairs and out into the streets of Cranesmuir, leaving the lot of them to their own devices.</p><p>HE\u2019D MADE SIXTEEN circuits of the village square\u2014it was a small square\u2014before getting a precarious hold on his sense of outrage. He stood in front of the Duncans\u2019 front door, fists clenched, taking deep, deliberate breaths.</p><p>He had to go back. You didn\u2019t walk away from people who were drowning, even if they\u2019d jumped into a quagmire on purpose. And he didn\u2019t want to think what might happen if McEwan, left to himself, should be overcome by anguish or fury and rush in on the pair in the attic. He really didn\u2019t want to think what Buck\u2014or, God forbid, Geillis\u2014might do in that case, and the thought galvanized him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t trouble knocking. Arthur Duncan was the procurator fiscal; his door was always open. The wee maid poked her head out of an inner door at the sound of his footsteps, but when she saw who he was, she drew it in again, doubtless thinking he\u2019d just stepped out for something.</p> <p>He nearly sprinted up the stair, a guilty conscience now furnishing him with visions of Hector McEwan hanging from the small chandelier in the parlor, helpless feet kicking in the air.</p><p>When he burst in, though, he found McEwan slumped forward in the wing chair, face buried in his hands. He didn\u2019t look up at Roger\u2019s entrance and wouldn\u2019t raise his head even when Roger shook him gently by the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man,\u201d he said gruffly, then cleared his throat. \u201cYe\u2019re still a doctor, aren\u2019t ye? Ye\u2019re needed.\u201d</p><p>That made the man look up, startled. His face was mottled with emotion\u2014anger, shame, desolation, lust. Could lust be an emotion? Roger wondered briefly, but dismissed the consideration as academic at the moment. McEwan straightened his shoulders and rubbed both hands hard over his face, as though trying to erase the feelings so plainly displayed there.</p><p>\u201cWho needs me?\u201d he said, and rose to his feet with a decent attempt at composure.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Roger said, and cleared his throat again, with a noise like falling gravel. It felt like gravel, too; strong emotion choked him, literally. \u201cCome outside, aye? I need air, and so do you.\u201d</p> <p>McEwan cast one last look up at the ceiling, where the noises had now ceased, then firmed his lips, nodded, and, taking up his hat from the table, came along.</p><p>Roger led the way out of the square and past the last house, then up a cow path, dodging heaps of manure, until they reached a drystane wall that they could sit upon. He sat down himself and gestured to McEwan, who sat obediently. The walk had lent the doctor some semblance of calm, and he turned at once to Roger and spread open his collar\u2014this still flapping loose. Roger felt the ghost of Geillis Duncan\u2019s touch on his throat and shivered, but it was cold out, and McEwan took no notice.</p><p>The doctor wrapped his fingers loosely around the scar and seemed to listen for a moment, head to one side. Then he pulled his hand back a little and felt delicately up higher with two probing fingers, then lower, a small frown of concentration on his face.</p><p>And Roger felt it. The same odd sensation of light warmth. He\u2019d been holding his breath under the doctor\u2019s touch, but at this realization he exhaled suddenly\u2014and freely.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said, and put his own hand to his throat. The word had come freely, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better?\u201d McEwan was looking at him intently, his earlier upset subsumed in professional concern.</p><p>\u201cIt . . . is.\u201d The scar was still bumpy under his fingers, but something had changed. He cleared his throat experimentally. A little pain, a little blockage\u2014but noticeably better. He lowered his hand and stared at McEwan. \u201cThank you. What the bloody hell did you do?\u201d</p><p>The tension that had been twanging through McEwan since Roger and Buck had entered the Duncans\u2019 house finally eased, just as the tightness in Roger\u2019s throat had.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I can tell you with any great precision,\u201d he said apologetically. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I know what a sound larynx should feel like, and I can tell what yours feels like, and . . .\u201d He shrugged a little, helpless. \u201cI put my fingers there and . . . envision the way it should feel.\u201d</p><p>He touched Roger\u2019s throat gently again, exploring. \u201cI can tell that it\u2019s very slightly better now. But there is a good deal of damage. I can\u2019t say whether it would ever be completely healed\u2014in all truth, I doubt it. But if I were to repeat the treatment\u2014it seems to need some time between treatments, no doubt for the tissue to heal, just as an external wound would. So far as I can tell, the optimum time between treatments of a serious injury is about a month; Geillis\u2014\u201d And here his face twitched violently; he had forgotten. He mastered himself with an effort, though, and went on, \u201cGeillis thinks that the process may be affected by the phase of the moon, but she is . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA witch,\u201d Roger finished for him.</p><p>The look of unhappiness had returned to McEwan\u2019s face, and he lowered his head to hide it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSurely she is . . . an unusual woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a good thing for the human race that there aren\u2019t more like her,\u201d Roger said, but then checked himself. If he could pray for Jack Randall\u2019s immortal soul, he couldn\u2019t do less for his own great-grandmother, homicidal maniac or not. But the immediate problem was to try to extract the hapless soul before him from her clutches before she could destroy Hector McEwan utterly.</p><p>\u201cDr. McEwan . . . Hector,\u201d he said softly, and laid a hand on the doctor\u2019s arm. \u201cYou need to go right away from this place, and from her. She won\u2019t merely bring you great unhappiness or imperil your soul\u2014she may well kill you.\u201d</p><p>A look of surprise momentarily displaced the unhappiness in McEwan\u2019s eyes. He looked aside, pursed his mouth, and glanced back at Roger, side-long, as though afraid to look at him too directly.</p><p>\u201cSurely you exaggerate,\u201d he said, but the words had no force. McEwan\u2019s own Adam\u2019s apple bobbed visibly as he swallowed.</p><p>Roger drew a deep, unconstricted breath and felt the cold, damp air fresh in his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said gently. \u201cI don\u2019t. Think about it, aye? And pray, if ye can. There is mercy, aye? And forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>McEwan sighed, too, but not with any sense of freedom in it. He cast his eyes down, fixed them on the muddy lane and the rain-dancing puddles in the low spots.</p><p>\u201cI cannot,\u201d he said, his voice low and hopeless. \u201cI\u2019ve . . . tried. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s hand was still on McEwan\u2019s arm. He squeezed, hard, and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll pray for ye. And for her,\u201d he added, hoping no reluctance showed in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cI value that extremely.\u201d But his eyes had lifted and turned, as though he had no power over them, toward Cranesmuir and its smoking chimneys, and Roger knew there was no hope.</p><p>HE WALKED BACK to Cranesmuir and waited in the square \u2019til the door of the Duncans\u2019 house opened and Buck emerged. The man looked mildly surprised\u2014but not displeased\u2014to see Roger, and nodded at him but didn\u2019t speak. They walked together to an ordinary, where they got a room and went upstairs to refresh themselves before supper. The ordinary didn\u2019t run to a bath, but hot water, soap, razor, and towels went some way to restore them to a decent state of cleanliness.</p><p>Buck hadn\u2019t spoken a word more than necessary, but he had an odd expression\u2014half pleased and half ashamed\u2014and kept darting sidelong glances at Roger, as though unsure whether to say something but rather wanting to.</p><p>Roger poured a cup of water from the ewer, drank half of it, and set the cup down with an air of resignation.</p><p>\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said finally. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Buck shot him a quick glance, looking both shocked at the words and slightly amused.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, after a pause long enough to knot Roger\u2019s belly. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m no saying I couldn\u2019t have, though,\u201d he added. \u201cShe . . . wasn\u2019t unwilling.\u201d</p><p>Roger would have said he didn\u2019t want to know, but he wasn\u2019t quite able to deceive himself.</p><p>\u201cYe tried?\u201d</p><p>Buck nodded, then picked up the cup of water and dashed the remnants into his own face, shaking them off with a whoof of breath.</p><p>\u201cI kissed her,\u201d he said. \u201cPut my hand on her breast.\u201d</p><p>Roger had seen the upper slopes of those br**sts as they swelled above her deep-green woolen bodice, round and white as snowdrops\u2014but a lot bigger. By a considerable force of will, he kept himself from asking, \u201cAnd what happened then?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to, though; Buck was obviously reliving the experience and wanted nothing more than to talk about it.</p><p>\u201cShe put her hand on mine, but she didn\u2019t pull my hand away. Not at first. She went on kissing me\u2014\u201d He broke off and looked at Roger, one brow raised. \u201cHave ye kissed many women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t kept count,\u201d Roger said, with a slight edge. \u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour besides her,\u201d Buck said contemplatively. He shook his head. \u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d expect it would be. Kissing your mother, I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that kind of different.\u201d Buck touched his lips with two fingers, lightly as a girl might. \u201cThe other kind. Or maybe I dinna mean that, quite. I kissed a whore once, and it wasna like that at all.\u201d He patted his lips absently for a moment, then realized what he was doing and drew his hand away, looking momentarily embarrassed. \u201cEver gone wi\u2019 a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not,\u201d Roger said, trying not to sound censorious, but not managing all that well.</p><p>Buck shrugged, dismissing it.</p><p>\u201cWell, so. She kept my hand on her breast while she took her time about kissin\u2019 me. But then . . .\u201d He paused, blushing, and Roger drew himself up. Buck, blushing?</p><p>\u201cWhat, then?\u201d he asked, unable to refrain.</p><p>\u201cWell, she drew it down, ken, over her body, very slow, and still kissin\u2019 me, and\u2014well, I must have heard her skirts rustle, mustn\u2019t I? But I wasna paying attention, because when she took my hand and put it on her . . . erm . . . lady part, I thought I\u2019d pass out from the shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer\u2014was she\u2014it, I mean\u2014naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBare as an egg, and just as bald, too,\u201d Buck assured him. \u201cHave ye ever heard of such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, aye.\u201d</p><p>Buck stared at him, green eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYe mean your wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bloody don\u2019t,\u201d Roger snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t ye dare speak of Brianna, an amaidan, or I\u2019ll gie you your head in your hands to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and who else?\u201d Buck said automatically, but waved a hand to calm Roger. \u201cWhy did ye not tell me my mother was a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t tell ye something like that, even if I knew it for a fact, and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Roger said.</p><p>Buck looked at him for a moment in silence, eyes direct. \u201cYe\u2019ll never make a decent minister,\u201d he said at last, \u201cif ye can\u2019t be honest.\u201d</p><p>The words were said objectively, without heat\u2014and stung the more on that account, being true. Roger breathed in hard through his nose and out again.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. And told Buck everything he knew, or thought he knew, concerning Gillian Edgars, alias Geillis Duncan.</p><p>\u201cJesus God,\u201d Buck said, blinking.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Roger said shortly. Buck\u2019s description of his encounter with his mother had given Roger a vividly disturbing image of Brianna, and he hadn\u2019t been able to dismiss it. He hungered for her, and as a result was acutely aware of Buck\u2019s lingering images of Geillis; he saw the man\u2019s hand absently cup itself, fingers drawing slowly in, as though he were guddling\u2014Christ, he could smell her on Buck\u2019s flesh, pungent and taunting.</p><p>\u201cSo now ye\u2019ve met her,\u201d Roger said abruptly, looking away. \u201cAnd now ye ken what she is. Is that enough, do ye think?\u201d He was careful to make the question no more than a question, and Buck nodded, but not in answer, more as though he were having an internal conversation\u2014with himself or with Geillis, Roger didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Buck said thoughtfully, without actually answering. \u201cFrom what he said when we met him at the MacLarens\u2019 croft, I thought he maybe didna ken her yet. But he was interested, ye could tell that.\u201d He looked suddenly at Roger, a thought having struck him.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think it was meeting us that made him\u2014will make him,\u201d he corrected, with a grimace, \u201cgo and find her?\u201d He glanced down, then back up at Roger. \u201cWould I not exist if we hadn\u2019t come to find your wee lad, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Roger felt the usual sense of startled creepiness at realizations of this sort, something like having cold fingers suddenly laid against the small of his back.</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I doubt ye\u2019ll ever know that. Not for sure.\u201d</p><p>He was glad enough to leave the subject of Geillis Duncan, though Buck\u2019s other parent was probably no less dangerous.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think ye need to speak with Dougal MacKenzie?\u201d Roger asked carefully. He didn\u2019t want to go anywhere near Castle Leoch or the MacKenzies, but Buck had a right to do it if he wanted, and Roger himself had an obligation\u2014two of them, as kin and as priest\u2014to help him if he did. And however such a conversation might work out, he doubted very much that it would be as disconcerting as the meeting with Geillis. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As for dangerous, though . . .</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Buck said softly, as though talking to himself. \u201cI dinna ken what I\u2019d say to the man\u2014to either of them.\u201d</p><p>That alarmed Roger, who sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cYe don\u2019t mean ye\u2019d go back to her? To\u2014your mother?\u201d</p> <p>Buck\u2019s mouth curled up on one side.</p><p>\u201cWell, we really didna say much to each other,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d Roger said shortly, \u201cto my father.\u201d</p><p>Buck made an indeterminate noise in his throat, and they fell silent, listening to the growing drum of rain on the slates of the roof. The tiny fire dwindled under the rain coming down the chimney and went out, leaving no more than the faint smell of warmth, and after a bit Roger wrapped himself in his cloak and curled up on one side of the bed, waiting for his body to warm enough for sleep to come.</p><p>The air through the cracked window was sharp with cold and the tingling smell of wet bracken and pine bark. No place smelled like the Highlands, and Roger found his heart eased by its harsh perfume. He was nearly asleep when Buck\u2019s voice came softly to him through the dark.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad ye got to say it, though.\u201d</p><p>NO A VERY GOOD PERSON</p><p>ROGER HAD INSISTED on camping outside the town, thinking it better to get Buck as far away from Geillis Duncan as was feasible. For once, it wasn\u2019t raining, and they\u2019d managed to gather enough in the way of pine twigs for a decent wood fire; pine would usually burn even if damp, because of the resin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no a very good person.\u201d The words were quiet and took a moment to register. Roger looked up to see Buck slumped on his rock, a long stick in his hand, poking at the fire in a desultory fashion. Roger rubbed a hand along his jaw. He felt tired, discouraged, and in no mood for more pastoral counseling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met worse,\u201d he said, after a pause. It sounded unconvincing.</p><p>Buck looked at him from under the fringe of blond hair. \u201cI wasna looking for contradiction or consolation,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cIt was a statement of fact. Call it a preface, if ye like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Roger stretched, yawning, then settled himself. \u201cA preface to what? An apology?\u201d He saw the question on his ancestor\u2019s face and, irritated, touched his throat. \u201cFor this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that.\u201d Buck rocked back a little and pursed his lips, eyes fixed on the scar.</p><p>\u201cAye, that!\u201d Roger snapped, irritation flaring suddenly into anger. \u201cDo you have any notion what it was ye took from me, you bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a bit.\u201d Buck resumed poking at the fire, waiting \u2019til the end of his stick caught, then stubbing it out again in the dirt. He fell silent, then, and for a bit there was no sound but the rattle of wind through the dry bracken. A ghost walking by, Roger thought, watching the brown fronds within the circle of firelight stir and then fall still.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t say it as excuse, mind,\u201d Buck said at last, eyes still fixed on the fire. \u201cBut there\u2019s the matter of intent. I didna mean to get ye hanged.\u201d</p><p>Roger made a low, vicious noise in response to this. It hurt. He was damned tired of it hurting to speak, or sing, or even grunt.</p><p>\u201cBugger off,\u201d he said abruptly, standing up. \u201cJust\u2014bugger off. I don\u2019t want to look at you.\u201d</p><p>Buck gave him a long look, as though debating whether to say something, but then shrugged, got up, and disappeared. He was back within five minutes, though, and sat down with the air of someone who had something to say. Fine, Roger thought. Get on with it.</p> <p>\u201cDid it not occur to the two of ye, whilst reading those letters, that there\u2019s another way for the past to speak to the future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d Roger said, impatient. He stabbed his dirk into one of the turnips to test it; still hard as a rock. \u201cWe thought of all sorts of things\u2014diaries left under stones, newspaper notices\u201d\u2014he grimaced at that one\u2014\u201cand a number of less-useful notions. But most of those options were either too unsure or too risky; that\u2019s why we arranged to use the banks. But . . .\u201d</p><p>He trailed off. Buck was looking smugly superior.</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose you\u2019ve thought of something better?\u201d Roger said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, man, it\u2019s right under your nose.\u201d With a smirk, Buck bent to test his own turnip and, evidently finding the results acceptable, lifted it out of the ashes on the point of his dirk.</p><p>\u201cIf ye think I\u2019m going to ask you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond that\u2014\u201d Buck said, blowing on the hot turnip between phrases, \u201cbeyond that\u2014it\u2019s the only way for the future to speak to the past.\u201d</p><p>He gave Roger a straight, hard look, and Roger felt as though he\u2019d been stabbed with a screwdriver.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014you?\u201d he blurted. \u201cYou mean you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Buck nodded, eyes casually on his smoking turnip.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be you, can it?\u201d He looked up suddenly, green eyes catching the firelight. \u201cYou won\u2019t go. Ye wouldn\u2019t trust me to keep looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d The words caught in Roger\u2019s throat, but he was well aware that they showed in his face.</p><p>Buck\u2019s own face twisted in a lopsided smile. \u201cI would keep looking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I see how ye\u2019d not believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Roger said, clearing his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s only\u2014I can\u2019t leave while Jem might be here. Not when I don\u2019t know for sure that I could come back if I left and he . . . wasn\u2019t at the other end.\u201d He made a helpless gesture. \u201cGo, and know I was maybe abandoning him forever?\u201d</p><p>Buck nodded, looking down. Roger saw the other man\u2019s throat move, too, and was struck by a pang of realization.</p><p>\u201cYour Jem,\u201d Roger said softly. \u201cYou do know where he is, at least. When, I mean.\u201d The question was clear: if Buck was willing to risk the stones again, why would he not do it in search of his own family, rather than to carry a message to Bree?</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re all mine, aren\u2019t ye?\u201d Buck said gruffly. \u201cMy blood. My . . . sons.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, Roger was moved by that. A little. He coughed, and it didn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d he said. He gave Buck a direct look. \u201cWhy? Ye ken it might do for you; it might have done this last time, if McEwan hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm.\u201d Buck poked his turnip again and put it back into the fire. \u201cAye. Well, I meant it; I\u2019m no a very good person. No such a waste, I mean, if I didna make it.\u201d His lips twisted a little as he glanced up at Roger. \u201cYe\u2019ve maybe got a bit more to offer the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d Roger said dryly. \u201cI imagine the world can get on well enough without me, if it came to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, maybe. But maybe your family can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence while Roger digested that, broken only by the pop of a burning twig and the distant hooting of courting owls.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your own family?\u201d he asked at last, quietly. \u201cYe seem to think your wife would be happier without ye. Why? What did ye do to her?\u201d</p><p>Buck made a short, unhappy noise that might have been meant for a wry laugh.</p><p>\u201cFell in love wi\u2019 her.\u201d He took a deep breath, looking down into the fire. \u201cWanted her.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d met Morag Gunn just after he\u2019d begun reading law with a solicitor in Inverness. The lawyer had been called to go out to a farm near Essich, to draw up a will for an old man, and had taken his junior along to see the way of it.</p><p>\u201cIt took three days, for the auld man was that ill, he couldna attend more than a few minutes at a time. So we stayed wi\u2019 the family, and I\u2019d go out to help wi\u2019 the pigs and the chickens when I wasna needed inside.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI was young and no bad-looking, and I had the trick of makin\u2019 women like me. And she did like me\u2014but she was in love wi\u2019 Donald McAllister, a young farmer from Daviot.\u201d</p><p>But Buck had been unable to forget the lass, and whenever he had a day free from the law, would ride out to visit. He came for Hogmanay, and there was a c\u00e8ilidh, and . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd wee Donald had a dram\u2014or two or three or four\u2014too many and was found in a stall wi\u2019 his hand down Mary Finlay\u2019s bodice. God, the stramash there was!\u201d A rueful smile flickered over Buck\u2019s face. \u201cMary\u2019s twa brothers gave Donald laldy and laid him out like a mackerel, and all the lasses were screamin\u2019 and the lads shoutin\u2019 like it was Judgment Day. And poor wee Morag was off behind the cow byre, greetin\u2019 her heart out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, um, comforted her,\u201d Roger suggested, not trying to keep the skeptical note out of his voice. Buck shot him a sharp glance, then shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThought it might be my only chance,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAye. I did. She was the worse for drink herself, and that upset. . . . I didna force her.\u201d His lips pressed together. \u201cBut I didna take no for an answer, either, and after a bit, she gave up sayin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. And when she woke up next morning and realized . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Buck cocked a brow.</p><p>\u201cShe didna say anything to anyone then. It was two months later when she realized . . .\u201d Buck had arrived at Mr. Ferguson\u2019s rooms one day in March to find Morag Gunn\u2019s father and three brothers waiting for him, and as soon as the banns could be read, he was a married man.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Buck took a breath and rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cWe . . . got on. I was mad in love wi\u2019 her, and she kent that and tried to be kind to me. But I knew well enough it was Donald she\u2019d wanted and still did. He was still there, ken, and she\u2019d see him now and then at c\u00e8ilidhean or the cattle sales.\u201d</p><p>It was knowing that that had made Buck take the opportunity to sail for North Carolina with his wife and small child.</p><p>\u201cThought she\u2019d forget,\u201d he said, a little bleakly. \u201cOr at least I wouldna have to see the look in her eyes when she saw him.\u201d</p><p>But things had gone badly for the MacKenzies in the New World; Buck had failed to establish a practice as a solicitor, they had little money and no land, and they had no one in the way of kinfolk to turn to for help.</p><p>\u201cSo we came back,\u201d Buck said. He rolled the turnip out of the fire and stabbed it with his stick; the black crust broke and oozed white. He stared at the vegetable for a moment, then stamped on it, mashing it into the ashes.</p><p>\u201cAnd Donald was still there, of course. Was he married?\u201d</p><p>Buck shook his head, then knuckled the hair out of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt was no good,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt was true, what I told ye about how I came to pass through the stones. But once I\u2019d come to myself and discovered how things were\u2014I kent Morag would be best served if I never came back. Either she\u2019d give me up for dead after a time and marry Donald, or, at the worst, her father would have her back, wi\u2019 the bairns. They\u2019d live well\u2014her da had inherited the farm, when his auld one died.\u201d</p><p>Roger\u2019s throat felt tight but it didn\u2019t matter. He reached out and squeezed Buck\u2019s shoulder, hard. Buck gave a small snort, but didn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>After a bit, though, he heaved a sigh and straightened up, turning to Roger.</p><p>\u201cSo ye see,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I go back and tell your wife what\u2019s to do\u2014and, with luck, come back to tell you\u2014it\u2019s maybe the one good thing I could do. For my family\u2014for yours.\u201d</p><p>It took some time for Roger to get his voice sufficiently under control as to speak.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cWell. Sleep on it. I mean to go up to Lallybroch. Ye\u2019ll maybe go and see Dougal MacKenzie at Leoch. If ye think ye still . . . mean it, after . . . there\u2019s time enough to decide then.\u201d</p><p>A BROTHER OF THE LODGE</p><p>Craigh na Dun, the Scottish Highlands</p><p>December 21, 1980</p><p>ESMERALDA\u2019S HAIR was much too red. Somebody will notice. They\u2019ll ask questions. You idiot, why are you even thinking about it? They\u2019d notice a Barbie in a polka-dot bikini a heck of a lot faster. . . . Brianna shut her eyes for an instant to blot out the sight of Mandy\u2019s rag dolly with her scarlet fright wig, brilliant with a dye much brighter than anything achievable in the eighteenth century. She tripped on a stone, said, \u201cS-word!\u201d under her breath, and, her eyes having flown open, took a firmer hold of Mandy\u2019s free hand, the other being employed to clutch Esmeralda.</p><p>She knew bloody well why she was worrying about the doll\u2019s hair. If she didn\u2019t think of something inconsequential, she was going to turn right around and run down the rocky slope like a panicked hare, dragging Jem and Mandy through the dead gorse.</p><p>We\u2019re going to do it. We have to. We\u2019ll die, we\u2019ll all die in there, in the black . . . Oh, God, oh, God . . .</p><p>\u201cMam?\u201d Jemmy looked up at her, small brow furrowed. She made a good attempt\u2014she thought\u2014at a reassuring smile, but it must have looked less than convincing, judging from his alarmed expression.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, abandoning the smile and putting what little conviction she could muster into her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d He still looked worried, but he turned his face uphill, and his expression smoothed out, intentness replacing concern. \u201cI can hear them,\u201d he said softly. \u201cCan ye hear them, Mama?\u201d</p><p>That \u201cMama\u201d made her hand tighten, and he winced, though she didn\u2019t think he really noticed. He was listening. She came to a stop, and they all listened. She could hear the rush of the wind and a slight patter as brief rain swept through the brown heather. Mandy was humming to Esmeralda. But Jem\u2019s face was turned upward, serious but not frightened. She could just see the pointed top of one of the stones, barely visible above the crest of the hill.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, honey,\u201d she said, letting out just a bit of the huge breath she\u2019d been holding. \u201cNot yet.\u201d What if I can\u2019t hear them at all? What if I\u2019ve lost it? Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us . . . \u201cLet\u2019s . . . get a little closer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been frozen inside for the last twenty-four hours. She hadn\u2019t been able to eat or sleep but had kept going, shoving everything aside, tamping it down\u2014refusing to actually believe they were going to do it, yet making the necessary preparations in a state of eerie calmness.</p><p>The leather bag hanging from her shoulder clanked a little, reassuring in its solid reality. Weight might be heavy to carry\u2014but it would hold her steady against the pull of wind and water, secure against the earth. Jem had let go of her hand, and she reached compulsively through the slit in her skirt to feel the three hard little lumps in the pocket tied round her waist.</p><p>She\u2019d been afraid to try synthetic stones, for fear they wouldn\u2019t work\u2014or might explode violently, like the big opal Jemmy had burst into pieces in North Carolina.</p><p>Suddenly she was swept by a longing for Fraser\u2019s Ridge\u2014and her parents\u2014so intense that tears welled in her eyes. She blinked hard and wiped her eyes on her sleeve, pretending that the wind had made them water. It didn\u2019t matter; neither of the kids was noticing. Now both of them were staring upward\u2014and she finally realized, with a small, flat thump of dread, that she could hear the stones; they were humming, and Mandy was humming with them.</p> <p>She glanced behind her involuntarily, checking to be sure that they hadn\u2019t been followed\u2014but they had. Lionel Menzies was coming up the path behind them, climbing fast.</p><p>\u201cF-word!\u201d she said aloud, and Jem whirled to see what was going on.</p><p>\u201cMr. Menzies!\u201d he said, and his face broke into a smile of relief. \u201cMr. Menzies!\u201d</p><p>Bree gestured firmly to Jem to stay where he was and took a couple of steps down the steep path toward Menzies, little rocks sliding under her shoes and bouncing downhill toward him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he said, coming up breathlessly and stopping just below her. \u201cI\u2014I had to come, be sure you were safe. That you\u2014that you\u2014get away.\u201d He nodded upward, looking beyond her. She didn\u2019t turn to look; she could feel the stones now, humming gently\u2014for the moment\u2014in her bones.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re okay,\u201d she said, her voice surprisingly steady. \u201cReally. Er . . . thank you,\u201d she added, belatedly polite.</p><p>His face was pale and a little strained, but quirked into a small smile at that.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he said, with equal politeness. But he didn\u2019t move to turn and go away. She breathed for a moment, realizing that the frozen core had thawed. She was alive again, completely, and thoroughly on the alert.</p><p>\u201cIs there some reason why we might not be safe?\u201d she asked, watching his eyes behind the glasses. He grimaced slightly and glanced over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d she said. \u201cWho? Rob Cameron?\u201d She spoke sharply and heard the creak of gravel under Jem\u2019s shoes as he turned sharply, hearing the name.</p><p>\u201cHim and his friends, yes.\u201d He nodded uphill. \u201cYou, um, really should go. Now, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>Brianna said something really bad in Gaelic, and Jemmy gave a nervous giggle. She glared at Menzies.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what were you planning to do if Rob and his band of jerks all turned up after us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I just did do,\u201d he said simply. \u201cWarn you. I\u2019d bloody go if I were you. Your, um, daughter . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She whirled round to see Mandy, Esmeralda in the crook of one arm, stumping laboriously up the path.</p><p>\u201cJem!\u201d She took one giant step, seized him by the hand, and they bolted up the hill after Mandy, leaving Lionel Menzies on the path below.</p><p>They caught Mandy up right at the edge of the circle, and Bree tried to grab Mandy\u2019s hand but missed. She could hear Lionel Menzies coming up behind them. \u201cMandy!\u201d She grabbed the little girl and stood, panting, surrounded by stones. The hum was higher-pitched and making her teeth itch; she gnashed them once or twice, trying to rid herself of the feeling, and saw Menzies blink. Good.</p><p>Then she heard the sound of a car\u2019s engine below and saw Menzies\u2019s face change to a look of acute alarm.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he said. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p> <p>She fumbled under her skirt, hands shaking, and finally got hold of all three stones. They were the same kind, small emeralds, though of slightly different cut. She\u2019d chosen them because they reminded her of Roger\u2019s eyes. Thought of him steadied her.</p><p>\u201cJem,\u201d she said, and put a stone in his hand. \u201cAnd, Mandy\u2014here\u2019s yours. Put them in your pockets, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Mandy, little fist clutching her emerald, had turned toward the biggest of the standing stones. Her mouth drooped open for a moment, and then suddenly her face brightened as though someone had lit a candle inside her.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d she shrieked, and, yanking her hand out of Brianna\u2019s, raced directly toward the cleft stone\u2014and into it.</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d Brianna barely heard Menzies\u2019s shocked exclamation. She ran toward the stone, tripped over Esmeralda, and fell full length in the grass, knocking out her wind.</p><p>\u201cMama!\u201d Jem paused for a moment beside her, glancing wildly back and forth between her and the stone where his little sister had just vanished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . okay,\u201d she managed, and with that assurance, Jem charged across the clearing, calling back, \u201cI\u2019ll get her, Mam!\u201d</p><p>She gulped air and tried to shriek after him, but made only a wheezing croak. The sound of feet made her glance fearfully round, but it was only Lionel, who\u2019d run to the edge of the circle, peering down the hillside. In the distance, she could hear car doors slamming. Doors. More than one . . .</p><p>She staggered to her feet; she\u2019d fallen on the bag and bruised her ribs, but that didn\u2019t matter. She limped toward the cleft stone, pausing only to scoop up Esmeralda by reflex. God, God, God . . . was the only thought in her head, an agony of unworded prayer.</p><p>And suddenly the prayer was answered. Both of them stood in front of her, swaying and white-faced. Mandy threw up; Jem sat down hard on his bottom and slumped there, wavering.</p><p>\u201cOh, God . . .\u201d She ran to them, grabbed them hard against her in spite of the nastiness. Jem clung to her a moment, but then pushed himself away.</p><p>\u201cMam,\u201d he said, and his voice was breathless with joy. \u201cMam, he\u2019s there. We could feel him. We can find him\u2014we gotta go, Mam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do.\u201d It was Lionel back, breathless and scared, tugging at Brianna\u2019s cloak, trying to straighten it for her. \u201cThey\u2019re coming\u2014three of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d But then realization struck her, and she turned to the children in panic. \u201cJem, Mandy . . . your stones\u2014where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurned up,\u201d Mandy said solemnly, and spat into the grass. \u201cPuh-toody! Yuck.\u201d She wiped her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they are, Mam. See?\u201d Jem turned out the pocket of his breeches, showing her the burnt spot and the smear of carbon black around it, smelling strongly of scorched wool.</p><p>Frantic, she fumbled at Mandy\u2019s clothes, finding the same scorch mark on the side of her skirt, where the vaporized stone had burned through from her pocket.</p><p>\u201cDid it burn you, honey?\u201d she asked, running a hand down Mandy\u2019s sturdy little thigh.</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Mandy reassured her.</p><p>\u201cBrianna! For God\u2019s sake\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d she shouted, rounding on him, fists clenched. \u201cThe kids\u2019 stones are gone! They can\u2019t\u2014they can\u2019t go through without them!\u201d She didn\u2019t know for sure that this was true, but the thought of letting them try to go into that . . . that . . . without the protection of a stone shriveled her stomach, and she nearly wept with fright and exasperation.</p><p>\u201cStones,\u201d he repeated, looking blank. \u201cJewels, do you mean? Gemstones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He stood for an instant with his mouth open, then fell to his knees, yanking at his left hand, and the next instant was whacking his right hand feverishly against a rock that lay half sunk in the grass.</p><p>Bree stared at him helplessly for a moment, then ran to the edge of the circle, ducked round a stone, and stood flat against it in the shadow, looking out. By peering sideways, she could just see human forms, halfway up the hill and moving fast.</p><p>On the other side of the stone, Menzies gave a grunt of pain or frustration and smacked something hard against the rock, with a small cracking noise.</p><p>\u201cBrianna!\u201d he called, urgent, and she rushed back, afraid the children were trying to go through\u2014but it was all right; they were standing in front of Lionel Menzies, who was stooping over Mandy, holding one of her hands.</p><p>\u201cCurl up your fist, wee lassie,\u201d he said, almost gently. \u201cAye, that\u2019s it. And, Jem\u2014here, put out your hand.\u201d Brianna was close enough now to see that it was a small glittering thing he put in Jem\u2019s palm\u2014and that Mandy\u2019s fist was curled around a large ring, rather battered, with a Masonic emblem carved into its onyx\u2014and the twin of Jem\u2019s small diamond winking beside it, an empty socket on the other side.</p><p>\u201cLionel,\u201d she said, and he reached out and touched her cheek.</p><p>\u201cGo now,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave until ye go. Once you\u2019re gone, though, I\u2019ll run for it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded jerkily, once, then stooped and took the children\u2019s hands. \u201cJem\u2014put that in your other pocket, okay?\u201d She gulped air and turned toward the big cleft stone. The racket of it hammered at her blood and she could feel it pulling, trying to take her apart.</p><p>\u201cMandy,\u201d she said, and could barely hear her own voice. \u201cLet\u2019s find Daddy. Don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>It was only as the screaming began that she realized she\u2019d not said \u201cThank you,\u201d and then she thought no more.</p><p>THE BURYING GROUND</p><p>SHE LOVED LALLYBROCH in winter. The gorse and broom and heather didn\u2019t seem to die so much as simply to fade back into the landscape, the purple heather fading to a soft brown shadow of itself and the broom to a cluster of dry sticks, their long flat pods rattling softly in the wind. Today the air was cold and still, and the soft gray smoke from the chimneys rose straight up to touch the lowering sky.</p><p>\u201cHome, we\u2019re home!\u201d Mandy said, hopping up and down. \u201cGoody, goody, goody! Can I have a Coke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t home, goofy,\u201d Jem said. Only the pink tip of his nose and a flicker of eyelash was visible in the gap between his woolly hat and the muffler round his neck. His breath wisped white. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014then. They don\u2019t have Cokes now. Besides,\u201d he added logically, \u201cit\u2019s too cold to drink Coke. Your tummy would freeze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind, honey,\u201d Brianna said, and tightened her grasp on Mandy\u2019s hand. They were standing at the crest of the hill behind the house, near the remains of the Iron Age fort. It had been a laborious haul up the hill, but she\u2019d been reluctant to approach the house from the front, where they would have been visible for a good quarter mile, coming across open ground.</p><p>\u201cCan you feel Daddy anywhere nearby?\u201d she asked the children. She\u2019d automatically looked for Roger\u2019s old orange Morris in the drive as they\u2019d crested the hill\u2014and felt a ridiculous plunge of spirits at seeing neither car nor graveled drive. Jem shook his head; Mandy didn\u2019t answer, distracted by a faint bleating from below.</p><p>\u201cIss sheep!\u201d she said, delighted. \u201cLet\u2019s go see da sheep!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sheep,\u201d Jem said, rather crossly. \u201cIt\u2019s goats. They\u2019re in the broch. Can we go down now, Mam? My nose is about to fall off.\u201d</p><p>She was still hesitant, watching the house. Every muscle was straining, pulling toward it. Home. But it wasn\u2019t her home, not now. Roger. \u201cThe strong, sweet, supple quality he has . . .\u201d</p><p>Of course, she knew that he likely wasn\u2019t here; he and Buck would be searching somewhere for Jerry MacKenzie. And what if they found him? she thought, with a little thump of something between excitement and fear.</p><p>The fear was what was stopping her racing down the hill to hammer on the door and meet whatever of her family happened to be home today. She\u2019d spent the last few days on the road, and the hours on the final walk from where the carter had dropped them, trying to decide\u2014and her mind was still as divided as ever.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said to the kids. She couldn\u2019t keep them standing out here in the cold while she made up her mind. \u201cLet\u2019s visit the goats first.\u201d</p><p>The smell of goats struck her the moment she opened the door\u2014pungent, warm, and familiar. Warm, above all; all three humans sighed in relief and pleasure as the animal heat rolled over them, and they smiled at the eager rush and outcry of mehhs that greeted their presence.</p><p>From the noise that echoed off the stone walls, there might have been fifty goats inside the broch\u2014though Brianna counted only half a dozen nannies, flop-eared and dainty, four or five half-grown, round-bellied kids, and a single robust billy goat who lowered his horns and glowered at them, suspicious and yellow-eyed. All of them shared a rough pen that fenced off half the ground floor of the broch. She glanced up\u2014but instead of the exposed rafters high above that she half-expected to see, there was the intact underside of another floor above.</p><p>The kids\u2014her kids, that is, and she smiled at the thought\u2014were already sticking wisps of hay through the fence and playing with the young goats, who were standing on their back legs to peer at the visitors.</p><p>\u201cJemmy, Mandy!\u201d she called. \u201cTake off your hats and mufflers and mittens and put them over by the door, so the goats don\u2019t chew on them!\u201d She left Jem to distentangle Mandy from her fuzzy muffler and went up the stair to see what was on the second floor.</p><p>Pale winter light from the windows striped the haunches of burlap bags that filled most of the floor space. She breathed in and coughed a little; flour dust was floating in the air, but she smelled the sweetness of dried corn\u2014maize, they called it\u2014and the deeper, nutty smell of ripe barley, as well, and when she nudged her foot against a particularly lumpy sack, she heard the shift and clack of hazelnuts. Lallybroch wouldn\u2019t starve this winter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Curious, she went up one more flight and on the top floor found a good number of small wooden casks arrayed against the wall. It was much colder up here, but the heady aroma of good whisky filled the air with the illusion of warmth. She stood breathing it in for a moment, wanting very badly to be drunk on the fumes, to obliviate her mind, be able not to bloody think, if only for a few minutes.</p><p>But that was the last thing she could do. In minutes, she\u2019d have to act.</p><p>She stepped back onto the narrow stair that wound up between the inner and outer walls of the broch and looked out toward the house, with vivid memories of the last time she had been here, crouched on the stair in the dark with a shotgun in her hands, watching the light of strangers in her house.</p><p>There were strangers here now, too, although her own blood. What if . . . She swallowed. If Roger had found Jerry MacKenzie, his father would be only in his early twenties\u2014much younger than Roger himself. And if her own da was here now\u2014</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t be,\u201d she whispered to herself, and wasn\u2019t sure if that was reassurance or regret. She\u2019d met him for the first time in North Carolina, pissing against a tree. He\u2019d been in his forties, she twenty-two.</p><p>You couldn\u2019t enter your own lifeline, couldn\u2019t exist in the same time twice. They thought they knew that for sure. But what if you entered someone else\u2019s life twice, at different times?</p><p>That was what was turning her blood to ice and making her curled fists tremble. What happened? Did one or the other of your appearances change things, perhaps cancel out the other? Would it not happen that way, would she not meet Jamie Fraser in North Carolina if she met him now?</p><p>But she had to find Roger. No matter what else happened. And Lallybroch was the only place she knew for sure he\u2019d been. She took a deep, deep breath and closed her eyes.</p><p>Please, she prayed. Please help me. Thy will be done, but please show me what to do . . .</p> <p>\u201cMam!\u201d Jemmy came running up the stair, his footsteps loud in the confined stone corridor. \u201cMam!\u201d He popped into sight, blue eyes round and hair standing half on end with excitement. \u201cMam, come down! A man\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d she asked, urgent, grabbing him by the sleeve. \u201cWhat color is his hair?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, surprised.</p><p>\u201cBlack, I think. He\u2019s at the bottom of the hill\u2014I couldn\u2019t see his face.\u201d</p><p>Roger.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019m coming.\u201d She felt half choked but no longer frozen. It was happening now, whatever it was, and energy fizzed through her veins.</p> <p>Even as she hurtled down the stairs behind Jemmy, rationality told her that it wasn\u2019t Roger\u2014distance or not, Jemmy would know his father. But she had to see.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d she said to the children, with so much command in her voice that they blinked but didn\u2019t argue. She threw open the door, saw the man coming up the path, and stepped out to meet him, closing the door firmly behind her.</p><p>From the first glance, she saw that it wasn\u2019t Roger, but the disappointment was subsumed at once in relief that it wasn\u2019t Jamie. And intense curiosity, because it must surely be . . .</p><p>She\u2019d run down the path, to get well away from the broch, just in case, and was picking her way through the stones of the family burying ground, eyes on the man coming up the steep, rocky path.</p><p>A tall, solid-looking man, his dark hair graying a little but still thick, glossy, and loose on his shoulders. His eyes were on the rough ground, watching his footing. And then he came to his destination and made his way across the hill, to one of the stones in the burying ground. He knelt by it and laid down something he\u2019d been carrying in his hand.</p><p>She shifted her weight, uncertain whether to call out or wait \u2019til he\u2019d finished his business with the dead. But the small stones under her feet shifted, too, rolling down with a click-clack-click that made him look up and, seeing her, rise abruptly to his feet, black brows raised.</p><p>Black hair, black brows. Brian Dubh. Black Brian.</p><p>I met Brian Fraser (you would like him, and he, you) . . .</p> <p>Wide, startled hazel eyes met hers, and for a second that was all she saw. His beautiful deep-set eyes, and the expression of stunned horror in them.</p><p>\u201cBrian,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Dhia!\u201d He went whiter than the harled plaster of the house below. \u201cEllen!\u201d</p><p>Astonishment deprived her of speech for an instant\u2014long enough to hear light footsteps scrambling down the hill behind her.</p><p>\u201cMam!\u201d Jem called, breathless.</p><p>Brian\u2019s glance turned up, behind her, and his mouth fell open at sight of Jem. Then a look of radiant joy suffused his face.</p><p>\u201cWillie!\u201d he said. \u201cA bhalaich! Mo bhalaich!\u201d He looked back at Brianna and stretched out a trembling hand to her. \u201cMo ghr\u00e0idh . . . mo chridhe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian,\u201d she said softly, her heart in her voice, filled with pity and love, unable to do anything but respond to the need of the soul that showed so clearly in his lovely eyes. And with her speaking of his name for the second time, he stopped dead, swaying for a moment, and then the eyes rolled up in his head and he fell.</p><p>SHE WAS KNEELING in the crunchy dead heather beside Brian Fraser before she\u2019d even thought to move. There was a slight blue tinge to his lips, but he was breathing, and she drew a deep cold breath of relief herself, seeing his chest rise slowly under the worn linen shirt.</p><p>Not for the first time, she wished fervently that her mother was there, but turned his head to one side and laid two fingers on the pulse she could see at the side of his neck. Her fingers were cold, and his flesh was startlingly warm. He didn\u2019t rouse or stir at her touch, though, and she began to fear that he hadn\u2019t just fainted.</p><p>He\u2019d died\u2014would die\u2014of a stroke. If there was some weakness in his brain . . . oh, God. Had she just killed him prematurely?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die!\u201d she said to him aloud. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t die here!\u201d</p><p>She glanced hastily toward the house below, but no one was coming. Looking down again, she saw what it was he\u2019d held: a small bouquet of evergreen twigs, tied with red thread. Yew\u2014she recognized the oddly tubular red berries\u2014and holly.</p><p>And then she saw the stone. She knew it well, had sat on the ground beside it often, contemplating Lallybroch and those who lay sleeping on its hillside.</p><p>Ellen Caitriona Sileas MacKenzie Fraser</p><p>Beloved wife and mother</p><p>Born 1691, Died in childbed 1729</p><p>And below, in smaller letters:</p><p>Robert Brian Gordon MacKenzie Fraser</p><p>Infant son</p><p>Died at birth 1729</p><p>And:</p><p>William Simon Murtagh MacKenzie Fraser</p><p>Beloved son</p><p>Born 1716, Died of the smallpox 1727</p><p>\u201cMam!\u201d Jem skidded down the last few feet, almost falling beside her. \u201cMam, Mam\u2014Mandy says\u2014who is he?\u201d He stared from Brian\u2019s pallid face to her own and back again.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Brian Fraser. He\u2019s your great-grandfather.\u201d Her hands were trembling, but to her surprise she felt suddenly calm at the speaking of the words, as though she had stepped into the center of a puzzle and found herself to be the missing piece. \u201cWhat about Mandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I scare him?\u201d Jem squatted down, looking worried. \u201cHe looked at me just before he fell down. Is he\u2014dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I think he\u2019s just had a shock. He thought we were . . . somebody else.\u201d She touched Brian\u2019s cheekbone, feeling the soft prickle of his beard stubble, and smoothed the tumbled hair behind his ear. His mouth twitched a little as she did so, the ghost of a half smile, and her heart jumped. Thank God, he was coming round. \u201cWhat did Mandy say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Jem stood up, fast, eyes wide. \u201cShe says she hears Dad!\u201d</p><p>REALITY IS THAT WHICH, WHEN YOU STOP BELIEVING IN IT, DOESN\u2019T GO AWAY</p><p>ROGER TURNED HIS horse\u2019s head toward Lallybroch, knowing nowhere else to go. He\u2019d taken leave of Brian Fraser six weeks before and had been sad at what he\u2019d thought was a permanent parting. His heart was eased a little now at the thought of seeing Brian again. Also at the certainty of a sympathetic ear, even though there was little he could openly discuss with him.</p><p>He\u2019d have to tell Brian, of course, that he hadn\u2019t found Jem. That thought was a thorn in his heart, and one felt at every beat. For the last weeks, he had been able to put the brutal ache of Jemmy\u2019s absence aside for a little, hoping that somehow, finding Jerry might also lead to finding Jem. But it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>What the devil it did mean was a complete mystery. Had he found the only Jeremiah there was to be found here? If he had . . . where was Jem?</p><p>He wanted to tell Brian that he\u2019d found the man to whom the identity disks belonged\u2014Brian would ask. But how to do so without divulging either Jerry\u2019s identity, Roger\u2019s relationship with him\u2014or explaining what had happened to him? He sighed, reining his horse around a large puddle in the road. Maybe better to say simply that he\u2019d failed, hadn\u2019t found J. W. MacKenzie\u2014though it troubled him to lie outright to such an openhearted man.</p><p>And he couldn\u2019t discuss Buck, either. Beyond thought of Jem, Buck was the matter lying heaviest on his mind at the moment.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll never make a decent minister, if ye can\u2019t be honest.\u201d He\u2019d tried to be. The honest truths of the situation from his own selfish point of view were that he\u2019d miss Buck\u2019s company badly, that he was deeply jealous of the possibility that Buck might make it to Brianna, and\u2014not least, he assured himself\u2014that he was terrified that Buck wouldn\u2019t make it through the stones again. He\u2019d die in the void, or maybe be lost once more, alone in some random time.</p><p>The truth for Buck was that while it could be argued (and with no little force) that Buck should remove himself forthwith and permanently from the vicinity of Geillis Duncan, going through the stones was maybe the least desirable means of ensuring such an outcome.</p><p>To accept Buck\u2019s gallant gesture was a temptation, though. If he could make it, tell Bree where Roger was . . . Roger didn\u2019t think Buck could come back, though. The effects of travel were cumulative, and Hector McEwan likely wouldn\u2019t be standing by next time.</p><p>But if Buck was willing to risk the crossing, in spite of the very real danger to his own life, surely it was Roger\u2019s obligation to try to persuade him to return to his own wife, rather than to Roger\u2019s?</p><p>He brushed the back of his hand against his lips, feeling in memory the softness of Morag\u2019s brown hair on his cheek when he\u2019d bent to kiss her forehead on the banks of the Alamance. The gentle trust in her eyes\u2014and the fact that she\u2019d bloody saved his own life very shortly thereafter. His fingers rested for an instant on his throat, and he realized, with the flicker of surprise that attends recognition of things already long known, that whatever the bitterness of his regrets about his voice, he\u2019d never for an instant wished that she hadn\u2019t saved him.</p><p>When Stephen Bonnet would have thrown Morag\u2019s son overboard, Roger had saved the child from drowning, and that at some risk to his own life. But he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d done what she\u2019d done at Alamance in payment of that debt. She\u2019d done it because she didn\u2019t want him to die.</p><p>Well. He didn\u2019t want Buck to die.</p><p>Did Morag want Buck back? Buck thought not, but he might be wrong. Roger was fairly sure that the man still loved Morag and that his abnegation was due as much to Buck\u2019s own sense of personal failure as to what he thought Morag\u2019s desires might be.</p><p>\u201cEven if that\u2019s true,\u201d he said aloud, \u201cwhere do I get off trying to manage people\u2019s lives?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and rode on through a light mist that wove shreds of fog through the wet black spikiness of the gorse. It wasn\u2019t raining, that was one thing, though the sky bore a burden of cloud that brought it down to shroud the tops of the nearby mountains.</p><p>He\u2019d never asked his adoptive father anything about the art of being a priest; it was the last thing he\u2019d ever thought of being. But he\u2019d grown up in the Reverend\u2019s house and had seen parishioners come every day to the comfortably shabby study in search of help or advice. He remembered his father (and now felt a new oddness in the word, layered as it was with the freshness of Jerry MacKenzie\u2019s physical presence), remembered him sitting down with a sigh to drink tea in the kitchen with Mrs. Graham, shaking his head in response to her questioning look and saying, \u201cSometimes there\u2019s nothing you can give some of them but a friendly ear and a prayer to be going on with.\u201d</p><p>He came to a dead stop in the road, closed his eyes, and tried to find a moment\u2019s peace in the chaos of his thoughts. And ended, as every priest since Aaron\u2019s time doubtless had, by throwing up his hands and demanding, \u201cWhat do You want of me? What the hell should I do about these people?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes when he said that, but instead of finding an angel with an illuminated scroll standing before him, he was confronted by the beady yellow eyes of a fat seagull sitting in the road a few feet from his horse and not discomposed in the slightest by the presence of a creature a hundred times its size. The bird gave him an old-fashioned sort of look, then spread its wings and flapped off with a piercing screek! This echoed from the hillside above, where a few more gulls wheeled slowly, barely visible against the paper-white sky.</p><p>The presence of the gull broke his sense of isolation, at least. He rode on in a calmer frame of mind, resolved only not to think about things until he had to.</p><p>He thought he was close to Lallybroch; with luck, would reach it well before dark. His belly rumbled at the prospect of tea, and he felt happier. Whatever he could and couldn\u2019t tell Brian Fraser, just seeing Brian and his daughter Jenny again would be a comfort.</p><p>The gulls cried high overhead, still wheeling, and he looked up. Sure enough: he could just make out the low ruins of the Iron Age hill fort up there, the ruins he\u2019d rebuilt\u2014would rebuild? What if he never got back to\u2014Jesus, don\u2019t even think about it, man, it\u2019ll drive you crazier than you are already. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nudged the horse and it reluctantly accelerated a bit. It accelerated a lot faster in the next moment, when a crashing noise came from the hillside just above.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! Whoa, you eedjit! Whoa, I said!\u201d These adjurations, along with a heave of the reins to bring the horse\u2019s head around, had an effect, and they ended facing back the way they\u2019d come, to see a young boy standing, panting, in the middle of the road, his red hair all on end, nearly brown in the muted light.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d he said, and his face lit as though touched by a sudden sun. \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>ROGER HADN\u2019T ANY memory of leaving his horse or running down the road. Or of anything else. He was sitting in the mud and the mist in a patch of wet bracken with his son hugged tight to his chest, and nothing else mattered in the world.</p> <p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jem kept saying, gasping with sobs, \u201cDaddy, Daddy . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he whispered into Jem\u2019s hair, the tears running down his own face. \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Jem took a shuddering breath, managed to say, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d and cried some more.</p><p>At last, a sense of time crept back, along with the sensation of water soaking through the seat of his breeches. He breathed and shuddered a bit himself, smoothed Jem\u2019s hair, and kissed his head.</p><p>\u201cYou smell like a goat,\u201d he said, swallowed, brushed at his eyes with the back of a hand, and laughed. \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the broch with Mandy,\u201d Jem said, as though this was the most natural statement in the world. He gave Roger a faintly accusing look. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMandy?\u201d Roger said blankly. \u201cWhat do you mean Mandy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister,\u201d Jem said, with the patience children occasionally show for the denseness of their parents. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . where is Mandy, then?\u201d In Roger\u2019s state of surreal confusion, Mandy might just as well have popped up beside Jem like a mushroom.</p><p>Jem\u2019s face went momentarily blank with confusion, and he glanced round as though expecting Mandy to materialize out of the moss and heather at any moment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, sounding mildly puzzled. \u201cShe ran away to find you, and then Mam fell down and broke something and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Roger had let go of Jem but grabbed him again at this, startling the breath out of the boy.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s here, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure,\u201d Jem said, sounding mildly annoyed. \u201cI mean\u2014not here here. She\u2019s up there, in the old fort. She tripped on a rock when we were running to catch Mandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Lord,\u201d Roger said fervently, taking a stride in the direction of the fort, then halting abruptly. \u201cWait: you said she broke something\u2014she\u2019s hurt?\u201d</p><p>Jem shrugged. He was beginning to look worried again, but not very worried. Dad was here; everything would be okay.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad,\u201d he assured his father. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t walk, though, so she told me to run and catch Mandy. But I found you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. She\u2019s awake, though, she\u2019s talking?\u201d He had Jem by the shoulders, as much to keep him from disappearing\u2014he half-feared he was hallucinating\u2014as to compel an answer.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Jem was looking vaguely about, a slight frown on his face. \u201cMandy\u2019s here someplace. . . .\u201d Wriggling free, he turned round slowly, face creased in intent concentration.</p> <p>\u201cMandy!\u201d Roger shouted up the hill. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled again. \u201cBREE!\u201d He scanned the fort and the hillside anxiously for Bree\u2019s head popping up above the ruins or any sign of agitation among the vegetation that might be occasioned by a scrambling three-year-old. No head showed, but a breeze had come up and the whole hill seemed alive.</p><p>\u201cMandy ran away down this hill?\u201d he asked, and, at Jem\u2019s nod, he glanced behind him. The land flattened out into moor on the other side of the road, and there wasn\u2019t a glimpse of anything that might be Mandy on it. Unless she\u2019d fallen down and was lying in a hollow . . .</p><p>\u201cYou stay right here,\u201d he said to Jem, squeezing his shoulder hard. \u201cI\u2019m going to go up the hill and look. I\u2019ll bring your mother down.\u201d He bounded up the gravel trace that was the nearest thing there was to a path, calling out Mandy\u2019s name at intervals, torn between overwhelming joy and terrifying panic, lest it not be real, lest he actually had cracked and was simply imagining that Jem was there\u2014he turned at every third step to check that he was there, still standing on the road.</p><p>Bree. The thought that she was up there, just above him . . . \u201cMandy!\u201d he shouted again, his voice cracking. But it cracked from emotion, and he realized in a startled instant that he\u2019d been shouting at full volume for minutes now\u2014and it hadn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cGod bless you, Hector,\u201d he said fervently under his breath, and went on, beginning now to zigzag back and forth across the hill, beating through the sticks of dry broom and birch saplings, kicking at gorse and dead ferns in case Mandy should have fallen, maybe knocked herself out on a rock.</p><p>He heard the seagulls shriek above, thin and piercing, and looked up, hoping to see Brianna peering over the wall of the fort. She wasn\u2019t, but something called again\u2014thin and piercing, but not a gull.</p><p>\u201cDaddeeeee . . .\u201d</p><p>He whirled, almost losing his footing, and saw Jem running down the road\u2014and coming round the bend of that road, Buck\u2019s horse with Buck atop him, and a wildly squirming bundle with black curly hair cradled precariously in Buck\u2019s arm.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t speak at all by the time he reached them.</p><p>\u201cThink ye might have lost something,\u201d Buck said gruffly, and handed Mandy carefully down to him. She was a heavy, lively weight in his arms\u2014and smelled of goats.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d she exclaimed, beaming at him as though he\u2019d just come in from work. \u201cMwah! Mwah!\u201d She kissed him noisily and snuggled into his chest, her hair tickling his chin.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Jem was saying accusingly.</p><p>\u201cWhere was you?\u201d Mandy countered, and stuck her tongue out at him. \u201cBleah.\u201d</p><p>Roger was crying again, couldn\u2019t stop. Mandy had burrs and foxtails stuck in her hair and in the fabric of her jacket, and he thought she might have wet herself somewhere in the recent past. Buck twitched the reins, as though about to turn and go, and Roger reached out a hand and grabbed his stirrup.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he croaked. \u201cTell me it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>Buck made an incoherent noise, and, looking up through his tears, Roger could see that Buck was making an inadequate attempt at hiding his own emotion.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Buck said, sounding almost as choked as Roger. He looped his reins and, sliding off into the road, took Jem very gently into his own arms. \u201cAye, it\u2019s real.\u201d</p><p>FROTTAGE</p><p>DR. MCEWAN WAS a single man and owned a single bed. The bed was presently accommodating four people, and even if two of those people were not full-sized, the general atmosphere was that of the London Tube in rush hour. Heat, random flesh in all directions, and a distinct shortage of oxygen.</p><p>Brianna squirmed, trying to find room to breathe. She was lying on her side, back pressed to the wall, with Mandy squashed into a heavily breathing mass between her parents. Roger balanced precariously on the bed\u2019s outer edge with Jem draped bonelessly over him, Jem\u2019s legs occasionally twitching spasmodically, prodding Bree in the shins. And Esmeralda was taking up most of the single pillow, red yarn hair getting up everyone\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the word \u2018frottage\u2019?\u201d Bree whispered to Roger. He wasn\u2019t asleep; if he had been, he\u2019d have been on the floor by now.</p><p>\u201cI do. Why, do ye want to try it now?\u201d He reached carefully across Jem and stroked her bare arm lightly. The fine hairs rose on her forearm; she could see them do it, lifting silently in the dull glow from the hearth.</p><p>\u201cI want to do less of it with a three-year-old. Mandy\u2019s zonked. Is Jem asleep enough to move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out. I\u2019m going to suffocate if he\u2019s not.\u201d Roger edged out from under his son, who emitted a loud \u201cmmmm,\u201d but then smacked his lips and subsided. Roger patted him softly, bent to check that he was solidly asleep, and straightened up. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d appeared at McEwan\u2019s door well after dark, Brianna supported between Roger and Buck, the children at their heels. The doctor, while clearly surprised at this nocturnal invasion of MacKenzies, had taken it calmly, sitting Bree down in his surgery with her foot in a pan of cold water and then going to call his landlady to find a bit of supper for the children.</p><p>\u201cA sprain, and not too bad,\u201d he\u2019d assured Brianna, drying her foot with a linen towel and expertly palpating her swollen ankle. He passed a thumb up the problematic tendon and noted her wince. \u201cIt will just take time to heal\u2014but I think I can ease the pain a bit . . . if you like?\u201d He glanced toward Roger, brow raised, and Brianna breathed in through her nose.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his ankle,\u201d she said, mildly annoyed. \u201cAnd I\u2019d certainly appreciate anything you can do.\u201d</p><p>Roger nodded, to her further annoyance, and McEwan took her foot onto his knee. Seeing her grip the edges of the stool to keep her balance, Roger knelt behind her and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cLean on me,\u201d he said quietly in her ear. \u201cJust breathe. See what happens.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a puzzled look, but he merely brushed her ear with his lips and nodded toward McEwan.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s head was bent over the foot, which he held lightly in both hands, his thumbs on her instep. He moved them slowly in circles, then pressed firmly. A sharp pain shot up her ankle, but died abruptly before she could gasp.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s hands were noticeably warm on her chilled flesh, and she wondered at that, since they\u2019d been immersed in the same cold water as her foot. One hand now cupped her heel, and thumb and forefinger massaged the puffy flesh lightly, repeatedly, then a little harder. The sensation hovered unsettlingly somewhere between pain and pleasure.</p><p>McEwan looked up suddenly and smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cIt will take a little time,\u201d he murmured. \u201cRelax, if you can.\u201d</p><p>In fact, she could. For the first time in twenty-four hours, she wasn\u2019t hungry. For the first time in days, she was beginning to thaw out completely\u2014and for the first time in months, she wasn\u2019t afraid. She let out her breath and eased her head back on Roger\u2019s shoulder. He made a low humming noise in his throat and took a firmer hold, settling himself.</p><p>She could hear Mandy telling Jem a disjointed story about Esmeralda\u2019s adventures, in the back room where the landlady had taken them to eat their soup and bread. Sure that they were safe, she gave herself up to the elemental bliss of her husband\u2019s arms and the smell of his skin.</p><p>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;</p><p>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists . . .</p><p>\u201cBree,\u201d Roger whispered to her some moments later. \u201cBree\u2014look.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw at first the curve of his wrist where it rested on her bosom, the hard elegance of bone and the curve of muscled forearm. But then her focus widened and she started a little. Her toes were glowing with a faint blue light barely visible in the crevices between them. She blinked hard and looked again, to be sure she was really seeing it, but the sound Roger made in his throat assured her that she was\u2014and that he saw it, too.</p><p>Dr. McEwan had felt her startlement; he looked up and smiled again, this time joyful. His eyes flicked up toward Roger, then back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou, too?\u201d he said. \u201cI thought so.\u201d He held her foot still for a long moment, until she thought she felt the pulse in his fingers echo in the spaces between the small bones, and then he wrapped a bandage neatly around her ankle and lowered her foot gently to the floor. \u201cBetter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and found her voice a little husky. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to ask him questions, but he rose and put on his coat.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll oblige me greatly by staying here the night,\u201d he said firmly, still smiling at her. \u201cI\u2019ll find a bed with a friend.\u201d And raising his hat to Roger, he bowed and went out, leaving them to put the children to bed.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Mandy had put up a fuss at sleeping in a strange bed in a strange room, complaining that Esmeralda thought the surgery smelled funny and was scared of the big wardrobe because there might be kelpies in it.</p><p>\u201cKelpies only live in water, silly,\u201d Jem had said, but he also looked a little apprehensively at the enormous dark armoire with its cracked door. So they\u2019d all lain down on the narrow bed together, parents comforted as much as children by sheer physical proximity.</p><p>Brianna felt the soft warmth and the haze of exhalation blanketing her bodily exhaustion, a pull on her senses beckoning her toward the well of sleep. But not nearly such a strong pull as her sense of Roger.</p><p>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees; dress does not hide him . . .</p><p>She lay for a moment, hand on Mandy\u2019s back, feeling the slow beating of the child\u2019s heart, watching as Roger scooped Jem into his arms and turned to lay him down on one of the extra quilts McEwan\u2019s landlady had brought up with the soup.</p><p>The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel . . .</p><p>He was dressed in nothing but shirt and breeks and now paused to shed the homespun breeks, casually scratching his arse in relief, the long linen shirt momentarily rucked up to show the lean curve of a buttock. Then he came to pick up Mandy, smiling over her stertorously breathing body at Bree.</p><p>\u201cLeave the bed to the kids, you think? We could make up a pallet with the cloaks\u2014if they\u2019ve dried out a bit\u2014and quilts in the surgery.\u201d He gathered Mandy up like an armful of laundry, and Bree was able to sit up and scoot across the bed, feeling a wonderful movement of air through her perspiration-dampened shift and a brush of soft fabric across her br**sts that made her ni**les rise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned back the bedding; he moved the children back to the bed, and she covered them and kissed their dreaming faces, kissing Esmeralda for good measure before tucking her into Mandy\u2019s arm. Roger turned toward the closed door to the surgery and looked back at Bree over his shoulder, smiling. She could see the shadow of his body through the linen shirt, against the glow of the hearth.</p><p>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more . . .</p><p>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.</p><p>\u201cWilt bed with me, lass?\u201d he said softly, and put out a hand to her.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said, and came to him.</p><p>THE SURGERY WAS cold, after the humid heat of the bedroom, and they came to each other at once, warm limbs and warm lips seeking. The fire in this room had gone out, and they didn\u2019t trouble to rebuild it.</p><p>Roger had kissed her the moment he saw her on the ground in the fort, grabbing her and lifting her into an embrace that crushed her ribs and nearly bruised her lips. She\u2019d had no objections whatever. But now his mouth was soft and tender and the scruff of his beard light on her skin.</p><p>\u201cFast?\u201d he murmured against her mouth. \u201cSlow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorizontal,\u201d she murmured back, clutching his bottom. \u201cSpeed irrelevant.\u201d She was standing on one leg, the bad foot elegantly\u2014she hoped\u2014extended behind her. Dr. McEwan\u2019s ministrations had eased the throbbing quite a bit, but she still couldn\u2019t put weight on it for more than the briefest second.</p> <p>He laughed\u2014quietly, with a guilty look toward the bedroom door\u2014and, bending suddenly, scooped her up and staggered across the room to the coat rack, where she snagged the hanging cloaks and tossed them onto the floor by the table, that being the cleanest open space visible. He squatted, back creaking audibly and manfully suppressing a groan as he lowered her gently onto the heap.</p><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d she whispered, and not jokingly. \u201cYou could put your back out, and then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ye\u2019d get to be on top,\u201d he whispered back, and ran a hand up her thigh, her shift rippling up with it. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t, so ye don\u2019t.\u201d Then he pulled up his shirt, spread her legs, and came to her with an incoherent noise of deep satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI hope ye meant it about the speed being irrelevant,\u201d he said in her ear, a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes,\u201d she said vaguely, and wrapped her arms round his body. \u201cYou . . . just . . . stay put.\u201d When she could, she let him go, cradling his head and kissing the smooth warm flesh at the side of his neck. She felt the rope scar and gently drew the tip of her tongue along it, making gooseflesh erupt all over his back and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAre you asleep?\u201d he inquired some moments later, suspicious.</p> <p>She opened one eye halfway. He\u2019d gone back into the bedroom for quilts and was kneeling beside her, spreading one over her. It smelled faintly musty, with a tang of mice, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and rolled onto her back, feeling wonderful, despite the hard floor, her sprained ankle, and the dawning realization that Dr. McEwan must do operations and amputations on the table. There was a dark stain on the underside, above her head. \u201cJust . . . limp.\u201d She stretched out a slow hand to Roger, urging him under the quilt with her. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asleep,\u201d he assured her, sliding down close beside her. \u201cAnd if ye think I\u2019m going to say \u2018limp,\u2019 think again.\u201d</p><p>She laughed\u2014quietly, with a glance at the door\u2014rolled over, and rested her forehead against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI thought I might never see you again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said softly, and his hand stroked her long hair and her back. \u201cMe, too.\u201d They were silent for a long moment, each listening to the other\u2019s breath\u2014his came easier than it had, she thought, without the small catches\u2014and then he finally said, \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She did, baldly and with as little emotion as she could manage. She thought he might be emotional enough for both of them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t shout or curse, because of the sleeping children. She could feel the rage in him; he was shaking with it, his fists clenched like solid knobs of bone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him,\u201d he said, in a voice barely pitched above silence, and his eyes met hers, savage and so dark that they seemed black in the dim light.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said softly, and, sitting up, took both his hands in hers, lifting one and then the other to her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019re all right, all of us. And we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He looked away and took a deep breath, then looked back, his hands tightening on hers.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he repeated, his voice bleak, still hoarse with fury. \u201cIn 1739. If I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had to,\u201d she said firmly, squeezing back hard. Besides,\u201d she added, a little diffidently, \u201cI sort of thought we wouldn\u2019t stay. Unless you\u2019ve taken a great liking to some of the denizens?\u201d</p><p>Expressions flickered across his face, from anger to rue to reluctant acceptance . . . and an even more reluctant humor, as he got a grip of himself. He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cThere\u2019s Hector McEwan, to be sure. But there are a good many other people, too\u2014Geillis Duncan, for one.\u201d</p><p>A small jolt went through her at the name.</p><p>\u201cGeillis Duncan? Well . . . yes, I suppose she would be here at this point, wouldn\u2019t she? Did you\u2014did you meet her?\u201d</p><p>A truly extraordinary expression went over Roger\u2019s face at that question.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, avoiding her questioning glance. He turned and waved a hand at the surgery window that looked out onto the square. \u201cShe lives just across the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Brianna got to her feet, clutching a quilt to her bosom, forgot about her bad foot, and stumbled. Roger leapt up and caught her by the arm.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to meet her,\u201d he said, with emphasis. \u201cSit down, aye? Ye\u2019re going to fall.\u201d</p><p>Brianna eyed him, but allowed him to ease her back down to their nest and to pull a quilt up over her shoulders. It was bloody cold in the surgery, now that the warmth of their efforts had faded.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, and shook her hair down to cover her ears and neck. \u201cTell me why I don\u2019t want to meet Geillis Duncan.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he flushed deeply, visible even in the shadows of the surgery. Roger had neither the skin nor the temperament to blush easily, but when he did describe\u2014briefly, but vividly\u2014what had happened (or possibly not happened) with Buck, Dr. McEwan, and Geillis, she understood it.</p><p>\u201cHoly moly,\u201d she said, with a glance over her shoulder at the window. \u201cEr . . . when Dr. McEwan said he\u2019d find a bed with a friend . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Buck had gone off, saying that he\u2019d take a bed at the ordinary at the foot of the High Street and would see them in the morning. Presumably he\u2019d meant it, but . . .</p><p>\u201cShe is married,\u201d Roger said tersely. \u201cPresumably her husband would notice were she inviting strange men to spend the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know so much,\u201d she said, half-teasing. \u201cShe\u2019s an herbalist, remember? Mama does a good sleeping potion; I imagine Geillis could, too.\u201d</p><p>The color washed up Roger\u2019s face again, and she knew, as clearly as if he\u2019d said so, that he was envisioning Geillis Duncan doing something disgraceful with one or another of her lovers whilst lying beside her snoring husband.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou, um, do remember what\u2019s going to happen to her poor husband, don\u2019t you?\u201d Bree said delicately. The color vanished instantly from Roger\u2019s face, and she knew he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she said, gently but firmly. \u201cThere are too many things we know. And we don\u2019t know what trying to interfere might do, but it\u2019s a good bet that it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d he began, but broke off at the look on her face. \u201cLallybroch. Is that why ye wouldna go there?\u201d For he\u2019d tried to take her down the hill to the house when he\u2019d rescued her from the fort. She\u2019d insisted that they must go to the village for help instead, even though it meant an awkward and painful three-hour ride.</p><p>She nodded and felt a small lump come into her throat. It stayed there as she told him about meeting Brian in the burying ground.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that I\u2019m afraid what meeting them might do to . . . later,\u201d she said, and the lump dissolved into tears. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . oh, Roger, the look on his face when he saw me and thought I was Ellen!</p><p>\u201cI\u2014he\u2014he\u2019s going to die in a year or two. That beautiful, sweet man . . . and there isn\u2019t any-anything we can do to stop it.\u201d She gulped and swiped at her eyes. \u201cHe\u2014he thinks he\u2019s seen his wife and his son, that they\u2019re w-waiting for him. And the\u2014oh, God, the joy on his face. I couldn\u2019t take that away from him, I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took her in his arms and rubbed her back gently as she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course ye couldn\u2019t,\u201d he whispered to her. \u201cDinna fash, Bree. Ye did right.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and groped among the cloaks for something to blow her nose on, settling at last for a stained cloth from Dr. McEwan\u2019s table. It smelled of some pungent medicine, thank God, not blood.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s Da, too,\u201d she said, taking a deep, tremulous breath. \u201cWhat will happen to him . . . the scars on his back . . . I\u2014can\u2019t stand to think about that and us doing nothing, but we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Roger agreed quietly. \u201cWe daren\u2019t. God only knows what I may have done already, finding Jerry and sending him\u2014wherever I did send him.\u201d Taking the cloth, he dipped it in the water bucket and wiped her face, the cold of it soothing on her hot cheeks, though it made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cCome lie down,\u201d he said, putting an arm round her shoulders. \u201cYe need rest, mo chridhe. It\u2019s been a terrible day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured, easing down and laying her head in the curve of his shoulder, feeling the strength and warmth of his body. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful day. I have you back.\u201d</p><p>THE SOUNDS THAT MAKE UP SILENCE</p><p>ROGER FELT HER begin to relax, and quite suddenly she let go her stubborn hold on consciousness and fell asleep like someone breathing ether. He held her and listened to the tiny sounds that made up silence: the distant hiss of the peat fire in the bedroom, a cold wind rattling at the window, the rustling and breathing of the sleeping kids, the slow beating of Brianna\u2019s valiant heart.</p><p>Thank you, he said silently to God.</p><p>He had expected to fall asleep himself at once; tiredness covered him like a lead blanket. But the day was still with him, and he lay for some time looking up into the dark.</p><p>He was at peace, too tired to think coherently of anything. All the possibilities drifted round him in a slow, distant swirl, too far away to be troublesome. Where they might go . . . and how. What Buck might have said to Dougal MacKenzie. What Bree had brought in her bag, heavy as lead. Whether there would be porridge for breakfast\u2014Mandy liked porridge.</p><p>The thought of Mandy made him ease out of the quilts to check on the children. To reassure himself that they were really there.</p><p>They were, and he stood by the bed for a long time, watching their faces in wordless gratitude, breathing the warm childish smell of them\u2014still tinged with a slight tang of goat.</p><p>At last he turned, shivering, to make his way back to his warm wife and the beckoning bliss of sleep. But as he reentered the surgery, he glanced through the window into the night outside.</p><p>Cranesmuir slept, and mist lay in her streets, the cobbles beneath gleaming with wet in the half-light of a drowning moon. On the far side of the square, though, a light showed in the attic window of Arthur Duncan\u2019s house.</p><p>And in the shadow of the square below, a small movement betrayed the presence of a man. Waiting.</p><p>Roger closed his eyes, cold rising from his bare feet up his body, seeing in his mind the sudden vision of a green-eyed woman, lazy in the arms of a fair-haired lover . . . and a look of surprise and then of horror on her face as the man vanished from her side. And an invisible blue glow rose in her womb.</p><p>With his eyes tight shut, he put a hand on the icy windowpane, and said a prayer to be going on with.</p><p>PART SEVEN</p><p>Before I Go Hence</p><p>A DISTANT MASSACRE</p><p>September 5, 1778</p><p>IFOLDED THE CLOTH into a tidy square and used the tongs to dip it in the steaming cauldron, then stood waving it gently to and fro until the compress should cool enough for me to wring it out and use it. Joanie sighed, fidgeting on her stool.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rub your eye,\u201d I said automatically, seeing her curled fist steal toward the large pink sty on her right eyelid. \u201cDon\u2019t fret; it won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does take long,\u201d she said crossly. \u201cIt takes forever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinna be giving your grannie sauce,\u201d Marsali told her, pausing in her stride on the way from kitchen to printshop, a cheese roll for Fergus in her hand. \u201cHauld your wheesht and be grateful.\u201d</p><p>Joanie groaned and writhed, and stuck her tongue out after her departing mother, but whipped it back into her mouth again and looked rather shame-faced when she caught sight of my raised brow.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, with some sympathy. Holding a warm compress on a sty for ten minutes did feel like forever. Particularly if you\u2019d been doing it six times a day for the last two days. \u201cMaybe you can think of something to pass the time. You could recite me the multiplication tables while I grind valerian root.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Grannie!\u201d she said, exasperated, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d I said, handing her the warm poultice. \u201cDo you know any good songs?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled moodily, small nostrils flaring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wish Grandda was here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could tell me a story.\u201d The note of comparative accusation was clear in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSpell \u2018hordeolum\u2019 for me and I\u2019ll tell you the one about the water horse\u2019s wife,\u201d I suggested. That made her unaffected eye fly open with interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a hordeolum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the scientific name for a sty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seemed unimpressed by this, but her forehead creased a little in concentration, and I could see her lips move as she sounded out the syllables. Both Joanie and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 were good spellers; they\u2019d been playing with discarded lead type since they were toddlers and loved stumping each other with new words.</p><p>That was a thought; maybe I could get her to spell unusual words for me during the compress treatments. The sty was a big, nasty one; her entire eyelid had been red and swollen in the beginning, the eye no more than a gleaming, resentful slit. Now the sty itself had shrunk to the size of a pea, and at least three-quarters of the eye was visible.</p><p>\u201cH,\u201d she said, watching me to see if that was right, and I nodded. \u201cO, R, D . . .\u201d I nodded again, and saw her lips move silently. \u201cHor-de-o-lum,\u201d I repeated helpfully, and she nodded, more confident. \u201cE, O, L, U, M!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d I said, beaming at her. \u201cHow about . . .\u201d I cast about for another good one, long but strictly phonetic. \u201cHepatitis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cViral infection of the liver. Do you know where your liver is?\u201d I was looking through my medicine chest, but appeared to be out of aloe salve. I should ride over to Bartram\u2019s Garden tomorrow, I thought, weather permitting. I was out of almost everything, in the wake of the battle. The usual small twinge came in my side at thought of it, but I pushed it firmly away. It would fade, and so would the thoughts.</p><p>Marsali appeared suddenly in the kitchen door, as Joanie was carefully spelling \u201cacanthocytosis,\u201d and I looked up from my grinding. She was holding a letter in her hand and looked worried.</p><p>\u201cIs it the Indian they call Joseph Brant that Young Ian kens?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI expect he knows quite a few of them,\u201d I replied, setting down my pestle. \u201cBut I\u2019ve heard him mention Joseph Brant, yes. The man\u2019s Mohawk name starts with a \u2018T,\u2019 I think, but that\u2019s as much as I feel sure of. Why?\u201d I felt a slight uneasiness at the name. Ian\u2019s Mohawk wife, Emily, had been living in a settlement in New York founded by Brant; Ian had mentioned it, very briefly, when he\u2019d gone up there to visit her last year.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said what the purpose of his visit was, and neither Jamie nor I had asked, but I assumed it to have had something to do with his fear that he couldn\u2019t sire children, as all his babies with Emily had either been stillborn or miscarried. He\u2019d asked me about the matter, and I\u2019d told him what I could, offering what reassurance I could that he might be able to have children with another woman.</p><p>I offered up a quick prayer for Rachel\u2019s chances, then returned abruptly to what Marsali was saying.</p> <p>\u201cThey did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis gentleman\u201d\u2014she tapped the letter\u2014\u201csays that Brant and his men fell upon a wee place called Andrustown. No but seven families living there.\u201d Her lips pressed tight, and she glanced at Joanie, who was listening with her ears flapping. \u201cThey plundered and burnt the place, he says, and massa\u2014er . . . did awa wi\u2019 a number of the folk who lived there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that word, Mam?\u201d Joanie asked brightly. \u201cThe one that means \u2018did awa\u2019 with?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Massacred,\u2019\u201d I told her, saving her mother the embarrassment. \u201cIt means indiscriminate and brutal slaughter. Here.\u201d I handed her the fresh compress, which she applied without protest, frowning in thought.</p><p>\u201cIs that different than just killin\u2019 someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said judiciously, \u201cit depends. You might kill someone by accident, for instance, and that wouldn\u2019t be a massacre, though it would certainly be lamentable. You might kill someone who was trying to kill you, and that would be self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel says ye oughtn\u2019t do that,\u201d Joanie observed, but merely for the sake of thoroughness. \u201cWhat about if ye\u2019re with an army and have to kill the soldiers on the other side?\u201d</p><p>Marsali made a low Scottish noise of disapproval but answered tersely.</p> <p>\u201cIf a man\u2019s gone to the army, then killin\u2019 is his job,\u201d she said. \u201cHe does it\u2014mostly\u2014\u201d she added fairly, with a raised brow to me, \u201cto protect his ain family and property. So that\u2019s more like self-defense, aye?\u201d</p><p>Joanie glanced from her mother to me, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cI ken what \u2018bru-tal\u2019 is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s bein\u2019 mean when ye havena got to. But what\u2019s \u2018in-dis-crim-in-ate\u2019?\u201d She sounded it out carefully, as though about to spell it.</p><p>\u201cWithout choosing,\u201d I said, lifting one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cIt means you do something without taking much notice who you do it to and probably without much reason to do it to that particular person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Cousin Ian\u2019s Indian friend have nay reason for burning yon place and killing the folk, then?\u201d</p><p>Marsali and I exchanged a glance.</p><p>\u201cWe dinna ken that,\u201d Marsali said. \u201cBut it\u2019s no a good thing, whatever he meant by it. Now, ye\u2019re done. Go along and find F\u00e9licit\u00e9 and start in fillin\u2019 up the washtub.\u201d She took the compress from Joanie and shooed her out.</p><p>She stood watching until Joanie had gone out through the back door, then turned to me and handed me the letter.</p><p>It was from a Mr. Johansen, apparently one of Fergus\u2019s regular correspondents, and the contents were as Marsali had said, though adding a few gruesome details that she hadn\u2019t mentioned in Joanie\u2019s hearing. It was fairly factual, with only the barest of eighteenth-century ornaments, and the more hair-raising\u2014literally, I thought; some of the Andrustown residents had been scalped, by report\u2014for that.</p><p>Marsali nodded as I looked up from the letter.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said. \u201cFergus wants to publish the account, but I\u2019m nay so sure he ought to. Because of Young Ian, ken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s because of Young Ian?\u201d said a Scottish voice from the printshop doorway, and Jenny came through, a marketing basket over one arm. Her eyes went to the letter in my hand, and her sharp dark brows rose.</p><p>\u201cHas he told ye much about her?\u201d Marsali asked, having explained the letter. \u201cThe Indian lass he wed?\u201d</p><p>Jenny shook her head and began taking things out of her basket.</p><p>\u201cNay a word, save for his telling Jamie to say he wouldna forget us.\u201d A shadow crossed her face at the memory, and I wondered for a moment how it must have been for her and Ian, receiving Jamie\u2019s account of the circumstances in which Ian had become a Mohawk. I knew the agony with which he\u2019d written that letter, and doubted that the reading of it had been done with less.</p><p>She laid down an apple and beckoned to me for the letter. Having read it through in silence, she looked at me. \u201cD\u2019ye think he\u2019s got feelings for her still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he does,\u201d I answered reluctantly. \u201cBut nothing like his feelings for Rachel, surely.\u201d I did recall him, though, standing with me in the twilight on the demilune battery at Fort Ticonderoga, when he\u2019d told me about his children\u2014and Emily, his wife.</p><p>\u201cHe feels guilty about her, does he?\u201d Jenny asked, shrewdly watching my face. I gave her a look, but nodded. She compressed her lips, but then handed the letter back to Marsali.</p><p>\u201cWell, we dinna ken whether his wife has anything to do wi\u2019 this Brant or his doings, and it\u2019s no her that\u2019s been massacred. I\u2019d say let Fergus print it, but\u201d\u2014and she glanced at me\u2014\u201cshow the letter to Jamie and have him talk to wee Ian about it. He\u2019ll listen.\u201d Her expression lightened a little then, and a slight smile emerged. \u201cHe\u2019s got a good wife now, and I think Rachel will keep him to home.\u201d</p><p>MAIL WAS DELIVERED to the printshop at all hours of the day\u2014and, not infrequently, the night\u2014and by all manner of messengers. Philadelphia gloried in the best postal system in the colonies, this having been established by Benjamin Franklin only three years before; post riders rode regularly between New York and Philadelphia and over thirty other routes through the colonies.</p><p>Given the nature of Fergus\u2019s business and the nature of the times, though, almost as much mail arrived by older routes: passed along by travelers, merchants, Indians, and soldiers, and shoved under the door in the night watches. Or handed to a member of the family in the street. It was exchanges of that sort during the British occupation of the city that had compelled me to marry John Grey in order to avoid arrest for sedition and spying.</p><p>John\u2019s own letter, though, arrived sedately in the pouch of a postal rider, properly stamped, and sealed with a blob of yellow wax imprinted with his signet in the shape of a smiling half-moon.</p><p>To Mrs. James Fraser, Fraser\u2019s Printshop, Philadelphia</p><p>From Lord John Grey, Wilbury House, New York</p><p>My dear,</p><p>I am with my brother and his regiment in New York, and am like to remain here for some time. That being so, I thought I would mention that the Lease of my house on Chestnut Street will run until the End of the Year, and as the Thought of it being left empty to be vandalized or left to ruin distresses me, I conceived the Notion of offering it to you once again.</p><p>Not, I hasten to add (lest your intransigent Husband be reading this), as a Domicile but rather as Premises for a Surgery. Acquainted as I am with your peculiar Habit of attracting Persons suffering from Disease, Deformity, or hideous Injury, and being also well acquainted with the Number of Persons presently inhabiting the younger Mr. Fraser\u2019s printing Establishment, I believe you may find your medical Adventures more easily accommodated in Chestnut Street than between a Printing Press and a towering Stack of sixpenny Bibles bound in buckram.</p><p>As I do not expect you to spend your valuable Time in domestic Labor, I have arranged for Mrs. Figg and a Servant of her choice to remain in my employment for so long as you require them, being paid through my Bank. You will greatly oblige me, my dear, by accepting this Proposition, as it will put my mind at ease regarding the Property. And the Thought of you at work, earnestly administering a Clyster to General Arnold, will greatly enliven the Tedium of my present Condition.</p><p>Your most obedient Servant,</p><p>John</p><p>\u201cWhat are ye smiling at, Mother Claire?\u201d Marsali inquired, observing me with the letter in hand. She smiled, teasing. \u201cHas someone sent ye a billet-doux?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, something of the sort,\u201d I said, folding it up. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know where Jamie is just now, would you?\u201d</p><p>She closed one eye to assist thought, keeping the other on Henri-Christian, who was industriously blacking his father\u2019s best boots\u2014and a good deal of himself in the process.</p><p>\u201cHe said he was going wi\u2019 Young Ian to see a man about a horse,\u201d she said, \u201cand then to the docks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe docks?\u201d I said in surprise. \u201cDid he say why?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI could maybe guess, though. That\u2019ll do, Henri! A Dhia, the state of you! Go find one o\u2019 your sisters and tell her to wash your hands for ye, aye?\u201d</p><p>Henri looked at his hands, as though astonished to find them completely black.</p><p>\u201cOui, Maman,\u201d he said, and, cheerfully wiping them on his breeches, scampered out into the kitchen, bellowing, \u201cF\u00e9licit\u00e9! Come wash me!\u201d at the top of his lungs.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, moving closer and lowering my voice slightly\u2014for obviously she\u2019d got rid of Henri-Christian on the little pitchers\u2013big ears principle.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been talking wi\u2019 Fergus about going with ye, when ye go back to North Carolina,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had to guess, I\u2019d say he\u2019s gone to find out what it might cost to move everything\u201d\u2014she made a sweeping gesture, encompassing everything from printing press to loft\u2014\u201cby ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said, as noncommittally as possible, though my heart had leapt\u2014at both the thought of imminent departure for the Ridge and the thought that Fergus and Marsali might come with us. \u201cDo you . . . want to?\u201d I asked cautiously, seeing the line between her brows. She was still a lovely woman, fair and fine-boned, but she was too thin, and the lines of strain sharpened her features.</p><p>She shook her head, but in indecision rather than negation.</p><p>\u201cI really dinna ken,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bit easier now, wi\u2019 the British gone\u2014but they\u2019re no so far away, are they? They could come back, and then what?\u201d She glanced uneasily over her shoulder, though the print-shop was empty for the moment. Fergus had had to leave home and live furtively on the outskirts of the city, during the last months of the British occupation.</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell her that I doubted this. Hal Grey had told me, under the influence of ganja, that the new British strategy was to sever the southern colonies from the North and suppress the rebellion there, thus starving the North into submission. But I closed it without speaking. Best not to mention that until I found out whether Jamie had told Fergus.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t I bloody know what was going to happen? I asked myself in frustration\u2014and not for the first time. Why hadn\u2019t I thought to brush up on American history when I had the chance?</p><p>Well, because I hadn\u2019t expected to end up in America, was the answer. Just went to show, I supposed. Pointless to spend too much time in planning, anyway, given the propensity of life to make sudden left-hand turns without warning.</p><p>\u201cIt would be wonderful, if you were to come,\u201d I said, as mildly as possible, adding craftily, \u201cso nice to have the children nearby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marsali snorted, giving me a sideways glance.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cNever think I dinna appreciate the value of a grannie. And when ye leave, Grannie Janet will go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think so?\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought of that. \u201cBut Jenny loves you and your children\u2014Fergus is as much a son to her as any of the boys she bore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s maybe true,\u201d she admitted, with a brief smile that showed me the radiant fifteen-year-old who had married Fergus on a Caribbean beach twelve years before. \u201cBut Young Ian\u2019s her youngest, ken? And she\u2019s had too little of him. Now he\u2019s wed, she\u2019ll want to be nearby, to help wi\u2019 his bairns when they come. And ye ken Rachel will go where Ian does\u2014and Ian will go where Da does.\u201d</p> <p>That was a shrewd assessment, I thought, and gave her a brief nod of agreement and respect.</p><p>She sighed deeply and, sitting down in her nursing chair, took up the topmost item in the brimming mending basket, the threaded needle still sticking up from the garment where she\u2019d last put it down. I had no desire to abandon the conversation and, pulling out a stool, sat down beside her and plucked one of Germain\u2019s stockings out of the basket. The workbasket, with its housewife, thread balls, and darning egg, was set beside the mending, and I deftly threaded my own needle, feeling pleased that I could still do that without putting on my spectacles.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Fergus?\u201d I asked bluntly. Because plainly Fergus was the crux of the matter, where Marsali was concerned.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s the rub,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cI\u2019d go, and happy, but ye ken how it was for him when we stayed on the Ridge.\u201d</p><p>I did, and grimaced slightly, stretching the heel of the stocking over the darning egg.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been dangerous in the city, this last year,\u201d she said, and swallowed at the memory. \u201cCouldna tell ye how many times the soldiers came to arrest him; they broke up the shop, more than once, when they couldna find him. And the Loyalists would come and paint slogans on the front wall sometimes. But the danger didna trouble him\u2014so long as it didna threaten me and the bairns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes even if it does,\u201d I muttered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean just Fergus. Bloody men.\u201d</p><p>Marsali sniffed with amusement.</p><p>\u201cAye. But the thing is\u2014he is a man, no? He\u2019s got to feel he\u2019s worth something. He needs to be able to care for us, and that\u2019s a thing he can do\u2014and do well\u2014here. I canna see how he\u2019d make a decent living in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d I admitted reluctantly. It was a hot day, and stifling in the kitchen, with the cauldron simmering over the hearth. Flies or no flies\u2014and there were an ungodly number of flies in Philadelphia\u2014I got up to open the back door. It wasn\u2019t noticeably cooler outside, though at least the fire under the big washtub hadn\u2019t yet been lit; the girls were still filling it, trudging to and fro from the well with their buckets.</p><p>Henri-Christian was nowhere in sight, but had presumably been scrubbed; a filthy black cloth lay crumpled on the doorstep. I stooped to pick it up and saw a folded bit of paper lying on the ground beside the step. It had no direction on it but looked purposeful, so I picked it up and took it back inside.</p> <p>\u201cStill,\u201d Marsali said, barely waiting for me to sit down. \u201cI\u2019m thinkin\u2019 that even if we canna go to the Ridge, it might be as well if we were to go. There must be places in the South that could use a printer, even if they\u2019re none sae big as Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s Charleston,\u201d I said doubtfully, \u201cand Savannah. They\u2019re just as hot and ghastly in the summer as Philadelphia is, but the winters are milder, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>She shot me a brief look over the shift she was mending, then set it down on her lap, as though having come to a decision.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no the weather that troubles me,\u201d she said quietly. And, bending, she groped under the pile of shirts and stockings, emerging with a handful of grubby notes and frayed letters. Handling these gingerly, as though they carried some disease, she placed them on my knee.</p><p>\u201cAny printer in these days gets such things poked under his door,\u201d she said, watching my face as I read through the first few. \u201cEspecially if ye take a stand. We didn\u2019t, for as long as we could, but after a time, ye just canna stand in the middle o\u2019 the road any longer.\u201d</p><p>This was said with a simplicity and acceptance that brought tears to my eyes. The more so with the content of the anonymous notes\u2014for they were all unsigned and in a variety of hands, though some were plainly written by the same person\u2014making it quite clear what the price of standing on the Rebel side might be.</p><p>\u201cIt was worse, maybe,\u201d she said, taking them back and stacking them tidily, \u201cwhen the British were here. I thought it might stop when they left, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine all the Loyalists left with them,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath in order to control myself. I felt as though I\u2019d been punched in the stomach.</p> <p>\u201cOnly the richer ones,\u201d Marsali said cynically. \u201cThe ones who thought they\u2019d be dragged from their homes or beaten and robbed, without the army to protect them. But it doesna mean the poorer ones dinna have the same opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep these?\u201d I asked, handing them back with two fingers, as though holding them with tongs. \u201cI think I\u2019d throw them into the fire at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, at first,\u201d she said, tucking the handful of nastiness carefully back into the bottom of the basket. \u201cBut I found I couldna forget what they\u2019d said, and the words would come back to me at night and stop me sleeping.\u201d She straightened, shrugged, and took up her needle again.</p><p>\u201cI told Fergus, and he said the thing to do was to keep them and read them through several times a day, one after the other. Read them tae each other.\u201d A brief, rueful smile touched her mouth. \u201cSo we did, after the bairns were asleep\u2014we\u2019d sit by the fire and take turns reading them. And he\u2019d make fun o\u2019 them, criticizing the grammar and the lack o\u2019 poetry, comparing them one to another, and we\u2019d rank them from best to worst . . . and then we\u2019d put them away and go to sleep in each other\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>Her hand rested gently on the mound of mending, as though it were Fergus\u2019s shoulder, and I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, and, clearing my throat, produced the note I\u2019d picked up on the step. \u201cI have no idea whether this is another one for your collection\u2014but I found it on the back step just now.\u201d</p><p>She took it with a raised brow and looked it over, turning it to and fro.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cleaner than most,\u201d she observed. \u201cA decent rag paper, too. It\u2019s maybe just a . . .\u201d Her voice died away as she opened it and began to read. I could see that the writing inside was brief; within seconds, the blood drained from her face.</p><p>\u201cMarsali.\u201d I reached toward her, and she thrust the note into my hand and rose swiftly.</p><p>Ladybird, ladybird, the note read, fly away home. Your house is on fire and your children are gone.</p><p>\u201cHenri-Christian!\u201d Marsali\u2019s voice was strong and urgent. \u201cGirls! Where\u2019s your wee brother?\u201d</p><p>DAYLIGHT HAUNTING</p><p>I FOUND HENRI-CHRISTIAN in the first place I looked: down the street, playing with the two smallest Phillips girls. The Phillipses had ten children, and even Henri-Christian could blend into their household without causing much notice.</p><p>Some parents kept their children from coming anywhere near Henri-Christian\u2014whether from fear that dwarfishness was catching, I supposed, or from the popular superstition that his appearance was the result of his mother having fornicated with the devil. I\u2019d heard that one now and then, though everyone in the neighborhood knew better than to say it anywhere in the hearing of Jamie, Fergus, Ian, or Germain.</p><p>The Phillipses were Jewish, though, and apparently felt some kinship with a person whose differences set him apart. Henri-Christian was always welcome at their house. Their maid-of-all-work merely nodded when I asked whether one of the older children would walk home with him later, then went back to her washing; it was laundry day all over Philadelphia, and the humid atmosphere was aggravated by a score of steaming washtubs in the neighborhood, all fuming with the reek of washing soda.</p><p>I went back quickly to the printshop to tell Marsali where Henri-Christian was and, having relieved her fears, put on my wide-brimmed hat and announced my intent of going to buy some fish for supper. Marsali and Jenny, armed respectively with a laundry fork and a large paddle for clothes-stirring, gave me marked looks\u2014both of them knew exactly how much I disliked doing laundry\u2014but neither said anything.</p><p>I had of course been excused from housework while recuperating and, in all truth, was still not up to the labor of hoicking hot, sodden clothes about. I could have managed hanging out the washing, perhaps, but soothed my conscience on grounds that: 1) fish made an easy supper on laundry day, 2) I needed to walk regularly, in order to regain my strength, and 3) I wanted to talk to Jamie, alone.</p><p>The anonymous letter had upset me nearly as much as it had Marsali. It wasn\u2019t like the other threats she had shown me: those were all specifically political, and while some were aimed at Marsali (for she had run the newspaper alone while Fergus was in hiding), they were of the run-of-the-mill \u201cRebel bitch\u201d variety. I\u2019d heard such epithets\u2014along with \u201cTory whore!\u201d and their German and Yiddish equivalents\u2014commonly in the rougher parts of Philadelphia.</p><p>This was different. It had the whiff of a refined and intelligent malice, and I suddenly felt the presence of Jack Randall at my shoulder, so strongly that I came to an abrupt halt and spun round.</p><p>The street was busy, but there was no one behind me. No glimpse of a red coat anywhere, though there were Continental officers here and there, in blue and buff.</p><p>\u201cBugger off, Captain,\u201d I said, under my breath. Not quite far enough under: I got a wide-eyed look from a round little woman selling pretzels from a tray round her neck. She glanced over her shoulder to see to whom I was speaking, then turned back to me with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cYou are all right, madam?\u201d she said in a heavy German accent.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, embarrassed. \u201cYes, quite all right. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake this,\u201d she said kindly, handing me a pretzel. \u201cI think you are hungry.\u201d And waving away my fumbling attempt at payment, she went off down the street, wide hips rolling, waving a stick of pretzels stacked like quoits and shouting, \u201cBrezeln! Hei\u00dfe Brezeln!\u201d</p><p>Feeling suddenly dizzy, I leaned against the front of a building, closed my eyes, and bit into the pretzel. It was chewy, fresh, and rimed with salt, and I discovered that the woman had been right. I was hungry. Starved, in fact.</p><p>The pretzel hit my stomach and then my bloodstream, imparting an instant sense of stability and well-being, and the momentary panic I\u2019d felt evaporated so quickly that I could almost believe it hadn\u2019t happened. Almost.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t happened in some time. I swallowed the last bit of pretzel and, after checking my pulse\u2014strong and steady\u2014set off again toward the river.</p><p>I walked slowly; it was midday, and any great exertion would leave me drenched with sweat and very likely light-headed again. I ought to have brought my walking stick but had recklessly decided to do without it. I hated feeling infirm.</p><p>I hated feeling . . . that, even more. The sudden sense of threat, irrational fear . . . violation. Flashback, the military called it\u2014would call it\u2014in my time. It hadn\u2019t happened to me since Saratoga, though, and I\u2019d almost forgotten about it. Almost.</p><p>Completely explainable, of course: I\u2019d been shot, come close to dying, was still physically weak. The last time, I\u2019d been in the dark in the forest near a battlefield, alone, lost, and surrounded by violent men. No wonder it had happened then; the situation was much too close to what it had been when I\u2019d been abducted and assaulted\u2014</p><p>\u201cRaped,\u201d I said out loud, firmly, to the extreme startlement of a pair of gentlemen passing by. I paid no attention to them. No point in trying to avoid either the word or the memory. It was over; I was safe.</p><p>Before that . . . the first time I\u2019d been overtaken by that sense of threat, it was at River Run, in the course of a party. But a party where the sense of imminent violence was palpable. On that occasion, Jamie had been nearby, thank God. He\u2019d seen that I was spooked\u2014literally, he assumed\u2014and had given me a handful of salt with which to lay the ghost that haunted me.</p><p>The Highlands always had a practical answer, whether the difficulty was keeping a fire smoored for the night, having your cow run dry, or being haunted.</p><p>I touched the corner of my mouth with my tongue, found a stray salt crystal from the pretzel, and nearly laughed. I looked over my shoulder for the woman who\u2019d given me succor, but she\u2019d vanished.</p><p>\u201cJust as an angel should, I suppose,\u201d I murmured. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>There was probably a charm for it in the G\u00e0idhlig, I reflected. There were dozens, probably hundreds. I knew only a few, mostly those concerned with health (they gave my Gaelic-speaking patients reassurance), but picked the one that seemed most suitable to the situation and strode firmly along, my feet solid on the cobbles, chanting:</p><p>\u201cI trample on thee, thou seizure,</p><p>As tramples whale on brine,</p><p>Thou seizure of back, thou seizure of body,</p><p>Thou foul wasting of chest.\u201d</p><p>And then I saw Jamie, coming up from the docks, laughing at something Fergus was saying, and the world dropped back into place around me.</p><p>JAMIE TOOK ONE look at me, took my arm, and steered me into a small coffeehouse around the corner on Locust Street. At this hour of the day, it was all but deserted, and I attracted relatively little attention. Women did drink coffee\u2014when any was to be had\u2014but they mostly drank it at home, in company with friends or at small parties and salons. And while there were grander coffeehouses in London and Edinburgh that women might now and then frequent, the Philadelphia coffeehouses tended to be male preserves of business, gossip, and politics. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat have ye been doing, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie inquired mildly, taking the tray of coffee cups and almond biscuits from the server. \u201cYe look\u2014\u201d He squinted at me, evidently searching for a term that would be accurate without causing me to pour scalding coffee on him.</p><p>\u201cSomewhat indisposed,\u201d Fergus said, taking up the sugar tongs. \u201cHere, milady.\u201d Without asking, he dropped three large lumps of brown sugar into my cup. \u201cThey say that drinking hot beverages will cool you,\u201d he added helpfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, it does make you sweat more,\u201d I said, taking up my spoon. \u201cBut if the sweat doesn\u2019t evaporate, it certainly won\u2019t make you cooler.\u201d I estimated the ambient humidity at roughly a thousand percent, but tipped a little of my sweetened coffee into the saucer and blew on it nonetheless. \u201cAs to what I\u2019ve been doing, I was on my way to buy fish for supper. And what have you gentlemen been doing?\u201d</p><p>Sitting down had made me feel a good bit steadier, and being flanked by Jamie and Fergus made the odd sense of threat I\u2019d experienced in the street fade a bit. But thought of the anonymous letter on the step raised the hairs on the back of my neck, despite the heat.</p> <p>Jamie and Fergus glanced at each other, and Fergus raised one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cReckoning our assets,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cAnd visiting warehouses and shipping captains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d The thought made my heart lift immediately. These sounded like the first concrete steps toward going home. \u201cHave we got any assets to speak of?\u201d Most of our available cash had gone to pay for horses, uniforms, weapons, food for Jamie\u2019s men, and other war-related expenses. Theoretically, Congress would reimburse these expenses, but given everything General Arnold had told me about Congress, I rather thought we oughtn\u2019t to hold our collective breath in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cA bit,\u201d Jamie said, smiling at me. He knew very well what I was thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve found a buyer for the gelding; four pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems a good price,\u201d I said uncertainly. \u201cBut . . . wouldn\u2019t we need the horse, for travel?\u201d</p> <p>Before he could answer, the door opened and Germain came in, a bundle of broadsheets under one arm and a scowl on his face. The latter disappeared like the morning dew as he spotted us, though, and he came to hug me.</p><p>\u201cGrand-m\u00e8re! What are you doing in here? Maman said you went to buy fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, suddenly guilty at thought of the laundry. \u201cYes. I am\u2014er, I mean, I was just on my way. . . . Would you like a bite, Germain?\u201d I offered him the plate of almond biscuits, and his eyes lighted up.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d said Fergus firmly. Germain rolled his eyes at me but took a single biscuit, lifting it with two fingers in exaggerated delicacy.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d he said, consuming the biscuit in two swift bites, \u201cI think perhaps you should go home.\u201d</p><p>Both of Fergus\u2019s strongly marked black brows rose.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Germain said, licking sugar from the corner of his mouth and eyeing the remaining biscuits, \u201cGrannie Janet told Mr. Sorrel that if he didn\u2019t leave off pestering Maman, she would stab him with the laundry fork. She might do it, too,\u201d he added thoughtfully, dabbing a finger on the plate for crumbs.</p><p>Fergus growled. It quite startled me, as I hadn\u2019t heard anything like that from him since he\u2019d been a feral eight-year-old pickpocket in Paris.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Sorrel?\u201d Jamie asked, in a deceptively mild tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cA tavern owner who passes by the shop on his way to and from his work and stops to buy a newspaper\u2014and to ogle my wife,\u201d Fergus said tersely. He pushed back his bench, and rose. \u201cExcuse me, milady,\u201d he said, bowing to me.</p><p>\u201cHad I best come with ye?\u201d Jamie asked, also pushing back from the table. Fergus shook his head, though, and put on his cocked hat.</p><p>\u201cNo. The man is a coward. One sight of me, and he will be gone.\u201d His very white teeth showed in a sudden smile. \u201cIf your sister has not disposed of him already.\u201d</p><p>He went out, leaving the biscuits at the mercy of Germain, who scooped them tidily into his pocket before going to the counter to deposit the new broadsheets, take away the much-read and coffee-spotted ones from yesterday, and collect his money from the proprietress.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst you were reckoning assets, did Fergus tell you how well he\u2019s doing with the printing business?\u201d I asked, pitching my voice low enough as not to reach Germain.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Jamie passed a coffee cup under his nose and grimaced slightly. The beverage was nominally coffee\u2014a few genuine beans had likely been included in the brew\u2014but contained a high proportion of chicory and a few other ingredients. I picked a small fragment of charred acorn out of my saucer and added more sugar.</p><p>The printshop was in fact very profitable; the more so now, as Fergus\u2019s chief competitor, a Loyalist, had left town with the departure of the British army.</p><p>\u201cThere are a good many expenses, though,\u201d Jamie explained. \u201cAnd some of those have increased since the army left.\u201d Paper and ink were more difficult to obtain, with the army no longer protecting transport in and out of the city. And the increased danger of the public roads meant that fewer orders of printed books were shipped and, when they were, must either be insured or risk loss.</p><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s insurance on his premises, which is expensive,\u201d Jamie added. He pinched his nose slightly, then drank his coffee in three large gulps. \u201cMarsali doesna like paying that,\u201d he said, gasping a little, \u201cbut Fergus kent what happened to my place in Edinburgh. And he told me a few things that Marsali doesna ken, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d I cast a wary eye at Germain, but he was engaged in what was plainly a saucy conversation with a serving girl at the counter. The girl was two or three years older than Germain but clearly amused by him.</p><p>\u201cOh, the odd threat from folk who dinna like something he\u2019s printed or who have their noses put out o\u2019 joint because he willna print something of theirs. Bit of sabotage, sometimes: his broadsheets stolen from coffeehouses and taverns and scattered in the street\u2014though he said that\u2019s got better since Mr. Dunphy left town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunphy being the Loyalist printer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Germain!\u201d he called across the shop. \u201cHave ye other places to visit today? Because if so, ye\u2019d best get to them before your news goes stale.\u201d</p><p>That made the few customers laugh, and Germain\u2019s ears went somewhat pink. He gave his grandfather a measured look, but was wise enough not to say anything, and with a few last words to the counter girl, went out, slipping the small cake she\u2019d given him into his pocket with a casual air.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s been picking pockets, do you?\u201d I asked, observing the skill with which this maneuver was accomplished. Fergus had taught Germain a good many of his own techniques in that regard, not wanting the skills to be lost.</p><p>\u201cGod knows, but all the better if he leaves Philadelphia. He willna find so much scope for that particular talent in the mountains.\u201d Jamie craned his neck to see out the window, watching Germain go down the street, then sat back, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThe main thing Fergus hasna told Marsali, though, is about yon French popinjay Wainwright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the fashionable Percival?\u201d I asked, mildly amused. \u201cIs he still around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he is. Persistent wee sodomite,\u201d he observed dispassionately. \u201cHe wrote out a detailed account of what he claims is the story of Fergus\u2019s parents, wi\u2019 the conclusion that Fergus is the heir to some great estate in France. Fergus says if it had been a romantic novel, it would have been criticized as too implausible and nay publisher would touch it.\u201d He grinned at the thought, but then sobered. \u201cStill. Fergus says he hasna the slightest intent o\u2019 having anything to do with the matter, as even if it were true, he doesna mean to be a pawn for someone else\u2019s interests\u2014and if it\u2019s not true, still less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I had taken to simply eating the sugar lumps by now, rather than mixing them into the problematical coffee, and crunched one between my back teeth. \u201cWhy is he keeping that from Marsali, though? She knows about Wainwright\u2019s earlier approaches, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jamie drummed his hand on the table in thought, and I watched in fascination; he had been accustomed for a great while to drumming the two stiff fingers of his right hand when thinking\u2014the middle and ring finger, which had been badly broken, crudely reset, and frequently re-broken, owing to the clumsy way it stuck out. But I had finally amputated the ruined ring finger after he\u2019d had half of it sliced off by a cavalry saber during the first battle of Saratoga. He still drummed his hand, though, as if the finger were still there, though now only the middle finger struck the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cBut Fergus said that there began to be that odd wee bit of . . . something . . . in Wainwright\u2019s importunities. No quite a threat\u2014but just things like an observation that, of course, since Fergus is the heir to the Beauchamp estate\u2014if he is, in fact\u2014then Germain would inherit the title and land after him.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI can see that being offered as an inducement\u2014but why is it a threat?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a level look over the coffee debris.</p><p>\u201cIf Germain would inherit this estate\u2014Wainwright\u2019s principals dinna really need Fergus, now, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H. . . . Really?\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2014or, rather, Fergus thinks Wainwright and company might kill him and then use Germain to get hold of this property or whatever it is they have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave the ghost of a shrug.</p><p>\u201cFergus hasna lived as long as he has without having a sense of when someone means him harm. And if he thinks there\u2019s summat amiss wi\u2019 this Wainwright, I\u2019m inclined to believe him. Besides,\u201d he added fairly, \u201cif it makes him more willing to leave Philadelphia and come south with us, I\u2019m no going to persuade him he\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s that.\u201d I looked dubiously at the dregs of my coffee and decided against it. \u201cSpeaking of Germain, though\u2014or, rather, the children in general\u2014that\u2019s actually why I was looking for you.\u201d And, in a few words, I described the ladybird note and its effect on Marsali.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s thick auburn brows drew together, and his face took on a look that his enemies would have recognized. I had last seen it in the light of dawn on a North Carolina mountainside, when he had escorted me through woods and meadows, from one cold body to the next, to show me that the men who had hurt me were dead, to reassure me that they could not touch me.</p><p>\u201cThat was what made me . . . er . . . indisposed in the street,\u201d I said, rather apologetically. \u201cIt just seemed so . . . evil. But a sort of delicate evil, if you know what I mean. It\u2014rather gave me a turn.\u201d The dead had their own means of making you remember them, but I felt nothing at the memory of his vengeance beyond a remote sense of relief and an even remoter sense of awe at the supernatural beauty of carnage in such a setting.</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d he said softly, and tapped his missing finger on the table. \u201cAnd I should like to see that note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see whether the handwriting looks like that in Percy Wainwright\u2019s letter, Sassenach,\u201d he said, pushing back from the table and handing me my hat. \u201cAre ye ready?\u201d</p><p>THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH</p><p>I HAD BOUGHT A striped bass nearly as long as my arm, along with a mess of crayfish and a gunnysack of oysters from the estuary, and the kitchen smelled delightfully of fresh bread and fish stew. This was a good thing, as stew can always be stretched, and Ian and Rachel, with Rollo in tow, had drifted into the printshop just before supper, so visibly in the throes of wedded bliss that it made one smile\u2014and occasionally blush\u2014to look at them.</p><p>Jenny did smile, and I saw her thin shoulders relax a little, seeing Ian\u2019s radiant face. I gave the stew a quick stir and came over to stand behind her as she sat by the fire, laying my hands on those shoulders and kneading them gently. I knew bloody well what a day\u2019s laundry felt like in the muscles.</p><p>She heaved a long, blissful sigh and bent her head to allow me to get my thumbs on her neck.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think our wee Quaker lass is wi\u2019 child yet?\u201d she murmured to me. Rachel was across the room, chatting with the younger children and very easy with them\u2014though her eyes kept turning to Ian, who was looking at something Fergus had taken out of a drawer in the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been married barely a month,\u201d I whispered back, though I looked carefully at Rachel.</p><p>\u201cIt doesna take that long,\u201d Jenny said. \u201cAnd plainly the lad kens his job. Look at her.\u201d Her shoulders quivered slightly with a suppressed laugh.</p><p>\u201cA fine thing for a mother to be thinking about her son,\u201d I said under my breath, though I could neither keep the amusement out of my own voice nor say she was wrong. Rachel glowed in the magic light of mingled dusk and hearth fire, and her eyes rested on the lines of Ian\u2019s back, even as she admired F\u00e9licit\u00e9\u2019s new rag doll.</p><p>\u201cHe takes after his father,\u201d Jenny said, and made a little \u201chmph\u201d in her throat\u2014still amused, but with a faint tinge of . . . longing? My own eyes went to Jamie, who had come to join Fergus and Ian by the sideboard. Still here, thank God. Tall and graceful, the soft light making shadows in the folds of his shirt as he moved, a fugitive gleam from the long straight bridge of his nose, the auburn wave of his hair. Still mine. Thank God.</p><p>\u201cCome cut the bread, Joanie!\u201d Marsali called. \u201cHenri-Christian, stop playin\u2019 with that dog and fetch the butter, aye? And, F\u00e9licit\u00e9, put your heid outside and call Germain.\u201d The distant sound of boys\u2019 voices came from the street, shouts punctuated by the occasional thud of a ball against the front wall of the shop. \u201cAnd tell those wee heathens I said if they break a windowpane, their fathers will hear about it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A brief outbreak of domestic chaos ended with all the adults seated on the benches at table and the children in their own huddle by the hearth with their wooden bowls and spoons. Despite the heat of the evening, the fragrant steam of onions, milk, seafood, and fresh bread enveloped the table in a brief enchantment of anticipation.</p><p>The men sat down last, their murmured talk stopping well short of the table, and I gave Jamie a brief, questioning look. He touched my shoulder as he sat down beside me, saying, \u201cAye, later,\u201d under his breath, and nodded at the hearth. Pas devant les enfants, then.</p><p>Fergus cleared his throat. A small sound, but the children instantly stopped talking. He smiled at them, and their heads bowed over earnestly clasped hands.</p><p>\u201cBless us, O Lord,\u201d he said in French, \u201cand these thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty, through Christ our Lord.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAmen,\u201d everyone murmured, and talk washed over the room like the tide coming in.</p><p>\u201cAre ye bound back to the army soon, Ian?\u201d Marsali asked, tucking a damp lock of blond hair back into her cap.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut not Washington\u2019s army. No yet, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jamie leaned across me to raise a brow at him.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve turned your coat, then?\u201d he said. \u201cOr just decided the British pay better?\u201d There was a wry edge to this; he\u2019d not seen a penny of pay and told me frankly that he didn\u2019t expect to. Congress wasn\u2019t swift about paying anyone, and a temporary general who\u2019d resigned his commission was likely at the bottom of their list.</p> <p>Ian closed his eyes in momentary bliss, chewing an oyster, then swallowed and opened them, wiping a dribble of milk from his chin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said equably, \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 Dottie up to New York to see her da and Lord John.\u201d</p><p>That stopped all adult conversation dead, though the children continued to chatter by the hearth. I saw Jenny dart her eyes at Rachel, who looked composed, though considerably less blissful than she had before. She\u2019d known about it, though; there was no surprise on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that, then?\u201d Jamie asked, in a tone of mild curiosity. \u201cShe\u2019s not decided Denzell doesna suit her, I hope? For I doubt he\u2019s taken to beating her.\u201d</p><p>That made Rachel laugh\u2014briefly, but out loud, and the company relaxed a bit.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe Dottie to be pleased in her marriage; I know my brother is.\u201d The smile lingered in her eyes, though her face grew serious as she glanced at Ian, then turned to Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cHer eldest brother has died. He was a prisoner of war, held in New Jersey. Her brother Henry received news yesterday confirming his death, but Henry cannot bear the strain of so long a journey yet, especially with the roads so dangerous, and Dottie feels she must go to her father.\u201d</p><p>Jenny gave her a sharp look, which sharpened a bit further as she turned it on Ian.</p><p>\u201cThe roads bein\u2019 so dangerous,\u201d she repeated, with a mild tone that matched Jamie\u2019s and fooled no one. Ian grinned at her and took a fresh chunk of bread, which he dunked in his stew.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash, Mam,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a wee band o\u2019 folk I ken, traveling north. They\u2019re agreeable to going by New York. We\u2019ll be gey safe wi\u2019 them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of folk?\u201d Jenny asked suspiciously. \u201cQuakers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMohawk,\u201d he said, the grin widening. \u201cCome out wi\u2019 me and Rachel after supper, Mam. They\u2019d be that pleased to meet ye.\u201d</p><p>I could honestly say that, in all the time I\u2019d known her, I\u2019d never before seen Jenny Murray gobsmacked. I could feel Jamie vibrating with suppressed hilarity next to me, and had to look down into my bowl for a moment to regain my own composure.</p><p>Jenny was made of stern stuff, though. She took a long moment, took a longer breath, pushed Rollo\u2019s nose out of her lap, and then said calmly, \u201cAye. I\u2019d like that. Pass me the salt, Fergus, aye?\u201d</p> <p>In spite of the general amusement, I hadn\u2019t forgotten what Rachel had said about Dottie\u2019s brother Benjamin, and I felt a twist of surprisingly acute pain, as though someone had knotted a length of barbed wire round my heart. \u201cDo you ever make bargains with God?\u201d If Hal had offered such a bargain, evidently God had declined it. Oh, God, Hal . . . I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear about Dottie\u2019s brother,\u201d I said, leaning forward to talk to Rachel. \u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head briefly, and the firelight, now behind her, cast shadow on her face from the curtain of dark hair.</p><p>\u201cHenry had had a letter from their brother Adam. He\u2019d had the news from someone on General Clinton\u2019s staff, I think he said. All it said was that whoever had written the letter wished to express their regrets as to the death of Captain Benjamin Grey, a British prisoner of war who had been held at Middlebrook Encampment in New Jersey, and would General Clinton\u2019s office please relay this sad news to the captain\u2019s family. They\u2019d thought it possible that he was dead\u2014but this seems to put the matter beyond all doubt, alas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiddlebrook Encampment is what they call the place in the Watchung Mountains where Washington took his troops after Bound Brook,\u201d Fergus remarked with interest. \u201cBut the army left there in June of last year. Why would Captain Grey be there, I wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes an army travel wi\u2019 its captives?\u201d Jamie asked, raising one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cSave if they\u2019re taken when the army\u2019s on the move, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Fergus nodded, conceding the point, but seemed still to be pondering something. Marsali stepped in before he could speak, though, gesturing at Ian with her spoon.</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 o\u2019 why\u2014why are your friends going north?\u201d she asked. \u201cHasn\u2019t anything to do wi\u2019 the massacre at Andrustown, has it?\u201d</p><p>Jenny turned toward her son, intent. A closed look came over Ian\u2019s face, though he answered calmly enough.</p><p>\u201cIt does, aye. Where did ye hear o\u2019 that?\u201d</p><p>Marsali and Fergus shrugged in unison, making me smile involuntarily, in spite of my distress over Hal\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cThe way in which we hear most of the news we print,\u201d Fergus amplified. \u201cA letter from someone who heard of the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do your friends have in mind to do about the matter?\u201d Jenny asked.</p><p>\u201cMore to the point,\u201d Jamie said, twisting to address Ian, \u201cwhat do you have in mind to do about it?\u201d</p><p>I was watching Rachel, on the other side of the table, rather than Ian, but I saw a look too faint to be called anxiety cross her brow, relaxing in the next instant when Ian replied flatly, \u201cNothing.\u201d Perhaps feeling this too blunt, he coughed and took a gulp of beer.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken anyone who was there, and as I havena any intent to turn my coat and fight for the British wi\u2019 Thayendanegea . . . Nay,\u201d he finished, setting down his cup. \u201cI\u2019ll go as far as New York to see Dottie safe and then come back to wherever Washington might be.\u201d He smiled at Rachel, his face shifting abruptly from its usual appealing half-homely expression to a startling attractiveness. \u201cI need my scout\u2019s pay, after all; I\u2019ve a wife to support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe must come and stay wi\u2019 us, then,\u201d Marsali said to Rachel. \u201cWhile Ian\u2019s gone, I mean.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t time to wonder exactly where she planned to put Rachel\u2014Marsali was ingenious and would doubtless find a place\u2014before Rachel shook her head. She wasn\u2019t wearing a cap but wore her straight dark hair loose on her shoulders; I could hear the whisper of it against her dress as she moved.</p><p>\u201cI shall go with Ian to fetch Dottie. Rollo and I will stay in camp with my brother until Ian returns. I can be useful there.\u201d Her long fingers curled and flexed in illustration, and she smiled at me. \u201cThee knows the joy of useful occupation, Claire, I expect.\u201d</p><p>Jenny made a nondescript noise in her throat, and Marsali snorted briefly, though without rancor.</p><p>\u201cIndeed I do,\u201d I said, my eyes on the slice of bread I was buttering. \u201cAnd which would you rather find useful occupation in, Rachel\u2014boiling laundry, or lancing the boils on Mr. Pinckney\u2019s arse?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and the arrival of Henri-Christian with an empty bowl in his hands saved her replying. He set it on the table and yawned sleepily, swaying on his feet.</p><p>\u201cAye, it\u2019s late, wee man,\u201d his mother said to him, and, picking him up, cradled him in her arms. \u201cLay your head, a bhalaich. Papa will take ye up presently.\u201d</p><p>More beer was fetched, the little girls collected the empty bowls and put them in the bucket to soak, Germain vanished outside into the gathering dusk for the last few minutes of play with his friends, Rollo curled up to sleep by the fire, and talk became general.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand rested warmly on my thigh, and I leaned against him, laying my head briefly on his shoulder. He looked down at me and smiled, squeezing my leg. I was looking forward to the Spartan comfort of our pallet in the loft, the cooling freedom of shift and nakedness, and the sharing of whispers in the dark\u2014but for the moment was more than content to be where I was.</p><p>Rachel was talking across Marsali to Fergus, Marsali humming quietly to Henri-Christian, whose round dark head lolled on her bosom, his eyes almost closed. I looked carefully at Rachel, but it was much too soon to see any signs of pregnancy, even if\u2014And then I stopped, startled, as my eye caught something else.</p><p>I\u2019d seen Marsali through her pregnancy with Henri-Christian. And I was seeing a bloom on her cheeks now that wasn\u2019t from the warmth of the room: a slight fullness of the eyelids, and a subtle softening and rounding of face and body that I might have recognized earlier, had I been looking for it. Did Fergus know, I wondered? And glanced quickly at the head of the table, to see him looking at Marsali and Henri-Christian, his dark eyes soft with love.</p><p>Jamie shifted a little beside me, turning to say something to Ian, on my other side. I turned, too, and saw that Ian\u2019s eyes were also fixed on Marsali and Henri-Christian, with a look of wistfulness that smote me to the heart.</p><p>I felt his longing, and my own\u2014for Brianna. Roger, and Jem, and Mandy. Safe, I hoped\u2014but not here, and I swallowed a lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d die for them, happily,\u201d Hal had said, in the long night watch when I\u2019d kept him breathing. \u201cYour family. But at the same time you think, Christ, I can\u2019t die! What might happen to them if I weren\u2019t here?\u201d He\u2019d given me a wry and rueful smile. \u201cAnd you know bloody well that you mostly can\u2019t help them anyway; they\u2019ve got to do it\u2014or not\u2014themselves.\u201d</p><p>That was true. But it didn\u2019t stop you caring.</p><p>IT WAS HOT and close in the loft, with the comfortable lingering scents of supper crammed in under the rafters, the more argumentative pungencies of ink, paper, buckram, and leather that had built up all day, and the faintly pervasive scent of mule straw underlying everything. I gasped at the impact as I stepped off the ladder and went at once to open the loading door that looked out onto the cobbled alley behind the shop.</p><p>A blast of Philadelphia rushed in, fluttering the stacks of paper: smoke from a dozen nearby chimneys, an acrid stink from the manure pile behind the livery stable down the street, and the intoxicatingly resinous scent of leaves and bark and brush and flowers that was William Penn\u2019s legacy. Leave one acre of trees for every five acres cleared, he\u2019d advised in his charter, and if Philadelphia had not quite met that ideal, it was still a particularly verdant city.</p><p>\u201cGod bless you, William,\u201d I said, beginning to shed my outer clothes as fast as possible. The evening air might be warm and humid, but it was moving, and I couldn\u2019t wait to let it move over my skin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a kind thought, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, stepping off the ladder into the loft. \u201cWhy, though? Is the lad in your mind for some reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014oh, William,\u201d I said, realizing. \u201cI hadn\u2019t actually meant your son, but naturally . . .\u201d I fumbled to organize an explanation but gave it up, seeing that he wasn\u2019t really attending. \u201cWere you thinking of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, aye,\u201d he admitted, coming to help with my laces. \u201cBeing wi\u2019 the weans and the bairns, and all sae comfortable together . . .\u201d His voice died away and he drew me gently to him, bent his head to mine, and let it rest there with a sigh that stirred the hair near my face.</p><p>\u201cYou wish he could be part of it,\u201d I said softly, reaching up to touch his cheek. \u201cBe part of the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf wishes were horses, then beggars would ride,\u201d he said, and let go, with a wry smile visible in the glow from the kitchen below. \u201cAnd if turnips were swords, I\u2019d hae one by my side.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, but my eye went to the stack of Bibles where he was accustomed to leave his sword. His dirk was there, his pistols, shot bag, and a scatter of oddments from his sporran, but no sword. I squinted to be sure I was seeing a-right, but I was.</p><p>\u201cI sold it,\u201d he said matter-of-factly, seeing the direction of my glance. \u201cIt\u2019s one good thing to be said of war: ye can get a good price for a decent weapon.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to protest, but didn\u2019t. He wore weapons with a lifelong ease, to the point that his knives and guns seemed a part of him, and I didn\u2019t like to see him diminished by the loss of any. But without an army commission, he likely wouldn\u2019t need a sword immediately, and we did certainly need money.</p><p>\u201cYou can buy another when we reach Wilmington,\u201d I said practically, returning his favor by unbuttoning his breeks. They slid off his lean hips and fell, puddling round his feet. \u201cIt would be lovely for William to know the truth about Bree and her family sometime. Will you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the event that he ever comes within speakin\u2019 distance of me without trying to kill me?\u201d One corner of his mouth curled ruefully. \u201cAye, maybe. But I maybe wouldn\u2019t tell him all the truth.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, perhaps not all at once, no,\u201d I agreed. A warm breeze from the window stirred his hair and the tails of his shirt. I fingered the creased linen, warm and damp from his body. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take that off?\u201d</p><p>He looked me over carefully; I was standing now in nothing but my shift and stockings. A slow smile spread into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFair\u2019s fair,\u201d he said. \u201cTake yours off, as well, then.\u201d</p><p>CLAIRE WAS LOVELY, standing white and naked as a French statue against the deep twilight from the open window, her curly hair a storm cloud round her shoulders. Jamie wanted to stand and look at her, but he wanted a lot more to have his c**k inside her.</p> <p>There were still voices down in the kitchen, though, and he went and pulled the ladder up. Wouldn\u2019t do to have Germain or one of the girls scamper up to say good night.</p><p>There was a hoot of laughter from Ian and Fergus below, probably at sight of the ladder disappearing, and he grinned to himself, laying it aside. They had their own wives, and if they were foolish enough to sit drinking beer instead of enjoying their beds, it was none of his affair.</p><p>Claire was already on their pallet when he turned from the edge of the loft, a pale shadow under the gloom of the ink casks. He eased himself in naked beside her, touched her curving hip; she touched his cock. \u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered, and suddenly everything changed.</p><p>It was their common magic, but magic nonetheless, the smell of onions and brine on her hands, the taste of butter and beer on her tongue, a tickle of hair on his shoulder, and a sudden rush when she ran a finger down the crack of his arse, which drew him straight up hard between her willing legs.</p><p>She made a sound that made him put a hand over her mouth, and he felt her laugh, hot breath against his palm, so he took his hand away and stopped her noises with his mouth, lying full on her for a moment, not moving, trying to wait, not able to wait for the feel of her squirming under him, slick and slippery, rubbing her ni**les on his, urging him . . . and then she quivered and made a small noise of surrender that freed him to do as he would, and he did.</p> <p>JAMIE HEAVED a deep sigh of utter relaxation.</p><p>\u201cI have been wanting to do that all day, Sassenach. Moran taing, a nighean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have\u2014Is that a bat?\u201d It was: a flittering scrap of detached darkness, ricocheting from one side of the loft to the other. I grabbed Jamie\u2019s arm with one hand and pulled a corner of the sheet over my head with the other. It wasn\u2019t that I minded bats, as such; a bat whizzing to and fro three feet over my head in the dark, though . . .</p><p>\u201cDinna fash, Sassenach,\u201d he said, sounding amused. \u201cIt\u2019ll go out again directly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure of that,\u201d I said, slapping something ticklish on my neck. \u201cThere are probably any number of insects in here for it to hunt.\u201d Clouds of gnats and mosquitoes were inclined to roam in through the open loading window when evening fell, and it was always a Hobson\u2019s choice: keep the window closed and die of suffocation, or open it and be chivvied all night by crawling feet and the irritating sneeeee! of mosquitoes whining in our ears.</p><p>\u201cYe ought to be pleased about the bat, then,\u201d Jamie told me, rolling onto his side and using another bit of sheet to blot a sheen of sweat from his chest. \u201cHow many bugs did ye tell me they eat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell . . . lots,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me how I remember this, but according to Brianna\u2019s encyclopedia, the average little brown bat can eat up to a thousand mosquitoes in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there ye are, then,\u201d he said. \u201cI dinna think there can be more than two or three hundred mosquitoes in here just now\u2014it shouldna take him more than a quarter hour to deal wi\u2019 those.\u201d</p><p>It was a definite point, but I was not quite convinced of the virtues of entertaining a resident bat. I did emerge from my makeshift shelter, though, peering upward. \u201cWhat if more bats come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they\u2019ll clear the place in five minutes.\u201d He sighed briefly. \u201cD\u2019ye want me to catch him, throw him out, and close the door, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, envisioning Jamie pirouetting around the loft in the dark, either being bitten by a startled bat if he did succeed in catching it or plunging over the edge of the loft in the effort to do so. \u201cNo, that\u2019s all right. Tell me what you didn\u2019t want to say earlier\u2014that will take my mind off it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2014oh, aye.\u201d He rolled onto his back, hands clasped on his stomach. \u201cIt\u2019s only I\u2019ve been talking wi\u2019 Fergus and Ian about coming with us when we leave for the Ridge. Didna want to mention it at table, though. Ian and Fergus should talk it over wi\u2019 Rachel and Marsali by themselves first\u2014and I didna want the bairns to hear. They\u2019d go mad with excitement, and Marsali would run me through the heart wi\u2019 a meat skewer for stirring them up just before bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might,\u201d I said, amused. \u201cOh\u2014speaking of Marsali . . . I rather think she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she, now?\u201d He turned his head to me, deeply interested. \u201cAre ye sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure without asking her nosy questions and examining her. But I think there\u2019s a good chance of it. If so . . . that might affect whether they go with us, mightn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The prospect of going home was suddenly real, in a way that it hadn\u2019t been even a moment before. I could almost feel the breath of the mountains on my bare skin, and gooseflesh rippled fleetingly over my ribs at the thought, in spite of the heat.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Jamie said, though absently. \u201cI suppose it might. D\u2019ye think\u2014if she is wi\u2019 child, might the new one be like Henri-Christian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said, though professional caution made me add, \u201cI can\u2019t be positive that his type of dwarfism isn\u2019t a hereditary condition, because Fergus doesn\u2019t know anything about his family. But I think Henri-Christian\u2019s is probably a mutation\u2014something that happens just once, a sort of accident.\u201d</p><p>Jamie gave a small snort.</p><p>\u201cMiracles only happen once, too, Sassenach,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why all bairns are different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t argue with that,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cBut we\u2019ll need to be traveling quite soon, won\u2019t we? Even if Marsali is pregnant, she won\u2019t be more than three or four months along.\u201d A small sense of unease crept into my mind. It was early September; snow might begin to close the mountain passes as early as October, though if it was a warm year . . .</p><p>\u201cHow long will it take, do you think? To get back to the Ridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long to make it before the snow, Sassenach,\u201d he said gently, running a hand down my back. \u201cEven if I manage the money and find a ship to take us down to North Carolina\u2014and I\u2019d rather do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d I blurted, astonished. \u201cYou? Take a ship? I thought you\u2019d sworn you\u2019d never set foot on one again unless it was the ship taking your coffin back to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Aye, well. If it was only me, then, aye, I\u2019d rather walk to North Carolina barefoot over hot coals. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s you, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I sat up straight, angry. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? Ahhh!\u201d I clutched my hair and dived into his lap, for the bat had zoomed within inches of my head; I actually heard its faint squeaking and the leathery flap of wings.</p><p>Jamie laughed, but with a faint edge to it. As I sat up again, he ran a hand down my right side and rested two fingers over the fresh scar there.</p><p>\u201cI mean that, Sassenach,\u201d he said, and pressed. Very gently, and I kept myself from flinching at the touch\u2014but the scar was still red and tender.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, as firmly as possible.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been shot, Sassenach,\u201d he said, very dryly. \u201cMore than once. I ken what it feels like\u2014and how long it takes to get your full strength back. Ye nearly fell over in the street today, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t eaten anything; I was hungry, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no taking ye overland,\u201d he said, in a tone that brooked no argument. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only you\u2014though it\u2019s mostly you,\u201d he added, in a softer tone, smoothing the hair off my face. \u201cBut there are the wee bairns, as well, and now Marsali, if she\u2019s wi\u2019 child . . . It\u2019s a hard journey, lass, and dangerous, forbye. Did ye not say the duke told ye the British mean to take the South now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d I said, but allowed him to pull me down next to him. \u201cYes, he did. But I\u2019ve no idea what that might actually mean, in terms of where they are or what they\u2019re doing. The only battles I\u2019d actually heard of, beyond Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill, are Saratoga and Yorktown\u2014that\u2019s where it ends, Yorktown,\u201d I added. \u201cObviously a few things must happen in between, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d he said. \u201cAye. Well, I\u2019ll buy another sword when we get to North Carolina and I\u2019ve money again.\u201d</p><p>He did in fact have considerable assets\u2014in North Carolina. But there was no way of retrieving any of the gold hidden in the Spaniard\u2019s Cave there\u2014even if he had trusted anyone to do so, no one knew where the cave was, save him and Jemmy\u2014and the aging whisky (almost as valuable as the gold, if brought to the coast for sale) was in the same place.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the price of a good sword isn\u2019t quite enough for ship\u2019s passage for nine people\u2014no, eleven, if Ian and Rachel come, too\u2014is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI said to Fergus that he might consider selling his press. He doesna own the premises, ken\u2014but the press is his.\u201d He made a small gesture, encompassing the building around us. \u201cThere\u2019s my Bonnie in Wilmington, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour\u2014oh, your press. Of course.\u201d I hid a smile in his biceps. He invariably spoke of . . . well, her . . . with a certain possessive affection. Come to think, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever heard him talk about me that way. . . .</p><p>\u201cAye. Fergus has his mind set that he\u2019ll go on bein\u2019 a printer, and I think that\u2019s wise. Germain\u2019s not yet big enough to plow\u2014and poor wee Henri-Christian never will be.\u201d</p><p>I suppressed my speculations as to just what Germain\u2019s reaction might be if forcibly removed from the environs of a thriving city and plunked down behind a plow. He might remember the Ridge fondly, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted to be a farmer.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Richard Bell?\u201d Bell was the Loyalist who had been forcibly deported from his North Carolina home and sent, penniless and friendless, to England, ending up eventually in Edinburgh, where he had found employment as a printer\u2014and where Jamie had encountered him and made the bargain whereby Richard would bring Bonnie to North Carolina and look after her in return for his passage home.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken,\u201d Jamie said reflectively. \u201cI wrote to him, to say we were coming to Wilmington and that we must make some arrangement . . . but I\u2019ve had no reply.\u201d This didn\u2019t necessarily mean anything; letters frequently were lost or late. Jamie shrugged a little and shifted, stretching as he resettled himself. \u201cAye, well; let that bide. We\u2019ll see when we see. How\u2019s our wee friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur\u2014oh.\u201d I looked up, scanning the low ceiling, but saw no trace of the bat. I didn\u2019t hear any whining mosquitoes, either. \u201cWell done, bat,\u201d I said appreciatively.</p><p>Jamie laughed, low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cRemember sittin\u2019 on the stoop and watching the bats come out in the summer evenings on the Ridge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said softly, and turned on my side to embrace him lightly, hand on the curly hairs of his chest. I did remember. The Ridge. The cabin Jamie and Ian had built for shelter when we first came there, and the white piglet we\u2019d bought, who had become the fearsome white sow, terror of the entire neighborhood. Our friends, Jamie\u2019s tenants, Lizzie and the Beardsley twins . . . My heart squeezed at some of the memories.</p><p>Malva Christie. Poor doomed child. And the Bugs\u2014Jamie\u2019s trusted factor and his wife\u2014who had proven a good deal less than trustworthy. And the Big House, our house, gone up in flames, and our life there with it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to build the new house first thing,\u201d he said thoughtfully. He laid his own hand on mine and squeezed it. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make ye a new garden. Ye can have half the money I got for my sword, to buy seeds.\u201d</p><p>BELIEF IS A WISE WAGER</p><p>September 10, 1778</p><p>New York</p><p>HAL GAVE A MILD snort. \u201cI don\u2019t like your going alone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it, either,\u201d John said matter-of-factly, corking his hip flask. \u201cBut the only person who could effectively go with me is you, and you can\u2019t, because of the regiment, so . . . God, I miss Tom Byrd,\u201d he said impulsively.</p><p>\u201cYour erstwhile valet?\u201d Hal smiled, despite the worry of the situation. \u201cHow long has it been since you\u2019ve seen him? Ten years at least, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that.\u201d Thought of Tom still gave him a slight pang. Tom had left his employment\u2014with deep regret on both sides\u2014in order to marry, and had become a successful publican in Southwark, his wife having inherited a thriving public house from her father. Grey couldn\u2019t begrudge him his happiness, but he still sorely missed Byrd, with his sharp eyes, quick mind, and anxious care for Grey\u2019s person as well as his clothes.</p><p>He glanced down at himself; his current valet managed to keep him decent\u2014a task that he himself admitted to be Sisyphean\u2014but lacked both imagination and conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou should take Marks, regardless,\u201d Hal said, having evidently followed his train of thought without difficulty. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to keep you in order.\u201d He gave John\u2019s uniform a critical look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can dress myself, you know,\u201d John said mildly. \u201cAs for the uniform\u2014\u201d He glanced down and shrugged. \u201cBit of a brush-off, clean shirt, spare stockings . . . it\u2019s not as though I mean to be calling on General Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can only hope.\u201d Hal\u2019s lips pressed together. He\u2019d already expressed his reservations\u2014if anything so violently explicit could be described in such terms\u2014regarding Grey\u2019s intent to travel as himself, in uniform.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had quite enough of being arrested as a spy, thank you,\u201d John replied. \u201cBeyond the risk of being hanged out-of-hand, the Americans\u2019 sense of hospitality . . . though come to think, I\u2019d meant to ask: do you know a Watson Smith? Used to be a captain in the Twenty-second, I think.\u201d</p><p>Hal frowned in concentration, but his brow cleared almost immediately.</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cA very good officer; did well at Crefeld and Zorndorf.\u201d He cocked his head to one side, brows raised. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s turned his coat; he\u2019s now a colonel in the Continental army. I was his involuntary guest for a short time. Nice fellow,\u201d Grey added fairly. \u201cGot me drunk on applejack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtless with the intent of extracting intelligence from you?\u201d Hal\u2019s expression made it clear that he doubted there had been much in that line for Smith to extract.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grey said thoughtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. We just got drunk together. Nice fellow,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI was going to express the hope that I wouldn\u2019t meet him again\u2014shouldn\u2019t like to have to kill him, I mean\u2014but I suppose it isn\u2019t beyond belief that I might run into him somewhere.\u201d The thought gave him a small, pleasant clench low down in the belly that rather surprised him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m going in uniform, even if grubby uniform. It won\u2019t necessarily keep me from arrest, imprisonment, starvation, and torture, but it will save me from being hanged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTorture?\u201d Hal gave him a look.</p><p>\u201cI had in mind waking up after the applejack,\u201d John told him. \u201cAnd the singing. Have you any idea how many verses the Americans have for \u2018Yankee Doodle\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Hal grunted in response to this and took out a leather folder, from which he extracted a thin sheaf of documents.</p><p>\u201cHere are your bona fides,\u201d he said, handing them over. \u201cThey may help\u2014assuming firstly that you\u2019re captured or detained, rather than shot on sight, and secondly that your captors take the time to read them.\u201d</p><p>Grey didn\u2019t trouble to reply to this, being occupied in thumbing through the documents. A copy of his warrant of commission; a note from Hal as Colonel of the Regiment, detaching Lieutenant Colonel John Grey temporarily from service and desiring him to undertake the task of locating and assisting one Mrs. Benjamin Grey (n\u00e9e Amaranthus Cowden), widow of Captain Benjamin Grey, late of the Thirty-fourth Foot; a \u201cTo Whom It May Concern\u201d letter from Clinton, formally recognizing Grey\u2019s mission and requesting that every courtesy and assistance be provided him in consequence thereof; several bills of exchange drawn on Coutts\u2019 bank in New York (\u201cJust in case,\u201d Hal told him. \u201cIn case of what?\u201d \u201cIn case you get knocked over and relieved of your gold, halfwit.\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d); and . . . Benedict Arnold\u2019s note, granting the Duke of Pardloe and his brother, Lord John Grey, permission to abide temporarily in Philadelphia for the purpose of searching for the duke\u2019s nephew.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Grey said, raising his brows at this last. \u201cUnder what circumstances do you think this might be helpful?\u201d</p> <p>Hal shrugged and straightened his waistcoat. \u201cThe fact that you and I are known to General Arnold is worth something. The note doesn\u2019t give his opinion of us, after all.\u201d</p><p>Grey gave the note a critical eye, but, in fact, Arnold had refrained from personalities and had not codified his threats regarding rails and tar and feathers.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He closed the folder and put it down, laying his hat on it to ensure against walking off without it. \u201cThat\u2019s that, then. What\u2019s for supper?\u201d</p><p>JOHN GREY WAS enjoying a confused but pleasant dream involving spring rain, his dachshund Roscoe, Colonel Watson Smith, and a great deal of mud, when he gradually became aware that the raindrops on his face were real.</p><p>He opened his eyes, blinking, to discover his niece, Dottie, holding his pitcher in one hand and sprinkling water from her fingertips onto his face.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Uncle John,\u201d she said cheerily. \u201cRise and shine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last person injudicious enough to say that to me in the morning came to a most unpleasant end,\u201d he said, struggling upright and rubbing the sleeve of his nightshirt across his face.</p><p>\u201cReally? What happened to him? Or was it a him?\u201d She dimpled at him and set down the pitcher, wiping her wet fingers on her skirt.</p> <p>\u201cWhat an improper question,\u201d he said, eyeing her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am a married woman now, you know,\u201d she said, sitting down with an air of extreme self-possession. \u201cI am allowed to know that men and women occasionally share a bed, even outwith the bonds of matrimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutwith? Where did you pick up that barbarous construction? Have you been speaking to Scotchmen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConstantly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what happened to the unfortunate person who tried to roust you from your slumbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, him.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his head, still surprised at feeling the hair so short, though it had at least grown enough to fall over and lie somewhat flat, rather than sticking straight up like a shaving brush. \u201cHe was scalped by red Indians.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cWell, that will teach him, to be sure,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Grey swung his legs out of bed and gave her a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how married you are, Dottie, you are not allowed to help me dress. What the devil are you doing here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you to find B-Ben\u2019s widow,\u201d she said, and all of a sudden her bright fa\u00e7ade collapsed like papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 in the rain. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she clamped a hand hard over her mouth to prevent them falling.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Grey said. \u201cOh, my dear . . .\u201d And pausing only to fling on his banyan\u2014even in emergency, there were limits\u2014he knelt beside her and gathered her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said softly to her, rubbing her back. \u201cBen may not be dead, after all. We think he\u2019s not\u2014your father and I.\u201d We certainly hope he\u2019s not, he thought, but opted for the most positive view of the situation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d She choked, sniffed, and sat up a bit, looking up at him with drowned-cornflower eyes.</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d he said firmly, and dug in the pocket of his banyan for a handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cBut why not?\u201d She accepted the proffered linen\u2014somewhat crumpled but not indecently so\u2014and dabbed at her face. \u201cHow could he not be?\u201d</p><p>Grey sighed, caught between Scylla and Charybdis, as usual when enmeshed in one of Hal\u2019s situations.</p><p>\u201cDoes your father know you\u2019re here?\u201d he asked, as a delaying tactic.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014I mean, no,\u201d she said, clearing her throat and sitting up straighter. \u201cI went to his quarters, but he was out, so I came on here to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it that you\u2019re sure Ben\u2019s died?\u201d Grey stood up and, tying the belt of his banyan, began looking about for his slippers. He knew that Hal hadn\u2019t yet written to Minnie about Ben\u2014wouldn\u2019t do so unless forced by dreadful certainty\u2014and even if he had, there was no way in which word could have come back to Dottie so soon. And Hal would not have told his daughter the news until he was sure, no more than he would have told his wife.</p><p>\u201cHenry told me,\u201d she said. She poured a little water onto the handkerchief and commenced repairs to her complexion. \u201cI went to visit him and Mercy, and he\u2019d just had a letter from Adam, telling him . . . you\u2019re sure he isn\u2019t dead?\u201d she asked anxiously, lowering the handkerchief to gaze at him. \u201cAdam\u2019s letter said he\u2019d heard it from someone on General Clinton\u2019s staff, telling him for sure that Ben had died at a military camp in New Jersey\u2014Middlebrook, I think he said it was called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not sure,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut we have reasonable grounds for doubt, and until those have been completely explored, we will proceed on the assumption that he\u2019s not. I do have to find his wife, though,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd child.\u201d</p><p>Dottie\u2019s eyes flew wide.</p><p>\u201cA child? Ben has a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the woman who claims to be his wife has a son, or so she says\u2014and she did say that Ben is the father of her offspring.\u201d Seeing that there was little alternative, he apprised her of the letter from Amaranthus Cowden that Hal had received in Philadelphia, and its contents.</p><p>\u201cNow, as Ben didn\u2019t happen to mention this woman to Hal, one of the duties I\u2019m to carry out for your father is the determination as to whether she\u2019s telling the truth. And if she is, then of course I will bring her back with me, and the family will take care of her and the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she\u2019s not telling the truth?\u201d Dottie\u2019s distress was rapidly being subsumed by a combination of hope and curiosity.</p><p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d Grey said frankly. \u201cWould you like to go and ask Marks to see about breakfast for us, Dottie? I may be out of bed, but I\u2019m in no way equipped to conduct hypothetical conversations before I\u2019ve had a cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, of course.\u201d She rose, though slowly, plainly still thinking about the revelations, and went toward the door, but paused on the threshold and looked back at him.</p><p>\u201cI am coming with you,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cWe can talk about it on the way.\u201d</p><p>HAL WALKED IN as the kippers and mixed grill were being laid out. He halted for a split second as he saw Dottie, but then came on, more slowly, eyeing her.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Papa,\u201d she said briskly, rising and coming to kiss his cheek. \u201cSit down and have a kipper.\u201d</p><p>He did sit down, still eyeing her, then switched his gaze to John.</p><p>\u201cI had nothing to do with it,\u201d Grey assured his brother. \u201cShe arrived\u2014how did you get here, Dottie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn a horse,\u201d she replied patiently, taking a slice of toast.</p><p>\u201cAnd where is your husband?\u201d Hal asked mildly. \u201cDoes he know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenzell is where his duty takes him,\u201d she said, rather tersely. \u201cWith the Continental army. Mine takes me here. And of course he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he had no objection to your traveling alone from Pennsylvania to New York, over roads infested by\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d She took a delicate bite of her toast, chewed, and swallowed. \u201cIan and some of his Mohawk friends brought me. The Mohawks were traveling to someplace north of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan\u2014is that by chance Ian Murray?\u201d Grey asked, but then answered himself. \u201cI suppose it must be; how many Mohawks can there be named Ian? I take it that he survived his wound, then; I\u2019m pleased to hear it. How did you come to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorothea,\u201d said Hal, in measured tones, staring at Dottie. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Dottie returned his stare, her jaw visibly clenched.</p><p>\u201cB-because of Ben,\u201d she said, unable to keep her voice entirely steady. \u201cAre you\u2014Papa, are you sure he\u2019s not dead?\u201d</p><p>Hal took an audible breath and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said in his best command voice. But John could see his knuckles whiten as he clutched a teaspoon, and felt the knot in his own stomach tighten in response.</p><p>Dottie clearly had her own doubts, judging from her glance at her father, but she obligingly nodded. Being Dottie, of course, she didn\u2019t stop there.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you know? Adam and Henry both think . . . the worst.\u201d</p><p>Hal\u2019s mouth opened a fraction of an inch, but nothing came out.</p><p>John thought that Hal ought really to have been prepared for this, but, after all, his brother had been having a difficult time. And, in all justice, it was hard to be prepared for something like Dottie.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d better tell her,\u201d John said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, she\u2019ll likely write to Minnie.\u201d</p><p>Hal shot him a glance full of venom, fully aware that this helpful suggestion had been made with the intent of forcing him to divulge his reasoning to Dottie\u2014but there wasn\u2019t much of a choice, and he did so with as much grace as he could.</p><p>\u201cBut this Captain Richardson hadn\u2019t done anything to Willie?\u201d Dottie said, frowning a little. \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on this occasion,\u201d John said briefly, \u201cbut given his earlier behavior over the Dismal Swamp and Quebec, we\u2019re somewhat suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the man apparently has deserted,\u201d Hal pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. He might have been killed by someone and his body concealed,\u201d Dottie pointed out logically.</p><p>\u201cHe was seen leaving the camp,\u201d John said patiently. \u201cAlone. And given what we know and surmise about him, I think we have grounds to consider the possibility that he might be an American agent.\u201d He was himself fairly well convinced of it, viewing all his experience of Richardson now with the clarity of hindsight. He\u2019d been an intelligencer himself for some years, and every instinct he possessed was presently shouting Stinking fish! with regard to Ezekiel Richardson.</p><p>\u201cI blame myself extremely,\u201d he said apologetically to Hal. \u201cI should have been on to him much sooner. But I was . . . distracted at the time.\u201d Distracted. Blown sideways and more than half obliterated by the news of Jamie Fraser\u2019s death. Even the memory of it was enough to close his stomach. He put down the forkful of kipper, untasted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Dottie said slowly. Her own breakfast was congealing on her plate. So was Hal\u2019s. \u201cSo you don\u2019t believe Ben is dead, because this Richardson told you he was\u2014and you think Richardson is a wrong \u2019un. But that\u2019s . . . all?\u201d She looked intently at her father, her young chin trembling slightly, begging reassurance.</p><p>Hal closed his eyes for an instant, opened them, and looked at her directly.</p><p>\u201cDorothea,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have to believe that Ben is alive. Because if he isn\u2019t, then your mother will die of heartbreak\u2014and I will die with her.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of long silence, during which Grey heard the passage of carts in the street and the muffled voices of his valet and a bootblack in the corridor. Dottie made no sound at all, but he felt he could hear, too, the tears that rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p> <p>THE RAVELED SLEEVE OF CARE</p><p>September 15, 1778</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>I WOKE ABRUPTLY IN the dark, disoriented and alarmed. For a moment, I had no idea where I was or what was happening\u2014only that something was seriously wrong.</p><p>I sat up, blinking furiously in an attempt to focus my eyes. Patted round in confusion and found myself naked, legs tangled in a sheet and wisps of straw prickling . . . oh. Loft. Printshop.</p> <p>Jamie.</p><p>That was what was wrong. He lay next to me, but not still. He was on his side, turned away from me, body contorted, knees drawn up, and his arms crossed tight over his chest, head bowed. Shivering violently, though moonlight showed me the gleam of cold sweat on his shoulders. And making the terrible small whimpering noises that betokened the worst of his dreams.</p><p>I knew better than to try to wake him suddenly. Not in a small space with a lot of clutter and a steep drop ten feet away.</p><p>My own heart was pounding, and I knew his was. I eased myself carefully down beside him, facing his back. I needed to touch him, to bring him slowly to himself\u2014or to enough of himself that he could recover alone. This wasn\u2019t the sort of nightmare eased by talking. Or, sometimes, even by waking.</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d he said, in a heartbroken whisper. \u201cGod, no!\u201d</p><p>I mustn\u2019t grab or shake him. I clenched my teeth and ran my hand lightly from the slope of his shoulder down to his elbow, and his skin shivered like a horse ridding itself of flies. That was all right, then. I did it again, paused, and again. He took a deep, horrible gasp, choked with fear . . . but the violent shivering eased a little.</p> <p>\u201cJamie,\u201d I whispered, and, with extreme caution, touched his back very lightly. If he was dreaming about Jack Randall, this might\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he exclaimed, in a loud, fierce voice, and his legs straightened, every muscle in his body tight against his skin. \u201cDamn you to hell!\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and relaxed, just a bit. Anger was a thousand times better than fear or pain. Anger would leave him, as soon as he woke completely. The other things tended to linger.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d I said, a little louder but still softly. Germain often slept by the hearth, not wanting to share a bed with his younger siblings. \u201cHush, Jamie. I\u2019m here.\u201d And with some trepidation, I put my arm round him, lightly, and laid my cheek against his back. His skin was hot; he smelled pungently of our lovemaking and even more strongly of fear and rage.</p><p>He stiffened, caught his breath\u2014but I felt his awareness come back: instantly, the way it did when he woke to some alarm, ready to leap out of bed, reaching for a weapon. I tightened my hold and pressed my body against his. He didn\u2019t move, but I felt the thud of his heart, beating hard and fast.</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>After a moment, he drew a deep breath and let it out in a long, quivering sigh.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he whispered, and his hand reached back to grasp my thigh, so tightly that I jerked but managed not to squeal. We rested quietly together for a time, until I felt his heart begin to slow and his skin cool, and then I kissed his back and traced the scars that would never fade from his body, over and over with gentle fingers, until they faded from his mind and he slept in my arms.</p> <p>THE PIGEONS ON the roof of the boardinghouse made a purling noise, like the sea coming in on a pebbled shore, rolling tiny rounded rocks in the surf. Rachel was making a similar noise, snoring very faintly. Ian found it charming and could have lain watching her and listening to her all night\u2014save that she was lying on his left arm, which had gone numb, and he needed urgently to piss.</p><p>As gently as possible, he edged out from under her soft weight, but she was a light sleeper and woke at once, yawning and stretching like a young catamount in the candlelight. She was naked, arms and face the color of just-toasted bread, her body white and her privates under their dark-brown bush a wonderful dusky color that wasn\u2019t either rose or violet or brown, but reminded him of orchids in the forests of Jamaica.</p><p>She stretched her arms above her head, and the movement lifted her startlingly white round br**sts and made her ni**les slowly rise. He began to slowly rise, too, and hastily turned away, before it became impossible to do what he\u2019d meant to.</p><p>\u201cGo back to sleep, lass,\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2014er . . .\u201d He gestured toward the chamber pot under the bed.</p><p>She made a pleasant sleepy noise and rolled onto her side, watching him.</p><p>\u201cDoes thee mind my looking at thee?\u201d she asked, in a soft voice husked by sleep and earlier muffled shrieks.</p><p>He glanced at her in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cWhy would ye want to?\u201d The notion seemed mildly perverse, but in a distinctly arousing fashion. He wanted to turn his back so he could piss, but if she wanted to watch him . . .</p><p>\u201cIt seems an intimacy of the body,\u201d she said, looking at him through half-closed eyes. \u201cA trusting, perhaps. That thee consider thy body to be mine, as I consider mine to be thine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo ye?\u201d That idea surprised him, but he didn\u2019t object. At all.</p><p>\u201cThee has seen the most hidden parts of me,\u201d she pointed out, and, spreading her legs, drew her fingers delicately between them in illustration. \u201cAnd tasted them, as well. What did it taste like?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cFresh-caught trout,\u201d he replied, smiling at her. \u201cRachel\u2014if ye want to watch me piss, ye can. But ye canna do it if ye talk to me like that while I\u2019m trying, aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She made a small snort of amusement and rolled over, turning her back and her very round bottom to him. \u201cGo ahead, then.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, examining his prospects.</p><p>\u201cIt will take a minute, aye?\u201d Before she could think of anything else outrageous to say to him, he went on, in hopes of distracting her. \u201cUncle Jamie and Auntie Claire think of leaving Philadelphia soon. To go back to North Carolina, ken? What would ye think of going with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He heard the rustle of the corn-husk mattress as she turned over quickly. \u201cWhere is thee thinking of going, that thee would not take me with thee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, I didna mean that, lass,\u201d he assured her, with a quick glance over his shoulder. She was propped on her elbows, looking at him accusingly. \u201cI meant we\u2019d both go. To Fraser\u2019s Ridge\u2014Uncle Jamie\u2019s settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That surprised her into silence. He could hear her thinking about it, and smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cThee does not feel an obligation to the Continental army?\u201d she asked after a moment, cautiously. \u201cTo the cause of freedom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dinna think those are necessarily the same thing, lass,\u201d he said, and closed his eyes in relief as everything relaxed at last. He shook himself and put away the pot, giving himself time to form a coherent sentence.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Pardloe told Auntie Claire that after Saratoga the British made a new plan. They mean to try to separate the southern colonies from the northern ones, blockade the South, and try to starve the North into submission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She moved to give him room to lie down beside her, then snuggled into him, her free hand cupping his balls. \u201cThen thee means there will not be fighting in the North, so thee will not be needed as a scout here\u2014but thee might, in the South?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, or I might find another use for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside the army, thee means?\u201d She was trying hard to keep hopefulness out of her voice; he could tell from the very sincere way she looked up at him, and he smiled at her, putting his own hand over hers. He was much in favor of bodily intimacy, but would rather not be squeezed like an orange should Rachel be overcome by enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said. \u201cI own some land, ken, on the Ridge. Uncle Jamie gave it to me, some years back. \u2019Twould be hard work, mind, clearing fields and planting and plowing, but farming is mostly peaceful. Bar things like bears and wild pigs and fire and hailstorms, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian.\u201d Her face had gone soft, and so had her hand, now resting peacefully in his. \u201cI should love to farm with thee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019d miss your brother,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cAnd Dottie. Maybe Fergus and Marsali and the weans, too\u2014I dinna think they\u2019d come settle on the Ridge, though Uncle Jamie thinks they\u2019d maybe travel south with us but settle near the coast. Fergus would need a decent-sized city, if he\u2019s to make much living as a printer.\u201d</p><p>A shadow crossed her face at that, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI will miss Denzell and Dottie\u2014but I should in any case, for they will go where the army goes. But I will be very happy if thee does not,\u201d she added softly, and lifted her face to kiss him.</p><p>RACHEL WOKE instantly. She hadn\u2019t been soundly asleep, her body still a-hum from lovemaking, and still so attuned to Ian\u2019s that when he gasped and stiffened beside her, she sprang at once into awareness and had her hands on his shoulders, meaning to shake him gently out of his dream.</p><p>The next moment, she was on the floor in a tangle of bedding, her husband on top of her and his very large hands vised round her throat. She flopped and wriggled, pushed at him in futile panic\u2014and then, as her breath vanished and brilliant red stars flashed in the darkness of her vision, she got hold of herself and brought her knee up as hard as she could.</p><p>It was a lucky blow, though it missed its mark; she hit Ian hard in the thigh, and he woke with a start and let go. She struggled out from under him, gasping and wheezing, and crawled as fast as she could to the corner, where she sat quivering with her arms wrapped round her knees, chest heaving and her heart thumping in her ears.</p><p>Ian was breathing heavily through his nose, pausing every so often to grunt or to say something brief\u2014and probably very expressive, if she\u2019d had the wit to understand it\u2014in either Gaelic or Mohawk. After a few minutes, though, he got slowly into a sitting position and leaned back against the bedstead.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d he said warily, after a moment\u2019s silence. He sounded rational, and her tight-clasped arms loosened a little.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said, tentative. \u201cIs thee . . . all right, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cWho taught ye to do that to a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenny,\u201d she said, beginning to breathe easier. \u201cHe said that discouraging a man from committing the sin of rape wasn\u2019t violence.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence from the vicinity of the bed.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Ian. \u201cI might have a wee chat wi\u2019 Denny, one of these days. A philosophical discussion on the meaning of words, like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he would enjoy it,\u201d Rachel said. She was still unnerved by what had happened, but crawled over and sat beside Ian on the floor. The sheet was lying in a pale puddle nearby, and she shook it out and draped it over her nakedness. She offered half of it to Ian, but he shook his head and leaned back a little, groaning as he stretched out his leg.</p><p>\u201cUm. Would thee like me to . . . rub it?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>He made a small huffing noise that she interpreted as amusement. \u201cNot just now, aye?\u201d</p><p>They sat together, shoulders barely touching, for a bit. Her mouth was dry, and it took some time to work up enough spit to speak.</p><p>\u201cI thought thee was going to kill me,\u201d she said, trying hard to keep her voice from quivering.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was, too,\u201d Ian said quietly. He groped for her hand in the dark and held it, hard. \u201cSorry, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThee was dreaming,\u201d she ventured. \u201cDoes\u2014does thee want to tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d he said, and sighed. He let go her hand and bent his head, folding his arms atop his knees.</p><p>She kept quiet, not knowing what to say, and prayed.</p><p>\u201cIt was the Abenaki,\u201d he said eventually, his voice muffled. \u201cThe one I killed. In the British camp.\u201d</p><p>The words were simple and bald, and struck her in the pit of the stomach. She knew; he\u2019d told her when he came back wounded. But to hear it again here, in the dark, with her back scraped from the floor and her throat bruised from his hands . . . She felt as though the deed itself had just happened in front of her, the reverberation of it shocking as a scream in her ear.</p><p>She swallowed and, turning to him, put a hand on his shoulder lightly, feeling with her thumb for the fresh, ragged scar where Denzell had cut to remove the arrow.</p><p>\u201cThee strangled the man?\u201d she asked, very quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He breathed deep and sat up slowly. \u201cI choked him, and I cut his throat, just a wee bit, and then I bashed his head in wi\u2019 a tomahawk.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her then and passed a hand lightly over her hair, smoothing it.</p><p>\u201cI didna have to,\u201d he said. \u201cNot right that moment, I mean. He didna attack me\u2014though he\u2019d tried to kill me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and tried to swallow, but her mouth had dried afresh. He sighed and bent so that his forehead rested on hers. She felt the warmth of his nearness, the warmth of his breath, smelling of beer and the juniper berries he chewed to clean his teeth. His eyes were open but so shadowed that she couldn\u2019t see into them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs thee afraid of me, Rachel?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she whispered back, and closed her hand on his wounded shoulder, lightly but hard enough for him to feel the hurt of it. \u201cAnd I am afraid for thee, as well. But there are things I fear much more than death\u2014and to be without thee is what I fear most.\u201d</p><p>RACHEL REMADE the bed by candlelight and left the candle burning for a bit, saying that she wanted to read, to settle her mind. Ian had nodded, kissed her, and curled up like a dog beside her\u2014the bedstead was too short for him. She glanced at the corner where Rollo slept; he was stretched out straight as a knife, head between his paws.</p><p>Ian put a hand on her leg and sank into sleep. She could see him doing it, his face going slack and peaceful, the muscles of his shoulders easing. It was why she\u2019d kept the candle lit, so she might watch him sleep for a little and let the sight of him bring her peace, as well.</p> <p>She\u2019d put on her shift, feeling obscurely exposed, and though it was hot enough to lie above the sheet, she\u2019d pulled it over her legs, too, wanting to be able to feel Ian when she moved in her sleep. She moved a leg toward him now, slowly, and felt the touch of his knee against her calf. His long lashes cast shadows on his cheeks in the candlelight, just above the looping line of his tattoos.</p><p>\u201cThee is my wolf,\u201d she\u2019d said to him. \u201cAnd if thee hunts at night, thee will come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sleep at thy feet,\u201d he\u2019d replied.</p><p>She sighed, but felt better, and opened her Bible, to read a psalm before blowing out the candle, only to discover that she had absently picked up Pamela: Or Virtue Rewarded, from the bedside table. She gave a small snort of amusement and, all sense of distress now driven from her mind, closed the book, put out the candle, and snuggled down beside her sleeping wolf.</p><p>Sometime much later, in the empty hours before dawn, she opened her eyes. Not asleep, but certainly not awake, she had a sense of perfect consciousness without thought. And a distinct and vivid sense that she was not alone.</p> <p>Ian was beside her; his breath touched her face, but she felt quite apart from him. It was only when it happened again that she realized what had wakened her: a tiny, sharp pain in her belly. Like the pain that sometimes came when she started her monthly, but smaller, less an ache than a . . . stab. A stab of awareness.</p><p>She blinked and put her hands over her stomach. The rafters were just barely visible overhead, shadowed with the distant coming of the light.</p><p>The pain had stopped, but the sense of . . . company? Of presence, rather. That hadn\u2019t gone away. It seemed very odd and completely natural\u2014and of course it was, she thought. Natural as the beating of her own heart and the breath in her lungs.</p><p>She had a faint impulse to wake Ian, but that passed almost at once. She wanted to keep this for now, be alone with the knowledge\u2014but not alone, she corrected herself, and sank peacefully back to sleep, hands still crossed over her lively womb.</p><p>IAN USUALLY WOKE before her, but she always felt him stir and would rise to the edge of wakefulness to enjoy his sleepy warm smell, the small male sounds he made, and the feel of his legs brushing hers as he swung them out of bed and sat up. He\u2019d sit there on the edge for a moment, rubbing his hands through his hair and getting his bearings on the day, and if she cracked her eyes open, she could see his long, lovely back just in front of her, columnar muscles tanned by the sun and sloping gently down to his neat, tight bu**ocks, white as milk in contrast.</p><p>Sometimes he would emit a small, popping fart and look guiltily over his shoulder. She\u2019d shut her eyes instantly and pretend to be still asleep, thinking that she must be completely besotted to find this adorable\u2014but she did.</p> <p>This morning, though, he sat up, rubbed a hand through his hair, and stiffened. She opened her eyes all the way, instantly alarmed by something in his posture.</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d she whispered, but he didn\u2019t attend.</p><p>\u201cA Dhia,\u201d he said, very softly. \u201cAh, no, a charaid . . .\u201d</p><p>She knew at once. Should have known from the instant she woke. Because Rollo woke when Ian did, stretching and yawning with a groaning creak of jaw muscles and a lazy thump of tail against the wall, before coming to poke a cold nose into his master\u2019s hand.</p><p>This morning there was only stillness, and the curled form of what used to be Rollo.</p><p>Ian rose and went to him swiftly, knelt on the floor beside the body of his dog, and laid a gentle hand on the big furry head. He didn\u2019t say anything, or weep, but she heard the sound he made when he breathed, as of something tearing in his chest.</p><p>She got out of bed and came to Ian, kneeling beside him, arm about his waist, and she was weeping, quite without meaning to.</p><p>\u201cMo ch\u00f9,\u201d Ian said, running his hand lightly over the soft, thick fur. \u201cMo chuilean.\u201d There was a catch in his voice when he said, \u201cBeannachd leat, a charaid.\u201d Goodbye, old friend.</p> <p>Then he sat back on his heels, took a deep breath, and clasped Rachel\u2019s hand very hard. \u201cHe waited, I think. Until he kent ye were here for me.\u201d He swallowed audibly, and his voice was steady when he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to bury him. I ken a place, but it\u2019s some way. I\u2019ll be back by midafternoon, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with thee.\u201d Her nose was running. She reached for the towel by the ewer and blew her nose on one end.</p><p>\u201cYe needn\u2019t, mo ghr\u00e0idh,\u201d he said gently, and passed a hand over her hair to smooth it. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way.\u201d</p><p>She drew breath and stood up.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d best get started.\u201d She touched her husband on the shoulder, as lightly as he\u2019d touched Rollo\u2019s fur. \u201cI married him, as well as thee.\u201d</p><p>A-HUNTING WE WILL GO</p><p>September 15, 1778</p><p>First Watchung Mountain</p><p>THERE WAS A NEAT mound of droppings by the path, dark and glistening as coffee beans and much the same size. William was leading his mare, owing to her stoutness and the steep nature of the trail, so took the opportunity to stop for a moment and let her breathe. This she did, with an explosive snort and a shake of her mane.</p><p>He squatted and scooped up a few of the pellets, sniffing. Very fresh, though not warm, and with the faint oaky tang that meant the deer had been browsing on green acorns. Glancing to his left, he saw the broken brush that marked the animal\u2019s passage, and his hand twitched, wanting to wrap itself round his rifle. He could leave the mare tethered . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat about it, owd lass?\u201d he asked the mare, in the accents of the Lake District, where he\u2019d grown up. \u201cWould \u2019ee carry a carcass, if I shot \u2019un?\u201d</p><p>The mare was maybe fourteen, old enough to be steady; in fact, it would be hard to imagine a steadier mount. She was more like riding a sofa than a horse, with her broad back and sides curved like a hogshead of beer. But he hadn\u2019t thought to ask, when he bought her, whether she was used to hunting. Steadiness of gait and a mild temper didn\u2019t necessarily mean she\u2019d be fine if he heaved a deer across her back, leaking blood. Still . . .</p><p>He lifted his face to the breeze. Perfect. It was straight across the mountainside, toward him, and he imagined he could actually smell the\u2014</p><p>Something moved in the wood, snapping twigs, and he heard the unmistakable rustling: the sound of a large herbivorous creature, wrenching mouthfuls of leaves off a tree.</p><p>Before he could think twice, he\u2019d got to his feet, slipped the rifle from its sheath as silently as he could, and shucked his boots. Soft-footed as a ferret, he slid into the brush . . .</p><p>And, five minutes later, grasped the thrashing stubby antlers of a yearling buck with one hand as he slit the deer\u2019s throat with the other, the sound of his shot still echoing off the rocky escarpment above him.</p><p>It had happened so fast, it scarcely seemed real, despite the warm-cold feel of the blood soaking into his stockings and the thick smell of it. There was a tick hanging just under the deer\u2019s glazing eye, round as a tiny muscat grape. Would it let go at once, he wondered? Or would there be enough blood left for it to go on feeding for some time?</p><p>The deer shuddered violently, shoving its antlers hard into his chest, bunched its legs convulsively as though about to make one final leap, and died.</p><p>He held it for a few moments, the shredded velvet still on the antlers like rough suede under his sweating palm, the weight of the coarse-haired shoulders growing heavy on his knee.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, and let go. He remembered that it had been Mac the groom who\u2019d told him that you always thanked a creature that gave you its life\u2014and that it had been James Fraser, some years later, who had killed a huge wapiti in front of him and spoken what he said was a \u201cgralloch prayer\u201d in Gaelic before butchering the beast. But with the deer\u2019s blood on his skin and the breeze moving in the wood around him, for once he didn\u2019t push those memories away.</p><p>He went to check the mare, who was fortunately close to where he\u2019d left her, having merely moved a few yards in order to crop weeds, and who looked at him with tranquil eyes, yellow wildflowers dangling from the corners of her mouth, as though gunshots and the smell of blood were commonplace in her life. Perhaps they were, he thought, and slapped her shoulder companionably.</p><p>Here\u2019s for you, Ben, he thought a few minutes later, slitting the belly skin. His cousin, nearly six years older than himself, had taken him hunting now and then in the forest near Earlingden, with Viscount Almerding, a friend of Ben\u2019s whose preserve it was.</p><p>He\u2019d tried not to think of his cousin too much as he\u2019d made his preparations. The greater part of him truly believed that Ben was dead. Gaol fever, according to what Richardson had told his uncle. Not an unusual thing to happen to a prisoner, by any means. And while he was convinced\u2014reluctantly, for it made him burn with shame to have been such a flat as to have been gulled by the man\u2014that Richardson was probably a villain, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that every word from the man\u2019s mouth was a lie. Granted, he\u2019d found no other trace of Ben in several weeks of searching.</p><p>But there was the small part of his heart that wouldn\u2019t give up. And a larger part that would do anything he could to ease the grief of his uncle and father, whatever the truth might prove to be.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you bloody come down to it, what the hell else is there for me to do?\u201d he muttered, reaching into the steaming heat of the body and groping for the heart.</p><p>At least he\u2019d be welcome when he walked into Middlebrook Encampment, as they called it. A man bearing fresh meat was always welcome.</p><p>A half hour later, he\u2019d gutted the carcass and wrapped his canvas bed sack around it to keep off flies. The horse flared her nostrils and snorted in disgust at the smell, but made no great objection when he wrestled it onto her back.</p><p>It was late in the afternoon, but this late in the summer it would stay light for some time. Better, he thought, to make his first approach at suppertime. Chances were good that he\u2019d be invited to sit down with someone, and conversation was much easier over food and drink.</p><p>He\u2019d gone up to the rocky summit in order to survey the terrain and had to admit that Washington and his engineers had chosen well. From the top of First Watchung Mountain, which he was standing on, the plains before New Brunswick lay clear below. The Continentals could easily keep a beady eye on the British army from their aerie and swoop down to interfere with their movements\u2014and had.</p><p>The armies were gone now, though: both of them. The British to New York, Washington\u2019s troops to . . . well, wherever they might be at the moment. They weren\u2019t here, and that was all to the good. But there were people, still, who lived near the encampment.</p><p>Ben had been\u2014was, he corrected himself fiercely\u2014an officer; an infantry captain, like himself. And captured officers were often billeted upon local householders, under parole. That was the place to begin his inquiries.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then, lass,\u201d he said to the mare, untying the reins from the sapling he\u2019d wrapped them round. \u201cLet\u2019s go and make ourselves welcome.\u201d</p><p>INTO THE BRIAR PATCH</p><p>September 16, 1778</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>WE\u2019D JUST FINISHED supper and I was wiping Henri-Christian\u2019s face with the hem of my apron, when a knock came at the alley door. Jenny, sitting next to me with F\u00e9licit\u00e9 on her lap, gave me a quick glance, brows raised. Was this cause for alarm?</p><p>I hadn\u2019t time to shrug or shake my head; all conversation had ceased on the instant, the children\u2019s chatter quelled as though someone had dropped a candle snuffer over them. It was first dark and the door was bolted. Fergus and Jamie exchanged looks and, without a word, both of them rose.</p><p>Jamie stood to one side, hand on his dirk\u2014I hadn\u2019t realized until this moment that he wore it all the time now, even at table. I heard the shuffle of feet in the alley. There was more than one man out there, and the hair stirred on my nape. Jamie stood relaxed but watchful, weight on his back foot, ready as Fergus lifted the bar.</p><p>\u201cBonsoir,\u201d Fergus said calmly, with an interrogative lift at the end of the phrase. A face hovered pale in the dark, not close enough to recognize.</p><p>\u201cBonsoir, Monsieur Fraser.\u201d I blinked in surprise; I knew the voice, but had never heard Benedict Arnold speak French. But of course he could, I thought, recovering. He\u2019d led more than one campaign in Quebec. It was a soldier\u2019s French he spoke: rough but serviceable.</p><p>\u201cMadame Fraser est ici, monsieur?\u201d he said. \u201cVotre m\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>Fergus glanced reflexively over his shoulder at Jenny, astonished. I coughed and eased Henri-Christian off my lap, smoothing his rumpled hair.</p><p>\u201cI rather think the governor means me,\u201d I said. The governor turned aside and murmured something to his aide, who nodded and retired into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d Arnold said, sounding relieved. Fergus stood aside, and the governor came in, bowing to Marsali and Jenny, nodding to Jamie, before fixing his attention on me. \u201cYes, I do mean you, ma\u2019am. I beg pardon for my untimely intrusion, sir,\u201d he added, turning to Fergus. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure where Mrs. Fraser was residing and was obliged to make inquiries.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I saw Jamie\u2019s mouth tighten briefly at this galling reference to our homelessness, but he bowed courteously.</p><p>\u201cAnd I daresay the matter is urgent, sir, since ye come to make your inquiries in person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, rather.\u201d The governor turned to me. \u201cI come to beg a favor of you, ma\u2019am, on behalf of a friend.\u201d He looked a little better than he had the last time I\u2019d seen him; he\u2019d gained a bit of weight and his color was better, but the lines and smudges of strain and fatigue were still plain in his face. The eyes, though, were as alert as ever.</p><p>\u201cThis would be a sick friend?\u201d I asked, already glancing toward the ladder that led to the loft where we slept\u2014and where the box holding my modest pharmacopeia was kept when I wasn\u2019t holding regular surgery hours.</p> <p>\u201cA matter of injury, ma\u2019am, rather than illness,\u201d Arnold said, and his mouth tightened involuntarily. \u201cSevere injury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Well, then, I\u2019d better\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamie stopped me, a hand on my arm and his eyes on Arnold.</p><p>\u201cA moment, Sassenach,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBefore I let ye go, I want to know the nature of the injury and the name of the injured man. And I also want to ken why the governor comes to ye under cover of night and hides his intent from his own aide.\u201d</p><p>The color rose in Arnold\u2019s cheeks, but he nodded.</p> <p>\u201cFair enough, Mr. Fraser. Do you know a man called Shippen?\u201d</p><p>Jamie looked blank and shook his head, but Fergus chimed in.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said, looking thoughtfully at Arnold. \u201cHe is a wealthy man, and a well-known Loyalist\u2014one of those who chose not to leave the city when the British army withdrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know one of the Shippen girls,\u201d I said, with a vague memory of General Howe\u2019s lavish leaving party in May\u2014God, could that possibly be only three months past? \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met the father, though. Is he the injured party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he is the friend on whose behalf I ask your help, ma\u2019am.\u201d Arnold drew a deep, unhappy breath. \u201cMr. Shippen\u2019s young cousin, a man named Tench Bledsoe, was set upon last night by the Sons of Liberty. They tarred and feathered him, ma\u2019am, and left him on the docks in front of Mr. Shippen\u2019s warehouse. He rolled off the dock into the river and by a mercy didn\u2019t drown, but crept up the bank and lay in the muddy shallows until a slave hunting crabs found him and ran for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d Jamie repeated carefully.</p> <p>Arnold met his eye and nodded. \u201cJust so, Mr. Fraser,\u201d he said bleakly. \u201cThe Shippens live within two streets of Dr. Benjamin Rush, but under the circumstances . . .\u201d</p><p>The circumstances being that Benjamin Rush was a very visible and outspoken Rebel, active in the Sons of Liberty, and would certainly be familiar with everyone in Philadelphia who held similar sentiments\u2014very likely including the men who had attacked Tench Bledsoe.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, gesturing to my stool. I didn\u2019t, and he gave me a brief, dark look.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mean to stop ye going,\u201d he said, a distinct edge in his voice. \u201cI ken well enough that ye will. I just mean to make sure ye come back. Aye?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr . . . yes,\u201d I said, and coughed. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2014go and get my things together, then.\u201d I sidled through the clump of staring children to the ladder and went up as quickly as I could, hearing Jamie\u2019s stern inquisition of Governor Arnold begin behind me.</p><p>Severe burns\u2014and the attendant difficulties of hardened tar\u2014and very likely fever and infection already started, after a night lying in river mud. This was going to be messy\u2014and possibly worse. There was no telling how badly the young man had been burned; if we were lucky, it might be only splashes of tar that had reached his skin. If we weren\u2019t lucky . . .</p><p>I set my jaw and began packing. Linen bandages, a scalpel and small paring knife for debridement . . . leeches? Perhaps; there would certainly be bruising involved\u2014no one submitted meekly to being tarred and feathered. I tied a hasty bandage around the leech jar to keep the lid from coming off in transit. Definitely a jar of honey . . . I held it up to the flicker of light from below: half full, a clouded gold that caught the light through brown glass like candle glow. Fergus kept a tin of turpentine in the shed for cleaning type; I should borrow that, as well.</p><p>I didn\u2019t worry overmuch about the political delicacies that had made Arnold come to me so surreptitiously. Jamie would take what precautions were possible, I knew. Philadelphia lay in Rebel hands, but it was by no means a safe place\u2014for anyone.</p> <p>Not for the first time\u2014or the last, I was sure\u2014I was glad that at least my own path lay clear before me. The door below opened and closed with a thump; the governor was gone.</p><p>I LOOKED AT the rather grubby sedan chair, inhaled the scent of several dozen previous users, and took a firmer grip on my cane.</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re not walking,\u201d Jamie replied equably.</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t intend to stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d he said, still mildly. \u201cI canna stop ye going\u2014and I wouldna try\u2014but I can, by God, make sure ye dinna fall on your face in the street on your way. Get in, Sassenach. Go slow,\u201d he added to the chairmen, as he opened the door of the sedan and gestured to me. \u201cI\u2019m coming, and I dinna want to gallop so soon after supper.\u201d</p><p>There being no reasonable alternative, I gathered the remnants of my dignity and got in. And with my basket of supplies settled at my feet and the window slid open as far as it would go\u2014the memories of my last claustrophobic ride in a sedan chair were as vivid as the smell of this one\u2014we set off at a stately jog through the quiet nighttime streets of Philadelphia.</p><p>The curfew had been eased of late, owing to protests from tavern owners\u2014and, likely, their patrons\u2014but the overall sense of the city was still edgy, and there were no respectable women on the street, no gangs of rowdy apprentices, or any of the slaves who worked for their masters but lived on their own. I saw one whore, standing by the mouth of an alley; she whistled at Jamie and called out an invitation, but halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cHer pimp\u2019ll be a-hiding . . . in the alley with a cosh . . . lay you three to one,\u201d the chairman behind me remarked, his remarks punctuated by his breathing. \u201cAin\u2019t as safe . . . as when the army was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink not?\u201d His partner grunted, then found breath to reply. \u201cArmy was here . . . when that officer got his . . . throat cut in a whorehouse. Reckon\u2019s why that . . . drab\u2019s out here in her shift.\u201d He gulped air and went on. \u201cHow you mean . . . to settle the bet, then? Go with her yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay be as this gentleman\u2019d do us the service,\u201d the other said with a brief, gasping laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt may be that he won\u2019t,\u201d I said, sticking my head out the window. \u201cBut I\u2019ll go and look, if you like.\u201d</p><p>Jamie and the forward man laughed, the other grunted, and we jolted gently round the corner and down the street to where the Shippen house stood, gracious in its own grounds, on a small rise near the edge of town. There was a lighted lantern by the gate, another by the door. I wondered whether that meant we were expected; I hadn\u2019t thought to ask Governor Arnold if he had sent word ahead of us. If he hadn\u2019t, the next few minutes might be interesting.</p><p>\u201cAny notion how long we might be, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie inquired, taking out his purse to pay the chairmen.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s already dead, it won\u2019t take long,\u201d I replied, shaking my skirts into order. \u201cIf he\u2019s not, it could well take all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Wait a bit, then,\u201d Jamie told the chairmen, who were staring at me, mouths agape. \u201cIf I havena come out in ten minutes, ye\u2019re free to go.\u201d</p><p>Such was his force of personality, they didn\u2019t observe that they were quite free to go at once if they wanted, and merely nodded meekly as he took my arm and escorted me up the steps.</p><p>We were expected; the door swung wide as Jamie\u2019s boots scuffed the scrubbed stone of the stoop, and a young woman peered out, alarm and interest showing in equal measure on her face. Evidently Mr. Bledsoe wasn\u2019t dead, then.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser?\u201d She blinked slightly, looking at me sideways. \u201cEr . . . I mean . . . it is Mrs. Fraser? Governor Arnold said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is Mrs. Fraser,\u201d Jamie said, a slight edge in his voice. \u201cAnd I assure ye, young woman, I\u2019m in a position to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be Mr. Fraser,\u201d I informed the young lady, who was looking up at him, clearly bewildered. \u201cI was probably Lady John Grey last time you saw me,\u201d I added, trying for a nonchalant matter-of-factness. \u201cBut, yes, I\u2019m Claire Fraser. Er . . . still. I mean\u2014again. I understand that your cousin . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes! Please\u2014come this way.\u201d She stepped back, gesturing toward the rear of the house, and I saw that she was accompanied by a servant, a middle-aged black man, who bowed when I met his gaze and then led the way through a long hallway to the back stair and thence upward.</p><p>On the way, our hostess introduced herself belatedly as Margaret Shippen and apologized prettily for the absence of her parents. Her father\u2014she said\u2014was called away on business.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been formally introduced to Peggy Shippen before, but I had seen her and knew a bit about her; she\u2019d been one of the organizing lights of the Mischianza, and while her father had prevented her actually attending the ball, all her friends had talked about her at length\u2014and I\u2019d glimpsed her, lavishly dressed, once or twice at other functions I\u2019d attended with John.</p><p>Called away on business, was it? I caught Jamie\u2019s eye when she\u2019d said that, and he\u2019d raised one shoulder in the briefest of shrugs. More than likely, Edward Shippen wanted to avoid any public linkage with his nephew\u2019s misfortune\u2014and, so far as possible, keep talk about the incident to a minimum. It wasn\u2019t a safe time or place to make a point of Loyalist leanings in the family.</p><p>Miss Shippen led us to a small bedroom on the third floor, where a blackened, man-shaped object lay on the bed. The smell of tar was thick in the air, along with a distinct smell of blood and a sort of constant low moaning noise. This must be Tench Bledsoe\u2014and wherever had he got a name like that? I wondered, gingerly approaching him. So far as I knew, a tench was a rather undistinguished-looking sort of carp.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bledsoe?\u201d I said quietly, setting down my basket on a small table. There was a candlestick on the table, and by the light of the single flame, I could make out his face\u2014or half of it. The other half was obscured by tar, as was a good bit of his head and neck. The clean half was that of a somewhat plain young man with a large, beaky nose, his features contorted in agony, but not at all fish-looking.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he gasped, and pressed his lips tight together, as though even the escape of a single word jeopardized the tenuous grip he had on himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mrs. Fraser,\u201d I said, and laid a hand on his shoulder. A fine shudder was running through him like current through a wire. \u201cI\u2019ve come to help.\u201d</p><p>He heard me and nodded jerkily. They\u2019d given him brandy; I could smell it under the aromatic reek of pine tar, and a half-full decanter stood on the table.</p><p>\u201cHave you any laudanum in the house?\u201d I asked, turning to Peggy. It wouldn\u2019t help that much in the long run, but a large dose might get us through the worst of the preliminaries.</p><p>She was quite young\u2014no more than eighteen, I thought\u2014but alert and self-possessed, as well as very pretty. She nodded and disappeared, with a murmured word to the servant. Of course, I thought, seeing her skirts whisk out of sight. She couldn\u2019t send him for it. The laudanum would be with the other household simples, in a closet under lock and key.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie said softly, as though afraid to break the injured man\u2019s concentration on his pain.</p><p>\u201cHelp me undress him.\u201d Whoever had attacked him hadn\u2019t stripped him; that was lucky. And most of the tar probably hadn\u2019t been boiling hot when it was applied; I smelled burnt hair, but not the sickening stench of cooked flesh. Pine tar wasn\u2019t like the asphalt road tar of later centuries; it was a by-product of turpentine distillation, and might be soft enough to be daubed without needing to be boiled first.</p><p>What wasn\u2019t fortunate was his leg, as I saw at once when Jamie peeled back the sheet covering him. That was where the smell of blood had come from; it spread in a soggy smear on the bedclothes, black in the candlelight, but copper and scarlet to the nose.</p><p>\u201cJesus H. Roosevelt Christ,\u201d I said under my breath. Tench\u2019s face was dead white and streaked with sweat and tears, his eyes closed, but he grimaced, hearing that.</p><p>Jamie set his jaw and drew his case knife, which was sharp enough to shave the hairs on a man\u2019s arm. Sharp enough to slice through shredded stocking and damp breeches, spreading the stiffened fabric aside to show me the damage.</p><p>\u201cWho did that to ye, man?\u201d he asked Tench, gripping him by the wrist as the injured man reached a tentative hand downward, seeking the extent of the damage.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Tench whispered, and coughed. \u201cI\u2014I jumped off the dock when he set my head afire, and landed on one foot in the mud. It stuck well in, and when I fell over . . .\u201d</p><p>It was a very nasty compound fracture. Both bones of the lower leg had snapped clean through, and the shattered ends were poking through the skin in different directions. I was surprised that he had survived the shock of it, together with the trauma of the attack\u2014to say nothing of a night and part of a day spent lying in the filthy river shallows afterward. The macerated flesh was swollen, raw, red, and ugly, the wounds deeply infected. I breathed in gently, half-expecting the reek of gangrene, but no. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cHe set your head afire?\u201d Jamie was saying incredulously. He leaned forward, touching the darkened mass on the left side of the young man\u2019s head. \u201cWho?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Tench\u2019s hand floated up, touched Jamie\u2019s, but Tench didn\u2019t try to pull it away. It rested on Jamie\u2019s, as though his touch would tell Tench what he needed to know but couldn\u2019t bear to find out for himself.</p><p>\u201cThink he . . . Way he spoke. Maybe England, maybe Ireland. He . . . poured pitch over my head and sprinkled feathers on. Others would have left me then, I think. But all of a sudden, he turned back and seized a torch . . .\u201d He coughed, wincing against the spasm, and ended breathlessly, \u201c . . . like he . . . hated me.\u201d He sounded astonished.</p><p>Jamie was carefully breaking off small chunks of singed hair and matted clumps of mud and tar, revealing the blistered skin underneath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none sae bad, man,\u201d he said, encouraging. \u201cYour ear\u2019s still there, no but a wee bit black and crusty round the edges.\u201d</p> <p>That actually made Tench laugh\u2014no more than a breathy gasp\u2014though this was extinguished abruptly when I touched his leg.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need more light,\u201d I said, turning to the servant. \u201cAnd a lot of bandages.\u201d He nodded, avoiding looking at the man on the bed, and left.</p><p>We worked for some minutes, murmuring occasional encouragement to Tench. At one point, Jamie pulled the chamber pot out from under the bed, excused himself with a brief word, and took it into the hall; I heard him retching. He came back a few moments later, pale and smelling of vomit, and resumed the delicate work of uncovering what might remain of Tench\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cCan ye open this eye, man?\u201d he asked, gently touching the left side. I peered up from my station over his leg, to see that the lid was evidently whole but badly blistered and swollen, the lashes singed off.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tench\u2019s voice had changed, and I moved abruptly up to his head. He sounded almost sleepy, his voice unconcerned. I laid the back of my hand against his cheek; it was cool and clammy. I said something very bad out loud, and his working eye sprang open, staring up at me.</p> <p>\u201cOh, there you are,\u201d I said, much relieved. \u201cI thought you were going into shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he hasna been shocked by what\u2019s already happened to him, I shouldna think anything would do it, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, but bent closer to look. \u201cI think he\u2019s only worn out from the pain, aye? Sometimes ye canna be bothered to put up with it anymore, but ye\u2019re no ready to die, so ye just drift away for a bit.\u201d</p><p>Tench sighed deeply and gave a small, jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cIf you could . . . stop for a little while?\u201d he whispered. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jamie said softly, and, patting his chest, drew the stained sheet up over him. \u201cRest a bit, mo charaid.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t at all sure that he wasn\u2019t trying to die, but there was a limit to what I could do to prevent him, if that were the case. And there was a much more serious limit to what I could do if he didn\u2019t die.</p> <p>On the other hand, I had a vivid understanding of exactly what Jamie meant by \u201cdrifting away\u201d and of the symptoms of severe blood loss. There was no telling how much blood Tench had lost, lying in the river. The fracture had by some miracle not ruptured either of the main tibial arteries\u2014if it had, he\u2019d have been dead long since\u2014but it had certainly made hash of a number of smaller vessels.</p><p>On the other hand . . . the Delaware was a fairly cold river, even in summer. The chill of the water might well have constricted the smaller blood vessels, as well as slowed his metabolism and even perhaps minimized the damage due to burns, both by extinguishing the fire and by cooling the burnt skin. I\u2019d whipped a pro forma tourniquet bandage round the leg above the knee but hadn\u2019t tightened it; blood loss at the moment was no more than a slow oozing.</p><p>And, in fact, the burns were minimal. His shirt had been torn open, but the tar on his chest, hands, and clothes hadn\u2019t been hot enough to blister his skin\u2014and while there was certainly visible damage to one side of his face and head, I didn\u2019t think more than a few square inches of scalp had third-degree burns; the rest was redness and blistering. Painful, of course, but not life-threatening. Whoever had attacked him had likely not meant to kill him\u2014but they stood a good chance of doing so, anyway.</p><p>\u201cPitch-capping, they call it,\u201d Jamie said, low-voiced. We had moved away to the window, but he nodded back toward the bed. \u201cI havena seen it before, but I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d He shook his head, lips tight, then picked up the ewer and offered it to me. \u201cD\u2019ye want water, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014oh, wait. Yes, I do, thank you.\u201d The window was firmly closed, in accordance with the custom of the times, and the small room was sweltering. I took the pitcher and nodded to the window. \u201cCan you get that open, do you think?\u201d</p><p>He turned to wrestle with the window; it was stuck fast in its frame, the wood swollen with humidity and disuse.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the leg?\u201d he said, back turned to me. \u201cYe\u2019ll have to take it off, no?\u201d</p><p>I lowered the pitcher\u2014the water was flat and tasted of earth\u2014and sighed.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. I\u2019d been fighting that conclusion almost from the moment I\u2019d seen Tench\u2019s leg, but hearing Jamie\u2019s matter-of-factness made it easier to accept.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I could save it in a modern hospital, with blood transfusions and anesthetic\u2014and, God, I wish I had ether right now!\u201d I bit my lip, looking at the bed, and watching closely to see whether Tench\u2019s chest was still rising and falling. A tiny, treacherous part of me rather hoped it wasn\u2019t\u2014but it was.</p><p>Feet on the stairs, and both Peggy and the manservant were with us again, armed respectively with a stable lantern and an enormous candelabra, Peggy with a square glass bottle clasped to her chest. Both turned anxious faces toward the bed, then toward me, standing apart by the window. Was he dead?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, shaking my head, and saw the same half-regretful relief flit across their faces that I had just experienced. I wasn\u2019t without sympathy; no matter what their feelings for the injured man, having him on the premises was a danger to the Shippens.</p><p>I came forward and explained in a low voice what had to be done, watching Peggy go the color of a bad oyster in the flickering light. She swayed a little, but swallowed hard and drew herself up.</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could take him to . . . Well, no, I suppose not.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cAll right. What can we do to help?\u201d</p><p>The manservant coughed behind her in a meaningful manner, and she stiffened.</p><p>\u201cMy father would say the same,\u201d she informed him coldly.</p><p>\u201cJust so, miss,\u201d he said, with a deference that wasn\u2019t all that deferential. \u201cBut he might like to have the chance to say it himself, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She shot him an angry glance, but before she could say anything, there was a grinding screech of wood as the window gave way to Jamie\u2019s will, and everyone\u2019s eye jerked to him.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mean to interrupt,\u201d he said mildly, turning round. \u201cBut I do believe the governor has come to call.\u201d</p><p>JAMIE PUSHED PAST Miss Shippen and her servant before either could react. He ran lightly down the back stair and came through the house, startling a kitchen maid. Clearly the governor wasn\u2019t going to be admitted by the kitchen door.</p><p>He reached the front door just as a firm knock sounded, and pulled it open.</p><p>\u201cMiss Margaret!\u201d Arnold pushed past Jamie as though he wasn\u2019t there\u2014no small feat\u2014and seized Peggy Shippen\u2019s hands in his. \u201cI thought I must come\u2014your cousin? How does he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is alive.\u201d Peggy swallowed, her face the color of the beeswax candle she was holding. \u201cMrs. Fraser is\u2014she says\u2014\u201d She swallowed again, and Jamie swallowed with her, out of sympathy, knowing all too well what she was thinking of. Tench Bledsoe\u2019s shattered leg bones, red and slimy as an ineptly butchered pig\u2019s. The back of his throat was still bitter with the taste of vomit.</p><p>\u201cI thank you so much for sending Mrs. Fraser to us, sir\u2014I couldn\u2019t think what on earth we were to do. My father\u2019s in Maryland and my mother with her sister in New Jersey. My brothers . . .\u201d She trailed off, looking distraught.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, my dear\u2014may I call you so? It is my most fervent concern, to help you\u2014your family, to . . . protect you.\u201d He hadn\u2019t let go her hands, Jamie noted, and she wasn\u2019t pulling them away.</p><p>Jamie glanced covertly from Arnold to Peggy Shippen, then turned away a little, drawing back. It wasn\u2019t hard for them to ignore him; they were focused on each other.</p><p>That made matters plain\u2014or at least plainer. Arnold wanted the girl, and wanted her so nakedly that Jamie was slightly ashamed for the man. You couldn\u2019t help lust, but surely a man should have enough control to hide it. And no just for the sake of decency, either, he thought, seeing a certain look of cautious calculation come into Peggy\u2019s face. It was, he thought, the look of a fisherman who has just seen a fat trout swim right under the lure.</p><p>He cleared his throat in a pointed manner, and both of them jerked as though he\u2019d run a drawing pin into them.</p><p>\u201cMy wife says it will be necessary to amputate the injured leg,\u201d he said. \u201cQuickly. She requires a few things\u2014instruments and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need both the large saw and the small lunar one, the set of tenaculae\u2014the long things that look like fishing hooks\u2014and quite a lot of sutures . . .\u201d</p><p>He was trying to keep the list in his head, though it made him ill to envision most of the items, thinking of the use they were about to be put to. Beneath the sense of revulsion and pity, though, was wariness\u2014the same wariness he saw at the back of Benedict Arnold\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoes she,\u201d Arnold said, not quite a question. His eyes flicked back to Peggy Shippen, who bit her lip in a becoming manner.</p><p>\u201cCan ye maybe send your coachman to the printshop?\u201d Jamie asked. \u201cI can go with him and fetch back what\u2019s needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arnold said slowly, but in an abstracted way, the way he did when he was thinking rapidly. \u201cOr . . . no. Let us rather remove Mr. Bledsoe\u2014and Mrs. Fraser, to be sure\u2014to the printshop in my coach. Mrs. Fraser will have access there to everything she requires, and the assistance and support of her family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jamie exclaimed, but Peggy Shippen was already hanging on to Arnold\u2019s arm, her face transformed by relief. Jamie seized Arnold by the arm to compel his attention, and the governor\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s intent had been to demand rhetorically whether Arnold was mad, but the split second\u2019s delay was enough to change this to a more politic \u201cThere\u2019s nay room at the shop for such a venture, sir. We live atop one another, and folk come in and out all day. This willna be a simple matter; the man will need to be nursed for some time.\u201d</p><p>Peggy Shippen made a small moan of anxiety, and it dawned upon Jamie that Tench Bledsoe was a hot potato, as much\u2014or more\u2014for Arnold as for the Shippens. The last thing Arnold could want, as military governor of the city, was public scandal and disorder, the remaining Loyalists in Philadelphia threatened and frightened, the Sons of Liberty seen as secret vigilantes, a law unto themselves.</p><p>Arnold must very much want the incident kept quiet. At the same time, he wanted to be the noble knight, riding to the aid of the very young and enchanting Miss Shippen by caring for her cousin while removing the potential danger he posed to her household.</p><p>By bringing it to mine, Jamie thought, his wariness beginning to turn to anger.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d he said formally. \u201cThere is no possibility of preventing the matter from being known, should ye bring yon man into my son\u2019s shop. And clearly ye ken the danger of that.\u201d</p><p>The truth of this was evident, and Arnold paused, wrinkling his brow. But Jamie had fought with the man and kent him well enough; Jamie saw that, having made up his mind to relieve Miss Peggy\u2019s concern, Arnold meant to do it, come hell or high water.</p><p>Evidently Claire was right in what she\u2019d told him about testosterone, and he\u2019d already known that Arnold was a ram, in terms both of balls and hardheadedness.</p><p>\u201cAh, I have it!\u201d Arnold exclaimed triumphantly, and Jamie saw\u2014with grudging admiration\u2014the general emergent. This admiration disappeared with Arnold\u2019s next sentence.</p><p>\u201cLord John Grey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could transport Mr. Bledsoe to his lordship\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie said by reflex.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arnold said, but in self-congratulation rather than contradiction; he was paying no attention. \u201cYes, the ideal solution! His lordship and his brother are much in my debt,\u201d he explained to Peggy, with a feigned modesty that made Jamie want to hit him. \u201cAnd as his lordship and Mrs. Fraser\u2014\u201d At this point, he caught sight of Jamie\u2019s face and arrested his speech just in time to prevent exactly such a happenstance. He coughed. \u201cThe ideal solution,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWill you go and tell Mrs. Fraser what we intend, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI intend nothing of the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell is going on down here?\u201d Claire\u2019s voice came from the stairway behind him, and he swung round to see her leaning on the banister, a-flicker like a ghost in the light from the tin sconce above her. There was blood smudging her apron, blotches black on the pale cloth.</p><p>\u201cNothing, a nighean,\u201d he said, fixing Arnold with a firm eye. \u201cOnly discussing where Mr. Bledsoe should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care where he should be,\u201d she snapped, coming down into the foyer, skirts rustling with agitation. \u201cWhere he will be is dead, if I can\u2019t take care of his leg quickly.\u201d Then she noticed the glaring going on betwixt him and Arnold and moved up beside Jamie, looking hard at the governor herself.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Arnold,\u201d she said, \u201cif you have the slightest concern for Miss Shippen\u2019s cousin\u2019s life, you\u2019ll oblige me by taking my husband promptly to fetch the instruments I need. Hurry!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Arnold blinked, and Jamie would have smiled had he not been worrit for the lass\u2014she was fierce, but she looked pale, and her fists were clenched in the cloth of her apron. It might have been to keep her from slapping the governor, but he rather thought it was to hide the fact that her hands were trembling\u2014and he realized with a shock that she was afraid.</p><p>Not afraid of the circumstance or any future danger\u2014afraid that she couldn\u2019t do what she knew she must.</p><p>His heart smote him at the thought. He took Arnold firmly by the upper arm, compelling him toward the stair.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said abruptly to Claire. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the man to Lord John\u2019s house, and whilst ye fettle him for the job there, I\u2019ll fetch what ye need from the shop. The general will help me to move him.\u201d</p> <p>Arnold\u2019s stiff resistance ceased abruptly as he took Jamie\u2019s meaning.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d A long moan from above interrupted him, and Claire\u2019s face tightened.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t time,\u201d she said, quite calmly. \u201cMiss Shippen\u2014Peggy. Fetch me the largest knife you have in the kitchen, and do it now. Have your servants bring more hot water and cloth for bandages. A strong sewing needle and black thread.\u201d Her eyes sought Jamie\u2019s, and he let go of the governor at once and went to her.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re all right, lass?\u201d he said quietly, taking her elbow.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she said, and squeezed his hand briefly. \u201cThis is very bad, though. I don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll need you to help hold him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cDinna be worrit. Only do what ye need to do. I promise I willna vomit on him while ye\u2019re taking off his leg.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t actually meant that to be funny, and was surprised\u2014but pleased\u2014when she laughed. Not much of a laugh, but the tension in her arm relaxed, and her fingers were steady on his.</p><p>He could tell the minute they entered the room. He didn\u2019t know what it was had changed, but clearly Claire had heard the beating of the wings of Death from the floor below; he could sense them now. Bledsoe was still conscious, but barely so; a slice of white showed as one eyelid lifted at their entrance.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here, man,\u201d Jamie whispered, sinking to his knees and grasping Bledsoe\u2019s hand. It was cold to the touch and clammy with sweat. \u201cDinna fash, we\u2019re here. It\u2019ll be done soon.\u201d</p><p>There was a strong smell of laudanum in the air, together with the stink of tar and blood and burnt hair. Claire was on the other side of the bed, holding Bledsoe\u2019s wrist, her eyes flickering from his slack face to the mangled leg.</p><p>\u201cSepsis,\u201d she said, quietly but in a normal voice. \u201cDo you see the red line there?\u201d She gestured at the wounded leg, and Jamie saw it clearly: a streak of an ugly dark-red color that he thought hadn\u2019t been there before\u2014or perhaps it had, and he\u2019d not noticed. The sight of it made the fine hairs ripple on his shoulders, and he shifted uneasily.</p> <p>\u201cBlood poisoning,\u201d Claire said. \u201cBacteria\u2014germs\u2014in the blood. It moves very fast, and if it should get into the body proper . . . there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d</p><p>He looked up sharp, hearing a tiny tremor in her voice.</p><p>\u201cBut before that, ye might? There\u2019s a chance?\u201d He tried to sound encouraging, though the thought of the alternative made the gooseflesh that much worse.</p><p>\u201cYes. But it isn\u2019t a good one.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cThe shock of the amputation may well kill him on the spot. And if it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s still a great chance of infection.\u201d</p><p>He stood up then and came round the bed to her, taking her gently but solidly by the shoulders. Her bones were close to the surface, and he thought her feelings were, too.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s got a chance, we must give it to him, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, and he felt the shiver go all through her, though the air was hot and close. \u201cGod help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Jamie whispered, folding his arms briefly round her. \u201cSo will I.\u201d</p> <p>I WAS STANDING in the wrong place. The fact that I understood what was happening to me didn\u2019t help at all.</p><p>A trained surgeon is also a potential killer, and an important bit of the training lies in accepting the fact. Your intent is entirely benign\u2014or at least you hope so\u2014but you are laying violent hands on someone, and you must be ruthless in order to do it effectively. And sometimes the person under your hands will die, and knowing that . . . you do it anyway.</p><p>I had had them bring more candles, though the air in the room was already suffocating. The miasma of humidity and slowly evaporating sweat made the light of the candelabra fill the chamber with a gentle, romantic glow; just the thing for a dinner party filled with wine, flirtations, and dancing.</p><p>The wine could wait, and any surgeon dances with death routinely. The problem was that I\u2019d forgotten the steps and was flirting with panic.</p><p>I bent to check Tench\u2019s heart rate and respiration. He was breathing shallowly but fast. Lack of oxygen, severe blood loss . . . and I felt my own chest tighten, heaving for air, and stood up, giddy, heart hammering.</p><p>\u201cSassenach.\u201d I turned, hand on the bedpost, to see Jamie watching me, eyebrows drawn together. \u201cAre ye all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, but my voice sounded queer even to my own ears. I shook my head hard, trying to clear it. Jamie came close to me and put his hand on mine, where it rested on the bedpost. It was big and steady, and it helped.</p><p>\u201cYe willna help him, lass, if ye faint in the midst of it,\u201d he said, low-voiced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to faint,\u201d I said, made a bit testy by anxiety. \u201cI just\u2014I\u2014I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>His hand fell away, and after a long, searching look into my face, he nodded soberly and stepped back.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to faint. Or at least I hoped not. But I was trapped there in that close, hot room, smelling blood and tar and the scent of myrrh in the laudanum, feeling Tench\u2019s agony. And I could not do that. I couldn\u2019t, I mustn\u2019t.</p><p>Peggy hurried in, a maidservant behind her, several large knives clutched to her bosom.</p><p>\u201cWill one of these do?\u201d She laid them in a clinking heap at the foot of the bed, then stood back, gazing anxiously at her cousin\u2019s pale, slack face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure one will.\u201d I stirred the heap gingerly, extracting a couple of possibilities: a carving knife that looked sharp, and a big, heavy knife of the sort used for chopping vegetables. And, with a vivid recollection of what it felt like to sever tendons, I picked up a paring knife with a freshly sharpened, silvered edge.</p><p>\u201cDo you butcher your own meat? If you have something like a bone saw . . .\u201d</p><p>The servant went as pale as a black man reasonably can, and went out, presumably to acquire one.</p><p>\u201cBoiling water?\u201d I asked, brows raised.</p><p>\u201cChrissy is bringing it,\u201d Peggy assured me. She licked her lips, uneasy. \u201cDo you\u2014mmm.\u201d She broke off, narrowly avoiding saying what she so plainly thought: \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>I did. That was the trouble. I knew much too much about what I was doing\u2014from both sides.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d I assured her, with a decent appearance of calm and confidence. \u201cI see we have needles and thread. Would you take the biggest needle\u2014a carpet needle, perhaps\u2014and thread it for me, please? And then a couple of smaller ones, just in case.\u201d Just in case I had time and opportunity to actually capture and ligate blood vessels. It was much more likely that the only choice I would have was cautery\u2014a brutal searing of the fresh stump to stanch the bleeding, for Tench didn\u2019t have enough blood left to be able to spare any of it.</p><p>I needed to be alone in my head, in a calm, clear place. The place from which I could see everything, sense the body under my hand in all its particularities\u2014but not be that body.</p><p>I was about to disjoint Tench Bledsoe\u2019s leg like a chicken\u2019s. Throw away his bones and flesh. Sear the stump. And I felt his fear in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>Benedict Arnold had come in with an armload of firewood and a silver table knife in one hand\u2014my cautery iron, if there wasn\u2019t time to stitch. He set them down on the hearth, and the butler began to poke up the fire.</p><p>I closed my eyes for an instant, trying not to breathe through my nose, shutting out the candle glow. Denny Hunter had operated on me by candlelight; I remembered watching through a haze of eyelashes, unable to open my eyes more than a crack, as each of the six big candles was lit, the flames rising up pure and hot\u2014and smelling the small iron heating in the brazier beside them.</p><p>A hand touched my waist, and, gulping air, I leaned blindly into Jamie.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, a nighean?\u201d he whispered to me.</p><p>\u201cLaudanum,\u201d I said, almost at random. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t lose consciousness altogether. It makes the pain go away\u2014not stop, just seem not connected to you\u2014but it\u2019s there. And you . . . you know what\u2019s happening to you.\u201d I swallowed, forcing down bile.</p><p>I felt it. The hard probe jabbing its way into my side, startling. The remarkable sense of cold intrusion, mingled with incongruous faint warm echoes of internal movement, the forceful jabs of a child in the womb.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s happening,\u201d I repeated, opening my eyes. I found his, looking down at me with gentleness.</p><p>\u201cI ken that, aye?\u201d he whispered, and cupped my cheek with his four-fingered hand. \u201cCome and tell me what ye need me to do, mo ghr\u00e0idh.\u201d</p><p>THE MOMENTARY PANIC was subsiding; I forced it aside, knowing that even to think about it was to slide headfirst back into it. I laid a hand on Tench\u2019s injured leg, willing myself to feel it, find the truth of it.</p><p>The truth was all too obvious. The lower leg was a complete wreck, mechanically, and so compromised by septicemia that there was no chance of saving it. I was searching desperately for a way to save the knee; having a knee made a tremendous difference in the ability to walk, to manage. But I couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>He was far gone from injury, blood loss, and shock; he was a stubborn man, but I could feel his life flickering in his flesh, dying away in the midst of infection, disruption, and pain. I could not ask his body to withstand the longer, painstaking surgery that would be necessary to amputate below the knee\u2014even if I felt sure that such an amputation would be sufficient to forestall the advancing septicemia, and I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take his leg off above the knee,\u201d I said to Jamie. I thought I spoke calmly, but my voice sounded odd. \u201cI need you to hold the leg for me and move it as I tell you. Governor\u201d\u2014I turned to Arnold, who stood with a reassuring arm about Peggy\u2019s Shippen\u2019s waist\u2014\u201ccome and hold him down.\u201d Laudanum alone wasn\u2019t going to be enough.</p><p>To his credit, Arnold came instantly and laid a hand against Tench\u2019s slack cheek for a moment in reassurance before taking firm hold of his shoulders. His own face was calm, and I remembered the stories I\u2019d heard of his campaigns into Canada: frostbite, injury, starvation . . . No, not a squeamish man, and I felt a small sense of reassurance from the presence of my two helpers.</p><p>No, three: Peggy Shippen came up beside me, pale to the lips and with her throat bobbing every few seconds as she swallowed\u2014but jaw set with determination.</p><p>\u201cTell me what to do,\u201d she whispered, and clamped her mouth shut hard as she caught sight of the mangled leg.</p><p>\u201cTry not to vomit, but if you must, turn away from the bed,\u201d I said. \u201cOtherwise\u2014stand there and hand me things as I ask.\u201d</p><p>There was no further time for thought or preparation. I tightened the tourniquet, grasped the sharpest knife, nodded to my helpers, and began.</p><p>A deep incision, fast, around and across the top of the leg, cutting hard down to expose the bone. An army surgeon could lop off a leg in less than two minutes. So could I, but it would be better if I could manage to cut flaps to cover the stump, could seal the major vessels. . . .</p><p>\u201cBig needle,\u201d I said to Peggy, holding out my hand. Lacking a tenaculum to seize the large blood vessels that snapped back into the flesh when severed, I had to probe for them with the point of the needle and drag them out, anchor them into the raw, exposed flesh, and then ligate them as fast as I could, whipping thread round them with one of the smaller needles and tying it off. Better than cautery, if there was time . . .</p><p>Sweat was running into my eyes; I had to dash it away with my bared forearm; my hands were bloody to the wrist.</p><p>\u201cSaw,\u201d I said, and no one moved. Had I spoken aloud? \u201cSaw,\u201d I said, much louder, and Jamie\u2019s head twisted toward the implements on the table. Leaning heavily on Tench\u2019s leg with one hand, he stretched to grab the saw from the table with the other.</p><p>Where was Peggy? On the floor. I saw the bloom of her skirt from the corner of my eye and felt vaguely through the floorboards the steps of a servant coming to haul her out of the way.</p><p>I groped for another suture, blind, and the jar of brandy in which I\u2019d stowed them tipped, spilling on the sheet and adding its sweet stickiness to the atmosphere. I heard Jamie gag, but he didn\u2019t move; his fingers squeezed the thigh hard above the tourniquet. Tench would have bruises there, I thought idly. If he lived long enough for his capillaries to bleed. . . .</p><p>The saw had been made to disjoint hogs. Sturdy, not sharp, and not well kept\u2014half the teeth were bent, and it jumped and skittered in my hand, grating over the bone. I clenched my teeth and pushed, my hand slipping on the handle, greased with blood and sweat.</p><p>Jamie made a deep, desperate noise and moved suddenly, taking the saw from my hand and nudging me aside. He gripped Tench\u2019s knee and bore down on the saw, driving it into the bone by main force. Three, four, five dragging strokes, and the bone, three-quarters sawn through, made a cracking noise that jolted me into action.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, and he did, white-faced and pouring sweat. \u201cLift his leg. Carefully.\u201d He did, and I made the cut from below, long, deep strokes of the knife deepening the incision at an angle to make the flap, joining the cut with the upper incision. The sheet was wet and dark with blood\u2014but not too much. Either the tourniquet was holding, or the man had so little blood left to lose . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSaw again,\u201d I said urgently, discarding the knife. \u201cHold steady! Both pieces.\u201d There was no more than a thin section of bone remaining; the spongy bone of the marrow showed, blood flowering slowly from the cut surface. I put no pressure on the saw; the last thing I wanted was to crack the bone in some awkward way. It wasn\u2019t working, though, and I looked back toward the line of tools, desperate to find something else.</p><p>\u201cRasp,\u201d Jamie said, his voice rough with strain. He nodded toward the table. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>I seized the rasp, a rat-tailed thing, drenched it with brandy, and, turning it sideways, filed through the last bit of bone, which parted gently. With a ragged edge, but intact, not shattered.</p><p>\u201cIs he breathing?\u201d I asked. I was having trouble breathing myself, and couldn\u2019t sense the patient\u2019s vital signs\u2014save to notice his heart was beating, because blood was pulsing slightly out of the smaller vessels\u2014but Arnold nodded, his head bowed, intent on Tench\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d he said, his voice firm and loud, and I knew he was speaking as much to Tench as to me. Now I could feel the stir in the upper leg, a violent reflexive urge to move, and Jamie leaned hard on it. My fingers brushed the discarded lower leg, the flesh horribly flaccid and rubbery, and I snatched them back, wiping them convulsively on my apron.</p><p>I swiped the bloody apron then across my face and pushed back loosened bits of hair with the back of my hand. It was shaking; they both were.</p><p>What the bloody hell are you shaking now for? I thought irritably. But I was, and it took much longer than it should have to cauterize the last few small bleeders\u2014adding the ghastly smell of roasting flesh to everything else in the room; I thought even General Arnold might throw up\u2014stitch the flaps, bandage the wound, and, at last, loosen the tourniquet.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, and straightened up. \u201cNow . . .\u201d But if I said anything else, I didn\u2019t hear it. The room revolved slowly round me and dissolved into a flicker of black and white spots, and then everything went black.</p><p>THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</p> <p>TENCH LIVED.</p><p>\u201cI should have known you would,\u201d I said to him. \u201cIf you were determined enough to survive all night in the river, plainly a mere amputation wouldn\u2019t slow you down.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t enough strength to laugh\u2014the journey by litter to Chestnut Street had left him white-faced and gasping\u2014but he did twitch his mouth enough to qualify his expression as a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh . . . I\u2019ll live,\u201d he managed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t . . . give \u2019em . . . the satis . . . faction . . . of dying.\u201d Worn out by this, he closed his eyes, chest heaving. I wiped his face gently with my handkerchief, patted his shoulder, and left him to rest.</p><p>I had had the litter bearers take him upstairs, to what had been my bedroom, and I closed the door behind me now with a queerly mixed feeling of triumph and depression.</p><p>I had spent the morning with Mrs. Figg and the housemaid, Doreen, packing away what remained of Lord John\u2019s furnishings\u2014for many had already been shipped to New York\u2014and rearranging the house to serve as a temporary surgery. Even if we were to leave for North Carolina soon\u2014and the sooner the better\u2014I did have to have someplace to put Tench where he could be looked after in conditions approaching comfort and hygiene. And the patients I had been seeing at the printshop could certainly be taken care of more conveniently here.</p> <p>At the same time . . . being here again brought back echoes of the numb despair I had lived with all those weeks of believing Jamie dead. I thought the bustle of work and the clean sweep of furnishings would perhaps obviate that distant sense of drowning, but at the moment it was an uneasy swirl around my ankles.</p><p>Mental oppression was not the only debilitating condition connected with the new situation. Leaving Number 17 to return to the Shippen house, I had been followed in the street by a gang of young men. Mostly boys, but some big fellows of sixteen or seventeen, big enough to make me uneasy with their glances.</p><p>Still more uneasy when they began to draw up close to me, taking a quick step to whisper, \u201cKing\u2019s whore!\u201d in my ear before falling back, or to try to tread on the hem of my skirt, sniggering.</p><p>I thought I had seen one or two of them in the mob when I\u2019d brought Hal here. Perhaps they\u2019d followed me then and, finding that I was married to Lord John, assumed I was a turncoat, a traitor to the Rebel cause. Or possibly, I thought, stiffening my spine, they were just troublemaking pipsqueaks.</p><p>I whirled round to face them, gripping my parasol. It wasn\u2019t much of a weapon, but no physical weapon would have been of use against so many. Even a twelve-year-old boy was likely stronger than I was at the moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I demanded, using the memory of my matron\u2019s voice, whipcrack and steel\u2014or at least I hoped I could still do that.</p><p>Some of the little warts blinked and took a step back, but one of the bigger ones took a step toward me, grinning. It took all my control not to recoil.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, hinnie,\u201d he said, looking me up and down with a lazy insolence. \u201cWhat does a Loyalist lady have that we might want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA swift poke in the eye is all I can offer you,\u201d I informed him crisply, with a meaningful pointing of my parasol. \u201cApparently I\u2019m walking too slowly and blocking your progress, gentlemen. Do go on ahead of me.\u201d Holding his eye with a menacing stare, I stepped into the street and gestured with my parasol, indicating that they should pass on.</p><p>That made some of them giggle, but the big fellow flushed a nasty pink that made his adolescent pimples fluoresce. I stepped back farther into the street, in an imitation of politeness, but actually in hopes of attracting some attention.</p><p>I was lucky: a rag-and-bone cart was coming down the road, the horse\u2019s hooves clopping on the cobbles, and I moved still farther, blocking the way. The carter, aroused from semi-somnolence, half-stood, peering out from under his hat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil are you idle buggers a-doing in the road? Get your fat arses out my way!\u201d He raised his whip in a menacing fashion, and the boys, who had started to advance on me, quickly retreated.</p><p>The carter stood up all the way, took off his hat, and bowed to me.</p><p>\u201cGood day, your ladyship; I hopes I sees you well. Can I offer you a ride, mayhap?\u201d He was speaking in jest; I didn\u2019t think he actually knew I had recently been a ladyship. He was certainly surprised when I swept up my skirts and mounted his cart, though.</p><p>\u201cHome, James,\u201d I said, furling my parasol, \u201cand don\u2019t spare the horses.\u201d</p><p>The recollection made me smile a little, but the smile faded at the thought that the louts who had accosted me certainly lived somewhere nearby. I mightn\u2019t be as lucky a second time. And at that thought, a wave of cold terror washed over me and I felt a band of soreness across my middle, the chafing and bruising from hours spent tied facedown across a horse\u2019s back, being carried helpless to\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d I said sharply to myself. \u201cStop it at once. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d They were teenaged boys. I wasn\u2019t afraid of . . . But the first man to rape me had been about sixteen; he\u2019d been apologetic about it. I stepped into a narrow alley between two buildings and threw up.</p><p>I\u2019d managed to function. I got back to the Shippens\u2019 house and collected my things, then returned to the printshop to eat lunch and pack up the rest of my herbs and medicines; Fergus and Germain would bring them to Chestnut Street on their afternoon delivery round.</p><p>No one had molested me on the way back to Chestnut Street. I could have asked Jenny to come with me, but pride prevented me. I would not let simple-minded fear stop me doing what needed to be done.</p><p>But how long can you keep doing it? And what\u2019s the point?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a point,\u201d I muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s someone\u2019s life. That\u2019s a point.\u201d</p><p>A life that could be snatched away, thrown away, frittered on a battlefield . . . How many men had died that way? And it didn\u2019t stop, it didn\u2019t get better. . . . This was an early war, for God\u2019s sake. An endless chain of wars lay between my lives: the Revolution here, the Great War at the other end\u2014and constant slaughter in between.</p><p>The summer was dying; the air was beginning to have a hint of freshness in the mornings, but in midafternoon it still hung thick and heavy. Too heavy to draw a full breath.</p><p>I stood for a moment outside Number 17, feeling unequal to going in and dealing with things. After a moment, I turned down the path that led round the side of the house, out to the tiny garden at the back, and sat down on the bench there, among the roses, feeling most unwell.</p><p>I DON\u2019T KNOW how long I had been sitting there, head in my hands, listening to the loud buzzing of bees. But I heard footsteps coming down the path and managed to lift my head.</p><p>\u201cAre ye all right, Sassenach?\u201d It was Jamie, the large box of medicines and bandages in his arms. And from the look of alarm on his face, it was reasonably obvious that I didn\u2019t look all right. I couldn\u2019t muster the energy to try to look all right.</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014thought I\u2019d sit down,\u201d I said, flapping a hand helplessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad ye did.\u201d He set down the box on the yellowing grass and came to crouch in front of me, examining my face. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, and without warning began to cry. Or, rather, to leak. There was nothing of the sobbing, convulsive, racking nature of weeping; tears were just streaking down my cheeks without my approval.</p><p>Jamie nudged me over a little and sat down beside me, wrapping his arms around me. He was wearing his old kilt, and the smell of the dusty wool fabric, worn thin with age, made me utterly dissolve.</p><p>He tightened his grip and, sighing, pressed his cheek to my head and said small, tender things in Gaelic. And in a little time, the effort to understand them gave me a tenuous grip on myself. I drew a deep breath and he released me, though he kept an arm around me for support.</p><p>\u201cMo nighean donn,\u201d he said softly, and smoothed hair out of my face. \u201cHave ye got a hankie?\u201d</p><p>That made me laugh. Or rather emit a sort of strangled giggle, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cYes. At least, I think so.\u201d I groped in my bosom and withdrew a sturdy square of much-laundered linen, on which I blew my nose several times and then wiped my eyes, trying to think what on earth to offer as an explanation for my disordered state\u2014of mind, as well as body. There wasn\u2019t any good way to begin, so I just began.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever\u2014well, no. I know you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely,\u201d he said, smiling a little. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee the . . . the void. The abyss.\u201d Speaking the words reopened the rent in my soul, and the cold wind came through. A shudder ran through me, in spite of the warmth of the air and Jamie\u2019s body. \u201cI mean\u2014it\u2019s always there, always yawning at your feet, but most people manage to ignore it, not think about it. I\u2019ve mostly been able to. You have to, to do medicine.\u201d I wiped my nose on my sleeve, having dropped my handkerchief. Jamie pulled a crumpled hankie out of his sleeve and handed it to me.</p><p>\u201cYe dinna mean only death?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen that often enough. It hasna really scairt me since I was ten or so, though.\u201d He glanced down at me and smiled. \u201cAnd I doubt ye\u2019re afraid of it, either. I\u2019ve seen ye face it down a thousand times and more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFacing something down doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t afraid of it,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cUsually quite the opposite. And I know you know that.\u201d</p><p>He made a small sound of agreement in his throat and hugged me gently. I would normally have found this comforting, and the fact that I didn\u2019t merely added to my sense of despair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s just . . . nothing. And so much endless nothing . . . It\u2019s as though nothing you do, nothing you are, can possibly matter, it\u2019s all just swallowed up . . .\u201d I closed my eyes, but the darkness behind my eyelids frightened me and I opened them again. \u201cI\u2014\u201d I raised a hand, then let it fall.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain,\u201d I said, defeated. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there\u2014or I wasn\u2019t looking at it\u2014after I was shot. It wasn\u2019t nearly dying that made me look in, see it yawning there. But being so . . . so bloody frail! Being so stinking afraid.\u201d I clenched my fists, seeing the knobby bones of my knuckles, the blue veins that stood out on the backs of my hands and curved down my wrists.</p><p>\u201cNot death,\u201d I said at last, sniffing. \u201cFutility. Uselessness. Bloody entropy. Death matters, at least sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken that,\u201d Jamie said softly, and took my hands in his; they were big, and battered, scarred and maimed. \u201cIt\u2019s why a warrior doesna fear death so much. He has the hope\u2014sometimes the certainty\u2014that his death will matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to me between now and then doesna matter to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Those words swam out of nowhere and struck me in the pit of the stomach, so hard that I could barely breathe. He\u2019d said that to me, from the bottom of despair, in the dungeon of Wentworth Prison, a lifetime ago. He\u2019d bargained for my life then, with what he had\u2014not his life, already forfeit, but his soul.</p><p>\u201cIt matters to me!\u201d I\u2019d said to him\u2014and, against all odds, had ransomed that soul and brought him back.</p><p>And then it had come again, stark and dire necessity, and he\u2019d laid down his life without hesitation for his men and for the child I carried. And that time I had been the one who sacrificed my soul. And it had mattered, for both of us.</p><p>It still mattered. And the shell of fear cracked like an egg and everything inside me poured out like blood and water mingled and I sobbed on his chest until there were no more tears and no more breath. I leaned against him, limp as a dishcloth, and watched the crescent moon begin to rise in the east.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I said, rousing myself after a long while. I felt groggy and disoriented, but at peace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI asked, what\u2019s entropy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said, momentarily disconcerted. When had the concept of entropy been invented? Not yet, obviously. \u201cIt\u2019s, um . . . a lack of order, a lack of predictability, an inability for a system to do work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA system of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there you have me,\u201d I admitted, sitting up and wiping my nose. \u201cJust an ideal sort of system, with heat energy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics basically says that in an isolated system\u2014one that\u2019s not getting energy from somewhere outside, I mean\u2014entropy will always increase. I think it\u2019s just a scientific way of saying that everything is going to pot, all of the time.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, and despite my shattered state of mind, I did, too.</p><p>\u201cAye, well, far be it from me to argue wi\u2019 the Second Law of Thermodynamics,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s likely right. When did ye last eat, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to do anything but sit still beside him.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye see the sky?\u201d he said, a little later. It was a pure deep violet at the horizon, fading into a blue-black immensity overhead, and the early stars burned like distant lamps.</p><p>\u201cHard to miss,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d He sat with his head tilted back, looking up, and I admired the clean line of his long, straight nose, his soft wide mouth and long throat, as though seeing them for the first time.</p><p>\u201cIs it not a void there?\u201d he said quietly, still looking up. \u201cAnd yet we\u2019re no afraid to look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are lights,\u201d I said. \u201cIt makes a difference.\u201d My voice was hoarse, and I swallowed. \u201cThough I suppose even the stars are burning out, according to the Second Law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmphm. Well, I suppose men can make all the laws they like,\u201d he said, \u201cbut God made hope. The stars willna burn out.\u201d He turned and, cupping my chin, kissed me gently. \u201cAnd nor will we.\u201d</p><p>The noises of the city were muted now, though even darkness didn\u2019t stifle it entirely. I heard distant voices and the sound of a fiddle: a party, perhaps, from one of the houses down the street. And the bell of St. George\u2019s struck the hour with a small, flat bong! Nine o\u2019clock. And all\u2019s well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go and see to my patient,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cALAS, POOR YORICK!\u201d</p><p>September 17, 1778</p><p>Middlebrook Encampment, New Jersey</p><p>TWO NIGHTS LATER, William stood at the edge of a dark wood, watching a lopsided rising moon shed its light over Middlebrook Encampment. His heart was thumping in his ears and he was breathing fast, his hands clenched around the handle of the spade he\u2019d just stolen.</p><p>He\u2019d been correct in his assessment of his welcome. He\u2019d roughened his accent and, posing as a young immigrant from England interested in joining Washington\u2019s troops, he\u2019d been invited to join the Hamilton family for supper and given a bed for the night. The next day, he\u2019d walked up to Middlebrook Encampment with the eldest Hamilton son, a man about his own age, where he\u2019d been introduced to a Captain Ronson, one of the few officers still there.</p><p>One thing had led to another, and, by degrees, he had steered the conversation to the battle at Brandywine Creek and thence to British prisoners of war . . . and eventually he\u2019d been taken to the small burying ground that lay before him now.</p><p>He\u2019d been cautious about Ben, mentioning his name only casually among several others\u2014family acquaintances, he\u2019d said, that he\u2019d heard had been at the battle. Some of the men he talked to hadn\u2019t recognized the name at all; two or three said, oh, yes, the English viscount, prisoner, billeted with a family called Tobermory, very civil fellow, shame that he\u2019d died. . . .</p><p>And one man, a Lieutenant Corey, had said the same thing but his eyes had flickered slightly when he said it. William was wise enough to abandon the subject at once\u2014but brought up Captain Benjamin Grey with someone else, much later and out of hearing of Corey.</p> <p>\u201cIs he buried nearby?\u201d he\u2019d asked, with a decent assumption of casual concern. \u201cI know his family. I should like to be able to write to them, tell them I\u2019d visited, you know. . . .\u201d</p><p>It had taken some effort; the burying ground was well outside the encampment, up on a little wooded knoll, and while some of the graves were neatly ranked, others had been dug hastily, and many were unmarked. His companion was not busy, though, and of a helpful complexion; he went and unearthed the adjutant\u2019s ledger in which the dead were listed and, with some poking about, eventually led William to a flattened mound with a piece of lath stuck into it, on which GREY had been scratched with a nail.</p><p>\u201cLucky you came before another winter got at it,\u201d his companion had remarked, pulling the lath out and examining it critically. He shook his head, reached into his pocket, and, fetching out a lead pencil, reinforced the name with strong, scrubbing strokes before pushing it back into the earth. \u201cMaybe that will last a bit, in case the family should want to set up a stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . very good of you,\u201d William had said, his throat tight. \u201cI\u2019ll tell his family of your kindness.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t weep for a man he theoretically hadn\u2019t known and so swallowed his emotions and turned away, finding something commonplace to talk about as they made their way downhill.</p><p>He had wept in private, later, leaning against the comforting bulk of the mare, whom he\u2019d named Miranda. She wasn\u2019t sprightly, but she was a good horse, and merely whuffed a little and shifted her weight to give him support.</p><p>He\u2019d been stubbornly insisting to himself that there must be some mistake. Ben couldn\u2019t be dead. This belief had been sustained by Uncle Hal\u2019s complete refusal to believe the news. And it was plausible; whatever Ezekiel Richardson was up to, he meant no good to the Greys.</p><p>But here was Ben\u2019s grave, silent and muddy, speckled with the first yellowing leaves of September. And all around him lay the decaying bodies of other men, some prisoners, some Continental regulars, some militia . . . equal, and equally alone in death.</p><p>He\u2019d eaten dinner that night with the Hamiltons again, replying automatically to their conversation but concerned with his own misery\u2014and the thought of the much greater misery to come when he had to return to New York and tell his father and Uncle Hal. . . .</p><p>William had taken leave of the Hamiltons next morning, consigning the remains of the deer to them, and was followed down the narrow road by their good wishes and hopes that they would see him again with General Washington, when the troops came back to Middlebrook to winter. He\u2019d made it several miles down the mountain, dragging his spirit behind him, when he stopped to take a piss.</p><p>He\u2019d been hunting once with Ben, and they\u2019d stopped like this; Ben had told him a particularly scabrous joke, and he\u2019d laughed so much that he couldn\u2019t piss and Ben had pissed on his shoes, which made them both laugh harder, and . . .</p><p>\u201cGod damn it,\u201d he said aloud, and, buttoning his flies, stamped back to Miranda and swung up into the saddle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, owd lass,\u201d he said, reining her head around to face uphill. \u201cWe\u2019re going back.\u201d</p><p>And here he was, wavering between the conviction that this was madness and the stark fact that there wasn\u2019t anything else he could do besides go back to New York, and he wouldn\u2019t do that until and unless he had no other choice. At least he might be able to salvage a lock of Ben\u2019s hair for Aunt Minnie. . . .</p><p>That thought made him want to throw up, but he touched the knife at his waist, took a firmer hold of the spade, and made his way gingerly in among the graves.</p><p>The moonlight was bright enough to find footing but not to read most of the markers. He had to kneel and run his thumb over several before feeling the letters G-R-E-Y.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said out loud. His voice sounded small and choked, and he cleared his throat and spat\u2014to the side, not on the grave. \u201cRight,\u201d he said again, more forcefully, and, standing, took up the spade and drove it into the earth.</p><p>He\u2019d started close to what he thought should be the head, but dug in from the side\u2014the thought of driving his spade down into Ben\u2019s face made his flesh creep. The dirt was soft, damp with recent rain, but it was heavy work, and despite the coolness of the mountain night, he was soaked with sweat before he\u2019d dug a quarter of an hour. If Ben had died of camp fever, as they said\u2014and come to think, was that sensible? He hadn\u2019t been held in the stockade with the enlisted men. As an officer, he\u2019d been billeted with the Tobermorys. How had he come to catch camp fever? But still, if he had, then others would have died at the same time; it was a badly infectious sort of plague, he knew that much.</p><p>But if that were true, then a number of other men would have been buried at the same time, and buried hastily, to prevent contagion from the bodies. (Oh, there was a good thought: he might be opening a grave full of teeming pestilence. . . .) Anyway, if that were the case, the graves would be shallow ones.</p><p>This one was. His spade struck something harder than dirt, and he stopped abruptly, muscles quivering. He swallowed and resumed shoveling, more cautiously.</p><p>The body had been wrapped in a shroud of coarse burlap. He couldn\u2019t see, but a ginger probing with his fingers told him as much. Squatting, he dug with his hands, unearthing what he hoped was the head. His stomach was clenched tight and he was breathing through his mouth. The stink was less than he\u2019d expected, but still definitely there.</p><p>Oh, God. Ben . . . He\u2019d been nursing the hope that the grave was empty.</p><p>Patting and probing, he made out the rounded shape and took a deep breath, feeling for the edge of the shroud. Had it been stitched? No, the edge was loose.</p><p>He\u2019d thought of bringing a torch but had dismissed the idea, not wanting to risk detection. On the whole, he was glad he hadn\u2019t. He wiped dirt from his hands onto his breeches and peeled the burlap gently back, grimacing as it stuck to the skin beneath. It came loose with a grisly, rasping sound, and he nearly dropped it and ran. But he steeled himself and touched the dead man\u2019s face.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as awful as he\u2019d thought it might be; the body seemed largely still intact. How long will a man lie i\u2019 the earth ere he rot? What had the gravedigger said in reply\u2014nine years? Well, then . . . He\u2019d seen Hamlet with Ben and Adam, in London. . . .</p><p>William fought back an insane urge to laugh and felt gently over the dead features. The nose was broad and stubby, not Ben\u2019s sharp beak\u2014but no doubt the process of decay . . . He slid his fingers over the temple, thinking to see if a presentable lock of hair might\u2014and stopped dead, not breathing.</p><p>The corpse was missing an ear. Bloody hell, it was missing both ears. He felt again, both sides, unable to believe it. But it was true\u2014and the ears had been missing for some time; even with the nasty slack feel of the decaying flesh, the ridges of scar tissue were distinct. A thief.</p><p>William sat back on his heels and tilted up his head, letting out a huge breath. He felt dizzy, and the stars made little pinwheels in his vision.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he breathed, flooded with relief, gratitude, and creeping horror. \u201cOh, Jesus, thank you! And, oh, Christ,\u201d he added, looking down at the invisible stranger in Ben\u2019s grave, \u201cnow what?\u201d</p><p>A CRACKLING OF THORNS</p><p>September 18, 1778</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>IWAS HAVING A pleasantly incoherent dream involving autumn leaves and fireflies. The fireflies were red, rather than green, and were floating down through the trees like live sparks, and where they brushed against the yellow leaves, the edges browned and curled as the leaves caught fire. Smoke curled upward through the trees, lazy against an evening sky, pungent as tobacco, and I was walking underneath, smoking a cigarette with Frank . . .</p><p>I woke muzzily, thinking how nice it was to see Frank again, followed abruptly by Dreams don\u2019t smell, do they? along with I don\u2019t smoke, and then\u2014</p><p>\u201cJesus! We\u2019re on fire!\u201d I sat up, panicked and wriggling to get out of the sheets. Smoke was already thick in the loft, drifting layers above my head, and Jamie was coughing, grabbing my arm and dragging me free before I could locate all my limbs.</p><p>\u201cQuick,\u201d he said, hoarse as a crow. \u201cDinna wait to dress, come down!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t dress, but did seize my shift and pulled it over my head as I crawled toward the edge of the loft. Jamie had the ladder over the edge as I reached it and was already started down, shouting in a loud, cracked voice.</p><p>I could hear the fire. It rattled and crackled, and the ashy smell of burning paper and the stink of singed buckram was thick in the air.</p><p>\u201cIn the shop,\u201d I gasped, catching up with Jamie in the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s in the shop. The Bibles are burning\u2014the typefoundry . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the weans.\u201d He ran across the kitchen, shirttails flying, and slammed shut the door that led into the printshop, from which smoke was fuming in clouds. I ran the other way, into the room that served Fergus and Marsali as living and sleeping quarters, with a smaller loft above, where the children and Jenny slept.</p><p>That door was shut, thank God. The smoke hadn\u2019t yet reached them. I flung it open, shouting, \u201cFire! Fire! Get up, get up!\u201d and ran for the ladder to the loft, hearing Fergus swear behind me in French and Marsali\u2019s confused \u201cWhat? WHAT?\u201d</p><p>My hands were sweating and slipped on the smooth wooden rails of the ladder.</p><p>\u201cJenny! Germain!\u201d I bellowed\u2014or tried to. Smoke was drifting here, too, high up under the roof, and I was coughing, my eyes and nose running.</p><p>\u201cJo-hoan!\u201d</p><p>There was one small bedstead, two little humps under the bedclothes. I ran to the bed, flinging back the covers. Joan and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 were curled together, F\u00e9licit\u00e9\u2019s nightdress rucked up to show her little bottom. I grabbed her by the shoulder, shaking her and trying to speak calmly.</p><p>\u201cGirls, girls! You have to get up. Right now. Do you hear me, Joan? Wake up!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Joan\u2019s eyelids were fluttering, and she was coughing, turning her head to and fro to escape the smoke, eyes stubbornly closed. F\u00e9licit\u00e9 normally slept like the dead, and tonight was no exception; her head wobbled like her rag doll\u2019s when I shook her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d Jenny was struggling out of the quilts on her pallet in the corner.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on fire!\u201d I shouted. \u201cHurry\u2014help me!\u201d</p><p>I heard a cracking noise from the kitchen and a scream from Marsali. I didn\u2019t know what had happened, but in desperation I grabbed F\u00e9licit\u00e9 bodily out of bed, still shouting at Joan to wake up, for God\u2019s sake!</p> <p>I felt the vibration of the ladder against the loft and Jamie was there, snatching Joan up out of the bed.</p><p>\u201cThe lads, where are the lads?\u201d he asked urgently. In the frantic need to wake the girls, I\u2019d forgotten Germain and Henri-Christian. I looked round in an urgent daze; there was a thin mattress on the floor, flattened and dented by bodies, but no sign of the boys.</p><p>\u201cGermain! Joan! Henri-Christian!\u201d Marsali\u2019s face popped up over the edge of the loft, pale with fear. \u201cF\u00e9licit\u00e9!\u201d In an instant, she was with me, taking F\u00e9licit\u00e9 from me. The little girl was coughing and whining, starting to cry.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, a nighean, it\u2019s all right; you\u2019re safe, aye?\u201d Marsali was patting her back, coughing herself as the smoke thickened. \u201cWhere are the boys?\u201d</p><p>Jamie had shoved Jenny onto the ladder and was following her down, Joan draped over his shoulder, small pink feet kicking urgently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll find them!\u201d I said, pushing Marsali toward the ladder. \u201cTake F\u00e9licit\u00e9 down!\u201d</p><p>Something in the shop exploded with a loud whoosh\u2014probably a barrel of ink, made with varnish and lampblack. Marsali gasped, clutched F\u00e9licit\u00e9 hard, and scuttled for the ladder. I began rootling madly through the bits of furniture and boxes and bags in the loft, calling the boys\u2019 names between fits of coughing.</p><p>The smoke was much worse now; I could barely see. I was kicking my way through blankets, a chamber pot\u2014unfortunately full\u2014and other things, but there was no sign of Henri-Christian or Germain. Even if they\u2019d been overcome by the smoke, surely\u2014</p><p>\u201cSassenach!\u201d Jamie was suddenly there by my elbow. \u201cCome down, come down! The fire\u2019s in the wall; the loft will come down any minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for argument, but picked me up bodily and swung me down onto the ladder. I missed my footing and slid the last few feet, knees buckling as I hit the floor. The wall in front of me was alight, plaster shattered and the fire moving, glowing along the edges of the laths. Jamie landed beside me with a thud that shook the floor, seized my arm, and we ran for the kitchen.</p> <p>I heard a rending crack and then a crash that seemed to happen in slow motion, as the supports to the children\u2019s loft gave way and the timbers came down.</p><p>\u201cGermain,\u201d I gasped. \u201cHenri\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Jamie said, and shook with coughing. \u201cOut, we must get out.\u201d The air in the kitchen was a little clearer, but not by much. It was hot enough to sear the hairs inside my nose. Eyes streaming, we made our way across the room to the back door, now standing open, and more or less fell through into the alleyway behind.</p><p>Marsali and Jenny were crouched in the privy yard of the house on the other side of the alley, both girls now awake and clinging to them, shrieking.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Fergus?\u201d Jamie shouted, pushing me toward Marsali. She pointed toward the burning building, screaming something that I couldn\u2019t hear over the rumble of the fire. Then there was a second\u2019s respite in the noise, and a long, panicked bray split the night air.</p><p>\u201cClarence!\u201d Jamie spun on his heel and ran for the tiny stable, little more than a shed next to the main building. I ran after him, thinking that perhaps the boys had taken refuge there. My bare feet slid on the cobbles, stubbing my toes, but I scarcely noticed, my heart pounding in my ears with fear, lungs laboring to find fresh air.</p><p>\u201cGermain!\u201d I heard the shout, faint above the fire, and turned to see a shadow moving just beyond the open door into the kitchen. Smoke was pouring from the door in a thick white column, glowing from the fire beyond. I took a deep gulp of air and dived into the smoke, flailing my arms in a vain effort to dispel enough to see.</p><p>One of my flailing arms struck something solid, though, and Fergus collapsed into me, so far overcome with heat and smoke that he couldn\u2019t stand. I grabbed him under the arms and dragged him toward the door with that sort of strength that comes from the absolute determination not to die.</p> <p>We fell out into the alley, and there were shouts from what proved to be neighbors rushing to help. Hands gripped me and pulled me away. I could hear Fergus, gasping and sobbing, struggling against the helpful hands, desperately croaking his sons\u2019 names.</p><p>Through streaming eyes, I saw the stable roof alight and Jamie leading Clarence out, the torn-off sleeve of his shirt wrapped round the mule\u2019s eyes.</p><p>And then I heard a shriek that rose above all the noise, fire, neighbors, Clarence\u2019s bray. Marsali stood up straight, eyes and mouth round with horror, looking up.</p><p>The loading door that led to the kitchen loft was open, smoke and sparks fuming out, and in the midst of it was Germain, dragging Henri-Christian by the hand.</p><p>He shouted something, but no one could hear above the racket. There was a muffled boom from the loft as another cask went, and the fire blazed up suddenly as the stacks of paper caught, silhouetting the boys in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cJump! Jump!\u201d Jamie was shouting, and everyone else in the alley was shouting it, too, people shoving one another in the effort to get underneath, to help. Germain looked wildly to and fro; Henri-Christian was panicked, struggling to go back into the loft. The rope used to raise and lower loads to a waiting wagon was there, almost within reach. Germain saw it and let go of Henri-Christian for an instant to reach for it, hanging on to the edge of the doorframe.</p><p>He got it, and a gasp went through the crowd. His fair hair was standing on end in the wind from the fire, surrounding his head like flames, and for an instant I thought it was on fire.</p><p>Henri-Christian, dizzy from the smoke, had fallen against the doorframe and was clinging to it. He was too frightened to move; I could see him shaking his head as Germain pulled at him.</p><p>\u201cThrow him, Germain! Throw your brother!\u201d Fergus was shouting as loudly as he could, his voice cracking with the strain, and several other voices joined in. \u201cThrow him!\u201d</p><p>I saw Germain\u2019s jaw set hard, and he yanked Henri-Christian loose, picked him up, and clutched him with one arm, wrapping the rope around the other.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie bellowed, seeing it. \u201cGermain, don\u2019t!\u201d But Germain bent his head over his brother\u2019s, and I thought I saw his lips move, saying, \u201cHold on tight!\u201d And then he stepped out into the air, both hands clinging to the rope, Henri-Christian\u2019s stocky legs wrapped round his ribs.</p><p>It happened instantly and yet so slowly. Henri-Christian\u2019s short legs lost their grip. Germain\u2019s grab failed, for the little boy was already falling, arms outstretched, in a half somersault through the smoky air.</p><p>He fell straight through the sea of upraised hands, and the sound as his head struck the cobbles was the sound of the end of the world.</p><p>WALKING ON COALS</p><p>September 19, 1778</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>EVEN WHEN THE world ends, things bloody go on happening. You just don\u2019t know what to do about them.</p><p>Everything smelled of smoke and burning. The air, my hair, Jamie\u2019s skin, the ill-fitting gown someone had given me . . . Even food tasted of ashes. But, then, it would, wouldn\u2019t it? I reflected. It didn\u2019t matter; I couldn\u2019t eat more than the mouthful or two required for politeness.</p><p>No one had slept. The printshop had burned to the ground in the small hours; there was nothing to be done but to beat off flying embers and stamp out sparks in an effort to preserve the nearby houses. By a mercy, it hadn\u2019t been a windy night.</p><p>The neighbors had given us shelter, clothes, food, and abundant sympathy. None of it seemed real, and I hoped in a vague sort of way that this state of things would continue, even though I knew it couldn\u2019t.</p><p>What did seem real, though, was the small collection of vivid images that had been literally seared on my mind during the night. Henri-Christian\u2019s bare feet, dirty-soled and large in comparison with his legs, sticking out from under his mother\u2019s skirt as she cradled him, rocking to and fro, wrapped in a grief too dense for any sound to escape it. Germain, letting go the rope in a frantic attempt to fly after his brother, dropping like a rock into Fergus\u2019s arms. Fergus clutching Germain so hard against him that it must have bruised them both, his hook gleaming against Germain\u2019s soot-streaked back.</p><p>The boys had been sleeping on the roof. There was a small trapdoor in the ceiling of the bedroom loft, which no one had remembered in the panic of the fire.</p><p>When Germain began finally to talk, sometime toward dawn, he said they had gone out to be cool and to look at the stars. They had fallen asleep and not waked until the slates they lay on began to feel hot\u2014and by then smoke was rolling up through the cracks of the trapdoor. They\u2019d run across the roof to the other side, where a similar trapdoor let them into the printing loft. Half the loft had fallen away and the rest was on fire, but they\u2019d made it through the smoke and rubble to the loading door.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he\u2019d cried, passed from one set of arms to another, ignoring all futile words of would-be comfort. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I hold on to him?! He was too little; he couldn\u2019t hold on.\u201d</p><p>Only his mother hadn\u2019t embraced him. She held Henri-Christian and wouldn\u2019t let go until daylight came and sheer exhaustion loosened her grasp. Fergus and Jamie had eased the small, chunky body from her grip and taken him away to be washed and made decent for the long business of being dead. Then Marsali had come to find her eldest son and touched him gently in his deadened sleep, sorrowing.</p><p>The Reverend Figg had once more come to our aid, a small neat figure in his black suit and high white stock, offering his church in which to hold the wake.</p><p>I was sitting in the church now, in midafternoon, alone, on a bench with my back against a wall, smelling smoke and trembling intermittently with echoes of flame and loss.</p><p>Marsali was asleep in a neighbor\u2019s bed. I had tucked her in, her daughters curled up on either side of her, F\u00e9licit\u00e9 sucking her thumb, round black eyes watchful as those of her rag doll, fortuitously saved from the flames. So few things had survived. I remembered the constant pang of loss after the Big House had burned, reaching for something and realizing that it wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Jenny, worn to the gray-white color of weathered bone, had gone to lie down at the Figgs\u2019 house, her rosary in her hands, the wooden beads sliding smoothly through her fingers as she walked, her lips moving silently; I doubted that she would stop praying, even in her sleep.</p><p>People came and went, bringing things. Tables, extra benches, platters of food. Late-summer flowers, roses and jasmine and early blue asters, and for the first time, tears ran down my cheeks at this scented remembrance of the wedding held here so little time before. I pressed a stranger\u2019s handkerchief to my face, though, not wanting anyone to see and feel that they must try to comfort me.</p><p>The bench beside me creaked and gave, and I peeped over the edge of my handkerchief to see Jamie beside me, wearing a worn suit that plainly belonged to a chairman\u2014it had a band round the coat sleeve reading \u201c82\u201d\u2014and with his face washed but the whorls of his ears still grimed with soot. He took my hand and held it tight, and I saw the blisters on his fingers, some fresh, some burst and shredded from the efforts to save what could be saved from the fire.</p><p>He looked to the front of the church, toward what couldn\u2019t be saved, then sighed and looked down to our clasped hands.</p><p>\u201cAll right, lass?\u201d His voice was hoarse, his throat raw and soot-choked as my own.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cHave you had anything to eat?\u201d I already knew he hadn\u2019t slept.</p><p>He shook his head and leaned back against the wall, closing his eyes, and I felt the relaxation of his body into momentary exhaustion. There were things still to be done, but just for a moment . . . I wanted to dress his hands, but there was nothing to dress them with. I lifted the hand he held and kissed his knuckles.</p><p>\u201cWhat do ye think it\u2019s like when ye die?\u201d he asked suddenly, opening his eyes and looking down at me. His eyes were red as an emery bag.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve really thought about it,\u201d I replied, taken aback. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed two fingers slowly between his brows; I thought from the look of him that his head must ache.</p><p>\u201cI only wondered if it\u2019s like this.\u201d He made a brief gesture, encompassing the half-empty room, the well-wishers coming and going in whispers, the mourners sitting, blank-faced and sagging like bags of rubbish, stirring\u2014with a visible effort\u2014only when spoken to. \u201cIf ye dinna ken what to do, and ye dinna much want to do anything. Or is it like going to sleep and wakin\u2019 up in a new, fresh place and wanting to go out at once and see what it\u2019s like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Father O\u2019Neill, innocents are just in the presence of God immediately. No limbo, no purgatory. Assuming they were properly baptized,\u201d I added. Henri-Christian had indeed been baptized, and as he was not yet seven, the Church held that he lacked sufficient sense of reason to commit sins. Ergo . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known people in their fifties who had less sense than Henri-Christian,\u201d I said, wiping my nose for the thousandth time. My nostrils were as raw as my eyelids.</p><p>\u201cAye, but they\u2019ve more capacity for causing harm wi\u2019 their foolishness.\u201d A faint smile touched his mouth. \u201cI thought I was dead on Culloden field; did I ever tell ye that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you did. Under the circumstances, I suppose it would have been a reasonable assumption, though\u2014were you knocked out?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes fixed on the floorboards.</p><p>\u201cAye. If I\u2019d been able to look about, I should have known better, but my eyes were sealed shut wi\u2019 the blood. It was all red and dim, so I supposed I was in purgatory and would just have to wait \u2019til someone came round to chastise me. After a bit, I supposed boredom was meant to be part of the punishment.\u201d He glanced at the tiny coffin on its bench at the front of the room. Germain sat by it, one hand on its lid. He hadn\u2019t moved at all in the last half hour.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Henri-Christian bored,\u201d I said quietly, after a moment. \u201cNot once.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jamie said softly, and took my hand. \u201cI dinna suppose he ever will be.\u201d</p><p>Gaelic wakes have their own rhythm. Fergus and Marsali came in quietly an hour or so later and sat together at first, holding hands near the coffin, but as more people came, the men gradually surrounded Fergus, absorbing him, much as a gang of phagocytes surround a microbe, carrying it along with them, and after a time, as happens normally in such situations, half the men were at one side of the room, talking quietly, and the others outside, unable to bear close quarters and exigent emotion but wanting to lend their presence and sympathy.</p><p>The women clustered, first near Marsali, hugging and weeping, then gathering in small clumps with their friends, drifting back to the tables to rearrange things or put out more bread or cakes. Josiah Prentice came with his fiddle, but left it in its case for the time being. Tobacco smoke from the pipes of the men outside drifted through the church in soft blue clouds. It tickled uneasily at the back of my nose, too reminiscent of the fire for comfort.</p><p>Jamie left me with a brief squeeze of the hand and went to speak to Ian. I saw them both look at Germain; Ian nodded and moved quietly to his nephew, putting both hands on his shoulders. Rachel hovered nearby, dark eyes watchful.</p><p>The bench beside me creaked, and Jenny sat down. Wordless, she put her arm about my shoulder, and equally wordless, I bent my head to hers and we wept for a bit\u2014not only for Henri-Christian but for the babies we each had lost, my stillborn Faith, her infant Caitlin. And for Marsali, now joining us in this sorrowful kinship.</p> <p>The night drew in, beer and ale were poured, some stronger drink was brought out, and the somber mood of the gathering lifted a little. Still, it was the wake of a child and a life cut short; there couldn\u2019t be the sense of shared memory and laughter that there might be for a man who had lived a full life and whose friends had come to share in his death.</p><p>Josiah Prentice played his fiddle, but quietly, mixing laments with peaceful tunes and the occasional hymn; there wouldn\u2019t be much singing tonight. I wished suddenly and fiercely that Roger were here. He would perhaps have known what to say, in a situation where there was nothing one could say. And even with his ruined voice, he would have known a song to sing, a prayer to offer.</p><p>Father O\u2019Neill from St. George\u2019s Church had come, tactfully overlooking the unorthodox Quaker marriage of a month before, and stood talking near the door with Fergus and a few other men.</p><p>\u201cPoor wee child,\u201d Jenny said, her voice roughened by tears but steady now. She was holding my hand, and I hers, and she was looking not at the coffin but at Fergus. \u201cHis bairns mean everything to him\u2014and especially our wee man.\u201d Her lips trembled, but she pressed them together and straightened her back.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think Marsali\u2019s breedin\u2019?\u201d she said, very softly, looking at Marsali, with Joan and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 clinging to her skirts, Joan\u2019s head in her lap. Her mother\u2019s hand rested on her hair, gently smoothing it.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, as softly.</p> <p>She nodded, and her hand twitched, half hidden in the folds of her skirt, making the horns against evil.</p><p>More people had come. The Congress was meeting in Philadelphia, and several delegates who did business with Fergus had come. Jonas Phillips and Samuel Adams were both there, chatting by the refreshments table. In a different frame of mind, I might have marveled at being in the same room with two signers of the Declaration of Independence, but, after all, they were only men\u2014though I took it kindly that they\u2019d come.</p><p>I looked for Germain every few minutes; now he was standing by the tables with Ian, drinking something from a cup. I blinked and looked again.</p><p>\u201cJesus H\u2014I mean, good Lord. Ian\u2019s giving Germain cherry bounce!\u201d</p><p>Jenny glanced at Germain\u2019s bright red lips, and a quiver of amusement ran through her.</p><p>\u201cCanna think of anything better for the lad just now, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . no.\u201d I stood up, shaking out my skirts. \u201cD\u2019you want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, and got up with alacrity. \u201cAnd maybe a wee bite, too. It\u2019ll be a long night; we\u2019ll need a bit to sustain us, aye?\u201d</p> <p>It felt better to be up and moving. The fog of grief still numbed sensation, and I didn\u2019t look forward to its passing, but at the same time . . . I realized that I was hungry now.</p><p>The feeling in the room shifted gradually, from the first impact of shock and sorrow, to comforting support for the family, and now to more-general talk. Which was, I realized uneasily, beginning to focus on speculation as to what\u2014or who\u2014had caused the fire.</p><p>In the shock and grief of the event, none of us had spoken of it, but even through that numbing fog, the insidious question had hovered like a bat overhead: Why? How? And . . . who?</p><p>If anyone. Fire was a common plague in a time when every household had open hearths, and a printshop, with its type forge and its stock of inflammables, was still more vulnerable to simple accident. An open window, a stray breeze, loose papers blowing . . . a spitting ember from a badly smoored fire catching hold . . .</p><p>And yet.</p><p>The memory of the anonymous letter floated queasily on the surface of my mind. Your house is on fire and your children are gone . . .</p><p>And the young men who had followed me from Chestnut Street, their stealthy plucking and whispered taunts. God, could I have brought their enmity to Fergus\u2019s door?</p><p>Jamie had come to stand by me again, steady and solid as a rock, and handed me a fresh cup of cherry bounce. It was like drinking very strong cough syrup, but it was undeniably bracing. Up to the point where you fell down insensible, at least. I saw that Germain had slid slowly down the wall; Rachel knelt next to him and eased him to the ground, then folded her shawl and put it under his head.</p><p>The cherry bounce was taking the place of the fog; I thought drunkenness was probably an improvement, on the whole.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser?\u201d A strange voice on my left drew my attention from bemused contemplation of the dark-red depths of my cup. A young man in shabby clothes was standing at my elbow, a small package in his hand.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Jamie said, giving the young man a searching look. \u201cAre ye needing a physician? Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, sir,\u201d the young man assured him, obsequious. \u201cI was told to give this into Mrs. Fraser\u2019s hand, that\u2019s all.\u201d He handed it to me and, with a short bow, turned and left.</p><p>Puzzled, and slow with fatigue, grief, and cherry bounce, I fumbled with the string, then gave up and handed the package to Jamie, who reached for his knife, failed to find it\u2014for it had, of course, perished in the fire\u2014and, with a flicker of annoyance, simply broke the string. The wrapping fell open to reveal a small leather purse and a note, folded but unsealed.</p><p>I blinked and squinted for a moment, then dipped a hand into my pocket. By a miracle, my spectacles had been downstairs, left behind in the kitchen when I took them off while chopping onions, and Jamie had retrieved them in his hurried foray into the burning house. The stylish handwriting sprang into reassuring clarity.</p><p>Mrs. Fraser,</p><p>I cannot think my Presence would be welcome and I would not intrude on private Grief. I ask nothing, neither Acknowledgment nor Obligation. I do ask that you would allow me to help in the only way that I can and that you will not reveal the Source of this Assistance to the younger Mr. Fraser. I trust your Discretion, as to the Elder.</p><p>It was signed simply, P. Wainwright (Beauchamp).</p><p>I raised my brows at Jamie and passed him the note. He read it, lips pressed tight together, but glanced at Marsali and the girls, now clustered with Jenny, talking to Mrs. Phillips, all of them crying quietly. Then across the room, to Fergus, flanked by Ian and Rachel. He grimaced very briefly, but his features set in resignation. There was a family to provide for; he couldn\u2019t, for the moment, afford pride.</p><p>\u201cWell, it probably wasn\u2019t him, then,\u201d I said, with a sigh, and tucked the little purse into the pocket under my skirt. Numbed as I was, I still felt a vague sense of relief at that. Whatever he might be, might have done, or might intend, I still rather liked the erstwhile Monsieur Beauchamp.</p><p>I had no time to consider Percy further, though, for at this point there was a stir among the people near the door, and, looking to see what had caused it, I saw George Sorrel come in.</p><p>It was apparent at a glance that the tavern owner had been availing himself of his own wares\u2014possibly as a means of getting up his courage, for he stood swaying slightly, fists clenched at his sides, looking slowly round the room, belligerently meeting the stares that greeted him.</p><p>Jamie said something very unsuitable in a house of God under his breath in Gaelic, and started toward the door. Before he could reach it, though, Fergus had turned to see the cause of the stir and had spotted Sorrel.</p><p>Fergus was no more sober than Sorrel but was much more upset. He stiffened for an instant, but then pulled himself free of the grasping hands of his supporters and headed for Sorrel without a word, red-eyed as a hunting ferret and just as dangerous.</p><p>He hit Sorrel with his fist as the man was opening his mouth. Unsteady as they were, both of them staggered from the impact, and men rushed in to separate them. Jamie reached Sorrel and, grabbing his arm, jerked him out of the scrum.</p><p>\u201cI suggest that ye leave, sir,\u201d he said, politely, under the circumstances, and turned the man firmly toward the door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Fergus said. He was breathing like a train, sweat pouring down his chalk-white face. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Stay\u2014and tell me why. Why have you come here? How dare you come here?\u201d This last was uttered in a cracked shout that made Sorrel blink and take a step backward. He shook his head doggedly, though, and drew himself up.</p><p>\u201cI came to\u2014to offer Mrs. Fraser con-condol\u2014to say I was sorry about her son,\u201d he said sullenly. \u201cAnd you ain\u2019t a-going to stop me, either, you farting French son of a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou offer my wife nothing,\u201d Fergus said, shaking with fury. \u201cNothing, do you hear? Who is to say you did not set the fire yourself? To kill me, to seize upon my wife? Salaud!\u201d</p><p>I would have bet money that Sorrel didn\u2019t know what a salaud was, but it didn\u2019t matter; he went the color of beetroot and lunged at Fergus. He didn\u2019t reach him, as Jamie managed to grab his collar, but there was a sound of rending cloth and Sorrel jerked to a stop, staggering.</p><p>There was a rumble through the room, men and women gathering in a thundercloud of disapproval. I could see Jamie drawing himself up and in, settling himself to haul Sorrel out before someone besides Fergus took a swing at him. A certain shuffling readiness suggested that a number of men had it in mind.</p><p>And then Rachel walked between the two men. She was very pale, though a red spot burned in each cheek, and her hands were clenched in the fabric of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cDoes thee indeed come to offer comfort, friend?\u201d she said to Sorrel, in a voice that shook only a little. \u201cFor if that is so, thee ought to offer it to all of those who are met here for the sake of the child. Particularly to his father.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward Fergus, reaching to put a careful hand on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cThee will not see thy wife distressed further, I know,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWill thee not go to her now? For while she is grateful for the presence of so many kind folk, it is only thee she wants.\u201d</p><p>Fergus\u2019s face worked, anguish and fury warring with confusion. Seeing him unable to decide what to do or how to do it, Rachel moved closer and took his arm, tucking her hand into the curve of his elbow, and compelled him to turn and to walk with her, the crowd parting in front of them. I saw the curve of Marsali\u2019s blond head as she raised it slowly, her face changing as she watched Fergus come.</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath and released Sorrel.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he said quietly. \u201cStay or go. As ye will.\u201d</p><p>Sorrel was still panting a little but had himself in hand now. He nodded jerkily, drew himself up, and straightened his torn coat. Then he walked through the silent crowd, head up, to give his sympathies to the bereaved.</p><p>HALLOWED GROUND</p><p>IN SPITE OF THE neighbors\u2019 generosity, there was very little to pack. Nor was there any reason to linger in Philadelphia. Our life there was ended.</p><p>There was\u2014there always is\u2014considerable speculation as to the cause of the fire. But after the outburst at the wake, a sense of flat finality had settled over all of us. The neighbors would continue to talk, but among the family there was an unspoken agreement that it made little difference whether the fire had been pure accident or someone\u2019s ill design. Nothing would bring Henri-Christian back. Nothing else mattered.</p><p>Jamie had taken Fergus to make the arrangements for our travel: not because he needed assistance but as a way of keeping Fergus moving, lest he simply sit down by Henri-Christian\u2019s small coffin and never rise again.</p><p>Things were both easier and harder for Marsali. She had children to care for, children who needed her badly.</p><p>Rachel and I packed what there was to pack, bought food for the journey, and dealt with the final details of leaving. I packed the bits and bobs of my surgery and, with mutual tears and embraces, gave the keys of Number 17 Chestnut Street to Mrs. Figg.</p><p>And in the early afternoon of the day following the wake, we borrowed a small cart, hitched up Clarence, and followed Henri-Christian to his grave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There hadn\u2019t been any discussion as to the burial. After the wake, Ian had simply stood up and said, \u201cI know where he must rest.\u201d</p><p>It was a long way, perhaps two hours\u2019 walk outside the city. The heat had broken at last, though, and the air moved gently over us, with the first cool touch of autumn. There was no ceremony to our procession; no Gaelic laments for a life cut short, no professional wailing. Only a small family, walking together for the last time.</p><p>We left the road at Ian\u2019s signal. Jamie unhitched Clarence and hobbled him to graze, then he and Fergus lifted the coffin and followed Ian into the whisper of the trees, along a small and hidden path made by the hooves of deer, and so upward to a small clearing in the forest.</p><p>There were two large cairns there, knee-high. And a smaller one, at the edge of the clearing, under the branches of a red cedar. A flat stone lay against it, the word ROLLO scratched into it.</p> <p>Fergus and Jamie set down the little coffin, gently. Joanie and F\u00e9licit\u00e9 had stopped crying during the long walk, but seeing it there, so small and forlorn, facing the thought of walking away . . . they began to weep silently, clinging hard to each other, and at the sight of them, grief rose in me like a fountain.</p><p>Germain was holding hard to his mother\u2019s hand, mute and jaw-set, tearless. Not seeking support, giving it, though the agony showed clear in his eyes as they rested on his brother\u2019s coffin.</p><p>Ian touched Marsali\u2019s arm gently.</p><p>\u201cThis place is hallowed by my sweat and my tears, cousin,\u201d he said softly. \u201cLet us hallow it also by our blood and let our wee lad rest here safe in his family. If he canna go with us, we will abide with him.\u201d</p><p>He took the sgian dubh from his stocking and drew it across his wrist, lightly, then held his arm above Henri-Christian\u2019s coffin, letting a few drops fall on the wood. I could hear the sound of it, like the beginning of rain.</p> <p>Marsali drew a shattered breath, stood straight, and took the knife from his hand.</p><p>PART EIGHT</p><p>Search and Rescue</p><p>QUOD SCRIPSI, SCRIPSI</p><p>From Mrs. Abigail Bell, Savannah, the Royal Colony of Georgia</p><p>To Mr. James Fraser, Philadelphia, Colony of Pennsylvania</p> <p>Dear Mr. Fraser,</p><p>I write in response to yours of the 17th inst., apprising my Husband of your return to America, which was forwarded to him by a Friend in Wilmington.</p><p>As you will see from the Direction of this Letter, we have removed from Wilmington to Savannah, the political Climate of North Carolina having become increasingly dangerous to Loyalists, particularly to my Husband, given his History and Profession.</p><p>I wish to assure you that your Press has been preserved in excellent condition but is not presently in use. My husband contracted a serious Ague soon after our arrival here, and it became evident that his Illness was of the periodic, or relapsing, Kind. He does somewhat better these days but is unable to sustain the difficult Labor of the printing Trade. (I will add, should you think of establishing a Business here, that while the Politics of the Place are a great deal more congenial to those of the Loyalist Persuasion than those of the northern Colonies, a Printer is exposed to much Unpleasantness, whatever his personal Beliefs.)</p><p>Your Press is presently stored in the Barn of a Farmer named Simpson, who lives a short Distance outside the City. I have seen it and assured myself that the Instrument is Clean, Dry (it is packed in Straw), and sheltered from the Weather. Please apprise me of your Desires, should you wish me to sell the Press and forward the Money to you, or should you wish to come and fetch it.</p><p>We are most appreciative of your Help and Kindness, and the Girls pray for you and your Family every Day.</p><p>Yours most Sincerely,</p><p>Abigail Bell</p> <p>William Ransom, to His Grace Harold, Duke of Pardloe</p><p>September 24, 1778</p><p>Dear Uncle Hal,</p><p>You will be gratified to know that your paternal Instinct was correct. I am very pleased to tell you that Ben probably isn\u2019t dead.</p><p>On the other hand, I haven\u2019t the slightest Idea where the devil he is or why he\u2019s there.</p><p>I was shown a Grave at Middlebrook Encampment in New Jersey, purported to be Ben\u2019s, but the Body therein is not Ben. (It\u2019s probably better if you don\u2019t know how that bit of information was ascertained.)</p><p>Clearly someone in the Continental army must know something of his whereabouts, but most of Washington\u2019s troops who were at the Encampment when he was captured have gone. There is one Man who might possibly yield some Information, but beyond that, the only possible Connection would seem to be the Captain with whom we are acquainted.</p><p>I propose therefore to hunt the Gentleman in question and extract what Information he may possess when I find him.</p><p>Your most obedient nephew,</p><p>William</p><p>Lord John Grey, to Harold, Duke of Pardloe</p><p>Charleston, South Carolina</p><p>September 28, 1778</p><p>Dear Hal,</p><p>We arrived in Charleston by ship two days ago, having encountered a Storm off the Chesapeake that blew us out to Sea, delaying us for several days. I\u2019m sure you will not be surprised in the least to learn that Dottie is a much better Sailor than I am.</p><p>She also shows Promise as an inquiry Agent. First thing this morning, she discovered the Whereabouts of Amaranthus Cowden by the simple Expedient of stopping a well-dressed Lady on the Street, admiring her Gown, and then asking for the names of the better Dressmakers in the City, on the Assumption (as she later explained to me) that Ben would not have married either a plain Woman or one with no Interest in Fashion.</p><p>The third Shop we visited did indeed boast that Miss Cowden (she was calling herself Mrs. Grey, they said, but they knew her Maiden Name, as she was residing with an Aunt named Cowden) was a Customer, and they were able to describe her to me as a slight young Woman of middle Height, with an excellent Complexion, large brown Eyes, and abundant Hair of a dark-blond Hue. They could not, however, give me her Address, as the Lady had recently decamped to winter with Friends in Savannah. (The Aunt has annoyingly died, I find.)</p><p>Interestingly, she styles herself as a Widow, so apparently she was informed\u2014and by whom? I should like to know\u2014of Ben\u2019s presumed Death, sometime after the Date of her Letter to you, as otherwise she would certainly have mentioned it.</p><p>I also find it interesting that she should be able to afford the Services of Madame Eulalie\u2014and these to no little Extent; I succeeded in inducing Madame to show me her recent Bills\u2014when her Letter to you professed her to be in financial Difficulties owing to Ben\u2019s Capture.</p><p>If Ben is indeed dead and both the Death and the Marriage proved, then presumably she would inherit some Property\u2014or at least the Child would. But she can\u2019t possibly have taken such Legal Steps in the Time between her Letter to you and the Present; it could easily take that long merely to send a Letter to London\u2014assuming that she had any Idea to whom it should be sent. And assuming also that whoever received it would not immediately have informed you.</p><p>Oh\u2014she does possess an Infant, a Boy, and the Child is hers; Madame made her two Gowns and a set of Stays to accommodate the Pregnancy. Naturally, there\u2019s no telling whether Benjamin is the child\u2019s Father. She clearly has at least met Ben\u2014or possibly Adam; she could have got \u201cWattiswade\u201d from anyone in the Family\u2014but that\u2019s not Proof of either Marriage or Paternity.</p><p>All in all, an interesting Woman, your putative Daughter-in-law. Plainly our Path lies now toward Savannah, though this may require somewhat more investigative Effort, as we don\u2019t know the Name of the Friends with whom she\u2019s taken Refuge, and if she is indeed poverty-stricken, she won\u2019t be buying new Gowns.</p><p>I hope to convince Dottie that she need not accompany me. She\u2019s most determined, but I can see that she pines for her Quaker Physician. And if our Quest should be greatly prolonged . . . I will not allow her to be placed in Danger, I assure you.</p><p>Your most affectionate Brother,</p><p>John</p><p>General Sir Henry Clinton, Commander in Chief for North</p><p>America, to Colonel His Grace Duke of Pardloe, 46th Foot</p><p>Sir,</p><p>You are hereby ordered and directed to assemble and re-fit your Troops in whatever manner you deem necessary, and then to make Junction with Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell, to march upon the City of Savannah in the colony of Georgia, and take possession of it in His Majesty\u2019s name.</p><p>H. Clinton</p><p>HAROLD, DUKE OF Pardloe, felt his chest tightening and rang for his orderly.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, please,\u201d he said to the man. \u201cBrewed very strong, and quickly. And bring the brandy while you\u2019re at it.\u201d</p><p>BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE LETTERS Q, E, AND D</p><p>IT WAS, OF COURSE, unthinkable that we should sell Clarence.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he weighs as much as a printing press?\u201d I asked, looking at him dubiously. His tiny stable next to the shop had survived the fire, and while he wrinkled his nose and sneezed when the wind raised a whiff of ash from the charred remains of the printshop, he didn\u2019t seem much affected.</p><p>\u201cSubstantially more, I think.\u201d Jamie scratched his forehead and ran a hand up the length of one long ear. \u201cD\u2019ye think mules suffer from seasickness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they vomit?\u201d I tried to recall whether I\u2019d ever seen a horse or mule regurgitate\u2014as opposed to dropping slobbery mouthfuls of whatever they were eating\u2014but couldn\u2019t call an instance to mind.</p><p>\u201cI couldna say if they can,\u201d Jamie said, picking up a stiff brush and beating clouds of dust from Clarence\u2019s broad gray back, \u201cbut they don\u2019t, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how would you know if a mule was seasick?\u201d Jamie himself got violently seasick, and I did wonder how he was going to manage if we did go by ship; the acupuncture needles I used to quell his nausea had perished in the fire\u2014with so much else.</p><p>Jamie gave me a jaundiced look over Clarence\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cCan ye no tell if I\u2019m seasick, even when I\u2019m not puking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d I said mildly, \u201cbut you aren\u2019t covered with hair, and you can talk. You turn green and pour with sweat and lie about, groaning and begging to be shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Well, bar the turning green, a mule can tell ye verra well if he\u2019s feeling peely-wally. And he can certainly make ye want to shoot him.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down Clarence\u2019s leg to pick up the mule\u2019s left front hoof. Clarence picked it up and set it down again very solidly, exactly where Jamie\u2019s own foot had been an instant before. His ears twitched.</p><p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d Jamie said to him, \u201cI could make ye walk all the way to Savannah, pullin\u2019 a cart behind ye. Think about that, aye?\u201d He came out of the stall and closed the gate, shaking it to be sure it was securely latched.</p><p>\u201cMr. Fraser!\u201d A shout from the end of the alley drew his attention. It was Jonas Phillips, presumably on his way home to a midday dinner from the assembly room, where the Continental Congress was still locked in struggle. Jamie waved back and, with a nod to me, walked down the alley. While I waited for him, I turned my attention to the jumble of items occupying the other half of the stable.</p><p>What little room there was besides Clarence\u2019s stall was filled with the things the neighbors had managed to salvage from the remains of the print-shop. All of it had the sour reek of ash about it, but a few of the items might be salvaged or sold, I supposed.</p><p>Mrs. Bell\u2019s letter had caused a certain reevaluation of our immediate prospects. Fergus\u2019s press had definitely perished in the flames; the derelict carcass was still there, the metal parts twisted in a way suggesting uncomfortably that the thing had died in agony. Fergus hadn\u2019t wept; after Henri-Christian, I didn\u2019t think anything could ever make him weep again. But he did avert his eyes whenever he came near the ruins.</p><p>On the one hand, the loss of the press was terrible\u2014but, on the other, it did save us the problem of hauling it to . . .</p><p>Well, that was another problem. Where were we going?</p><p>Jamie had assured me that we were going home\u2014back to the Ridge. But it was late September, and even if we found the money to pay the passage for so many people\u2014and Clarence\u2014and were fortunate enough not to be sunk or captured by an English cutter . . . we would part company with Fergus and Marsali in Wilmington, then go up the Cape Fear River into the North Carolina backcountry, leaving Marsali, Fergus, and the children to go on alone to Savannah. I knew that Jamie didn\u2019t want to do that. In all honesty, neither did I.</p><p>The little family was surviving, but there was no doubt that Henri-Christian\u2019s death and the fire had left them all badly wounded. Especially Germain.</p><p>You could see it in his face, even in the way he walked, no longer jaunty and bright-eyed, eager for adventure. He walked with his shoulders hunched, as though expecting a blow to come out of nowhere. And while sometimes he would forget for a few moments and revert to his normal swagger and talk, you could see it when the blow of memory did come out of nowhere to send him reeling.</p><p>Ian and Rachel had taken it upon themselves to be sure that he didn\u2019t slink away by himself; one or the other was always calling on him to come and help carry the marketing or go out to the forest to look for the proper wood for an ax handle or a new bow. That helped.</p><p>If Fergus went to Savannah to retrieve Bonnie, Jamie\u2019s original press, Marsali would be hampered and preoccupied by advancing pregnancy and the difficulties both of travel with a family and then of establishing a new home, Fergus needing to devote himself to setting up the new business and dealing with whatever the local politics might be. Germain could so easily slip through the cracks in his family and be lost.</p><p>I wondered whether Jenny would go with them\u2014or with Ian and Rachel. Marsali could certainly use her help, but I remembered what Marsali had said, and thought she was right: \u201cIan\u2019s her youngest. . . . And she\u2019s had too little of him.\u201d She had; Ian had essentially been lost to her at the age of fourteen, and she hadn\u2019t seen him again until he was a grown man\u2014and a Mohawk. I\u2019d seen her now and then, gazing at him as he talked and ate, with a small inward glow on her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I poked gingerly through the pile of remnants. Marsali\u2019s cauldron had survived unscathed, though covered with soot. A few pewter plates, one half melted\u2014the wooden ones had all burned\u2014and a stack of Bibles, rescued from the front room by some pious soul. A line of washing had been hung out across the alley; what clothes were on it had all survived, though a couple of Fergus\u2019s shirts and Joanie\u2019s pinafore had been badly singed. I supposed boiling with lye soap might get the stink of fire out of the clothes, but I doubted that any of the family would wear them again.</p><p>Clarence, having finished his hay, was methodically rubbing his forehead against the top rail of his gate, making it rattle and thump.</p><p>\u201cItchy, are you?\u201d I scratched him, then poked my head out of the stable. Jamie was still in conversation with Mr. Phillips at the mouth of the alley, though, and I went back to my explorations.</p><p>Under a pile of smoke-stained playscripts I found Marsali\u2019s small chiming clock, somehow miraculously intact. It had stopped, of course, but emitted one small, sweet silver bing! when I picked it up, making me smile.</p> <p>Perhaps that was a good omen for the journey. And, after all, even if Jamie and I\u2014and Rachel and Ian\u2014were to set out at once for Fraser\u2019s Ridge, there was no chance of reaching the mountains of North Carolina before snow had closed the passes for the winter. It would be March, at the earliest, before we could turn inland.</p><p>I sighed, clock in hand, envisioning the Ridge in springtime. It would be a good time to arrive, the weather good for planting and building. I could wait.</p><p>I heard Jamie\u2019s steps come down the cobbled alley and stop. Stepping to the open front of the stable, I saw that he\u2019d paused at the place where Henri-Christian had died. He stood unmoving for a moment, then crossed himself and turned.</p><p>The solemnity left his face as he saw me, and he held up a small leather bag, smiling.</p><p>\u201cLook, Sassenach!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the Phillips boys found it, scavenging about, and brought it to his father. Hold out your hands.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, I did so, and he tilted the bag, decanting a small cascade of surprisingly heavy dark-gray chunks of lead\u2014the type for a complete set of . . . I picked one out and squinted at it. \u201cCaslon English Roman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than that, Sassenach,\u201d he said, and, plucking the letter \u201cQ\u201d from the pile in my hand, he dug his thumbnail into the soft metal, revealing a faint yellow gleam. \u201cMarsali\u2019s hoard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, it is! I\u2019d forgotten all about it.\u201d At the height of the British occupation, when Fergus had been obliged to leave home to avoid arrest, sleeping in a different place each night, Marsali had cast a set of type in gold, carefully rubbing each slug with grease, soot, and ink, and had carried the pouch under her apron, in case she and the children should be likewise forced to flee.</p><p>\u201cSo did Marsali, I expect.\u201d His smile faded a bit, thinking of the causes of Marsali\u2019s distraction. \u201cShe\u2019d buried it under the bricks of the hearth\u2014I suppose when the army left. Sam Phillips found it when they were pulling down the chimney.\u201d He nodded toward the charred spot where the printshop had stood. The chimney had been damaged by the wall falling in, so a number of men had taken it down, neatly stacking the bricks, most of which were intact despite the fire and could be sold.</p> <p>I poured the type carefully back into the pouch and glanced over my shoulder at Clarence.</p><p>\u201cI suppose a goldsmith could make me a set of really big acupuncture needles. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>SQUID OF THE EVENING, BEAUTIFUL SQUID</p><p>Charleston, Royal Colony of South Carolina</p><p>LORD JOHN AND HIS niece, Dorothea, ate that night at a small ordinary near the shore, whose air was redolent with the luscious scents of baked fish, eels in wine sauce, and small whole squid, fried crisply in cornmeal. John inhaled deeply with pleasure, handed Dottie to a stool, and sat down himself, enjoying the moment of gustatory indecision.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that moment when you can convincingly imagine the delightful prospect of eating everything the establishment has to offer,\u201d he told Dottie. \u201cMomentarily untroubled by the knowledge that one\u2019s stomach has a limited capacity and thus one must, alas, choose in the end.\u201d</p><p>Dottie looked a little dubious, but, thus urged, she took a deep sniff of the atmosphere, to which the scent of fresh-baked bread had just been added as the serving maid came in with a great loaf and a dish of butter with a four-leafed clover\u2014this being the name of the establishment\u2014stamped into its oleaginous surface.</p><p>\u201cOh, that smells wonderful!\u201d she said, her face lighting. \u201cMight I have some, please? And a glass of cider?\u201d</p> <p>He was pleased to see her nibble hungrily at the bread and take a deep breath of the cider\u2014which was aromatic enough to challenge even the squid, his own reluctantly final choice, though this was accompanied by a dozen fresh-shucked oysters to fill whatever crevices might remain. Dottie had chosen the baked hake, though she had only picked at it so far.</p><p>\u201cI came down to the harbor this afternoon while you were resting,\u201d he said, tearing off a wodge of bread to counteract the grated horseradish mixed with the oysters\u2019 brine. \u201cI asked about and found two or three small boats whose owners are not averse to a quick journey to Savannah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow quick?\u201d she asked warily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s little more than a hundred miles by water,\u201d he said, shrugging in what he hoped was a casual manner. \u201cPerhaps two days, with a good wind and fair weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Dottie cast a skeptical glance at the ordinary\u2019s shuttered window. The shutters trembled to a blast of rain and wind. \u201cIt\u2019s October, Uncle John. The weather is seldom predictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know? Madam\u2014might I have some vinegar for the squid?\u201d The proprietor\u2019s wife nodded, bustling off, and he repeated, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur landlady\u2019s son is a fisherman. So was her husband. He died in a gale\u2014last October,\u201d she finished sweetly, and popped the last bite of bread into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSuch squeamish prudence is unlike you, Dottie,\u201d he remarked, accepting the vinegar bottle from the proprietress and sousing his crisp squidlings. \u201cOh, God,\u201d he said, chewing. \u201cAmbrosia. Here\u2014have one.\u201d He speared one with his fork and passed it across to her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well . . .\u201d She regarded the squid-laden fork with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. \u201cHow long would it take to travel overland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps four or five days. Again, with good weather.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, lifted the squid to her mouth, hesitated, and then, with the air of a Roman gladiator facing an oncoming crocodile in the arena, put it into her mouth and chewed. She went white.</p><p>\u201cDottie!\u201d He leapt up, knocking his stool over, and managed to catch her as she wilted toward the floor.</p><p>\u201cGah,\u201d she said faintly, and, lunging out of his arms, bolted for the door, retching. He followed and was in time to hold her head as she lost the bread, cider, and the half-chewed squid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said a few moments later, as he emerged from the ordinary with a mug and a damp cloth. She was leaning against the most sheltered wall of the building, wrapped in his cloak, and was the color of spoiled suet pudding. \u201cHow disgusting of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink nothing of it,\u201d he said amiably. \u201cI\u2019ve done just the same for all three of your brothers, on occasion\u2014though I somehow doubt from the same cause. How long have you known you were with child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI became certain of it about five minutes ago,\u201d she said, swallowing audibly and shuddering. \u201cDear Lord, I will never eat squid again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you ever eaten squid before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never want to see another squid. Bother, my mouth tastes of sick.\u201d</p><p>John, who was indeed experienced in such matters, handed her the mug of beer.</p><p>\u201cRinse your mouth with that,\u201d he said. \u201cThen drink the rest. It will settle your stomach.\u201d</p><p>She looked dubious at this but did as he said, and emerged from the cup still pale but much improved.</p><p>\u201cBetter? Good. I don\u2019t suppose you want to go back inside? No, of course not. Let me pay, and I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d Inside, he asked the landlady to make up a parcel of their abandoned supper\u2014he didn\u2019t mind eating cold fried squid, but he did want to eat; he was starving\u2014and held this carefully to windward as they walked back to their lodgings.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cI\u2019ve often wondered about that. Some women have told me they knew at once, and yet I\u2019ve heard of others who somehow remained oblivious to their condition until the moment of birth was upon them, incredible as that seems.\u201d</p><p>Dottie laughed; the cold wind had brought some of the color back to her cheeks, and he was relieved to see her spirits recovered.</p><p>\u201cDo lots of women discuss their intimacies with you, Uncle John? That seems somewhat unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to attract unusual women,\u201d he said, rather ruefully. \u201cI also seem to have the sort of face that people feel compelled to tell things to. In another age, perhaps I should have been a confessor, if that\u2019s the word. But returning to the point\u201d\u2014he took her elbow to guide her round a large pile of horse droppings\u2014\u201cnow that you do know . . . what shall we do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything actually needs to be done for about eight months,\u201d she said, and he gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d he said. \u201cI doubt you wish to establish residence in Charleston until after your child arrives. Do you wish to return to Philadelphia\u2014or New Jersey, or whatever godforsaken place Denzell happens to be at the moment\u2014or shall I make arrangements to proceed to Savannah and remain there for some time? Or\u2014\u201d Another thought struck him, and he altered the look to one of seriousness.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go home, Dottie? To England, I mean. To your mother?\u201d</p><p>Her face went blank with surprise, which gave way to a look of longing that broke his heart. She looked away, blinking back tears, but her voice was steady when she turned back to him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and swallowed. \u201cI want to be with Denzell. All other considerations aside,\u201d she added, managing a smile, \u201che knows how to deliver a baby. His cousin William is accoucheur to the Queen, and Denny studied with him for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that will be helpful,\u201d Grey agreed, rather dryly. He had himself delivered a child once\u2014completely against his will\u2014and still had nightmares about it.</p><p>It was just as well that Dottie didn\u2019t want to return to England, though. He\u2019d suggested the notion on impulse but now realized that it might be more dangerous than any of the other alternatives. Since France had entered the war, all English shipping would be at risk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking that we ought to go to Savannah, though,\u201d Dottie was saying. \u201cWe\u2019re so close, I mean\u2014and if Ben\u2019s wife is there . . . she might need our help, mightn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed reluctantly. There was a familial obligation. And, after all, unless he did take up residence in Charleston for the next eight months, there seemed no alternative to Dottie\u2019s traveling, in whichever direction. Still . . . the thought of her giving birth here, him responsible for finding midwives and nurses . . . and then she and the child would need to be transported . . .</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, more definitely. \u201cAmaranthus\u2014assuming she does exist\u2014will have to muddle on by herself a little longer. I\u2019m taking you back to New York.\u201d</p><p>THE OGLETHORPE PLAN</p><p>Late November</p><p>SAVANNAH, UNLIKE MOST American cities, had been carefully planned by its founder, a man named Oglethorpe. I knew this because Mrs. Landrum, the woman from whom we rented our room, had explained to me that the city was laid out according to \u201cthe Oglethorpe plan\u201d\u2014this spoken in portentous tones, for Mrs. Landrum was a relative of the aforesaid Oglethorpe and intensely proud of the city and its civic perfection.</p><p>The plan called for six wards\u2014a ward being composed of four civic blocks\u2014for business, and four \u201ctything\u201d blocks for houses, these arrayed around an open square. There were ten houses to a block, and the men of a tything trained together for militia duty.</p><p>\u201cThough that\u2019s not so important now as it used to be,\u201d Mrs. Landrum explained to me. \u201cThe Indians are still a bother in the backcountry, but it\u2019s years since they troubled to come into the city.\u201d</p><p>I rather thought Indians were the least of it, but as Mrs. Landrum didn\u2019t seem concerned about the war with the British, I didn\u2019t bring it up. It was apparent from her references that as not only her family but everyone she knew were Loyalists, plainly this was the proper state of things, and pesky nuisances like this \u201crebellion, as they\u2019re pleased to call it!\u201d would soon be put down and we could get tea at a decent price again.</p><p>From my point of view, the most interesting thing about Mr. Oglethorpe\u2019s plan\u2014in the course of conversation, it was revealed to me that he\u2019d founded not only Savannah but the whole Province of Georgia\u2014was that each house of a tything was provided with a one-mile tract of farmland outside the city and a five-acre kitchen garden closer in.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I said, my fingers beginning to itch at the thought of dirt. \u201cEr . . . what do you plant?\u201d</p><p>The upshot of this conversation\u2014and many like it\u2014was that I made an arrangement to help with the keeping of the kitchen garden in return for a share of \u201csass\u201d (as Mrs. Landrum puzzlingly referred to green stuff like kale and turnips), beans, and dried corn, as well as a small plot where I could cultivate medicinal herbs. A secondary consequence of this amiable acquaintance was that Rachel and Ian, whose room was below ours, began referring to their unborn child as Oglethorpe, though this was politely shortened to \u201cOggy\u201d whenever Mrs. Landrum was in hearing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And the third and most important effect of Mrs. Landrum\u2019s friendship was that I found myself once more a doctor.</p><p>We had been in Savannah for a few weeks when Mrs. Landrum came up to our room one afternoon and inquired as to whether I might know anything regarding cures for the toothache, she knowing that I had a way with herbs?</p><p>\u201cOh, I might,\u201d I replied, with a surreptitious glance at my medical bag, which had been gathering dust under the bed since our arrival. \u201cWhose tooth is it?\u201d</p><p>The tooth had belonged to a gentleman named Murphy from Ellis Ward, the one we lived in. I say \u201chad belonged\u201d because I had the badly broken and infected bicuspid out of Mr. Murphy\u2019s head before he could have said Jack Robinson, though he was in such pain that he could barely recall his own name, let alone Jack\u2019s.</p> <p>Mr. Murphy was extremely grateful for his deliverance. Mr. Murphy was also the owner of a very small vacant shop on the other side of Ellis Square. It was the work of a few moments to acquire a small shingle with TEETH EXTRACTED on it. And within twenty-four hours of hanging out my shingle, I was proudly depositing my earnings on the kitchen table\u2014which was also my herbal-preparations counter and Jamie\u2019s desk, as it occupied the center of our single room.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Sassenach!\u201d Jamie picked up a small jar of honey, taken in payment for a nastily impacted wisdom tooth. He loved honey. I\u2019d also acquired two large speckled turkey eggs (one of them filled the entire palm of my hand), a loaf of reasonably fresh sourdough bread, six pennies, and a small silver Spanish coin.</p><p>\u201cI think ye could support the family all on your own, a nighean,\u201d he said, dipping a finger in the honey and licking it before I could stop him. \u201cIan and Fergus and I can all retire and become gentlemen of leisure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You can start by making supper,\u201d I said, stretching my back. Stays did keep you upright through a long day\u2019s work, but I was looking forward to taking them off, eating supper, and lying down, in quick succession.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sassenach.\u201d With a small flourish, he drew the knife from his belt, cut a slice off the loaf, drizzled honey on it, and gave it to me. \u201cThere ye are.\u201d</p> <p>I raised an eyebrow at him but bit into it. Sweetness flooded my mouth and my bloodstream simultaneously, and I tasted sunlight and flowers. I moaned.</p><p>\u201cWhat did ye say, Sassenach?\u201d He was busily buttering another slice.</p><p>\u201cI said, \u2018Well done,\u2019\u201d I said, and picked up the pot of honey. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a cook of you yet.\u201d</p><p>THE BASIC ISSUES of housing and food taken care of, plainly the next order of business was to retrieve Bonnie. Jamie had located the Bell family, and three weeks after our arrival in Savannah, he and Fergus had scraped together enough money to hire a cart and an extra mule from the livery stable where Clarence boarded. We met Richard Bell in the morning, and he came with us to the farm of one Zachary Simpson, the farmer with whom Bonnie boarded.</p><p>Mr. Simpson cleared away the last of the hay and pulled away the canvas with the air of a magician producing a rabbit from a hat. From the reaction of three-quarters of his spectators, you\u2019d think he had: Jamie and Fergus both gasped audibly, and Richard Bell emitted a hum of satisfaction. I bit my lip and tried not to laugh, but I doubted they\u2019d have noticed if I\u2019d rolled on the floor in paroxysms of mirth.</p><p>\u201cNom de Dieu,\u201d Fergus said, stretching out a reverent hand. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBest I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Mr. Bell agreed, clearly torn between regard and regret.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Jamie was pink with pleasure, trying visibly to retain a modest constraint. \u201cAye. She\u2019s bonnie, no?\u201d</p><p>I supposed \u201cshe\u201d was\u2014if one was a connoisseur of printing presses, which I wasn\u2019t. Still, I confessed some fondness for Bonnie; we\u2019d met before, in Edinburgh. Jamie had been oiling some part of her mechanism when I\u2019d returned to find him after twenty years, and she had been witness to our reunion.</p><p>And she had withstood the rigors of disassembly, sea travel, reassembly, and months of being immured in a barn with commendable fortitude. A pale winter sun shone through a crack in the barn\u2019s wall, making her wood glow with somber pride, and her metal was\u2014so far as I could see\u2014quite free from rust.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d I said, giving her a small pat. Mr. Simpson was modestly accepting the applause of the crowd for his feat of preserving Bonnie from harm, and I could see that they\u2019d be some time in getting her onto the cart we\u2019d brought, so I made my way back to the farmhouse. I\u2019d noticed a number of chickens scratching in the yard and had some hopes of acquiring fresh eggs.</p><p>Marsali\u2019s hoard\u2014and Jenny\u2019s novena to St. Bride, Queen of the Sea, plus a modest assist from my acupuncture needles (Clarence luckily proved a good sailor)\u2014had got us safely to Savannah, but the requirements of housing ten people and renting premises suitable for a small printing business had exhausted both the Caslon English Roman gold and the insurance money paid to Fergus for the fire\u2019s destruction.</p><p>With the need for income somewhat acute, Ian and Jamie had found employment at one of the warehouses on the river. A wise choice, as it turned out: in addition to their pay and the odd damaged cask of salt fish or biscuit, being on the docks all day allowed them first\u2014and cheapest\u2014choice from the fishermen coming in with their catch. We therefore hadn\u2019t been starving nor yet threatened with scurvy\u2014the climate was mild enough that plenty of green things grew, even in late November\u2014but I was getting tired of rice and fish and winter kale. A nice dish of scrambled eggs, now . . . possibly with fresh butter . . .</p><p>I\u2019d come equipped for trading, with several packets of pins and a bag of salt, and Mrs. Simpson and I amicably concluded a bargain for a basket of eggs and a small tub of butter before the men had got Bonnie out of the barn and were sat on the back stoop, comfortably drinking beer.</p> <p>\u201cWhat remarkable chickens those are,\u201d I said, stifling a small belch. The beer, of Mrs. Simpson\u2019s own production, was tasty but strong. The chickens in question were more than remarkable: they appeared to have no legs but to be trundling round the yard on their bottom sides, pecking at their corn with cheerful imperturbability.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye,\u201d said Mrs. Simpson, nodding with pride. \u201cMy mother brought those\u2014well, their great-great-grandmothers\u2014with her from Scotland, thirty years a-gone. \u2018Creepies,\u2019 she always called them\u2014but they\u2019ve got a true name. Scots Dumpy, it is, or so a gentleman from Glasgow told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very appropriate,\u201d I said, taking another sip of beer and peering at the chickens. They did after all have legs; just very short ones.</p><p>\u201cI breed them for sale,\u201d Mrs. Simpson added helpfully. \u201cIf might should be ye should find yourself in want of a good hen or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d like better,\u201d I said wistfully. The rice paddies and palmettos of Savannah seemed infinitely far away from the clean sharp air of Fraser\u2019s Ridge . . . but we were in the South, at least. And come March and good traveling weather, Marsali and Fergus should be safely established, and we could turn our faces toward North Carolina. \u201cPerhaps in a few months . . .\u201d I added Scots Dumpy chickens to the mental list I was accumulating and returned to the beer.</p><p>The men had got the printing press onto the cart, suitably swathed in canvas and repacked with straw for the journey into town, and now came into the house to resume their own well-earned refreshment.</p><p>We sat companionably round Mrs. Simpson\u2019s scrubbed kitchen table, drinking beer and eating salted radishes. Jamie and Fergus were glowing with excitement and satisfaction; the looks on their faces warmed me more than the beer. Poor Richard Bell was trying his best to be generous and share their delight, but it was plain that he was low in both body and spirit.</p><p>I had met him only a few days before, and that briefly, so had not yet cultivated an acquaintance sufficient as to allow me to make him undress and let me palpate his liver, but I was morally certain that the \u201crelapsing ague\u201d Mrs. Bell had written of was malaria. I couldn\u2019t say so with complete certainty without looking at his blood cells under a microscope\u2014and God knew when I might ever have one again\u2014but I\u2019d seen enough people suffering from \u201cthe quartan ague\u201d or \u201cthe tertian fever\u201d as to have little doubt.</p><p>Luckily, I had a small supply of Jesuit bark among the selection of herbs and medicines I\u2019d brought with me. It wouldn\u2019t cure him, but I could, with luck, limit the more-severe attacks and relieve some of the symptoms. Thinking of this reminded me suddenly of Lizzie Wemyss. Coming to America as Brianna\u2019s bond servant, she also had contracted malaria from the coastal mosquitoes. I\u2019d managed to control the disease in her fairly well, but how had she fared in my absence?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d My attention was jerked back to the conversation, but I added LOTS of Jesuit bark to my mental list before replying.</p><p>PLUMBING</p><p>LIKE PLUMBING, MEDICINE is a profession where you learn early on not to put your fingers in your mouth. I smelled my next patient coming and was reaching for the jar of soft soap and the bottle of raw alcohol before she came through the door. And the instant I saw her, I knew what the problem was.</p><p>There were two women, in fact: one was a tall, rather commanding-looking woman, well dressed and wearing a hat rather than the usual bonnet. The other was a small, slight girl who might have been any age between twelve and twenty. She was what they called a mulatto, half black and half white, with caf\u00e9 au lait skin and snub features. I set her lower age limit at twelve only because she had apparent br**sts bubbling over the top of her stays. She was dressed neatly but plainly in blue gingham, and she stank like an open sewer.</p><p>The tall woman paused, looking me over consideringly.</p><p>\u201cYou are a female physician?\u201d she asked, in a tone just short of accusation.</p><p>\u201cI am Dr. Fraser, yes,\u201d I replied equably. \u201cAnd you are . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She flushed at that and looked disconcerted. Also very dubious. But after an awkward pause, she made up her mind and gave a sharp nod. \u201cI am Sarah Bradshaw. Mrs. Phillip Bradshaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you. And your . . . companion?\u201d I nodded at the young woman, who stood with her shoulders hunched and her head bent, staring at the ground. I could hear a soft dripping noise, and she shifted as though trying to press her legs together, wincing as she did so.</p><p>\u201cThis is Sophronia. One of my husband\u2019s slaves.\u201d Mrs. Bradshaw\u2019s lips compressed and drew in tight; from the lines surrounding her mouth, she did it routinely. \u201cShe\u2014that is\u2014I thought perhaps\u2014\u201d Her rather plain face flamed crimson; she couldn\u2019t bring herself to describe the trouble.</p><p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d I said, saving her the difficulty. I came round the table and took Sophronia by the hand; hers was small and very callused, but her fingernails were clean. A house slave, then. \u201cWhat happened to the baby?\u201d I asked her gently.</p><p>A small, frightened intake of breath, and she glanced sideways at Mrs. Bradshaw, who gave her another sharp nod, lips still pursed.</p><p>\u201cIt died in me,\u201d the girl said, so softly I could scarcely hear her, even though she was no more than an arm\u2019s length from me. \u201cDey cut it out in pieces.\u201d That had likely saved the girl\u2019s life, but it surely hadn\u2019t helped her condition.</p><p>Despite the smell, I took a deep breath, trying to keep my emotions under control.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to examine Sophronia, Mrs. Bradshaw. If you have any errands, perhaps you\u2019d like to go and take care of them . . . ?\u201d</p><p>She unzipped her lips sufficiently as to make a small, frustrated noise. Quite obviously, she would like nothing better than to leave the girl and never come back. But just as obviously, she was afraid of what the slave might tell me if left alone with me.</p><p>\u201cWas the child your husband\u2019s?\u201d I asked baldly. I didn\u2019t have time to beat around the bush; the poor girl was dripping urine and fecal matter on the floor and appeared ready to die of shame.</p><p>I doubted that Mrs. Bradshaw meant to die of that condition, but she plainly felt it almost as acutely as did Sophronia. She went white with shock, then her face flamed anew. She turned on her heel and stamped out, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a \u2018yes,\u2019 then,\u201d I said to the door, and turned to the girl, smiling in reassurance. \u201cHere, sweetheart. Let\u2019s have a look at the trouble, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Vesicovaginal fistula and rectovaginal fistula. I\u2019d known that from the first moment; I just didn\u2019t know how bad they might be or how far up the vaginal canal they\u2019d occurred. A fistula is a passage between two things that ought never to be joined and is, generally speaking, a bad thing.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a common condition in civilized countries in the twentieth century but more common than one might think. I\u2019d seen it several times in Boston, at a clinic where I gave time once a week to provide medical care to the city\u2019s poor. Young girls, much too young to be considering the opposite sex in any serious way, becoming pregnant before their bodies had ripened enough. Prostitutes, some of them. Others just girls who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Like this one.</p><p>A full-term baby that couldn\u2019t be forced out through the birth canal, and days of nonproductive labor, the child\u2019s head a battering ram against the tissues of the pelvis, the bladder, the vagina, and the bowel. Until at last the tissues thinned and split, leaving a ragged hole between bladder and vagina, or between vagina and rectum, allowing the body\u2019s waste to drip out unhindered through the vagina.</p><p>Not a matter of life or death, but revolting, uncontrollable, and bloody uncomfortable, too. Sophronia\u2019s inner thighs were swollen, a bright, patchy red, the skin macerated by the constant wetness, the irritating fecal slime. Like a permanent diaper rash, I thought, suppressing a deeply visceral urge to find Mr. Bradshaw and make a few fistulas in him with a blunt probe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I talked to her while I made my examinations, soothingly, and after a little she began to answer me, though still in whispers. She was thirteen. Yes, Mr. Bradshaw had took her to his bed. She hadn\u2019t minded. He said his wife was mean to him, and she was\u2014all the slaves knew it. Mr. Bradshaw had been nice to her, gentle-like, and when she fell pregnant, he\u2019d taken her from the laundry and put her to kitchen work, where she\u2019d have good food and wouldn\u2019t have to break her back with the heavy linens.</p><p>\u201cHe was sad,\u201d she said softly, looking up at the ceiling while I wiped away the filthy trickle between her legs. \u201cWhen the baby died. He cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he,\u201d I said, in what I hoped was a neutral voice. I folded a clean towel and pressed it between her legs, throwing the wet one she\u2019d been wearing into my bucket of vinegar and water. \u201cWhen did the baby die\u2014how long ago, I mean?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, the expression barely rippling the pure young skin of her forehead. Could she count? I wondered.</p> <p>\u201cBe some time before the sausage-makin\u2019,\u201d she said uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cIn the fall, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYessum.\u201d</p><p>And it was mid-December now. I poured water over my dirty hand and dribbled a bit of soap into my palm. I really must try to get a nailbrush, I thought.</p><p>Mrs. Bradshaw had come back but hadn\u2019t come in; I\u2019d pulled the curtains over the front window, but her shadowed outline was plain on the cloth, the jaunty feathers in her hat stuck up like a silhouette cowlick.</p> <p>I tapped my foot thoughtfully, then shook myself into order and went to open the door.</p><p>\u201cI might be able to help,\u201d I said without preamble, startling the woman.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d She blinked at me, and, taken unawares, her face was open, troubled but without the pinched look she\u2019d worn earlier.</p><p>\u201cCome inside,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here in the wind,\u201d and guided her in, a hand on her back. She was very thin; I could feel the knobs of her spine, even through her coat and stays.</p><p>Sophronia was sitting on the table, hands folded in her lap; when her mistress came in, she bent her head, looking at the floor again.</p><p>I explained the nature of the difficulty, so well as I could\u2014neither of them had any grasp of internal anatomy at all; it was simply a matter of holes to them. Still, I managed to get the general point across.</p> <p>\u201cYou know that a wound can be stitched, to hold the skin together while it heals?\u201d I said patiently. \u201cWell, this is much the same kind of thing, but made much harder by the wounds being inside and the tissues being very thin and slippery. It would be very difficult to mend\u2014I\u2019m not sure I can do it\u2014but it is at least possible to try.\u201d</p><p>It was\u2014just. In the late nineteenth century, a physician named J. Marion Sims had more or less invented the entire practice of gynecological surgery, in order to address exactly this condition. It had taken him years to develop the techniques, and I knew them\u2014had done the procedure more than once. The catch was that you really needed good, solid anesthesia in order to have a chance of success. Laudanum or whisky might answer for cruder, swifter operations, but for painstakingly delicate surgery like this, the patient had to be completely unconscious and immobile. I would have to have ether.</p><p>I had no idea how I was going to make ether, living in a small rented house with a number of people whom I really didn\u2019t want to risk blowing to bits. And the thought of what flammable ether could do\u2014had done\u2014made me break out in a cold sweat. But seeing the faint hope rise in both their faces, I made up my mind to do it.</p><p>I gave Sophronia a small jar of beeswax ointment for the skin of her thighs and told them to come back in a week; I would know then whether it was possible. I saw them out, and as they went away down the street, Mrs. Bradshaw reached out unconsciously and touched Sophronia\u2019s shoulder in a brief caress of reassurance.</p><p>I took a deep breath and resolved that I would find a way. Turning to go inside, I glanced the other way down the street and saw a tall young man whose lean ranginess struck me with a sense of instant recognition. I blinked once, and imagination promptly clothed him in scarlet.</p><p>\u201cWilliam!\u201d I called, and, picking up my skirts, ran after him.</p><p>HE DIDN\u2019T HEAR me at first, and I had time for doubt\u2014but not much; the set of head and shoulders, that long, decisive stride . . . He was thinner than Jamie, and his hair was a dark chestnut, not red, but he had his father\u2019s bones. And his eyes: hearing me at last, he turned, and those dark-blue cat eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>\u201cMother Cl\u2014\u201d He cut the word off, his face hardening, but I reached out and took his big hand between my own (rather hoping that I had got all of the slime off).</p> <p>\u201cWilliam,\u201d I said, panting just a bit, but smiling up at him. \u201cYou can call me what you like, but I\u2019m no less\u2014and no more\u2014to you than I ever was.\u201d</p><p>His severe look softened a little at that, and he ducked his head awkwardly.</p><p>\u201cI think I must call you Mrs. Fraser, mustn\u2019t I?\u201d He detached his hand, though gently. \u201cHow do you come to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might ask the same of you\u2014and perhaps with more reason. Where\u2019s your uniform?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve resigned my commission,\u201d he said, a little stiffly. \u201cUnder the circumstances, there seemed little point to my remaining in the army. And I have business that requires somewhat more independence of movement than I should have as one of Sir Henry\u2019s aides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come and have something hot to drink with me? You can tell me about your business.\u201d I\u2019d rushed out without my cloak, and a chilly breeze was fingering me with more intimacy than I liked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He caught himself, frowning, then looked at me thoughtfully and rubbed a finger down the long, straight bridge of his nose, just as Jamie did when making up his mind. And just as Jamie did, he dropped his hand and nodded briefly as though to himself.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, rather gruffly. \u201cIn fact, my business may be of some . . . importance to you.\u201d</p><p>Another five minutes saw us in an ordinary off Ellis Square, drinking hot cider, rich with cinnamon and nutmeg. Savannah wasn\u2019t\u2014thank God\u2014Philadelphia, in terms of nasty winter weather, but the day was cold and windy, and the pewter cup was delightfully warm in my hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat does bring you here, then, Willie? Or should I call you William now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam, please,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only name I feel is rightfully mine, for the moment. I should like to preserve what small dignity I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I said noncommittally. \u201cWilliam it is, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for my business . . .\u201d He sighed briefly and rubbed a knuckle between his brows. He then explained about his cousin Ben, Ben\u2019s wife and child, then Denys Randall, and finally\u2014Captain Ezekiel Richardson. That name made me sit up straight.</p><p>He noticed my reaction and nodded, grimacing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I meant when I said my business might have some relevance to you. Pa\u2014Lord John said that it was Richardson\u2019s threatening to arrest you as a spy that caused him to, er, marry you.\u201d He flushed a little.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d I said, trying not to recall the occasion. In fact, I recalled only snatches of those empty, glaring days when I\u2019d believed Jamie to be dead. One of those snatches, though, was a vivid recollection of standing in the parlor of Number 17, holding a bouquet of white roses, with John beside me and a military chaplain with a book before us\u2014and, standing on John\u2019s other side, grave and handsome, William in his captain\u2019s uniform and shining gorget, looking so like Jamie that I felt for a dizzying instant that Jamie\u2019s ghost had come to watch. Unable to decide whether to faint or to run out of the room shrieking, I\u2019d simply stood frozen, until John had nudged me gently, whispering in my ear, and I\u2019d blurted out, \u201cI do,\u201d and collapsed on the ottoman, flowers spilling from my hands.</p><p>Caught up in the memory, I\u2019d missed what William was saying and shook my head, trying to focus.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for him for the last three months,\u201d he said, putting down his cup and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s an elusive scoundrel. And I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s in Savannah at all, for that matter. But the last hint I had of him was in Charleston, and he left there three weeks ago, heading south.</p><p>\u201cNow, for all I know, the fellow\u2019s bound for Florida or has already taken ship for England. On the other hand . . . Amaranthus is here, or at least I believe so. Richardson seems to take an inordinate interest in the Grey family and its connections, so perhaps . . . Do you know Denys Randall yourself, by the way?\u201d</p><p>He was looking at me intently over his cup, and I realized, with a faint sense of amusement mingled with outrage, that he had thrown the name at me suddenly in hopes of surprising any guilty knowledge I might have.</p><p>Why, you little scallywag, I thought, amusement getting the upper hand. You need a bit more practice before you can pull off that sort of thing, my lad.</p><p>I did in fact know something about Denys Randall that William almost certainly didn\u2019t know\u2014and that Denys Randall himself might not know\u2014but it wasn\u2019t information that would shed any light on the whereabouts and motives of Ezekiel Richardson.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him,\u201d I said, quite truthfully, and held up my cup toward the serving maid for more cider. \u201cI used to know his mother, Mary Hawkins; we met in Paris. A lovely, sweet girl, but I\u2019ve had no contact with her for the last . . . thirty . . . no, thirty-four years. I assume from what you tell me that she married a Mr. Isaacs\u2014you said he was a Jewish merchant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So Randall said\u2014and I can\u2019t see why he\u2019d lie about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor can I. But what you do know\u2014you think,\u201d I corrected, \u201cis that while Denys Randall and Ezekiel Richardson have heretofore appeared to be working together, now they aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>William shrugged, impatient.</p><p>\u201cSo far as I know. I haven\u2019t seen Randall since he warned me about Richardson, but I haven\u2019t seen Richardson, either.\u201d</p><p>I could sense his rising desire to be up and off; he was drumming his fingers softly on the tabletop, and the table itself shuddered slightly when his leg bumped it.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying, William?\u201d I asked impulsively, before he could go. \u201cIn\u2014in case I do see Richardson. Or hear anything of Amaranthus, for that matter. I am a doctor; a lot of people come to see me, and everyone talks to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, but then gave another shrug, this one infinitesimal. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a room at Hendry\u2019s, on River Street.\u201d</p><p>He stood, tossed some money on the table, and extended a hand to help me up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying at Landrum\u2019s, one square over from the City Market,\u201d I said on impulse, rising. \u201cIf you should\u2014want to call. Or need help. Just in case, I mean.\u201d</p><p>His face had gone carefully blank, though his eyes were burning like match flames. I felt a chill, knowing from experience the sort of thing that was likely going on behind such a fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said politely. And, kissing my hand in brief farewell, he left.</p><p>GIGGING FROGS</p><p>December 22, 1778</p><p>JAMIE TOOK A FIRM grip of the back of Germain\u2019s shirt and beckoned with his free hand to Ian, who held the torch.</p><p>\u201cLook out over the water first, aye?\u201d Jamie whispered, lifting his chin at the black glitter of the submerged marsh. It was broken by clumps of waist-high cordgrass and smaller ones of needlerush, bright green in the torchlight. This was a deep spot, though, with two or three of what the natives of Savannah called \u201chammocks,\u201d though plainly they meant \u201chummock\u201d\u2014wee islands, with trees like wax myrtle and yaupon holly bushes, though these, too, were of a spiky nature, like everything else in a marsh save the frogs and fish.</p><p>Some of the spikier inhabitants of the marsh, though, were mobile and nothing you wanted to meet unexpectedly. Germain peered obediently into the darkness, his gigging spear held tight and high, poised for movement. Jamie could feel him tremble, partly from the chill but mostly, he thought, from excitement.</p><p>A sudden movement broke the surface of the water, and Germain lunged forward, plunging his gig into the water with a high-pitched yell.</p><p>Fergus and Jamie let out much deeper cries, each grabbing Germain by an arm and hauling him backward over the mud, as the irate cottonmouth he\u2019d nearly speared turned on him, lashing, yawning mouth flaring white.</p><p>But the snake luckily had business elsewhere and swam off with a peeved sinuosity. Ian, safely out of range, was laughing.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019s funny, do ye?\u201d said Germain, scowling in order to pretend he wasn\u2019t shaking.</p><p>\u201cAye, I do,\u201d his uncle assured him. \u201cBe even funnier if ye were eaten by an alligator, though. See there?\u201d He lifted the torch and pointed; ten feet away, there was a ripple in the water, between them and the nearest hammock. Germain frowned uncertainly at it, then turned his head to his grandfather.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an alligator? How d\u2019ye ken that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Jamie said. His own heart was pounding from the sight of the cottonmouth. Snakes unnerved him, but he wasn\u2019t scairt of alligators. Cautious, yes. Scairt, no. \u201cSee how the ripples come back from the island there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Germain squinted across the water. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose ripples are coming toward us side on. The one Ian\u2019s pointing at? It\u2019s coming at a right angle\u2014right toward us.\u201d</p><p>It was, though slowly.</p><p>\u201cAre alligators good to eat?\u201d Fergus asked, watching it thoughtfully. \u201cA good deal more meat on one than on a frog, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are, and there is, aye.\u201d Ian shifted his weight a little, gauging the distance. \u201cWe canna kill one of those wi\u2019 spears, though. I should have brought my bow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShould we . . . move?\u201d Germain asked doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cNay, see how big it is first,\u201d Ian said, fingering the long knife at his belt. He was wearing a breechclout, and his bare legs were long and steady as a heron\u2019s, standing mid-calf in the muddy water.</p><p>The four of them watched with great concentration as the ripple came on, paused, came on a little more, slowly.</p><p>\u201cAre they stunned by light, Ian?\u201d Jamie asked, low-voiced. Frogs were; they had maybe two dozen bullfrogs in their sack, surprised in the water and killed before they kent what hit them.</p> <p>\u201cI dinna think so,\u201d Ian whispered back. \u201cI\u2019ve not hunted one before, though.\u201d</p><p>There was a sudden gleam in the water, a scatter of ripples, and the glow of two small burning orbs, a demon\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cA Dhia!\u201d Jamie said, making a convulsive sign against evil. Fergus pulled Germain back farther, making a clumsy sign of the cross with his hook. Even Ian seemed taken back a bit; his hand fell from his knife and he stepped back toward the mud, not taking his eyes off the thing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wee one, I think,\u201d he said, reaching safety. \u201cSee, its eyes are nay bigger than my thumbnail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that matter, if it\u2019s possessed?\u201d Fergus asked, suspicious. \u201cEven if we were to kill it, we might be poisoned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I dinna think so,\u201d Jamie said. He could see it now as it hung motionless in the water, stubby clawed feet halfway drawn up. It was perhaps two feet long\u2014the toothy jaw maybe six inches. It could give you a nasty bite, nay more. But it wasn\u2019t close enough to reach.</p><p>\u201cKen what a wolf\u2019s eyes look like in the dark? Or a possum\u2019s?\u201d He\u2019d taken Fergus hunting, of course, when he was young, but seldom at night\u2014and such things as you\u2019d hunt at night in the Highlands were usually running from you, not looking at you.</p><p>Ian nodded, not taking his eyes off the small reptile.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s true. Wolves\u2019 eyes are usually green or yellow, but I\u2019ve seen them red like that sometimes, by torchlight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suppose that a wolf could be possessed by an evil spirit as easily as an alligator could,\u201d Fergus said, a little testily. It was clear, though, that he wasn\u2019t afraid of the thing, either, now that he\u2019d got a good look; they were all beginning to relax.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks we\u2019re stealing his frogs,\u201d Germain said, giggling. He was still holding the spear, and even as he spoke, he spotted something and slammed the three-tined sapling into the water with a whoop.</p> <p>\u201cI got it, I got it!\u201d he shouted, and splashed into the water, heedless of the alligator. He bent to see that his prey was firmly transfixed, let out another small whoop, and pulled up his spear, displaying a catfish of no mean size, belly showing white in its frantic flapping, blood running in trickles from the holes made by the tines.</p><p>\u201cMore meat on that than on yon wee lizard there, aye?\u201d Ian took the spear, pulled the fish off, and bashed its head with the hilt of his knife to kill it.</p><p>Everyone looked, but the alligator had departed, alarmed by the kerfuffle.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s us fettled, I think.\u201d Jamie picked up both bags\u2014one half full of bullfrogs, and the other still squirming slightly from the inclusion of a number of shrimp and crayfish netted from the shallows. He held open the one with the frogs for Ian to toss the fish inside, saying a verse from the Hunting Blessing, for Germain: \u201cThou shalt not eat fallen fish nor fallen flesh/ Nor one bird that thy hand shall not bring down/Be thou thankful for the one/ Though nine should be swimming.\u201d</p><p>Germain was not paying attention, though; he was standing quite still, fair hair lifting in the breeze, his head turned.</p><p>\u201cLook, Grand-p\u00e8re,\u201d he said, voice urgent. \u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>They all looked and saw the ships, far out beyond the marsh but coming in, heading for the small headland to the south. Seven, eight, nine . . . a dozen at least, with red lanterns at their masts, blue ones at the stern. Jamie felt the hair rise on his body and his blood go cold.</p><p>\u201cBritish men-of-war,\u201d Fergus said, his voice empty with shock.</p> <p>\u201cThey are,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cWe\u2019d best get home.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS ALMOST dawn before I felt Jamie slide into bed behind me, bringing chilled skin and the smell of brine, cold mud, and marsh plants with him. Also . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d I asked drowsily, kissing the arm he\u2019d put round me.</p><p>\u201cFrogs, I expect. God, ye\u2019re warm, Sassenach.\u201d He cuddled closer, pressing his body into mine, and I felt him pull loose the bow of the ribbon that gathered the neck of my shift.</p><p>\u201cGood hunting, then?\u201d I obligingly wiggled my bottom into the hollow of his thighs and he sighed in appreciation, his breath warm on my ear, and slipped a cold hand inside my shift. \u201cOoh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Germain caught a fine big catfish, and we brought back a sack of crawfish and shrimps\u2014the wee gray ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. We\u2019ll have a good supper, then.\u201d His temperature was quickly equalizing with mine, and I was drifting pleasantly back down toward sleep\u2014though quite willing to be roused for the right reasons.</p><p>\u201cWe saw a wee alligator. And a snake\u2014a water moccasin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t catch those, I hope.\u201d I knew that snakes and alligators were technically edible, but I didn\u2019t think we were quite hungry enough to make the challenges of cooking one worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cNo. Oh\u2014and a dozen British ships full of soldiers turned up, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ni\u2014What?\u201d I flipped over in his arms, ending face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cBritish soldiers,\u201d he repeated gently. \u201cDinna fash, Sassenach. I expect it will be all right. Fergus and I already hid the press, and we havena got any silver to bury. That\u2019s one thing to be said for poverty,\u201d he added reflectively, stroking my bottom. \u201cYe dinna need to fear bein\u2019 plundered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014what the bloody hell are they doing here?\u201d I rolled over and sat straight up in bed, pulling my shift up round my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye did say Pardloe told ye they meant to cut off the southern colonies, aye? I imagine they decided to start here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy here? Why not . . . Charleston? Or Norfolk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldna say, not being privy to the British councils of war,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cBut if I was to guess, I\u2019d say it\u2019s maybe that there are a good many troops already in Florida, and they\u2019ll be marching up to join this new lot. The Loyalists are thick as fleas on a dog all along the coast of the Carolinas; if the army\u2019s secured Florida and Georgia, they\u2019d be well placed to advance northward, picking up local support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have it all figured out, I see.\u201d I pressed my back against the wall\u2014there was no headboard\u2014and finished retying the ribbon of my shift. I didn\u2019t feel equal to meeting an invasion with my bosom uncovered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut there are only two things to do, Sassenach: stay or flee. It\u2019s the dead of winter in the mountains; we canna get through the passes \u2019til March, and I\u2019d rather not be stravaiging about the countryside with three bairns, two pregnant women, and nay money. And I doubt they\u2019ll burn the city, not if they mean it to be a base for invading the rest of the South.\u201d He reached up and ran a soothing hand down my shoulder and arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though ye\u2019ve not lived in an occupied city before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I said dubiously, but he did have a point. There were some advantages to the situation, the chief one being that if an army already held a city, they wouldn\u2019t be attacking it: no fighting in the streets. But, then . . . they didn\u2019t hold it yet.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, lass,\u201d he said softly, and twined a finger in my ribbon. \u201cDid I not tell ye when we wed, ye\u2019d have the protection of my body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d I admitted, and laid a hand over his. It was big, strong, and capable.</p><p>\u201cThen come lie wi\u2019 me, mo nighean donn, and let me prove it,\u201d he said, and pulled the ribbon loose.</p><p>FROG LEGS OF that size really did look quite like chicken drumsticks. And tasted very like, too, dredged in flour and egg with a little salt and pepper and fried.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it that the meat of strange animals is so often described as tasting like chicken?\u201d Rachel asked, neatly snaring another leg out from under her husband\u2019s reaching hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that of everything from catamount to alligator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it does,\u201d Ian answered, raising a brow at her and stabbing his fork into a platter of catfish chunks, similarly coated and fried.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want to be technical about it,\u201d I began, to a chorus of mingled groans and laughter. Before I could launch into an explanation of the biochemistry of muscle fiber, though, there was a rap on the door. We had been making so much noise over supper that I hadn\u2019t heard footsteps on the stair and was taken by surprise.</p><p>Germain popped up to open the door and gazed up in surprise at two Continental officers, in full uniform.</p><p>There was a general scraping of chairs as the men stood up, and Jamie stepped out from behind the table. He\u2019d been working in the warehouse all day, after hunting in the marshes half the night, and was not only barefoot but wearing a badly stained, grimy shirt and a faded plaid so worn that it was thin in spots. Still, no one would have doubted that he was the master of the house. When he inclined his head and said, \u201cGentlemen? Be welcome,\u201d both officers took off their hats, bowed, and came in, murmuring, \u201cYour servant, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeneral Fraser,\u201d the senior officer said, the title not quite a question, as he eyed Jamie\u2019s attire. \u201cI am Major General Robert Howe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never seen Major General Howe before, but I knew his companion, and my hand tightened on the bread knife. He was wearing a colonel\u2019s uniform now, and his face was as blandly forgettable as ever, but I wasn\u2019t likely to forget Captain Ezekiel Richardson\u2014lately a captain in His Majesty\u2019s army, last seen in Clinton\u2019s headquarters in Philadelphia.</p><p>\u201cYour humble servant, sir,\u201d Jamie said, in a tone quite belying the usual compliment. \u201cI am James Fraser but no longer an officer in any army. I have resigned my commission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand, sir.\u201d Howe\u2019s rather bulging eyes scanned the table, flicking past Jenny, Rachel, Marsali, and the little girls before settling on me. He gave a small nod of inward conviction and bowed to me. \u201cMrs. Fraser? I trust I see you well, ma\u2019am.\u201d Obviously, he\u2019d heard the story behind Jamie\u2019s dramatic resignation.</p><p>\u201cYou do, thank you,\u201d I said. \u201cDo watch out for the crayfish there, Colonel.\u201d For Richardson was standing just in front of the tin tub in which I\u2019d set the crayfish, covered with water and supplied with a few handfuls of cornmeal, with which they\u2019d purge their nasty little entrails over the next twenty-four hours and become safe to eat.</p><p>\u201cYour pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said politely, moving aside. Unlike Howe, he was chiefly concerned with the men; I saw his eyes touch for an instant on Fergus\u2019s hook, dismiss him, then rest on Ian, with an air of satisfaction. What Jamie called a cold grue went down my back. I knew already what they wanted; this was a high-level press gang.</p><p>Jamie recognized their purpose, too.</p><p>\u201cMy wife is well, thanks be to God, General. I expect she would like her husband to remain in that condition, too.\u201d</p><p>Well, that was fairly blunt. Howe evidently decided there was no point in further civilities and waded in directly.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware, sir, that a number of British troops have disembarked just outside the city and doubtless mean to invade and capture it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Jamie said patiently. \u201cI watched their ships come in last night. As for capturing the city, I think they\u2019re verra well placed to do just that. And if I were you, General\u2014and I thank the Lord that I\u2019m not\u2014I should be gatherin\u2019 my men this minute and marching out of the city wi\u2019 them. Ken the proverb about livin\u2019 to fight another day, do ye? I recommend it as a strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I understand you aright, sir?\u201d Richardson put in, his tone edgy. \u201cYou decline to join in the defense of your own city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we do,\u201d Ian put in before Jamie could answer. He eyed the visitors in an unfriendly way, and I saw his right hand drop to his side, reaching for Rollo\u2019s head, then his fingers curl up tight, missing it. \u201cIt\u2019s no our city and we\u2019re no disposed to die for it.\u201d</p><p>I was sitting next to Rachel and felt her shoulders lose a little of their tension. Across the table, Marsali\u2019s eyes slid sideways, meeting Fergus\u2019s, and I saw a moment of silent marital communication and accord. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know who we are, don\u2019t tell them.\u201d</p><p>Howe, a rather thickset man, opened and closed his mouth several times before finding words.</p><p>\u201cI am appalled, sir,\u201d he managed finally, his face quite red. \u201cAppalled,\u201d he repeated, his second chin quivering with outrage\u2014and, I thought, no little desperation. \u201cThat a man known for his bravery in battle, his constancy to the cause of freedom, would cravenly submit to the rule of the bloody tyrant!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA choice little short of treason,\u201d Richardson put in, nodding severely. I raised my eyebrows at this and stared at him, but he sedulously avoided my eye.</p><p>Jamie stood looking at them for a moment, rubbing a forefinger down the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cMr. Howe,\u201d he said at last, dropping his hand. \u201cHow many men have ye in your command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . nearly a thousand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nearly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hundred,\u201d Richardson said, at the same moment that Howe exclaimed, \u201cNine hundred, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said Jamie, clearly unimpressed. \u201cThose transports carry three thousand men, easily\u2014well armed, with artillery\u2014and they\u2019ve an entire Highland regiment wi\u2019 them, too; I heard their pipes as they came ashore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Howe\u2019s color faded noticeably. Still, he had grit; he kept his dignity.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the odds, sir,\u201d he said, \u201cit is my duty to fight and to protect the city entrusted to my care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respect your devotion to your duty, General,\u201d Jamie said, quite seriously. \u201cAnd may God be with ye. But I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could physically compel you,\u201d Richardson pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cYe could,\u201d Jamie agreed, unruffled. \u201cBut to what end? Ye canna make me command men if I refuse to do it, and what good is an unwilling soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is craven cowardice, sir!\u201d Howe said, but it was clear that this was bluster, and poorly acted bluster, at that.</p><p>\u201cDia eadarainn \u2019s an t-olc,\u201d Jamie said quietly, and nodded toward the door. \u201cGod between us an evil,\u201d he said. \u201cGo with God, gentlemen, but leave my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHEE DID WELL, Jamie,\u201d Rachel said quietly, after the sound of the soldiers\u2019 footsteps had faded from the stairwell. \u201cNo Friend could have spoken more wisely.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, mouth quirking.</p> <p>\u201cThank ye, lass,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think ye ken I wasna speaking from the same reasons a Friend might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cBut the effect is the same, and Friends are grateful for whatever they can get. Will thee have the last frog leg?\u201d</p><p>A small ripple of laughter ran through the adults, and the children, who had been sitting rigid and white-faced during the soldiers\u2019 visit, relaxed as though they were balloons that someone had let the air out of and began zooming around the room in relief. Fearing for the tub of crayfish, Jenny and Marsali marshaled them into some sort of order and marched them off home to bed, Marsali pausing to kiss Fergus and adjuring him to be careful walking home alone.</p><p>\u201cThe British are not in the city yet, mon chou,\u201d he said, kissing her back.</p><p>\u201cAye, well\u2014it never hurts to keep in practice,\u201d she said tartly. \u201cCome along, ye wee rattans.\u201d</p><p>The rest of us sat for a time discussing the immediate future and what little might be done. Jamie was right about the advantages of poverty in such a situation\u2014but at the same time . . .</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take whatever food they find,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least at first.\u201d I gave the shelf behind me a quick glance; it was our pantry and held the sum total of the household\u2019s stores: a small crock of lard, cloth bags of oatmeal, flour, rice, beans, and parched corn, a braid of onions and a few dried apples, half a wheel of cheese, a little box of salt and a pepper pot, and the remains of a loaf of sugar. Plus our small stock of candles.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Jamie nodded, got up, and fetched his purse, which he turned out on the table. \u201cFourteen shillings, about. Ian? Fergus?\u201d Ian and Rachel\u2019s resources amounted to another nine shillings, Fergus\u2019s one guinea, two shillings, and a handful of pennies.</p><p>\u201cSee what ye can get at the tavern tomorrow, lass,\u201d he said, pushing a small pile of coins toward Rachel. \u201cI think I can put aside a cask of salt fish from the warehouse. And you, Sassenach\u2014if ye\u2019re quick at the market in the morning, ye might manage to get more rice and beans, maybe a flitch of bacon?\u201d Bits of copper and silver winked on the table before me, the King\u2019s stolid countenance chiseled in profile.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no good hiding place in our room,\u201d Ian observed, looking around. \u201cNor here. Auntie\u2019s wee surgery, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s what I was thinking. It\u2019s a board floor, and the building\u2019s got a good foundation. I\u2019ll maybe make a wee hidey-hole tomorrow. I shouldna think there\u2019s much in your surgery that soldiers would want?\u201d This last was said questioningly to me.</p><p>\u201cOnly the medicines that are made with alcohol,\u201d I said. I took a deep breath. \u201cSpeaking of soldiers\u2014I have to tell you something. It may not be important\u2014but then again . . .\u201d And I told them about Ezekiel Richardson.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019re quite sure of it, Sassenach?\u201d Jamie frowned a little, red brows sparking in the candlelight. \u201cYon man\u2019s got a face that might belong to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not what you\u2019d call memorable, at all,\u201d I admitted. \u201cBut, yes, I am sure. He has that mole on the side of his chin; I remember that. It\u2019s more the way he was looking at me, though. He recognized me, I\u2019m positive.\u201d</p> <p>Jamie drew breath and blew it out slowly, considering. Then he put his hands flat on the table and looked at Ian.</p><p>\u201cYour auntie met my son, William, in the city the other day\u2014by accident,\u201d he said, his voice carefully neutral. \u201cTell them what he said of Richardson, Sassenach, will ye?\u201d</p><p>I did, keeping an eye on the pulse in Ian\u2019s throat. So was Rachel; she put a hand quietly on his, which he was clenching in a fist on the table. He glanced at her, smiled briefly, and reluctantly unclenched it, lacing his fingers with hers.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s William doing here, then?\u201d Ian asked, obviously working to keep any hint of hostility out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cHe was looking for Richardson, in fact, but he\u2019s also searching for his cousin\u2019s wife, a woman named Amaranthus Grey\u2014or perhaps Cowden,\u201d I added. \u201cShe might be going by her maiden name. I\u2019d meant to ask if either of you had heard any mention of her.\u201d</p><p>Both Ian and Rachel shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cThee would remember a name like that,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cBut thee thinks William doesn\u2019t know that Richardson is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cNor that Richardson has gone over to the Rebels. Apparently.\u201d</p><p>There was silence for a moment. I could hear the faint clicking of the crayfish in the tub behind me and the slight pop as a fault in the candlewick made the flame bob and dance.</p><p>\u201cThis man Richardson may simply have changed his allegiance,\u201d Rachel suggested. \u201cI know of many who have, over the last two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cbut the thing is\u2014John thought he was an intelligencer\u2014a spy or secret agent of some sort. And when someone of that stripe turns his coat . . . you have to ask whether he\u2019s turned it once or twice. Or not at all. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie laid a hand on the table, thinking.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said at last, and, sitting up straight, stretched himself with a sigh. \u201cIf there\u2019s aught fishy about the man, we\u2019ll ken it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will?\u201d I asked. He gave me a wry smile.</p><p>\u201cAye, Sassenach. He\u2019ll come looking for you. Keep your wee knife close to hand, aye?\u201d</p><p>INVASION</p><p>December 29</p><p>WE HEARD THE GUNS soon after dawn. Jamie paused in the act of shaving to listen. It was a distant thunder, irregular, muffled by distance. But I had heard artillery close at hand and felt the sound as an echo in my bones, urging instant flight. Jamie had heard artillery at a much closer range than I and set down his razor, planting his hands flat on the washstand. To keep them from trembling, I thought.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re firing cannon from the ships in the river,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cAnd regular artillery from the south. God help Howe and his men.\u201d He crossed himself and picked up the razor.</p><p>\u201cHow far away do you think they are?\u201d I had paused in the act of putting on my stockings and now drew one up, slowly fastening my garter. Jamie shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo telling from in here. I\u2019ll go out in a bit, though, and then I\u2019ll see how the wind lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going out?\u201d I asked, uneasy at the prospect. \u201cSurely you\u2019re not going to work today.\u201d Fadler\u2019s warehouse, where he worked as a supervisor and senior clerk, was on the river.</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d he said briefly. \u201cBut I thought I\u2019d go and fetch the bairns and Marsali and my sister. Fergus will be gone to see what\u2019s happening, and I dinna want them left alone without a man.\u201d His mouth thinned. \u201cEspecially not if the soldiers come into the city.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, at once unable to speak. The thought of the things that happened\u2014could happen\u2014during an invasion . . . I had, thank God, never lived through such an event but had seen too many newsreels and photographs to be under any illusions as to the possibilities. And there had already been reports of a British company come up from Florida under an officer named Major Prevost, raiding the countryside around Sunbury, running off cattle, and burning barns and farmhouses. Sunbury was not nearly far enough away for comfort.</p><p>When Jamie left, I rattled around for a few minutes, undecided what to do first, but then pulled myself together and decided to make a quick visit to my surgery. It would be a good idea to take away my more-valuable instruments\u2014not that any of them had great value; there was no black market in amputation saws (at least not yet . . .)\u2014and such drugs and supplies as might be needed if\u2014</p><p>I cut that \u201cif\u201d off sharply and looked around our modest room. I had been keeping only a few staples, like flour and butter, and the more perishable items of food here; anything that could be stored for a while was now hidden under the floor of my surgery. If we were about to have Marsali, Jenny, and the children to stay for an indefinite time, though, I\u2019d best bring back a few more things.</p><p>I took my biggest basket and knocked at Rachel\u2019s door downstairs. She answered at once, already dressed to go out.</p><p>\u201cIan has gone with Fergus,\u201d she said, before I could ask. \u201cHe says he will not fight with the militia but that Fergus is his brother and it is his duty to see him safe. I can\u2019t complain about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d I said frankly. \u201cI\u2019d complain like billy-o if I thought it would do any good. Waste of breath, though. Will you come with me down to the surgery? Jamie\u2019s gone to get Jenny and Marsali and the children, so I thought I\u2019d best bring back something for them to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get my basket.\u201d</p><p>The streets were full of people\u2014most of them in some process of leaving the city, fetching goods, or drawing carts through the streets, though some were clearly bent on looting. I saw two men break a window and crawl through it into a large house off Ellis Square.</p><p>We reached the surgery without incident, though, and found two whores standing outside. They were women I knew, and I introduced them to Rachel, who was much less discomposed by the introduction than they were.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re wanting to buy pox cures, missus,\u201d said Molly, a sturdy Irish girl. \u201cSo many as ye might have to hand and be willin\u2019 to part with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you, um, expecting a\u2014er\u2014rash of the pox? So to speak?\u201d I was unlocking the door as we spoke, calculating whether the current crop of penicillin was likely to be sufficiently potent as to make any difference.</p><p>\u201cIt don\u2019t matter that much whether it works or not, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Iris, who was very tall, very thin, and very black. \u201cWe\u2019uns plan to sell \u2019em to the soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I said, rather blankly. \u201cWell, then . . .\u201d</p><p>I gave them what penicillin I had in liquid form, declining to charge them. I kept the powdered mold and the remnants of Roquefort cheese, though, in case the family might have need of them\u2014and suffered a bolt of vivid fear at the thought of Fergus and Ian, doing God knew what. The artillery had stopped \u2014or the wind had changed\u2014but it started up again as we made our way home, holding our baskets under our cloaks to prevent snatch-and-grab attacks.</p><p>Jamie had brought back Marsali and Jenny and the children, all of them carrying what they could in the way of clothes, food, and bedding. There was a long period of total chaos, while things were organized, but at last we sat down to a sort of rough tea, at around three o\u2019clock. Jamie, declining to be involved in the domestic engineering, had exercised his male prerogative of disappearing on vaguely unspecified \u201cbusiness\u201d but, with unerring instinct, reappeared just as the cake was being set out, bearing a large gunnysack full of clams, a barrel of flour, and a modicum of news.</p><p>\u201cThe fighting\u2019s over,\u201d he said, looking for someplace to set the clams down.</p><p>\u201cI noticed the guns had stopped some time ago. Do you know what\u2019s happened?\u201d I took the bag and decanted the clams with a loud clatter into the empty cauldron, then poured a bucket of water over them. They\u2019d keep until supper.</p><p>\u201cExactly what I told General Howe would happen,\u201d he said, though not with any sense of pleasure at being right. \u201cCampbell\u2014that\u2019s the British Lieutenant Colonel, Archibald Campbell\u2014circled Howe and his men and bagged them up like fish in a net. I dinna ken what he\u2019s done wi\u2019 them, but I expect there will be troops in the city before nightfall.\u201d</p><p>The women all looked at one another and relaxed visibly. This was actually good news. What with one thing and another, the British army was quite good at occupying cities. And while the citizenry might justifiably resent the billeting of troops and the requisitioning of supplies, the underlying fact was that there\u2019s nothing for keeping public order like having an army living with you.</p><p>\u201cWill we be safe, then, with the soldiers here?\u201d Joanie asked. She was bright-eyed with the adventure, like her siblings, and had been following the adult conversation closely.</p><p>\u201cAye, mostly,\u201d Jamie said, but his eye met Marsali\u2019s, and she grimaced. We probably would be safe enough, though food might be short for a while, until the army quartermasters got things straightened out. Fergus and Bonnie, though, were another matter.</p><p>\u201cLuckily, we hadna started up L\u2019Oignon yet,\u201d she said, answering Jamie\u2019s look. \u201cIt\u2019s only been printing up handbills and broadsheets and the odd religious tract. I think it will be all right,\u201d she said bravely, but she reached to touch F\u00e9licit\u00e9\u2019s dark head, as though to reassure herself.</p><p>We had the clams made into chowder\u2014rather a watery chowder, as we had very little milk, but we thickened it with crumbled biscuit, and there was enough butter\u2014and were setting the table for supper when Fergus and Ian came clattering up the stairs, flushed with excitement and full of news. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt was a black slave who made the difference,\u201d Fergus said, cramming a piece of bread into his mouth. \u201cMon Dieu, I\u2019m famished! We haven\u2019t eaten all day. This man wandered into the British camp soon after the fighting began and offered to show them a secret path through the swamp. Lieutenant Colonel Campbell sent a regiment of Highlanders\u2014we could hear the pipes; it reminded me of Prestonpans.\u201d He grinned at Jamie, and I could see the scrawny ten-year-old French orphan he\u2019d been, riding on a captured cannon. He swallowed and washed the bite down with water, that being all we had at the moment.</p><p>\u201cHighlanders,\u201d he continued, \u201cand some other infantry, and they followed the slave through the swamp and got well round General Howe\u2019s men, who were all clumped together, for of course they didn\u2019t know from which direction the fight might come.\u201d</p><p>Campbell had then sent another infantry company to Howe\u2019s left, \u201cto make some demonstrations,\u201d Fergus said, waving an airy hand and scattering crumbs. \u201cThey turned, of course, to meet this, and then the Highlanders fell on them from the other side, and voil\u00e0!\u201d He snapped his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI doubt Howe feels any gratitude to that slave,\u201d Ian put in, scooping his bowl into the cauldron of chowder. \u201cBut he ought. He didna lose more than thirty or forty men\u2014and had they stood and fought, they\u2019d likely all have been killed, if they hadn\u2019t the sense to surrender. And he didna strike me as a man o\u2019 sense,\u201d he added thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cHow long d\u2019ye think they\u2019ll stay, the army?\u201d Jenny was slicing bread and handing out the pieces round the table but paused to wipe a forearm across her brow. It was winter, but with the fire going in the small room and so many people crowded in, the temperature was quickly approaching Turkish-bath levels.</p><p>All the men exchanged glances. Then Jamie spoke, reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cA long time, a piuthar.\u201d</p><p>A SOVEREIGN CURE</p><p>IT HAD TO BE done, and it had to be done now. Between Jamie\u2019s uneasiness and my own misgivings, I\u2019d put off the question of making ether. But now we were up against it: I simply couldn\u2019t do what needed to be done for Sophronia without a dependable general anesthetic.</p> <p>I\u2019d already decided that I could do the manufacture in the tiny toolshed in Mrs. Landrum\u2019s huge kitchen garden. It was outside the city limits, with an acre of open space on every side, this occupied only by winter kale and hibernating carrots. If I blew myself to kingdom come, I wouldn\u2019t take anyone else with me.</p><p>I doubted that this observation would reassure Jamie to any great extent, though, so I put off mentioning my plans. I\u2019d assemble what I needed and tell him only at the last minute, thus saving him worry. And, after all, if I couldn\u2019t obtain the necessary ingredients . . . but I was sure that I could. Savannah was a sizable city, and a shipping port. There were at least three apothecaries in town, as well as several warehouses that imported specialty items from England. Someone was bound to have sulfuric acid, otherwise known as oil of vitriol.</p><p>The weather was cool but sunny, and seeing a number of red-coated soldiers in the street, I wondered idly whether climatic considerations had had anything to do with the British deciding to switch their theater of operations to the South.</p><p>The elder Mr. Jameson\u2014a sprightly gentleman in his seventies\u2014greeted me pleasantly when I entered Jameson\u2019s Apothecary. I\u2019d had occasion to make small purchases of herbs from him before, and we got on well. I presented him with my list and browsed among the jars on his shelves while he pottered to and fro in search of my requests. There were three young soldiers on the other side of the shop, gathered in furtive conversation with the younger Mr. Jameson over something he was showing them under his counter. Pox cures, I assumed\u2014or\u2014giving them the benefit of the doubt regarding foresight\u2014possibly condoms.</p><p>They concluded their surreptitious purchases and scuttled out, heads down and rather red in the face. The younger Mr. Jameson, who was the grandson of the owner and about the same age as the just-departed soldiers, was also rather pink but greeted me with aplomb, bowing.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Mrs. Fraser! Might I be of assistance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you, Nigel,\u201d I said. \u201cYour grandfather has my list. But\u201d\u2014a thought had occurred to me, perhaps jogged by the soldiers\u2014\u201cI wonder whether you might know of a Mrs. Grey. Amaranthus Grey is her name, and I believe her maiden name was . . . oh, what was it? Cowden! Amaranthus Cowden Grey. Have you ever heard that name?\u201d</p><p>He wrinkled his very smooth brow in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat an odd name. Er\u2014meaning no offense, ma\u2019am,\u201d he hastily assured me. \u201cI meant . . . rather exotic. Quite unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I don\u2019t know her,\u201d I said, \u201cbut a friend of mine said that she lived in Savannah and had urged me to . . . er . . . make her acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Nigel hmm\u2019d for a bit but shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever encountered an Amaranthus Cowden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCowden?\u201d said Mr. Jameson, emerging suddenly from his back room with several bottles in his hands. \u201cOf course we have, boy. Or, rather, not encountered; she\u2019s never come in the shop. But we had a request brought by mail, only two or three weeks ago, asking for . . . oh, what was it, my mind is a sieve, Mrs. Fraser, an absolute sieve, I assure you\u2014don\u2019t get old, that\u2019s my advice\u2014oh, yes. Gould\u2019s complexion cream, Villette\u2019s gripe water, a box of pastilles to sweeten the breath, and a dozen bars of Savon D\u2019Artagnan French soap. That was it.\u201d He beamed at me over his spectacles. \u201cShe lives in Saperville,\u201d he added, as an afterthought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wonder, Granddad,\u201d Nigel murmured dutifully, and reached for the bottles his grandfather was holding. \u201cShall I wrap these, or are we mixing something for the lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mr. Jameson looked down at the bottles in his hands, as though wondering how they\u2019d got there. \u201cOh, yes! I wanted to ask you, Mrs. Fraser, what it was you had in mind to do with oil of vitriol. It\u2019s amazingly dangerous, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, yes, I do.\u201d I eyed him consideringly; some men would be quite capable of refusing to sell a woman something they thought inappropriate or dangerous, but Mr. Jameson seemed a worldly sort\u2014and he did at least know that I knew the use of medicinal herbs.</p><p>\u201cI have it in mind to make ether,\u201d I said. The substance was known, I knew\u2014someone or other had discovered it back in the eighth century, or so I was told in medical school\u2014but its use as an anesthetic wouldn\u2019t be developed \u2019til somewhere in the nineteenth century. I wondered idly whether anyone in the intervening eleven hundred years had noticed that the stuff put people to sleep, but had inadvertently killed them and thus abandoned further experimentation.</p><p>Both Mr. Jamesons looked surprised.</p><p>\u201cEther?\u201d said Nigel, openly puzzled. \u201cWhy would you make it yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I\u2014what, do you mean that you have the stuff already made up?\u201d I asked, astonished.</p><p>Both of them nodded, pleased to be of service.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Mr. Jameson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always stock it, of course, but with the . . . er . . . army\u201d\u2014he waved a hand, encompassing the recent invasion and occupation\u2014\u201cthere are the troop transports, and there will be a great increase of shipping, now that the blockade is not in effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the increase of shipping have to do with the sale of ether?\u201d I asked, wondering whether Mr. Jameson might just possibly be right about the effects of advancing age on the brain.</p><p>\u201cWhy, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Nigel. \u201cIt\u2019s a sovereign cure for the seasickness. Did you not know?\u201d</p><p>A BORN GAMBLER</p><p>ICOUNTED MY INSTRUMENTS for the third time and, finding that none of them had escaped since the last count, covered them with a clean linen cloth and patted it lightly in reassurance\u2014whether of the scalpels or myself, I wasn\u2019t sure. Silk sutures, gut sutures, needles\u2014the finest embroidery needles obtainable in Savannah. Pledgets, swabs, dressings, rolled bandages. A six-inch willow twig, carefully cleaned of its pith, sanded smooth, and boiled slowly\u2014so as not to crack the wood\u2014to be used as a catheter to stabilize the urethra and bladder and keep urine out of the surgical field. I\u2019d thought of using a larger one for the bowel, but decided that I\u2019d be better using my fingers to manipulate the slippery tissues there\u2014so long as I managed neither to cut nor puncture myself in the process.</p><p>Rachel was coming to assist with the surgery, and I\u2019d go through all the instruments and procedures again with her. I\u2019d come down an hour early, though, wanting both to make my final preparations and to spend a little time alone, settling my mind and spirit to the job ahead.</p><p>I felt surprisingly calm, considering the complexity and risks of the operation ahead. It could be argued that even if I failed, the poor child couldn\u2019t possibly be worse off than she was\u2014but of course she could die as a result of the surgery, from shock, infection, or even accidental hemorrhage. Abdominal surgery was much more serious than trying a transvaginal correction\u2014but given what I had at hand, I thought the chances of achieving a cure were much better that way. And then there was the matter of the curettage that had removed the dead infant; I had no idea what kind of damage that might have inflicted, but if there was any, I might be able to correct it.</p><p>I glanced automatically at the shelf where my penicillin factory was working\u2014or at least I hoped it was working, billions of little spores excreting their helpful substance. I hadn\u2019t had time in Savannah to establish a good process and test the resultant product; there was, as was so often the case, no guarantee whatever that I had usable penicillin in my broth. But I did have a small chunk of very ripe French cheese, acquired at extravagant cost and stirred into a little boiled milk to make a paste; the thick scent of it fought for ascendancy with the pungent smell of ether.</p><p>I could hear the early-morning sounds of the city outside, soothing in their ordinariness: the whisk of a broom on pavement, the clop of horse-drawn wagons, a tantalizing smell of hot bread as the baker\u2019s boy\u2019s quick footsteps passed by. The simple demands of life quickly made routine out of any sort of chaos, and as invasions went, the occupation of Savannah had been reasonably bloodless.</p><p>My sense of well-being and calm detachment was interrupted a moment later by the opening of the surgery door.</p><p>\u201cMay I help\u2014\u201d I began, turning. Then I saw my visitor and altered my remark to a fairly hostile \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Captain\u2014no, he was a colonel now; the wages of treason, I supposed\u2014Richardson smiled charmingly at me, then turned and bolted the door. I pulled out a drawer and removed my small amputation saw; it was small enough to handle quickly, and the serrated edge would take his nose off, if my aim was good.</p><p>The charming smile broadened into a grin as he saw what I was about, and he bowed. He wasn\u2019t wearing a uniform\u2014and no wonder\u2014but was clothed in a decent, rather sober suit, with unpowdered hair tied simply back. No one would have looked at him twice.</p><p>\u201cYour most humble servant, ma\u2019am. Have no alarm; I merely wished to make sure we weren\u2019t interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m alarmed about,\u201d I said, taking a firm grip on the saw. \u201cUnbolt that bloody door this minute.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a moment, one eye narrowed in calculation, but then uttered a short laugh and, turning, pulled the bolt. Folding his arms, he leaned against the door.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d I let go the saw but didn\u2019t move my hand far from it. \u201cI repeat\u2014what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I thought perhaps the time had come to lay my cards upon your table, Mrs. Fraser\u2014and see whether you might want to play a hand or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I might be inclined to play with you, Colonel, is mumblety-peg,\u201d I said, tapping my fingers on the handle of the saw. \u201cBut if you want to show me your cards, go right ahead. You want to be quick about it, though\u2014I have an operation to conduct in less than an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take that long. May I?\u201d Raising his brows, he gestured at one of the stools. I nodded, and he sat down, looking quite relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThe essence of the matter, ma\u2019am, is that I am a Rebel\u2014and always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am presently a colonel in the Continental army\u2014but when you first knew me, I was working as an American agent in the guise of a captain in His Majesty\u2019s army in Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d I grasped what he was telling me but couldn\u2019t grasp why the hell he should be telling me.</p><p>\u201cYou are a Rebel yourself, are you not?\u201d One sparse brow lifted in inquiry. He really was the most ordinary-looking man, I thought. If he was a spy, he was physically well suited for it.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I said guardedly. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re on the same side,\u201d he said patiently. \u201cWhen I cozened Lord John Grey into marrying you, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely he told you that I had threatened to have you arrested for distributing seditious materials? At which you\u2019re very clumsy, I might add,\u201d he added dispassionately. \u201cHis lordship assured me that he had no personal interest in you whatever and then most obligingly married you the next day. His lordship is a very gallant man\u2014particularly in view of his own preferences.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head, smiling in a conspiratorial manner, and a spear of ice shot through my belly.</p><p>\u201cOh, you do know, then,\u201d he observed, watching my face. \u201cI thought you would. He\u2019s extremely discreet, but I think you a very perceptive woman, particularly in sexual matters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStand up,\u201d I said, in my coldest voice, \u201cand leave. Right now.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t, of course, and I cursed my lack of forethought in not keeping a loaded pistol in the surgery. The saw might serve if he attacked me, but I knew better than to try attacking him.</p><p>Besides, what would you do with the body, if you killed him? the logical side of my mind inquired. He wouldn\u2019t fit in the cupboard, let alone the hidey-hole.</p><p>\u201cFor the third\u2014and last\u2014time,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you bloody want?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour help,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cI\u2019d originally had it in mind to use you as an agent in place. You could have been very valuable to me, moving in the same social circles as the British high command. But you seemed too unstable\u2014forgive me, ma\u2019am\u2014to approach immediately. I hoped that as your grief over your first husband faded, you would come to a state of resignation in which I might seek your acquaintance and by degrees achieve a state of intimacy in which you could be persuaded to discover small\u2014and, at first, seemingly innocent\u2014bits of information, which you would pass on to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what do you mean by \u2018intimacy\u2019?\u201d I said, folding my arms. Because while the word in current parlance often meant merely friendship, he hadn\u2019t used it with that intonation at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very desirable woman, Mrs. Fraser,\u201d he said, looking me over in an objectionably appraising way. \u201cAnd one who knows her desirability. His lordship obviously wasn\u2019t obliging you in that regard, so . . .\u201d He lifted a shoulder, smiling in a deprecating fashion. \u201cBut as General Fraser has returned from the dead, I imagine you\u2019re no longer susceptible to lures of that kind.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and dropped my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou flatter yourself, Colonel,\u201d I said dryly. \u201cIf not me. Look: why not stop trying to fluster me and tell me what you want me to do and why on earth you think I\u2019d do it.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, too, which lent some sense of individuality to his face.</p><p>\u201cVery well. It may be difficult to believe, but this war will not be won on the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I assure you, ma\u2019am. It will be won by spying and by politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very novel approach, I\u2019m sure.\u201d I was trying to place his accent; it was English but a rather flat sort of accent. Not London, not the north . . . educated, but not polished. \u201cI assume you weren\u2019t soliciting my assistance in the political line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I am,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somewhat indirectly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suggest you try the direct approach,\u201d I said. \u201cMy patient will be arriving very shortly.\u201d The sounds outside had changed; apprentices and housemaids were going past in little groups, bound for work or daily marketing. Calls to and fro, the occasional giggle of a flirtation in passing.</p><p>Richardson nodded in acceptance.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware of the Duke of Pardloe\u2019s opinion of this war?\u201d</p><p>I was somewhat taken aback by this. Foolishly, it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that Hal might have one, outside the requirements of his service. But if ever I had met a man guaranteed to have opinions, it was Harold, Second Duke of Pardloe.</p><p>\u201cWhat with one thing and another, I\u2019ve never exchanged views with the duke on political matters. Nor with my\u2014nor with his brother, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well, ladies often take no interest in things outside their own sphere of interest\u2014though I rather thought you might have a . . . wider appreciation, shall we say?\u201d He looked pointedly from my canvas apron and tray of instruments to the other appointments of my surgery.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his politics?\u201d I asked shortly, disregarding his implications.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace is a strong voice in the House of Lords,\u201d Richardson said, playing with a frayed thread on the edge of his cuff. \u201cAnd while he was at first very much in favor of the war, his opinions of late have been noticeably more . . . moderate. He wrote a public letter to the first minister in the fall, urging a consideration of reconciliation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I hadn\u2019t the slightest idea where he was going with this and was growing impatient.</p><p>\u201cReconciliation is not what we want, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, and, pulling the thread free, flicked it aside. \u201cSuch efforts will only delay the inevitable and interfere with the commitment of the citizenry that we desperately need. But the fact that His Grace shows this moderation of outlook is useful to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolly good,\u201d I said. \u201cGet to the point, if you please.\u201d</p><p>He ignored this and proceeded about his exposition as though he had all the time in the world.</p><p>\u201cWere he fiercely committed to one extreme or the other, he would be difficult to . . . influence. While I don\u2019t know His Grace well, everything I know of him indicates that he values his sense of honor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014almost as much as he values his family,\u201d Richardson finished. He looked directly at me, and for the first time I felt a flicker of real fear.</p><p>\u201cI have for some time been working to acquire influence\u2014whether direct or otherwise\u2014over such members of the duke\u2019s family as are within my reach. With, say, a son\u2014a nephew?\u2014perhaps even his brother in my control, it would then be possible to affect His Grace\u2019s public position, in whatever way seemed most advantageous to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re suggesting what I think you\u2019re suggesting, then I suggest you leave my sight this instant,\u201d I said, in what I hoped was a tone of calm menace. Though I spoiled whatever effect there might have been by adding, \u201cBesides, I have absolutely no connection with any of Pardloe\u2019s family now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly, with no sense of pleasantry at all.</p><p>\u201cHis nephew, William, is in the city, ma\u2019am, and you were seen speaking with him nine days ago. Perhaps you are unaware, though, that both Pardloe and his brother are here, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d My mouth hung open for an instant and I closed it sharply. \u201cWith the army?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI gather that in spite of your recent . . . marital rearrangement? . . . you remain on good terms with Lord John Grey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSufficiently good that I would do nothing whatever to deliver him into your bloody hands, if that\u2019s what you had in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing so crude, ma\u2019am,\u201d he assured me, with a brief flash of teeth. \u201cI had in mind only the transmission of information\u2014in both directions. I intend no damage at all to the duke or his family; I only wish to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever his intentions, they were interrupted by a tentative knock on the door, which then opened to admit Mrs. Bradshaw\u2019s head. She looked apprehensively at me and suspiciously at Richardson, who cleared his throat, stood up, and bowed to her.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just taking my leave of Mrs. Fraser. Good day to you.\u201d He turned and bowed to me, more elaborately. \u201cYour most humble servant, Mrs. Fraser. I look forward to seeing you again. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet you do,\u201d I said, but far enough under my breath that I doubted he heard me.</p><p>Mrs. Bradshaw and Sophronia edged into the room, coming close enough to Richardson on his way out that his face wrinkled up in involuntary revulsion at smelling Sophronia, and he cast a startled glance over his shoulder at me\u2014this causing him to collide heavily with Rachel, hurrying in. He waltzed with her for a step or two, finally getting his balance and making his inelegant escape, pursued by my laughter.</p><p>This bit of slapstick had partially dispelled the uneasiness he\u2019d brought to my surgery, and I put him firmly out of my mind. Sufficient to the day was the Richardson thereof, and I had work to do. It was with a sense of confidence that I took Sophronia\u2019s small hand between my own and smiled at her downcast face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be worried, sweetheart,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>WITH A MODERN hospital and equipment, I would have done the surgery transvaginally. Given my current resources, though, it would have to be abdominal. With Mrs. Bradshaw anxiously perched on a stool out of the way\u2014she wouldn\u2019t leave, and I hoped she wouldn\u2019t faint\u2014and Rachel carefully counting drops of ether under her breath, I took my best scalpel and cut into Sophronia\u2019s fresh-scrubbed belly. The stretch marks left by her pregnancy were fading but still visible on her very young flesh.</p><p>I had makeshift stirrups, should I need them, made by nailing blocks of wood to the table at an angle, and I\u2019d put a wadded towel between her thighs, soaked with the antibacterial lotion I\u2019d scrubbed her with, an alcoholic extraction of crushed garlic mixed with a hot-water extract of lemon balm. It smelled pleasantly kitchen-like and did something to kill the sewage smell\u2014as well as germs, I hoped.</p><p>The ether, though, was stronger than anything else, and within ten minutes of starting, I began to feel a slight swimming in my head.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bradshaw,\u201d I called over my shoulder. \u201cWill you open the window, please? And the shutters?\u201d I hoped we wouldn\u2019t attract any spectators\u2014but the need for fresh air was imperative.</p><p>The vesicovaginal fistula was luckily fairly small and in a reasonably easy position to reach. Rachel was holding a retractor for me with one hand, keeping the other on Sophronia\u2019s pulse, and administering more ether every few minutes.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Rachel?\u201d I asked, trimming back the edges of the fistula in order to get a decent field for stitching\u2014the edges were flattened and macerated, and the tissue would shred and pull apart under any sort of pressure. I\u2019d had some hesitation in asking her to help today; I would have asked Jenny, but she was suffering from what was called the catarrh, and sneezing and coughing were the last things I wanted in a surgical assistant.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she answered, her voice slightly muffled behind her not-quite-sterile-but-at-least-boiled mask. She\u2019d used one of Ian\u2019s handkerchiefs for the purpose; it was an incongruously cheerful calico in dark-pink-and-white checks. Ian\u2019s taste in clothing was strongly Mohawk.</p><p>\u201cGood. Tell me if you feel at all dizzy.\u201d I had no idea what I\u2019d do if she did feel dizzy\u2014perhaps Mrs. Bradshaw could take over the dropping bottle for a few minutes. . . .</p><p>I spared a quick glance over my shoulder. Mrs. Bradshaw sat on her stool, gloved hands clasped tight in her lap and her face pale as a sheet, but she sat firm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going well so far,\u201d I said to her, trying to sound as reassuring as possible through my own chaste white mask. The masks seemed to unnerve her, and she looked away, swallowing.</p><p>It really was going well, though. While it was Sophronia\u2019s youth that had caused the problem, that also meant that her tissues were healthy, in good shape, and she had considerable animal vitality. If the surgery was successful, if there was little or no subsequent infection, she\u2019d heal very quickly. If.</p><p>\u201cIfs\u201d hover in the air above your head all the time when you\u2019re doing surgery, like a cloud of gnats. For the most part, though, they keep a respectful distance, only buzzing dimly in the background.</p><p>Done.</p><p>\u201cOne down, one to go,\u201d I murmured, and, dipping a wad of sterilized gauze into my cheese lotion, I daubed some\u2014not without a qualm\u2014over the newly stitched repair. \u201cOnward.\u201d</p><p>The bowel repair was easier\u2014though more unpleasant. It was quite cold in the surgery\u2014I hadn\u2019t lit a fire, not wanting soot in the air\u2014but I was sweating; beads of perspiration ran tickling down the side of my nose and down my neck from my bound-up hair.</p><p>I could feel the girl, though, the life of her echoing in my hands, her heartbeat strong and steady\u2014there was a large blood vessel visible on the surface of the uterus, and I could see it pulsing. She\u2019d been lucky in the one thing: the uterus hadn\u2019t been perforated, and looked healthy. I couldn\u2019t tell whether there was internal scarring, but when I cupped my hand gently over the organ, it felt normal to me. For a moment, I closed my eyes, feeling deeper, and found what I thought I needed. I opened them again, blotted the ooze of blood from the cut tissues, and reached for a fresh needle.</p><p>How long? Anesthesia complications were one of the nasty little flying \u201cifs,\u201d and that one flew down and perched on my shoulder. I had no clock or pocket watch but had brought a small sandglass borrowed from our landlady.</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been, Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes.\u201d Her voice was soft, and I looked up, but she was still steady, her eyes fixed on the open belly. She was nearly four months\u2019 pregnant, her own belly slightly rounded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said to her briefly. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely it could?\u201d she said, still more softly.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNot if I\u2019m with you when you give birth.\u201d</p><p>She made a small amused sound and picked up the dropping bottle again.</p><p>\u201cThee will be, I assure thee, Claire.\u201d</p><p>Rachel was shivering slightly by the time I\u2019d finished; I was wringing wet but feeling the glow of at least temporary victory. The fistulas were repaired, the leakage stopped. I irrigated the surgical field with saline solution and the organs glistened, the beautiful deep colors of the body unmarred by smears of fecal matter.</p><p>I paused for a moment to admire the neat compactness of the pelvic organs, all in their places. There was a tiny trickle of pale urine from the catheter, staining the towel with a faint yellow shadow. In a modern hospital, I would have left the catheter in during the healing, but it would be difficult to manage without a drainage bag, and the chances of irritation or infection from the device were likely greater than the possible benefits of leaving it. I eased it free of her body, watching. Within a few seconds, the flow of urine ceased, and I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I was holding.</p><p>I had taken up a fresh needle threaded with silk, to close the incision, when something occurred to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRachel\u2014do you want to look? Closely, I mean.\u201d Sophronia had had ether within the last couple of minutes and was still deeply under; Rachel checked her color and breathing and then came round the table to stand beside me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be disturbed by the blood or the sight of organs, given the things she\u2019d seen in military camps and battlefields. She wasn\u2019t, but she was disturbed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d She swallowed and put a hand to her swelling stomach, very gently. \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow the body is made. How such things can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, her awe making me lower my own voice.</p> <p>\u201cTo think of her poor infant, though . . . and she no more than a child . . .\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Rachel and saw tears standing in her eyes. And I saw the thought cross her face, masked as it was: It could happen to me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cGo back to the ether; I\u2019ll close the incision now.\u201d But as I dipped my hands again in the bowl of alcohol and water, something else occurred to me.</p><p>Oh, God, I thought, appalled at the thought. But . . .</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bradshaw,\u201d I said. She was sitting with her head bowed, arms wrapped round herself against the chill, perhaps half asleep. When I spoke, though, her head came up sharply.</p> <p>\u201cIs it over?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoes she live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd, with luck, will continue to do so. But . . .\u201d I hesitated, but I had to ask. And I had to ask this woman.</p><p>\u201cBefore I sew up the incision . . . I can\u2014do a very minor procedure that will stop Sophronia from becoming pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Bradshaw blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s a simple thing to do\u2014but, once done, it can\u2019t be undone. She\u2019d never be able to have babies.\u201d A fresh cloud of \u201cifs\u201d had formed, buzzing anxiously over my shoulder.</p> <p>She was thirteen. She was a slave. And had a master who used her. If she were to become pregnant again soon, she might well die during the labor and would almost certainly be seriously damaged. It might never be safe for her to bear a child\u2014but it wasn\u2019t safe for any woman, ever. And \u201cnever\u201d is a very big word.</p><p>Mrs. Bradshaw had drifted slowly toward the table, her eyes twitching toward the exposed, half-draped body, then away, unable either to look or to stay away. I put out a hand, warding her off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come closer, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was sad when the baby died. He cried.\u201d I could still hear the sadness in Sophronia\u2019s voice; she mourned her child. How could she not? Could I take away the possibility of another\u2014forever\u2014without even asking her what she felt about it?</p><p>And yet . . .</p><p>If she bore a child, it, too, would be a slave; it might be taken from her and sold. Even if not, it would likely live and die in slavery.</p><p>And yet . . .</p><p>\u201cIf she wasn\u2019t able to bear children . . .\u201d Mrs. Bradshaw said slowly. She stopped speaking, and I could see the thoughts crossing her white, pinched face; her lips had all but disappeared, so tightly were they pressed together. I didn\u2019t think she was concerned with the fact that Sophronia\u2019s value would be diminished if she couldn\u2019t reproduce.</p> <p>Would the fear of damage due to pregnancy stop Mr. Bradshaw from using the girl?</p><p>If she were barren, would he feel no hesitation?</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hesitate because she was twelve,\u201d I said, my words cold as pellets of ice. \u201cWould the chance of killing her next time stop him?\u201d</p><p>She stared at me in shock, mouth hanging open. She blinked, swallowed, and looked at Sophronia, limp and helpless, body gaping open on the blood-soaked towels, the floor around her thickly spattered with her fluids.</p><p>\u201cI think thee cannot,\u201d Rachel said quietly. She looked from me to Mrs. Bradshaw, and it wasn\u2019t clear to whom she was speaking: perhaps both of us. She was holding Sophronia\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cShe felt her child move within her. She loved it.\u201d Rachel\u2019s voice broke, and she choked a little. Tears welled and rolled down to disappear into her mask. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t . . . she . . .\u201d She stopped, gulping a little, and shook her head, unable to go on.</p><p>Mrs. Bradshaw put a hand clumsily over her face, as though to stop me seeing her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, and repeated almost angrily, behind the shield of her hand, \u201cI can\u2019t. It isn\u2019t my fault! I tried\u2014I tried to do the right thing!\u201d She wasn\u2019t talking to me; I didn\u2019t know if it was to Mr. Bradshaw or God.</p><p>The \u201cifs\u201d were all still there, but so was Sophronia, and I couldn\u2019t leave her any longer.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cGo and sit down, Mrs. Bradshaw. I said I\u2019d take care of her, and I will.\u201d</p><p>My hands were cold, and the body under them was very warm, pulsing with life. I picked up the needle and put in the first suture.</p><p>WILL-O\u2019-THE-WISP</p><p>SAPERVILLE? WILLIAM WAS beginning to wonder whether Amaranthus Cowden Grey actually existed or whether she was a will-o\u2019-the-wisp created by Ezekiel Richardson. But if so\u2014to what end?</p><p>He\u2019d made careful inquiries after receiving Mrs. Fraser\u2019s note yesterday; there really was a place called Saperville\u2014a tiny settlement some twenty miles to the southwest of Savannah, in what his interlocutor had told him was \u201cthe piney woods,\u201d in a tone of voice suggesting that the piney woods were next door to hell, both in terms of remoteness and uncivil conditions. He couldn\u2019t conceive what might have made the woman\u2014if she really did exist\u2014go to such a place.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t exist . . . then someone had invented her, and the most likely suspect for such a deception was Ezekiel Richardson. William had been decoyed by Richardson before. The entire experience in the Dismal Swamp still made him grit his teeth in retrospect\u2014the more so when he reflected that, if not for that chain of events, neither he nor Ian Murray would have met Rachel Hunter.</p><p>With an effort, he dismissed Rachel from his mind\u2014she wouldn\u2019t stay out of his dreams, but he didn\u2019t have to think about her while awake\u2014and returned to the elusive Amaranthus.</p><p>In purely practical terms, Saperville lay on the other side of Campbell\u2019s army, which was still encamped over several acres of ground outside Savannah, while billeting arrangements were made, housing built, and fortifications dug. A large part of the Continental forces that had opposed them had been neatly bagged up and sent north as prisoners, and the chances of the remnants causing trouble for Campbell were minuscule. That didn\u2019t mean William could walk straight through the camp without attracting attention. He might not meet with anyone who knew him, but that didn\u2019t mean no one would question him. And however innocuous his errand, the last thing he wanted was to have to explain to anyone why he had resigned his commission.</p><p>He\u2019d had time, while Campbell was arraying his forces, to take Miranda out of Savannah and board her with a farmer some ten miles to the north. The army foragers might still find her\u2014they certainly would, if the army remained in Savannah for any great time\u2014but for the moment she was safe. All too familiar with military rapacity\u2014he\u2019d seized horses and supplies himself, many times\u2014he wasn\u2019t about to take her within sight of the army.</p><p>He drummed his fingers on the table, thinking, but reluctantly concluded that he\u2019d best walk to Saperville, making a wide circle around Campbell\u2019s men. He wasn\u2019t going to find out about bloody Amaranthus sitting here, that was sure.</p><p>Resolved, he paid for his meal, wrapped himself in his cloak, and set off. It wasn\u2019t raining, that was one good thing.</p><p>It was January, though, and the days were still short; the shadows were lengthening by the time he came to the edge of the sea of camp followers that had formed around the army. He made his way past a conclave of red-armed laundresses, their kettles all fuming in the chilly air and the scent of smoke and lye soap hanging over them in a witchy sort of haze.</p><p>\u201cDouble, double toil and trouble,\u201d he chanted under his breath. \u201cFire burn and caldron bubble. Fillet of a fenny snake, in the caldron boil and bake. Eye of newt and toe of frog, wool of bat and tongue of dog . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t recall what came next and abandoned the effort.</p><p>Beyond the laundresses, the ground was choppy, the boggy spots interspersed with higher bits of ground, these crowned with stunted trees and low bushes\u2014and quite obviously providing a footing, so to speak, for the whores to ply their own trade.</p><p>He gave these a somewhat wider berth and consequently found himself squelching through something that was not quite a bog, but not far off, either. It was remarkably beautiful, though, in a chiaroscuro sort of way; the fading light somehow made each barren twig stand out in stark contrast to the air, the swollen buds still sleeping but rounded, balanced on the edge between winter\u2019s death and the life of spring. He wished for a moment that he could draw, or paint, or write poetry, but as it was, he could only pause for a few seconds to admire it.</p><p>As he did so, though, he felt a permanence form in his heart, a quiet sense that even though he had only these few seconds, he would have them forever, could come back to this place, this time, in his mind.</p><p>He was right, though not entirely for the reasons he supposed.</p><p>He would have passed right by her, thinking she was a part of the bog, for she was curled over in a tight ball and the hood of her sad-colored cloak covered her head. But she made a tiny sound, a heartbroken whimper that stopped him in his tracks, and he saw her then, crouched in the mud at the foot of a sweet gum.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d he said tentatively. She hadn\u2019t been aware of him; she uncurled suddenly, her white face staring up at him, shocked and tear-streaked. Then she gulped air and leapt to her feet, throwing herself at him.</p><p>\u201cWiyum! Wiyum!\u201d It was Fanny, Jane\u2019s sister, alone, daubed with mud, and in a state of complete hysteria. She\u2019d catapulted into his arms; he gripped her firmly, holding her lest she fly to pieces, which she looked very like doing.</p><p>\u201cFrances. Frances! It\u2019s all right; I\u2019m here. What\u2019s happened? Where\u2019s Jane?\u201d</p><p>At her sister\u2019s name, she gave a wail that made his blood go cold and buried her face in his chest. He patted her back and, this failing to help, then shook her a little.</p><p>\u201cFrances! Pull yourself together. Sweetheart,\u201d he added more gently, seeing her swimming, red-rimmed eyes and swollen face. She\u2019d been weeping for a long time. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happened, so I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she blubbered, and thumped her forehead hard against his chest, several times. \u201cYou can\u2019t, you can\u2019t, nobody can, you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see about that.\u201d He looked around for someplace to sit her down, but there was nothing more solid than clumps of grass and spindly trees in sight. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s getting dark. We need to get out of this place, at least.\u201d He set her firmly on her feet, took her arm, and compelled her to start walking, on the theory that one can\u2019t be hysterical and walk in a straight line at the same time.</p><p>In fact, this seemed to be the case. By the time he\u2019d got her back to the camp followers\u2019 area, she was sniffling but no longer wailing, and she was looking where she was going. He bought her a cup of hot soup from a woman with a steaming cauldron and made her drink it, though a remnant thought of the fingers of birth-strangled babes made him forgo one for himself.</p><p>He handed back the empty cup and, seeing that Fanny was at least superficially calm now, towed her toward the hillock with trees, in search of a seat. She stiffened, though, as they approached, and pulled back with a little mew of fear.</p><p>Losing patience, he put a hand under her chin and made her meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFrances,\u201d he said in a level tone. \u201cTell me what the devil is going on, and do it now. Words of one syllable, if you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d she said, and her eyes began to overflow again. She dashed at them with her cloak-covered forearm, though, and, with a visible effort, managed to tell him.</p><p>\u201cIt wass a cuwwy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what? Oh, a cully, sorry. At the brothel, you mean. Yes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe wass looking thu the gulls and s-saw J-Jane . . .\u201d She gulped. \u201cHe wass a fwend of Captain Hahkness. He wass at da house when he\u2014Captain Hahkness\u2014died. He weckognized huh.\u201d</p><p>A ball of ice formed in William\u2019s entrails at her words.</p><p>\u201cThe devil he did,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhat did he do, Fanny?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2014a Major Jenkins, she said\u2014had seized Jane by the arm and dragged her off, Fanny running after them. He had taken her all the way into the city, to a house with soldiers standing outside. They wouldn\u2019t let Fanny in, so she had stood outside in the street, terrified but determined not to leave, and after a time they had given up trying to drive her away.</p><p>The house with soldiers standing outside was very likely Colonel Campbell\u2019s headquarters, William thought, beginning to feel sick. Presumably Jenkins had hauled Jane before some senior officer, if not Campbell himself, to denounce her for Harkness\u2019s murder.</p><p>Would they even bother giving her a trial? He doubted it. The city was under martial law; the army\u2014or, rather, Lieutenant Colonel Campbell\u2014did as it saw fit, and he doubted very much that Campbell would give a whore accused of murdering a soldier the benefit of any doubt.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d He forced himself to go on sounding calm, though he felt anything but.</p><p>Fanny gulped and wiped her nose on her cloak again. At this point, it scarcely mattered, but by instinct he pulled his handkerchief from his sleeve and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cDey took her to anovver house. On de edge of da city. Dere\u2019s a big tree dere, ousside. I tink dey\u2019ll hang her, Wiyum.\u201d</p><p>William was very much afraid they would. He swallowed the saliva that had collected in his mouth and patted Fanny\u2019s shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and see what I can find out. Do you have friends here\u2014someone to stay with?\u201d He motioned at the mass of the encampment, where small fires were beginning to glow amidst the oncoming shades of night. She nodded, pressing her lips together to keep them from trembling.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Go and find them. I\u2019ll come in the morning\u2014at first light. Meet me where I found you, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwright,\u201d she whispered, and laid a small white hand on his chest, just over his heart. \u201cSank you, Wiyum.\u201d</p><p>HIS ONLY CHANCE was to talk to Campbell. Fanny had told him the house where Jenkins had taken Jane was the big gray house north of Reynolds Square; that was the likeliest place to start.</p> <p>He paused on the street to brush the worst of the dried mud and bits of vegetation off his cloak. He was only too well aware that he looked like exactly what he\u2019d been pretending to be for the last three months: an unemployed laborer. On the other hand\u2014</p><p>As he\u2019d resigned his commission, he was no longer under Campbell\u2019s authority. And no matter how he personally felt about the matter of his title, it was still his, by law. The Ninth Earl of Ellesmere drew himself up to his full height, squared his shoulders, and went to war.</p><p>Manner and speech got him past the sentries at the door. The servant who came to take his cloak stared at him in unmitigated dismay, but was afraid to throw him out, and vanished to find someone who would take the responsibility of dealing with him.</p><p>There was a dinner party going on; he could hear the clink of silver and china, the glugging of bottles being poured, and the muted rumble of conversation, punctuated by bursts of polite laughter. His hands were sweating; he wiped them unobtrusively on his breeches.</p><p>What the devil was he going to say? He\u2019d tried to formulate some line of reasonable argument on his way, but everything seemed to fall to pieces the moment he thought of it. He\u2019d have to say something, though. . . .</p> <p>Then he heard a voice, raised in question, that made his heart skip a beat. Uncle Hal! He couldn\u2019t be mistaken; his uncle and his father both had light but penetrating voices, clear as cut crystal\u2014and sharp as good Toledo steel when they wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cHere, you!\u201d He strode down the hall and grabbed a servitor coming out of the dining room with a platter of crab shells in his hands. \u201cGive me that,\u201d he ordered, taking the platter from the man\u2019s hands, \u201cgo back in there, and tell the Duke of Pardloe his nephew would like a word.\u201d</p><p>The man goggled at him, mouth open, but didn\u2019t move. William repeated his request, adding \u201cPlease,\u201d but also adding a stare meant to indicate that, in the case of resistance, his next step would be to bash the man over the head with the platter. This worked, and the man turned like an automaton and marched back into the dining room\u2014from which, in very short order, his uncle emerged, polished in dress and manner but clearly excited in countenance.</p><p>\u201cWilliam! What the devil are you doing with that?\u201d He took the platter from William and shoved it carelessly under one of the gilt chairs ranged along the wall of the foyer. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Have you found Ben?\u201d</p><p>Christ, he hadn\u2019t thought of that. Naturally, Uncle Hal would assume . . . With a grimace, he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t, Uncle, I\u2019m sorry. I think I do know where his wife is, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Hal\u2019s face underwent a couple of lightning shifts, from excitement to disappointment to outward calm.</p><p>\u201cGood. Where are you staying? John and I will come and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa\u2019s here, too?\u201d William blurted, feeling like a fool. If he hadn\u2019t been so sensitive about his position and thus avoided anyone from the army, he would have learned that the 46th was part of Campbell\u2019s force in short order.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Hal said, with a touch of impatience. \u201cWhere else would he be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Dottie, looking for Ben\u2019s wife,\u201d William riposted smartly. \u201cIs she here, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His uncle looked displeased, but not altogether displeased. \u201cShe discovered that she was with child, so John very properly brought her back to New York\u2014and less properly consigned her to the care of her husband. She\u2019s presumably wherever Washington\u2019s troops are at the moment, unless that bloody Quaker\u2019s had the common sense to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Pardloe.\u201d A stout officer in a lieutenant colonel\u2019s uniform and an ornate double-curled wig stood in the doorway, looking mildly surprised. \u201cThought you\u2019d been taken ill, the way you dashed out.\u201d Despite the mild tone, there was an undercurrent in the man\u2019s voice that drove a two-penny nail into William\u2019s spine. This was Archibald Campbell, and from the visible frostiness with which he and Uncle Hal were viewing each other, Uncle Hal\u2019s value as a negotiator might not be what his nephew could hope.</p><p>Still, Uncle Hal could\u2014and did\u2014introduce William to Campbell, thus relieving him of the worry of producing adequate bona fides.</p> <p>\u201cYour servant, my lord,\u201d Campbell said, eyeing him suspiciously. He glanced over his shoulder, moving out of the way of a pair of servants carrying a massive wine cooler. \u201cI fear that dinner has nearly concluded, but if you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll have the servants provide a small supper for you in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir, I thank you,\u201d William said, bowing\u2014though the smell of food made his stomach gurgle. \u201cI took the liberty of coming to speak with you about a . . . um . . . an urgent matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Campbell looked displeased and wasn\u2019t troubling to hide it. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait until the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that it can, sir.\u201d He\u2019d had a look at the big oak on the edge of town, which he thought must be the one Fanny meant. As Jane\u2019s corpse wasn\u2019t hanging from it, he assumed she was still being held prisoner in the house nearby. But that was no assurance that they didn\u2019t mean to execute her at dawn. The army was rather fond of executing prisoners at dawn; start the day off in the right frame of mind . . .</p><p>He got hold of his racing thoughts and bowed again.</p><p>\u201cIt concerns a young woman, sir, who I understand was arrested earlier today, upon suspicion of\u2014of assault. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssault?\u201d Campbell\u2019s beetling brows shot up toward the furbelows of his wig. \u201cShe stabbed a man twenty-six times, then cut his throat in cold blood. If that\u2019s your notion of assault, I should hate to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this young woman, my lord?\u201d Uncle Hal put in, his tone formal and his face impassive.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Jane,\u201d William began, and stopped, having no idea what her last name might be. \u201cUh . . . Jane . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPocock, she says,\u201d put in Campbell. \u201cShe\u2019s a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA\u2014\u201d Hal cut his exclamation off one syllable too late. He narrowed his eyes at William.</p><p>\u201cShe is . . . under my protection,\u201d William said, as firmly as he could.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d drawled Campbell. He gave Uncle Hal a look of amused contempt, and Uncle Hal went white with suppressed fury\u2014most of which was not suppressed at all in the look he turned on William.</p><p>\u201cYes. Really,\u201d said William, aware that this was not brilliant but unable to think of anything better. \u201cI wish to speak on her behalf. Provide her with a solicitor,\u201d he added, rather wildly. \u201cI\u2019m sure she isn\u2019t guilty of the crime of which she\u2019s accused.\u201d</p><p>Campbell actually laughed, and William felt his ears burning with hot blood. He might have said something imprudent had Lord John not appeared at this juncture, as impeccably uniformed as his brother and looking mildly inquisitive.</p><p>\u201cAh, William,\u201d he said, as though he\u2019d quite expected to see his son here. His eyes flicked rapidly from face to face, obviously drawing conclusions about the tenor of the conversation, if not its subject. With scarcely a pause, he stepped forward and embraced William warmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here! I\u2019m delighted to see you,\u201d he said, smiling up at William. \u201cI have remarkable news! Will you excuse us for a moment, sir?\u201d he said to Campbell, and, not waiting for an answer, gripped William by the elbow, yanked open the front door, towed him out onto the wide veranda, and closed the door firmly behind them.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d Lord John said, low-voiced. \u201cAnd do it fast.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said, when William had blurted out an only slightly confused account of the situation. He rubbed a hand slowly over his face, thinking, and repeated, \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d William said, still upset but feeling some comfort at his father\u2019s presence. \u201cI\u2019d thought to talk to Campbell, but then when Uncle Hal was here, I hoped . . . but he and Campbell seem to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, their relationship could best be described as one of cordial hatred,\u201d Lord John agreed. \u201cArchibald Campbell is highly unlikely to do Hal any sort of favor, unless it was to escort him personally into the next southbound coach for hell.\u201d He blew out his breath and shook his head, as though to clear it of wine fumes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, William, I really don\u2019t. The girl\u2014she is a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d He looked helplessly at William for a moment, then squared his shoulders. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll do what I can, but I don\u2019t promise anything. There\u2019s a tavern on the square, called Tudy\u2019s. Go there and wait\u2014I rather think your presence will not be helpful in this discussion.\u201d</p><p>IT SEEMED FOREVER but must have been less than an hour when Lord John appeared at Tudy\u2019s. One look at his face told William that he hadn\u2019t been successful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said without preliminary, and sat down opposite William. He\u2019d come out without his hat and brushed at the raindrops caught in his hair. \u201cThe girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Jane,\u201d William interrupted. It seemed important that he insist on that, not let everyone just dismiss her as \u201cthe whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Jane Eleanora Pocock,\u201d his father agreed, with a brief nod. \u201cApparently she not only committed the crime but has confessed to it. A signed confession, no less. I read it.\u201d He rubbed a hand tiredly over his face. \u201cHer only objection was to the statement that she stabbed Harkness twenty-six times and cut his throat. According to her, she only stabbed him once before cutting his throat. People will exaggerate these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what she told me.\u201d William\u2019s throat felt tight. His father darted a glance at him but chose not to say anything in response to this. What he thought was all too clear, though.</p><p>\u201cShe was trying to save her young sister from being defiled by the man,\u201d he said, urgently defensive. \u201cAnd Harkness was a depraved sod who\u2019d used her\u2014Jane, I mean\u2014abominably! I heard him talk about it. It would have turned your stomach to hear him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d Lord John agreed. \u201cDangerous clients are one of the hazards of that profession. But was there no recourse available to her other than a carving knife? Most brothels that cater to soldiers have some means of rescuing the whores from . . . excessive importunity. And Miss Pocock, from what Colonel Campbell tells me, is a\u2014er\u2014an\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpensive piece. She is. Was.\u201d</p><p>William reached out blindly for the mug of beer he\u2019d been ignoring, took a huge gulp, and coughed convulsively. His father watched with some sympathy.</p><p>William at last drew breath and sat, staring at his fists, clenched on the table.</p><p>\u201cShe hated him,\u201d he said at last, low-voiced. \u201cAnd the madam wouldn\u2019t have kept her sister from him; he\u2019d paid for her maidenhead.\u201d</p><p>Lord John sighed and covered one of William\u2019s fists with his hand, squeezing.</p><p>\u201cDo you love the young woman, William?\u201d he asked, very quietly. The tavern wasn\u2019t busy, but there were enough men drinking there that no one was noticing them.</p><p>William shook his head, helpless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014tried to protect her. To save her from Harkness. I\u2014I bought her for the night. I didn\u2019t stop to think that he\u2019d come back\u2014but of course he would,\u201d he finished bitterly. \u201cI likely made things worse for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been a way of making them better, save marrying the girl or killing Harkness yourself,\u201d Lord John said dryly. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t recommend murder as a way of settling difficult situations. It tends to lead to complications\u2014but not nearly as many as marriage.\u201d He got up and went to the bar, returning with two steaming cups of hot rum punch.</p><p>\u201cDrink that,\u201d he said, pushing one in front of William. \u201cYou look chilled through.\u201d</p><p>He was; he\u2019d taken a table in a far corner, nowhere near the fire, and a fine, uncontrollable shiver was running through him, enough to ripple the surface of the punch when he wrapped his hand round the pewter cup. The punch was good, though made with preserved lemon peel, sweet, strong, and hot and made with good brandy as well as rum. He hadn\u2019t eaten anything in hours, and it warmed his stomach immediately.</p><p>They drank in silence\u2014what was there to say? There was no way of saving Jane, bar some sort of physical assault, and he couldn\u2019t ask his father or uncle to join or support him in that sort of desperate caper. He didn\u2019t think they\u2019d do it, for one thing. He believed in their considerable affection for him but knew quite well that they\u2019d see it as their duty to prevent him committing folly that could well prove fatal.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t have been entirely in vain, you know,\u201d Lord John said quietly. \u201cShe did save her sister.\u201d</p><p>William nodded, unable to speak. The thought of seeing Fanny in the morning, only to tell her\u2014and then what? Must he stand beside her and watch Jane be hanged? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord John stood up and, without asking, went back to the bar for another pair of drinks. William looked at the gently steaming cup set before him and then at his father.</p><p>\u201cYou think you bloody know me, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said, but with true affection in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do think that, William,\u201d said his father, in the same tone. \u201cDrink your drink.\u201d</p><p>William smiled and, rising, clapped his father on the shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you do, at that. I\u2019ll see you in the morning, Papa.\u201d</p><p>LAST RESORT</p><p>IWAS LYING IN bed beside Jamie, drowsily wondering on what grounds I could induce Mrs. Weisenheimer to collect her urine for me. She suffered from gallstones, for which the most effective herbal treatment I had was bearberry. Fortunately, Mr. Jameson had some of the dried leaf in stock. One had to be careful in using it, though, because it contained arbutin, which hydrolyzed to hydroquinone\u2014a very effective urinary antiseptic, but dangerously toxic. On the other hand . . . it was an effective skin lightener, if applied topically.</p><p>I yawned and decided that it wasn\u2019t worth the bother of making Jamie come to the surgery and talk to Mrs. Weisenheimer in German about her urine. He\u2019d do it if I asked, but I\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>I dismissed the idea and rolled over, cuddling against Jamie, who was peacefully asleep on his back, as usual, but who half-woke at my touch, patted me clumsily, curled round me, and fell soundly asleep again at once. Ninety seconds later, there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>\u201cIfrinn!\u201d Jamie shot bolt upright, rubbed a hand roughly over his face, and threw back the covers. Groaning, I followed suit less athletically, crawling out of bed and groping blindly for my knitted slippers.</p><p>\u201cLet me go. It\u2019s probably for me.\u201d At this hour of the night, a knock at the door was more likely someone with a medical emergency than one involving salt fish or horses, but given the military occupation of the city, one never knew.</p><p>One certainly hadn\u2019t anticipated opening the door to find William standing on the other side of it, looking pale and feral.</p><p>\u201cIs Mr. Fraser at home?\u201d he said tersely. \u201cI need his help.\u201d</p><p>FRASER HAD DRESSED at once, taken up a belt with a sheathed dirk and a leather bag upon it, and fastened this round his waist without question. He was wearing Highland dress, William saw, a much-worn, faded plaid. He gathered up a fold of it around his shoulders, nodding toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best go down to my wife\u2019s surgery,\u201d he said softly, nodding toward the thin wall, the laths clearly visible through its plaster. \u201cYe can tell me there what\u2019s to do.\u201d</p> <p>William followed him through the rain-slicked streets, water like cold tears on his cheeks. Inside, he felt parched and dry, cracked leather wrapped around a core of solid terror. Fraser didn\u2019t speak on the way but clutched him once by the elbow, pushing him into a narrow space between two buildings, just as an army patrol came round the corner. He pressed hard against the wall, shoulder to shoulder with Fraser, and felt the man\u2019s denseness and warmth as a shock.</p><p>In the back of his mind was the memory of having been small and lost in the fog on the fells of the Lake District. Cold and terrified, he\u2019d fallen into a rocky hollow and lain there, frozen, hearing ghosts in the mist. And then the overwhelming relief of Mac\u2019s finding him, of the enveloping warmth of the groom\u2019s arms.</p><p>He shoved the memory impatiently aside, but a lingering sense of something that wasn\u2019t quite hope remained when the last of the boots trampled out of hearing and Fraser slid from their hiding place, beckoning him to follow.</p><p>The small surgery was cold and dark, smelling of herbs and medicines and old blood. There was a sweetish smell, too, strange but familiar, and after a moment\u2019s disorientation, he realized that it must be ether; he\u2019d smelled it on Mother Claire and Denzell Hunter when they\u2019d operated on his cousin Henry.</p><p>Fraser had locked the door behind them and found a candlestick in the cupboard. He handed this to William, took a tinderbox from the same cupboard, and set the candle alight with a brisk efficiency. The wavering light shone up into his face, and the boldness of his features sprang into view: long straight nose and heavy brows, broad cheekbones and the fine deep modeling of jaw and temple. It was damnably queer to see the resemblance so marked and so close, but at the moment William actually found it an odd comfort.</p><p>Fraser set the candlestick on the table and motioned William to one of the two stools, taking the other.</p><p>\u201cTell me, then,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s safe here; no one will hear. I gather it\u2019s a dangerous matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife and death,\u201d William said, and, with a deep breath, began.</p> <p>Fraser listened with complete attention, his eyes fixed intently on William\u2019s face as he talked. When he had finished, there was a moment of silence. Then Fraser nodded once, as if to himself.</p><p>\u201cThis young woman,\u201d he said. \u201cMay I know what she is to you?\u201d</p><p>William hesitated, not knowing what to say. What was Jane to him? Not a friend, nor yet a lover. And yet . . .</p><p>\u201cShe\u2014I took her and her sister under my protection,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they left Philadelphia with the army.\u201d</p><p>Fraser nodded as though this was a perfectly adequate explanation of the situation.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye know that your uncle and his regiment are with the occupying army? That he\u2019s here, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I spoke with my\u2014with Lord John and Pardloe. They aren\u2019t able to help. I\u2014have resigned my commission,\u201d he felt compelled to add. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t anything to do with why they can\u2019t help, only that I\u2019m not subject any longer to military command myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I saw ye weren\u2019t in uniform,\u201d he said. He drummed the fingers of his right hand briefly on the tabletop, and William saw with surprise that the ring finger was missing, a thick scar down the back of the hand. Fraser saw him notice.</p><p>\u201cSaratoga,\u201d he said, with the flicker of something that might have been a smile in other circumstances.</p><p>William felt a small shock at the word, things unnoticed at the time suddenly returning to him. Himself kneeling through the night beside Brigadier Simon Fraser\u2019s deathbed and a tall man on the other side, a white bandage on his hand, leaning down from the shadows to say something softly in the Scottish tongue to the brigadier, who replied in the same language.</p><p>\u201cThe brigadier,\u201d he said, and stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cMy kinsman,\u201d Fraser said. He delicately forbore to add, \u201cAnd yours,\u201d but William made that connection easily. He felt it as a distant echo of grief, a pebble dropped in water, but that could wait.</p><p>\u201cIs the young woman\u2019s life worth yours?\u201d Fraser asked. \u201cBecause I think that consideration is likely what lies behind your\u2014your other kinsmen\u2019s\u201d\u2014the corner of his mouth twitched, though William couldn\u2019t tell whether with humor or distaste\u2014\u201cfailure to help ye.\u201d</p><p>William felt hot blood rise in his face, anger supplanting desperation.</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t fail me. They couldn\u2019t help. Are you saying that you will not help me, either, sir? Or can\u2019t? Are you afraid of the venture?\u201d</p><p>Fraser gave him a quelling look; William registered this but didn\u2019t care. He was on his feet, fists clenched.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother, then. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf ye thought ye could, ye\u2019d never have come to me, lad,\u201d Fraser said evenly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you call me \u2018lad,\u2019 you, you\u2014\u201d William choked off the epithet, not out of prudence but out of inability to choose among the several that sprang at once to his mind.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Fraser said, not raising his voice but infusing it with an air of command that made it unthinkable\u2014or at least uncomfortable\u2014to disobey. William glared at him. His chest was heaving and yet he couldn\u2019t draw enough breath to speak. He didn\u2019t sit down, but he did uncurl his fists and stand still. At last he managed a jerky nod. Fraser drew a long, visible breath and let it out slowly, white in the chill of the dark little room.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. Tell me where she is and what ye ken of the physical situation.\u201d He glanced at the shuttered window, where oozing damp showed black between the slats as the rain seeped through. \u201cThe night\u2019s not long enough.\u201d</p><p>THEY WENT TO the warehouse where Fraser worked, down by the river. Fraser left William outside to keep watch, unlocked a man door at the side, and slid through it with no sound, reappearing a few minutes later dressed in rough breeches and a shirt that didn\u2019t fit him, carrying a small burlap bag and two large black kerchiefs. He handed one of these to William and, folding the other diagonally, tied it round his face, covering nose and mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs this truly necessary?\u201d William tied on his own kerchief but felt slightly ridiculous, as though dressing up for some bizarre pantomime.</p><p>\u201cYe can go without if ye like,\u201d Fraser advised him, taking a knitted wool cap out of the bag, tucking his hair up under it, and then pulling it down over his eyebrows. \u201cI canna risk being recognized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think the risk too great\u2014\u201d William began, an edge in his voice, but Fraser stopped him, gripping his arm.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ve a claim to my help,\u201d he said, voice low and brusque. \u201cFor any venture ye deem worthy. But I\u2019ve a family who have a claim to my protection. I canna leave them to starve if I\u2019m taken.\u201d</p><p>William had no chance to reply to this; Fraser had locked the door and was already walking off, beckoning impatiently. He did think about it, though, following the Scot through the mist that rose knee-high in the streets. It had stopped raining; that was one thing in their favor.</p><p>\u201cFor any venture ye deem worthy.\u201d Not a word about Jane\u2019s being a whore or about her being a confessed murderess. Perhaps it was that Fraser himself was a criminal and felt some sympathy on that account.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s just that he\u2019s willing to take my word that I have to do it. And willing to take the devil of a risk to help me.</p><p>But such thoughts could do no good now, and he put them out of his mind. They hurried on, soft-footed and faceless, through the empty squares of Savannah, toward the house by the hanging tree.</p><p>\u201cI DINNA SUPPOSE ye ken which room is hers?\u201d Jamie murmured to William. They were loitering under the big live oak, concealed not only by its shadows but by the long beards of Spanish moss that hung from its branches and the mist that drifted under them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait here.\u201d Fraser disappeared in that unnerving catlike way of his. Left to his own devices and further unnerved by the silence, William thought to explore the contents of the bag Fraser had left on the ground. These proved to be several sheets of paper and a stoppered vial of what\u2014un-stoppered\u2014proved to be treacle.</p><p>He was still puzzling over that when Fraser was back, as suddenly as he\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no but one guard on the house, at the front,\u201d he said, moving close enough to whisper into William\u2019s ear. \u201cAnd all the windows are dark, save one upstairs. There\u2019s a single candle burning; it must be hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d William whispered back, startled.</p><p>Fraser hesitated for a moment, but then said, even more quietly, \u201cI once spent a night expecting to be hanged the next morning. I wouldna have spent it in darkness, given the choice. Come on.\u201d</p><p>It was a two-story house and, while fairly large, simply built. Two rooms on the upper floor at the back, two at the front. The shutters of the upper windows were open, and the glow of a candle flickered in the right-hand room at the back. Fraser insisted on circling the house\u2014at a cautious distance, darting from bush to tree to bush\u2014to be sure of the guard\u2019s position. The man, armed with a musket slung across his back, was on the veranda that ran across the front of the house. Judging from his build, he was young, probably younger than William. And by his posture, which was careless in the extreme, he wasn\u2019t expecting any trouble.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose they thought a whore would have any friends,\u201d William said under his breath, getting a brief Scottish grunt in return. Fraser beckoned and led him round the back of the house.</p><p>They passed a window that likely belonged to the kitchen; there were no curtains, and he could see the faint light of a smothered hearth deep inside, just visible through the shutters. There\u2019d be a risk that one or more slaves or servants slept in the kitchen, though\u2014and he was pleased to see that Fraser appeared to be going on that assumption. They moved around the next corner of the house, as quietly as possible.</p><p>Fraser pressed his ear to the shutters of a large window but appeared to hear nothing. He fitted the blade of his stout knife between the shutters and, with some difficulty, levered the bolt up out of its brackets. He gestured to William to come and lean hard on the shutter, to keep the bolt from falling suddenly, and with a joint effort composed of dumb-show and frantic gestures\u2014that would likely have seemed comic to anyone not involved in performing it\u2014they succeeded in getting the bloody shutters open without too much racket.</p><p>The window behind was curtained\u2014all to the good\u2014but a casement, with a thumb latch that wouldn\u2019t yield to Jamie\u2019s knife. The big Scot was sweating; he pulled his cap off for a moment to wipe his brow, then put it back on, and, taking the treacle from the bag, he un-stoppered the bottle and poured some of the sticky syrup into his hand. This he smeared over a pane of the casement and, taking a sheet of paper, pasted it onto the glass.</p><p>William could make no sense of this proceeding, but Fraser drew back his arm and struck the glass a sharp buffet with his fist. It broke with no more than a small cracking noise, and the shattered pieces were removed easily, stuck to the treacled paper.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn that one?\u201d William whispered, deeply impressed, and heard a small chuckle of satisfaction from behind Fraser\u2019s mask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy daughter told me about it,\u201d he whispered in reply, laying glass and paper on the ground. \u201cShe read it in a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d William stopped abruptly, and so did his heart. He\u2019d forgotten. \u201cYour . . . daughter. You mean\u2014I have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Fraser said briefly. \u201cYe\u2019ve met her. Come on.\u201d He reached through the hole in the glass, undid the catch, and pulled on the window frame. The window swung open, with an unexpected loud screech of unoiled hinges.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d William said, under his breath.</p> <p>Fraser had said something that William assumed was the equivalent sentiment in Gaelic, but he didn\u2019t waste time. He shoved William back against the wall and, with a hissed \u201cStay there!\u201d, faded into the night.</p><p>William plastered himself against the wall, heart hammering. He could hear rapid footsteps clattering down the wooden steps from the veranda, then muffled thumps on the damp ground.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d the guard shouted, as he rounded the house. Seeing William, he shouldered his musket and took aim. And Fraser came out of the dark mist like an angry ghost, grabbed the boy by the shoulder, and laid him out with a rock slammed into the back of his skull.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d he said, low-voiced, jerking his chin toward the open window as he lowered the guard\u2019s limp body to the ground. William wasted no time but heaved himself into the house, squirming across the sill to land almost soundlessly, squatting on the carpet of what must be a parlor, to judge from the dim outlines of the furniture. An unseen clock ticked accusingly, somewhere in the darkness.</p><p>Fraser hoisted himself into the open window frame and paused for a moment, listening. But there was no sound in the house save the ticking clock, and he hopped lightly down inside.</p> <p>\u201cYe dinna ken whose house this is?\u201d he whispered to William, looking round.</p><p>William shook his head. It must be an officer\u2019s billet, but he had no idea who the officer might be\u2014probably the major in charge of disciplinary matters. Presumably Campbell had lodged Jane here as an alternative to putting her in the camp\u2019s stockade. Thoughtful of him.</p><p>His eyes had adapted quickly; there was a dark oblong a few feet away\u2014the door. Fraser saw it, too; his hand rested on William\u2019s back for an instant, pushing him toward it.</p><p>There was an oval lozenge of glass set into the front door, and enough light came through it to show them the painted canvas floorcloth running down the hall, its diamond pattern black in the colorless light. Near the door, a pool of shadow hid the foot of the staircase, and within seconds they were creeping up the stairs, as quickly and as quietly as two very large men in a hurry could go.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d William was in the lead; he motioned to Fraser as he turned to the left. The blood was beating in his head, and he could scarcely breathe. He wanted to tear off the clinging mask and gulp air, but not yet . . . not yet.</p><p>Jane. Had she heard the guard call out? If she was awake, she must have heard them on the stair.</p> <p>The landing was windowless and very dark, but there was a faint glow of candlelight under Jane\u2019s door\u2014he hoped to God it was Jane\u2019s door. Running a hand down the doorframe, he felt the knob, and his hand closed round it. It was locked, naturally\u2014but in trying the knob, the heel of his hand brushed the key, still in the lock.</p><p>Fraser was behind him; he could hear the man\u2019s breathing. Behind the door of the next room, someone was snoring in a reassuringly regular sort of way. So long as the guard stayed out long enough . . .</p><p>\u201cJane,\u201d he whispered as loudly as he dared, putting his lips to the crack between the door and its jamb. \u201cJane! It\u2019s me, William. Be quiet!\u201d</p><p>He thought he heard a swift intake of breath from the other side of the door, though it might have been only the sound of his own blood racing in his ears. With infinite care, he pulled the door toward him and turned the key.</p><p>The candle was standing on a small bureau, its flame flickering wildly in the draft from the open door. There was a strong smell of beer; a broken bottle lay on the floor, brown glass a-glitter in the wavering light. The bed was rumpled, bedclothes hanging half off the mattress . . . Where was Jane? He whirled, expecting to see her cowering in the corner, frightened by his entrance.</p><p>He saw her hand first. She was lying on the floor by the bed, beside the broken bottle, her hand flung out, white and half open as though in supplication.</p><p>\u201cA Dhia,\u201d Fraser whispered behind him, and now he could smell the cut-steel reek of blood, mingled with beer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t remember falling on his knees or lifting her up in his arms. She was heavy, limp and awkward, all the grace and heat of her gone and her cheek cold to his hand. Only her hair was still Jane, shining in the candlelight, soft against his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHere, a bhalaich.\u201d A hand touched his shoulder, and he turned without thought.</p><p>Fraser had pulled the mask down around his neck, and his face was serious, intent. \u201cWe havena much time,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak. They straightened the bedclothes in silence, put a clean quilt over the worst of the blood, and laid her on it. William wetted his kerchief from the ewer and cleaned the spatters of blood from her face and hands. He hesitated for a moment, then tore the kerchief violently in two and bandaged her torn wrists, then crossed her hands on her breast.</p><p>Jamie Fraser was by him then, with a fugitive gleam from the blade of his knife.</p><p>\u201cFor her sister,\u201d he said, and, bending, cut a lock of the shining chestnut hair. He put this into the pocket of the ragged breeches and went quietly out. William heard the brief creak of his footsteps on the stair and understood that he had been left to make his farewell in privacy.</p><p>He looked upon her face by candlelight for the first time, and the last. He felt emptied, hollow as a gutted deer. With no notion what to say, he touched one black-bound hand and spoke the truth, in a voice too low for any but the dead to hear.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to save you, Jane. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>LAST RITES</p><p>JAMIE CAME HOME just before dawn, white-faced and chilled to the bone. I wasn\u2019t asleep. I hadn\u2019t slept since he\u2019d left with William, and when I heard his step on the creaking stairs, I scooped hot water from the ever-simmering cauldron into the wooden mug I had ready, half filled with cheap whisky and a spoonful of honey. I\u2019d thought he\u2019d need it, but I hadn\u2019t had any idea how much.</p><p>\u201cThe lassie had cut her wrists wi\u2019 a broken bottle,\u201d he said, crouching on a stool by the fire, a quilt draped over his shoulders and the warm mug cupped between his big hands. He couldn\u2019t stop shivering.</p><p>\u201cGod rest her soul and forgive her the sin of despair.\u201d He closed his eyes and shook his head violently, as though to dispel his memory of what he\u2019d seen in that candlelit room. \u201cOh, Jesus, my poor lad.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d made him go to bed and crawled in to warm him with my body, but I hadn\u2019t slept then, either. I didn\u2019t feel the need of it. There were things that would need to be done when the day came; I could feel them waiting, a patient throng. William. The dead girl. And Jamie had said something about the girl\u2019s young sister. . . . But for the moment, time was still, balanced on the cusp of night. I lay beside Jamie and listened to him breathe. For the moment, that was enough.</p><p>BUT THE SUN rose, as it always did.</p><p>I was stirring the breakfast porridge when William appeared, bringing with him a mud-smeared young girl who looked like a lightning-blasted tree. William didn\u2019t look any better but seemed less likely to fall to bits.</p><p>\u201cThis is Frances,\u201d he said, in a low, hoarse voice, putting a large paw on her shoulder. \u201cThese are Mr. and Mrs. Fraser, Fanny.\u201d She was so fine-boned that I half-expected her to stagger under the weight of his hand, but she didn\u2019t. After a stunned moment, she realized the introduction and gave a jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cSit down, sweetheart,\u201d I said, smiling at her. \u201cThe porridge is almost ready, and there\u2019s toasted bread with honey.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me, blinking dully. Her eyes were red and swollen, her hair lank under a tattered cap. I thought she was so shocked that she was unable to comprehend anything. William looked as though someone had hit him on the head, stunning him like an ox bound for slaughter. I looked uncertainly at Jamie, not knowing what to do for either of them. He glanced from one to the other, then rose and quietly took the girl into his arms.</p><p>\u201cThere, a nighean,\u201d he said quietly, patting her back. His eyes met Willie\u2019s and I saw something pass between them\u2014a question asked and answered. Jamie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll care for her,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. She . . . Jane,\u201d William said with difficulty. \u201cI want to\u2014to bury her. Decently. But I think I can\u2019t . . . claim her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see to it. Go and do whatever ye need to do. Come back when ye can.\u201d</p><p>William stood a moment longer, red-rimmed eyes fixed on the girl\u2019s back, then gave me an abrupt bow and left. At the sound of his departing footsteps, Frances gave a small, despairing howl, like an orphaned puppy. Jamie wrapped her closer in his arms, holding her snug against his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right, a nighean,\u201d he said softly, though his eyes were fixed on the door through which William had gone. \u201cYe\u2019re at home now.\u201d</p><p>I DIDN\u2019T REALIZE that Fanny was tongue-tied, until I took her to see Colonel Campbell. She hadn\u2019t spoken at all until that point, merely shaking her head yes or no, making small motions of refusal or gratitude.</p><p>\u201cYou kilt my thither!\u201d she said loudly, when Campbell rose from his desk to greet us. He blinked and sat back down.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said, eyeing her warily. She wasn\u2019t crying, but her face was blotched and swollen, as if someone had slapped her repeatedly. She stood very straight, though, small fists clenched, and glared at him. He looked at me. I shrugged slightly.</p><p>\u201cThe\u2019th dead,\u201d Fanny said. \u201cThe wath your prithoner!\u201d</p><p>Campbell steepled his hands and cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask who you are, child? And who your sister is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Frances Pocock,\u201d I put in hastily. \u201cHer sister was Jane Pocock, who I understand . . . died last night, while in your custody. She would like to claim her sister\u2019s body, for burial.\u201d</p><p>Campbell gave me a bleak look.</p><p>\u201cI see that news travels fast. And you are, madam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of the family,\u201d I said, as firmly as possible. \u201cMy name is Mrs. James Fraser.\u201d</p><p>His face shifted a little; he\u2019d heard the name. That probably wasn\u2019t a good thing.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Fraser,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you. You dispense pox cures to the city\u2019s whores, do you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong . . . other things, yes,\u201d I said, rather taken aback by this description of my medical practice. Still, it seemed to offer him a logical connection between Fanny and me, for he glanced from one of us to the other, nodding to himself.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the\u2014er\u2014the body has been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t oo call my thither \u2018the body\u2019!\u201d Fanny shouted. \u201cHer name ith Jane!\u201d</p><p>Commanders, as a rule, aren\u2019t used to being shouted at, and Campbell appeared to be no exception. His square face flushed and he put his hands flat on the desk, preparing to rise. Before he got the seat of his breeches clear of his chair, though, his aide came in and coughed discreetly.</p><p>\u201cI beg pardon, sir; Lieutenant Colonel Lord John Grey wishes to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he, indeed.\u201d This didn\u2019t seem to be welcome news to Campbell, but it was to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re clearly busy, sir,\u201d I said quickly, seizing Fanny by the arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back later.\u201d And without waiting to be dismissed, I more or less dragged her out of the office.</p><p>Sure enough, John was standing in the anteroom, in full uniform. His face was calmly pleasant and I saw that he was in diplomatic mode, but his expression altered the instant he saw me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he blurted. \u201cAnd\u201d\u2014glancing at Fanny\u2014\u201cwho the devil is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know about Jane?\u201d I said, grabbing him by the sleeve. \u201cWhat happened to her last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to claim her body, for burial. Can you help?\u201d</p><p>He detached my hand, courteously, and brushed his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI can, yes. I\u2019m here upon the same errand. I\u2019ll send word\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you,\u201d I said hastily, seeing the aide frown in my direction. \u201cOutside. Come, Fanny!\u201d</p><p>Outside, we found a place to wait on an ornamental bench set in the formal front garden. Even in winter, it was a pleasant spot, with several palmetto trees popping out of the shrubbery like so many Japanese parasols, and even the presence of a number of soldiers coming and going didn\u2019t much impair the sense of gracious peace. Fanny, though, was in no mood for peace.</p><p>\u201cWho wath that?\u201d she demanded, twisting to look back at the house. \u201cWhat doth he want wif Jane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . that\u2019s William\u2019s father,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cLord John Grey is his name. I imagine William asked him to come.\u201d</p><p>Fanny blinked for a moment, then turned a remarkably penetrating pair of brown eyes on me, red-rimmed and bloodshot but decidedly intelligent.</p><p>\u201cHe doethn\u2019t wook wike Wiyum,\u201d she said. \u201cMither Fwather wooks a wot wike Wiyum.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed that. Do you mind not talking for a bit, Fanny? I need to think.\u201d</p><p>JOHN CAME OUT about ten minutes later. He paused on the steps, looking around, and I waved. He came down to where we sat and at once bowed very formally to Fanny.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Miss Frances,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand from Colonel Campbell that you are the sister of Miss Pocock; please allow me to offer my deepest condolences.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He spoke very simply and honestly, and Fanny\u2019s eyes welled up with tears.</p><p>\u201cCan I have huh?\u201d she said softly. \u201cPwease?\u201d</p><p>Heedless of his immaculate breeches, he knelt on the ground in front of her and took her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart,\u201d he said, just as softly. \u201cOf course you can.\u201d He patted her hand. \u201cWill you wait here, just for a moment, while I speak with Mrs. Fraser?\u201d He stood and, as an afterthought, pulled a large snowy handkerchief out of his sleeve and handed it to her with another small bow.</p> <p>\u201cPoor child,\u201d he said, taking my hand and tucking it into the curve of his elbow. \u201cOr children\u2014the other girl can\u2019t have been more than seventeen.\u201d We walked for a few paces, down a small brick walk between empty flower beds, until we were safely out of earshot of both street and house. \u201cI take it that William sought Jamie\u2019s help. I thought he might, though I hoped he wouldn\u2019t, for both their sakes.\u201d</p><p>His face was shadowed, and there were blue smudges under his eyes; evidently he\u2019d had a disturbed night, too.</p><p>\u201cWhere is William, do you know?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. He said he had an errand outside the city but would return tonight.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder at the house. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged for . . . Jane . . . to be appropriately tended. She cannot be buried in a churchyard, of course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I murmured, angry at the thought. He noticed but cleared his throat and went on.</p> <p>\u201cI know a family with a small private cemetery. I believe I can make arrangement for a quiet burial. Quickly, of course; tomorrow, very early?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, getting a grip on myself. It wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been very good,\u201d I said. Worry and the lack of sleep were catching up with me; things seemed oddly non-dimensional, as though trees and people and garden furniture were merely pasted onto a painted backdrop. I shook my head to clear it, though; there were important things to be said.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you something,\u201d I said. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t, but there it is. Ezekiel Richardson came to my surgery the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil he did.\u201d John had stiffened at the name. \u201cHe\u2019s not with the army here, surely? I would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not with your army.\u201d I told him, as briefly as I could, what Richardson now was\u2014or, rather, was revealed to be; God only knew how long he\u2019d been a Rebel spy\u2014and what his intentions were toward Hal and the Grey family in general.</p> <p>John listened, his face quietly intent, though the corner of his mouth twitched when I described Richardson\u2019s plan to influence Hal\u2019s political actions.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d I said dryly, seeing that. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s ever actually met Hal. But the important thing . . .\u201d I hesitated, but he had to know.</p><p>\u201cHe knows about you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat you . . . are. I mean that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I am,\u201d he repeated, expressionless. His eyes had been fastened on my face to this point; now he looked away. \u201cI see.\u201d He took a deep breath and let it out slowly.</p><p>John was a distinguished soldier and an honorable gentleman, member of an ancient noble family. He was also a homosexual, in a time when that particular attribute was a capital offense. For that knowledge to be in the hands of a man who meant ill to him and his family . . . I wasn\u2019t under any illusions about what I\u2019d just done\u2014with three words, I\u2019d shown him that he was standing on a very narrow tightrope over a very deep pit, with Richardson holding the end of the rope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, John,\u201d I said, very softly. I touched his arm, and he laid his hand briefly over mine, squeezed it gently, and smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He stared at the brick paving under his feet for a moment, then looked up. \u201cDo you know how he came by the\u2014information?\u201d He spoke calmly, but a nerve was jumping just under his injured eye, a tiny twitch. I wanted to put my finger on it, still it. But there was nothing I could do.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I looked back at the distant bench. Fanny was still there, a small, desolate figure, head bent. I turned my gaze back to John; his brow was creased, thinking.</p> <p>\u201cOne last thing. Hal\u2019s daughter-in-law, the young woman with the odd name\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmaranthus,\u201d he interrupted, and smiled wryly. \u201cYes, what about her? Don\u2019t tell me that Ezekiel Richardson invented her for his own purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past him, but probably not.\u201d I told him what I\u2019d learned from Mr. Jameson.</p><p>\u201cI told William day before yesterday,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what with everything\u201d\u2014I waved a hand, encompassing Fanny, Jane, Colonel Campbell, and a few other things\u2014\u201cI doubt he\u2019s had time to go to Saperville to look for her. You don\u2019t suppose that\u2019s the errand he spoke of, do you?\u201d I asked, struck by the thought.</p><p>\u201cGod knows.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his face, then straightened. \u201cI must go. I\u2019ll have to tell Hal a few things. Not . . . that, I don\u2019t think,\u201d he said, seeing my face. \u201cBut obviously there are things he needs to know, and know quickly. God bless you, my dear. I\u2019ll send word about tomorrow.\u201d He took my hand, kissed it very gently, and let go.</p><p>I watched him walk away, his back very straight, the scarlet of his coat bright as blood against the grays and faded greens of the winter garden.</p><p>WE BURIED JANE on the morning of a dull, cold day. The sky was sodden with low gray clouds, and a raw wind blew in from the sea. It was a small private burying ground, belonging to a large house that stood outside the city.</p><p>All of us came with Fanny: Rachel and Ian, Jenny, Fergus and Marsali\u2014even the girls and Germain. I worried a bit; they couldn\u2019t help but feel the echoes of Henri-Christian\u2019s death. But death was a fact of life and a common one, and while they stood solemn and pale amongst the adults, they were composed. Fanny was not so much composed as completely numb, I thought; she\u2019d wept all the tears her small body could hold and was white and stiff as a bleached stick.</p><p>John came, dressed in his uniform (in case anyone became inquisitive and tried to disturb us, he explained to me in an undertone). The coffin-maker had had only adult coffins to hand; Jane\u2019s shrouded body looked so like a chrysalis, I half-expected to hear a dry rattling sound when the men picked it up. Fanny had declined to look upon her sister\u2019s face one last time, and I thought that was as well.</p><p>There was no priest or minister; she was a suicide, and this was ground hallowed only by respect. When the last of the dirt had been shoveled in, we stood quiet, waiting, the harsh wind flurrying our hair and garments.</p><p>Jamie took a deep breath and a step to the head of the grave. He spoke the Gaelic prayer called the Death Dirge, but in English, for the sake of Fanny and Lord John.</p><p>Thou goest home this night to thy home of winter,</p><p>To thy home of autumn, of spring, and of summer;</p><p>Thou goest home this night to thy perpetual home,</p><p>To thine eternal bed, to thine eternal slumber.</p><p>Sleep thou, sleep, and away with thy sorrow,</p><p>Sleep thou, sleep, and away with thy sorrow,</p><p>Sleep thou, sleep, and away with thy sorrow,</p><p>Sleep, thou beloved, in the Rock of the fold.</p><p>The shade of death lies upon thy face, beloved,</p><p>But the Jesus of grace has His hand round about thee;</p><p>In nearness to the Trinity farewell to thy pains,</p><p>Christ stands before thee and peace is in His mind.</p><p>Jenny, Ian, Fergus, and Marsali joined in, murmuring the final verse with him.</p><p>Sleep, O sleep in the calm of all calm,</p><p>Sleep, O sleep in the guidance of guidance,</p><p>Sleep, O sleep in the love of all loves,</p><p>Sleep, O beloved, in the Lord of life,</p><p>Sleep, O beloved, in the God of life!</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until we turned to go that I saw William. He was standing just outside the wrought-iron fence that enclosed the burying ground, tall and somber in a dark cloak, the wind stirring the dark tail of his hair. He was holding the reins of a very large mare with a back as broad as a barn door. As I came out of the burying ground, holding Fanny\u2019s hand, he came toward us, the horse obligingly following him.</p><p>\u201cThis is Miranda,\u201d he said to Fanny. His face was white and carved with grief, but his voice was steady. \u201cShe\u2019s yours now. You\u2019ll need her.\u201d He took Fanny\u2019s limp hand, put the reins into it, and closed her fingers over them. Then he looked at me, wisps of hair blowing across his face. \u201cWill you look after her, Mother Claire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we will,\u201d I said, my throat tight. \u201cWhere are you going, William?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, very faintly.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, and walked away.</p><p>Fanny was staring up at Miranda in complete incomprehension. I gently took the reins from her, patted the horse\u2019s jaw, and turned to find Jamie. He was just inside the fence, talking with Marsali; the others had come out already and were standing in a cold little cluster, Ian and Fergus talking with Lord John, while Jenny shepherded the children\u2014all of whom were staring at Fanny.</p><p>Jamie was frowning a little, but at last he nodded and, bending forward, kissed Marsali on the forehead and came out. He raised one eyebrow when he saw Miranda, and I explained.</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, with a glance at Fanny. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more?\u201d There was an odd tone to his voice, and I looked at him in inquiry.</p><p>\u201cMarsali asked me if we\u2019d take Germain,\u201d he said, drawing Fanny in against him in a sheltering hug, as if this were a common thing.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I glanced over my shoulder at the rest of the family. \u201cWhy?\u201d We had all discussed the matter at some length the night before and concluded that we wouldn\u2019t wait until spring to leave Savannah. With the city occupied, there was no chance of Fergus and Marsali resuming publication of their newspaper, and with Colonel Richardson lurking behind the scenes, the place was beginning to seem distinctly dangerous.</p><p>We would all travel together to Charleston, get Fergus and Marsali established there, and then the rest of us would go on north to Wilmington, where we would begin to equip ourselves for the trip into the mountains when the snows began to melt in March.</p><p>\u201cYe told them, Sassenach,\u201d Jamie said, scratching Miranda\u2019s forelock with his free hand. \u201cWhat the war would be, and how long it would last. Germain\u2019s of an age when he\u2019ll be out and in the thick o\u2019 things. Marsali\u2019s worrit that he\u2019ll come to harm, loose in a city where the sorts of things happen that do happen in wartime. God knows the mountains may be no safer\u201d\u2014he grimaced, obviously recalling a few incidents that had taken place there\u2014\u201cbut on the whole, he\u2019s likely better off not being in a place where he could be conscripted by the militia or pressed into the British navy.\u201d</p><p>I looked down the gravel path that led to the house; Germain had drifted away from his mother, grandmother, Rachel, and his sisters and joined Ian and Fergus in conversation with Lord John.</p><p>\u201cAye, he kens he\u2019s a man,\u201d Jamie said dryly, following the direction of my gaze. \u201cCome along, a leannan,\u201d he said to Fanny. \u201cIt\u2019s time we all had breakfast.\u201d</p><p>AMARANTHUS</p><p>Saperville</p><p>January 15, 1779</p><p>SAPERVILLE WAS DIFFICULT to find but, once found, small enough that it was a matter of only three inquiries to discover the residence of a widow named Grey.</p><p>\u201cOver there.\u201d Hal reined up, nodding toward a house that stood a hundred yards back from the road in the shade of an enormous magnolia tree. He was being casual, but John could see the muscle twitching in his brother\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . I suppose we just go up and knock, then.\u201d He turned his own horse\u2019s head in at the rutted lane, taking stock of the place as they walked toward it. It was a rather shabby house, the front veranda sagging at one corner where its foundation had given way, and half its few windows boarded over. Still, the place was occupied; the chimney was smoking fitfully, in a way suggesting that it hadn\u2019t been recently swept.</p><p>The door was opened to them by a slattern. A white woman, but one clothed in a stained wrapper and felt slippers, with wary eyes and a sourly downturned mouth whose corners showed the stains of tobacco chewing.</p><p>\u201cIs Mrs. Grey at home?\u201d Hal inquired politely.</p><p>\u201cNobody o\u2019 that name here,\u201d the woman said, and made to shut the door, this action being prevented by Hal\u2019s boot.</p><p>\u201cWe were directed to this address, madam,\u201d Hal said, the politeness diminishing markedly. \u201cBe so good as to inform Mrs. Grey that she has visitors, please.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cAnd who in tarnation are you, Mr. Fancy Pants?\u201d</p><p>John\u2019s estimation of the woman\u2019s nerve rose considerably at this, but he thought he ought to intervene before Hal started wheezing.</p><p>\u201cThis is His Grace the Duke of Pardloe, madam,\u201d he said, with maximum politeness. Her face altered at once, though not for the better. Her jaw hardened, but a predatory gleam came into her eye.</p><p>\u201cElle conna\u00eet votre nom,\u201d he said to Hal. She knows your name.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d his brother snapped. \u201cMadam\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever he would have said was interrupted by the sudden shrieking of a baby, somewhere upstairs.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, madam,\u201d Lord John said politely to the slattern, and, seizing her by the elbows, walked her backward into the house, whirled her round, and pushed her into the kitchen. There was a pantry, and he shoved her into this cubbyhole, slammed the door upon her, and, grabbing a bread knife from the table, thrust it through the hasp of the latch as a makeshift bolt.</p><p>Hal had meanwhile disappeared upstairs, making enough noise for a company of cavalry. John galloped after him, and by the time he reached the head of the stair, his brother was busily engaged in trying to break down the door of a room from which came the siren shrieks of a baby and the even louder cries of what was probably the baby\u2019s mother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a good, solid door; Hal flung himself at it shoulder-first and rebounded as though made of India rubber. Barely pausing, he raised his foot and slammed the flat of his boot sole against the panel, which obligingly splintered but didn\u2019t break inward.</p><p>Wiping his face on his sleeve, he eyed the door and, catching the flicker of movement through the splintered paneling, called out, \u201cYoung woman! We have come to rescue you! Stand well away from the door!</p><p>\u201cPistol, please,\u201d he said, turning to John with his hand out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d John said, resigned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t any practice with doorknobs.\u201d</p> <p>Whereupon, with an air of assumed casualness, he drew the pistol from his belt, aimed carefully, and shot the doorknob to pieces. The boom of the gun evidently startled the room\u2019s inhabitants, for a dead silence fell. He gently pushed the stem of the shattered knob through the door; the remnants of the knob thunked to the floor on the other side, and he pushed the door cautiously open.</p><p>Hal, nodding his thanks, stepped forward through the wisps of smoke.</p><p>It was a small room, rather grimy, and furnished with no more than a bedstead, dresser, stool, and washstand. The stool was particularly noticeable, as it was being brandished by a wild-eyed young woman, clutching a baby to her breast with her other hand.</p><p>An ammoniac reek came from a basket in the corner, piled with dirty clouts; a folded quilt in a pulled-out drawer showed where the baby had been sleeping, and the young woman was less kempt than her mother would have liked to see, her cap askew and her pinny stained. Hal disregarded all matters of circumstance and bowed to her.</p><p>\u201cDo I address Miss Amaranthus Cowden?\u201d he said politely. \u201cOr is it Mrs. Grey?\u201d</p> <p>John gave his brother a disparaging look and turned a cordial smile on the young woman.</p><p>\u201cViscountess Grey,\u201d he said, and made a leg in courtly style. \u201cYour most humble servant, Lady Grey.\u201d</p><p>The young woman looked wildly from one man to the other, stool still raised, clearly unable to make head or tail of this invasion, and finally settled on John as the best\u2014if still dubious\u2014source of information.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she asked, pressing her back against the wall. \u201cHush, darling.\u201d For the baby, recovered from shock, had decided to grizzle.</p><p>John cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . this is Harold, Duke of Pardloe, and I am his brother, Lord John Grey. If our information is correct, I believe we are, respectively, your father-in-law and your uncle by marriage. And, after all,\u201d he remarked, turning to Hal, \u201chow many people in the colonies do you think there could possibly be named Amaranthus Cowden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t yet said she is Amaranthus Cowden,\u201d Hal pointed out. He did, however, smile at the young woman, who reacted as most women did, staring at him with her mouth slightly open.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d John reached forward and took the stool gently from her unresisting hand, setting it on the floor and gesturing her to take a seat. \u201cWhat sort of name is Amaranthus, may I ask?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, blinked, and sat down, clutching the baby.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a flower,\u201d she said, sounding rather dazed. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s a botanist. It could have been worse,\u201d she added more sharply, seeing John smile. \u201cIt might have been Ampelopsis or Petunia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmaranthus is a very beautiful name, my dear\u2014if I may call you so?\u201d Hal said, with grave courtesy. He wiggled a forefinger at the baby, who had stopped grizzling and was staring at him warily. Hal pulled his officer\u2019s gorget off over his head and dangled the shiny object, close enough for the child to grab\u2014which he did.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too large to choke him,\u201d Hal assured Amaranthus. \u201cHis father\u2014and his father\u2019s brothers\u2014all teethed on it. So did I, come to that.\u201d He smiled at her again. She was still white-faced but gave him a wary nod in response.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the little fellow\u2019s name, my dear?\u201d John asked.</p><p>\u201cTrevor,\u201d she said, taking a firmer hold on the child, now completely engrossed in trying to get the demilune gorget\u2014half the size of his head\u2014into his mouth. \u201cTrevor Grey.\u201d She looked back and forth between the Grey brothers, a frown puckering her brows. Then she lifted her chin and said, enunciating clearly, \u201cTrevor . . . Wattiswade . . . Grey. Your Grace.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you are Ben\u2019s wife.\u201d A little of the tension left Hal\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDo you know where Ben is, my dear?\u201d</p><p>Her face went stiff, and she clutched the baby tighter.</p><p>\u201cBenjamin is dead, Your Grace,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is his son, and if you don\u2019t mind . . . we should quite like to come with you.\u201d</p><p>UNFINISHED BUSINESS</p><p>WILLIAM SHOVED his way through the crowds in the City Market, oblivious to the complaints of those rebounding from his impact.</p><p>He knew where he was going and what he meant to do when he got there. It was the only thing left to do before leaving Savannah. After that . . . it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>His head throbbed like an inflamed boil. Everything throbbed. His hand\u2014he\u2019d probably broken something, but he didn\u2019t care. His heart, pounding and sore inside his chest. He hadn\u2019t slept since they\u2019d buried Jane; would likely never sleep again and didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He remembered where the warehouse was. The place was almost empty; doubtless the soldiers had taken everything the owner hadn\u2019t had time to move out of reach. Three men were lounging by the far wall, sitting on the few remaining casks of salt fish and smoking their pipes; the smell of tobacco reached him, a small comfort in the echoing cold fishiness of the building.</p><p>\u201cJames Fraser?\u201d he said to one of the loungers, and the man pointed with the stem of his pipe toward a small office, a sort of shed attached to the far wall of the warehouse.</p><p>The door was open; Fraser was seated at a table covered with papers, writing something by the light that fell through a tiny barred window behind him. He looked up at the sound of William\u2019s footsteps and, seeing him, put down his quill and rose slowly to his feet. William came forward, facing him across the table.</p><p>\u201cI have come to take my farewell,\u201d William said, very formally. His voice was less firm than he liked, and he cleared his throat hard.</p><p>\u201cAye? Where is it that ye mean to go?\u201d Fraser was wearing his plaid, the faded colors muted further by the dimness of the light, but what light there was sparked suddenly from his hair as he moved his head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d William said, gruff. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2014wished to thank you. For what you did. Even though\u2014\u201d His throat closed tight; try as he might, he couldn\u2019t keep Jane\u2019s small white hand out of his thoughts.</p><p>Fraser made a slight dismissive motion and said softly, \u201cGod rest her, poor wee lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d William said, and cleared his throat again. \u201cBut there is one further favor that I wished to ask of you.\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s head came up; he looked surprised but nodded.</p><p>\u201cAye, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can.\u201d</p><p>William turned and pulled the door shut, then turned to face the man again.</p><p>\u201cTell me how I came to be.\u201d</p><p>The whites of Fraser\u2019s eyes flashed in brief astonishment, then disappeared as his eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what happened,\u201d William said. \u201cWhen you lay with my mother. What happened that night? If it was night,\u201d he added, and then felt foolish for doing so.</p><p>Fraser eyed him for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYe want to tell me what it was like, the first time ye lay with a woman?\u201d</p><p>William felt the blood rush into his head, but before he could speak, the Scot went on.</p><p>\u201cAye, exactly. A decent man doesna speak of such things. Ye dinna tell your friends such things, do ye? No, of course not. So much less would ye tell your . . . father, or a father his . . .\u201d</p><p>The hesitation before \u201cfather\u201d was brief, but William caught it, no trouble. Fraser\u2019s mouth was firm, though, and his eyes direct.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna tell ye, no matter who ye were. But being who ye are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing who I am, I think I have a right to know!\u201d</p><p>Fraser looked at him for a moment, expressionless. He closed his eyes for an instant and sighed. Then opened them and drew himself up, straightening his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo, ye haven\u2019t. But that\u2019s not what ye want to know, in any case,\u201d he said. \u201cYe want to know, did I force your mother. I did not. Ye want to know, did I love your mother. I did not.\u201d</p><p>William let that lie there for a moment, controlling his breathing \u2019til he was sure his voice would be steady.</p><p>\u201cDid she love you?\u201d It would have been easy to love him. The thought came to him unbidden\u2014and unwelcome\u2014but with it, his own memories of Mac the groom. Something he shared with his mother.</p><p>Fraser\u2019s eyes were cast down, watching a trail of tiny ants running along the scuffed floorboards.</p><p>\u201cShe was verra young,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI was twice her age. It was my fault.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief silence, broken only by their breathing and the distant shouts of men working on the river.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the portraits,\u201d William said abruptly. \u201cOf my\u2014of the eighth earl. Her husband. Have you?\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s mouth twisted a little, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou know, though\u2014knew. He was fifty years older than she was.\u201d</p><p>Fraser\u2019s maimed hand twitched, fingers tapping lightly against his thigh. Yes, he\u2019d known. How could he not have known? He dipped his head, not quite a nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, you know,\u201d William said, louder than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cDidna think ye were,\u201d Fraser muttered, but didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cI can count,\u201d William went on, through his teeth. \u201cYou lay with her just before her wedding. Or was it just after?\u201d</p><p>That went home; Fraser\u2019s head jerked up and there was a flash of dark-blue anger.</p><p>\u201cI wouldna deceive another man in his marriage. Believe that of me, at least.\u201d</p><p>Oddly enough, he did. And in spite of the anger he still struggled to keep in check, he began to think he perhaps understood how it might have been.</p><p>\u201cShe was reckless.\u201d He made it a statement, not a question, and saw Fraser blink. It wasn\u2019t a nod, but he thought it was acknowledgment and went on, more confident.</p><p>\u201cEveryone says that\u2014everyone who knew her. She was reckless, beautiful, careless . . . she took chances . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had courage.\u201d It was said softly, the words dropped like pebbles in water, and the ripples spread through the tiny room. Fraser was still looking straight at him. \u201cDid they tell ye that, then? Her family, the folk who kent her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d William said, and felt the word sharp as a stone in his throat. For just an instant, he\u2019d seen her in those words. He\u2019d seen her, and the knowledge of the immensity of his loss struck through his anger like a lightning bolt. He drove his fist into the table, striking it once, twice, hammering it \u2019til the wood shook and the legs juddered over the floor, papers flying and the inkwell falling over.</p><p>He stopped as suddenly as he\u2019d started, and the racket ceased.</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry?\u201d he said, and made no effort to keep his voice from shaking. \u201cAre you sorry for it, damn you?\u201d</p><p>Fraser had turned away; now he turned sharply to face William but didn\u2019t speak at once. When he did, his voice was low and firm.</p><p>\u201cShe died because of it, and I shall sorrow for her death and do penance for my part in it until my own dying day. But\u2014\u201d He compressed his lips for an instant, and then, too fast for William to back away, came round the table and, raising his hand, cupped William\u2019s cheek, the touch light and fierce.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNo! I am not sorry.\u201d Then he whirled on his heel, threw open the door, and was gone, kilt flying.</p><p>PART NINE</p><p>\u201cThig crioch air an t-saoghal ach mairidh ceol agus gaol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world may come to an end, but love and music will endure.\u201d</p><p>IN THE WILDERNESS A LODGING PLACE</p><p>ICOULDN\u2019T STOP BREATHING. From the moment we left the salt-marsh miasma of Savannah, with its constant fog of rice paddies, mud, and decaying crustaceans, the air had grown clearer, the scents cleaner\u2014well, putting aside the Wilmington mudflats, redolent with their memories of crocodiles and dead pirates\u2014spicier, and more distinct. And as we reached the summit of the final pass, I thought I might explode from simple joy at the scent of the late-spring woods, an intoxicating mix of pine and balsam fir, oaks mingling the spice of fresh green leaves with the must of the winter\u2019s fallen acorns, and the nutty sweetness of chestnut mast under a layer of wet dead leaves, so thick that it made the air seem buoyant, bearing me up. I couldn\u2019t get enough of it into my lungs.</p><p>\u201cIf ye keep gasping like that, Sassenach, ye\u2019re like to pass out,\u201d Jamie said, smiling as he came up beside me. \u201cHow\u2019s the new knife, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful! Look, I found a huge ginseng root, and a birch gall and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped this with a kiss, and I dropped the soggy gunnysack full of plants on the path and kissed him back. He\u2019d been eating wild spring onions and watercress plucked dripping from a creek and he smelled of his own male scent, pine sap, and the bloody tang of the two dead rabbits hanging at his belt; it was like kissing the wilderness itself, and it went on for a bit, interrupted only by a discreet cough a few feet away.</p><p>We let go of each other at once, and I took an automatic step back behind Jamie even as he stepped in front of me, hand hovering within reach of his dirk. A split second later, he\u2019d taken a huge stride forward and engulfed Mr. Wemyss in an enormous hug.</p><p>\u201cJoseph! A charaid! Ciamar a tha thu?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Wemyss, a small, slight, elderly man, was swept literally off his feet; I could see a shoe dangling loose from the toes of one stockinged foot as he groped for traction. Smiling at this, I glanced round to see if Rachel and Ian had come into sight yet and spotted instead a small, round-faced boy on the path. He was perhaps four or five, with long fair hair, this flying loose around his shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEr . . . Rodney?\u201d I asked, making a hasty guess. I hadn\u2019t seen him since he was two or so, but I couldn\u2019t think who else might be accompanying Mr. Wemyss.</p><p>The child nodded, examining me soberly.</p><p>\u201cYou be the conjure-woman?\u201d he said, in a remarkably deep voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, rather surprised at this address, but still more surprised at how right my acknowledgment of it felt. I realized at that moment that I had been resuming my identity as we walked, that step by step as we climbed the mountain, smelling its scents and harvesting its plenty, I had sloughed off a few layers of the recent past and become again what I had last been in this place. I had come back.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said again. \u201cI am Mrs. Fraser. You may call me Grannie Fraser, if you like.\u201d</p><p>He nodded thoughtfully, taking this in and mouthing \u201cGrannie Fraser\u201d to himself once or twice, as though to taste it. Then he looked at Jamie, who had set Mr. Wemyss back on his feet and was smiling down at him with a look of joy that turned my heart to wax.</p><p>\u201cIzzat Himself?\u201d Rodney whispered, drawing close to me.</p><p>\u201cThat is Himself,\u201d I agreed, nodding gravely.</p><p>\u201cAidan said he was big,\u201d Rodney remarked, after another moment\u2019s scrutiny.</p> <p>\u201cIs he big enough, do you think?\u201d I asked, rather surprised by the realization that I didn\u2019t want Rodney to be disappointed in this first sight of Himself.</p><p>Rodney gave an odd sideways tilt of his head, terribly familiar\u2014it was what his mother, Lizzie, did when making a judgment about something\u2014and said philosophically, \u201cWell, he\u2019s lot\u2019s bigger \u2019n me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is relative,\u201d I agreed. \u201cAnd speaking of relatives, how is your mother? And your . . . er . . . father?\u201d</p><p>I was wondering whether Lizzie\u2019s unorthodox marriage was still in effect. Having fallen accidentally in love with identical-twin brothers, she had\u2014with a guile and cunning unexpected in a demure nineteen-year-old Scottish bond servant\u2014contrived to marry them both. There was no telling whether Rodney\u2019s father was Josiah or Keziah Beardsley, but I did wonder\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, Mammy\u2019s breedin\u2019 again,\u201d Rodney said casually. \u201cShe says she\u2019s a-going to castrate Daddy or Da or both of \u2019em, if that\u2019s what it takes to put a stop to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh . . . well, that would be effective,\u201d I said, rather taken aback. \u201cHow many sisters or brothers have you got?\u201d I\u2019d delivered a sister before we\u2019d left the Ridge, but\u2014</p> <p>\u201cOne sister, one brother.\u201d Rodney was clearly growing bored with me and stood on his toes to look down the path behind me. \u201cIs that Mary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Turning, I saw Ian and Rachel navigating a horseshoe bend some way below; they vanished into the trees even as I watched.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mary \u2019n Joseph a-flying into Egypt,\u201d he said, and I laughed in sudden understanding. Rachel, very noticeably pregnant, was riding Clarence, with Ian, who hadn\u2019t troubled to shave for the last several months and was sporting a beard of quasi-biblical dimensions, walking beside her. Jenny was presumably still out of sight behind them, riding the mare with Franny and leading the pack mule.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Rachel,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd her husband, Ian. Ian is Himself\u2019s nephew. You mentioned Aidan\u2014is his family well, too?\u201d Jamie and Mr. Wemyss had started off toward the trailhead, talking sixteen to the dozen about affairs on the Ridge. Rodney took my hand in a gentlemanly way and nodded after them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d best be going down. I want to tell Mam first, afore Opa gets there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpa . . . oh, your grandfather?\u201d Joseph Wemyss had married a German lady named Monika, soon after Rodney\u2019s birth, and I thought I recalled that \u201cOpa\u201d was a German expression for \u201cgrandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJa,\u201d Rodney said, confirming this supposition.</p><p>The trail meandered back and forth across the upper slopes of the Ridge, offering me tantalizing glimpses through the trees of the settlement below: scattered cabins among the bright-flowered laurels, the fresh-turned black earth of vegetable gardens\u2014I touched the digging knife at my belt, suddenly dying to have my hands in the dirt, to pull weeds . . .</p> <p>\u201cOh, you are losing your grip, Beauchamp,\u201d I murmured at the thought of ecstatic weed-pulling, but smiled nonetheless.</p><p>Rodney was not a chatterbox, but we kept up an amiable conversation as we walked. He said that he and his opa had walked up to the head of the pass every day for the last week, to be sure of meeting us.</p><p>\u201cMam and Missus Higgins have a ham saved for ye, for supper,\u201d he told me, and licked his lips in anticipation. \u201cAnd there\u2019s honey to have with our corn bread! Daddy found a bee tree last Tuesday sennight and I helped him smoke \u2019em. And . . .\u201d</p><p>I replied, but absentmindedly, and after a bit we both lapsed into a companionable silence. I was bracing myself for the sight of the clearing where the Big House had once stood\u2014and a brief, deep qualm swept through me, remembering fire.</p><p>The last time I had seen the house, it was no more than a heap of blackened timbers. Jamie had already chosen a site for a new house and had felled the trees for it, leaving them stacked. Sadness and regret there might be in this return\u2014but there were bright green spikes of anticipation poking through that scorched earth. Jamie had promised me a new garden, a new surgery, a bed long enough to stretch out in\u2014and glass windows.</p><p>Just before we came to the spot where the trail ended above the clearing, Jamie and Mr. Wemyss stopped, waiting for Rodney and me to catch up. With a shy smile, Mr. Wemyss kissed my hand and then took Rodney\u2019s, saying, \u201cCome along, Roddy, you can be first to tell your mam that Himself and his lady have come back!\u201d</p><p>Jamie took my hand and squeezed it hard. He was flushed from the walk, and even more from excitement; the color ran right down into the open neck of his shirt, turning his skin a beautiful rosy bronze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought ye home, Sassenach,\u201d he said, his voice a little husky. \u201cIt willna be the same\u2014and I canna say how things will be now\u2014but I\u2019ve kept my word.\u201d</p><p>My throat was so choked that I could barely whisper \u201cThank you.\u201d We stood for a long moment, clasped tight together, summoning up the strength to go around that last corner and look at what had been, and what might be.</p><p>Something brushed the hem of my skirt, and I looked down, expecting that a late cone from the big spruce we were standing by had fallen.</p><p>A large gray cat looked up at me with big, calm eyes of celadon green and dropped a fat, hairy, very dead wood rat at my feet.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d I said, and burst into tears.</p><p>FANNY\u2019S FRENULUM</p><p>JAMIE HAD SENT word ahead, and preparations had been made for our coming. Jamie and I would stay with Bobby and Amy Higgins; Rachel and Ian with the MacDonalds, a young married couple who lived up the Ridge a way; and Jenny, Fanny, and Germain would bide for the nonce with Widow MacDowall, who had a spare bed.</p><p>There was a modest party thrown in our honor the first night\u2014and in the morning we rose and were once more part of Fraser\u2019s Ridge. Jamie disappeared into the forest, coming back at nightfall to report that his cache of whisky was safe, and brought a small cask back with him to use as trade goods for what we might need to set up housekeeping, once we had a house to keep again.</p><p>As to said house\u2014he\u2019d begun the preparations for building a new house before we had left the Ridge, selecting a good site at the head of the wide cove that opened just below the ridge itself. The site was elevated but the ground there fairly level, and thanks to Bobby Higgins\u2019s industry, it had been cleared of trees, timber for the framing of the house laid in stacks, and an amazing quantity of large stones lugged uphill and piled, ready to be used for the foundation.</p><p>For Jamie, the first order of business was to see that his house\u2014or the beginnings of it\u2014was as it should be, and the second was to visit every household on the Ridge, hearing and giving news, listening to his tenants, reestablishing himself as the founder and proprietor of Fraser\u2019s Ridge.</p><p>My first order of business was Fanny\u2019s frenulum. I spent a day or two in organizing the various things we had brought with us, in particular my medical equipment, while visiting with the various women who came to call at the Higginses\u2019 cabin\u2014our own first cabin, which Jamie and Ian had built when we first came to the Ridge. But once that was done, I summoned my troops and commenced the action.</p><p>\u201cYE MAY PUT the poor lass off drinking whisky for good,\u201d Jamie observed, casting a worried look at the cup full of amber liquid sitting on the tray next to my embroidery scissors. \u201cWould it not be easier for her to have the ether?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one way, yes,\u201d I agreed, sliding the scissors point-first into a second cup, this one filled with clear alcohol. \u201cAnd if I were going to do a lingual frenectomy, I\u2019d have to. But there are dangers to using ether, and I don\u2019t mean merely burning down the house. I\u2019m going to do just a frenotomy, at least for now. That is a very simple operation; it will literally take five seconds. And, besides, Fanny says she doesn\u2019t want to be put to sleep\u2014perhaps she doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201d I smiled at Fanny as I said this; she was sitting on the oak settle by the hearth, solemnly taking note of my preparations. At this, though, she looked at me abruptly, her big brown eyes surprised.</p><p>\u201cOh, doh,\u201d she said. \u201cI twust oo. I zhust wanna thee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame you a bit,\u201d I assured her, handing her the cup of whisky. \u201cHere, then, take a good mouthful of that and hold it in your mouth\u2014let it go down under your tongue\u2014for as long as you can.\u201d</p><p>I had a tiny cautery iron, its handle wrapped in twisted wool, heating on Amy\u2019s girdle. I supposed it didn\u2019t matter if it tasted like sausages. I had a fine suture needle, threaded with black silk, too, just in case.</p><p>The frenulum is a very thin band of elastic tissue that tethers the tongue to the floor of the mouth, and in most people it is exactly as long as it needs to be to allow the tongue to make all the complex motions required for speaking and eating, without letting it stray between the moving teeth, where it could be badly damaged. In some, like Fanny, the frenulum was too long and, by fastening most of the length of the tongue to the floor of her mouth, prevented easy manipulations of that organ. She often had bad breath because, while she cleaned her teeth nightly, she couldn\u2019t use her tongue to dislodge bits of food that stuck between cheek and gum or in the hollows of the lower jaw below the tongue.</p><p>Fanny gulped audibly, then coughed violently.</p><p>\u201cTha\u2019th . . . thtrong!\u201d she said, her eyes watering. She wasn\u2019t put off, though, and at my nod took another sip and sat stoically, letting the whisky seep into her buccal tissues. It would in fact numb the frenulum, at least a bit, and at the same time provide disinfection.</p><p>I heard Aidan and Germain calling outside; Jenny and Rachel had come down for the operation.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019d better do this outside,\u201d I said to Jamie. \u201cThey\u2019ll never all fit in here\u2014not with Oglethorpe.\u201d For Rachel\u2019s belly had made considerable strides in the last few weeks and was of a size to make men shy nervously away from her lest she go off suddenly, like a bomb.</p><p>We took the tray of instruments outside and set up our operating site on the bench that stood by the front door. Amy, Aidan, Orrie, and wee Rob clustered together behind Jamie, who was charged with holding the looking glass\u2014both to direct light into Fanny\u2019s mouth to assist me and so that Fanny could indeed watch what was going on.</p><p>As Oglethorpe precluded Rachel being called into service as a back brace, though, we reshuffled the staff a bit and ended with Jenny holding the looking glass and Jamie sitting on the bench, holding Fanny on his knee, his arms wrapped comfortingly around her. Germain stood by, holding a stack of clean cloths, solemn as an altar boy, and Rachel sat beside me, the tray between us, so that she could hand me things.</p><p>\u201cAll right, sweetheart?\u201d I asked Fanny. She was round-eyed as a sun-stunned owl, and her mouth hung open just a little. She heard me, though, and nodded. I took the cup from her limp hand\u2014it was empty, and I handed it to Rachel, who refilled it briskly.</p><p>\u201cMirror, please, Jenny?\u201d I knelt on the grass before the bench, and with no more than a little trial and error, we had a beam of sunlight trained on Fanny\u2019s mouth. I took the embroidery scissors from their bath, wiped them, and, with a pledget of cloth, took hold of Fanny\u2019s tongue with my left hand and lifted it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take even three seconds. I\u2019d examined her carefully several times, making her move her tongue as far as she could, and knew exactly where I thought the point of attachment should be. Two quick snips and it was done.</p><p>Fanny made a surprised little noise and jerked in Jamie\u2019s arms, but didn\u2019t seem to be in acute pain. The wound was bleeding, though, suddenly and profusely, and I hurriedly pushed her head down, so that the blood could run out of her mouth onto the ground and not choke her.</p><p>I had another pledget waiting; I dipped this quickly into the whisky and, seizing Fanny\u2019s chin, brought her head up and tucked the pledget under her tongue. That made her emit a stifled \u201cOwy!\u201d but I cupped her chin and shut her mouth, adjuring her sternly to press down on the pledget with her tongue.</p><p>Everyone waited breathlessly while I counted silently to sixty. If the bleeding showed no sign of stopping, I\u2019d have to put in a suture, which would be messy, or cauterize the wound, which would certainly be painful.</p><p>\u201c. . . fifty-nine . . . sixty!\u201d I said aloud, and peering into Fanny\u2019s mouth, found the pledget substantially soaked with blood but not overwhelmed by it. I extracted it and put in another, repeating my silent count. This time, the pledget was stained, no more; the bleeding was stopping on its own.</p><p>\u201cHallelujah!\u201d I said, and everyone whooped. Fanny\u2019s head bobbed a bit and she smiled, very shyly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere, sweetheart,\u201d I said, handing her the half-filled cup. \u201cFinish that, if you can\u2014just sip it slowly and let it go onto the wound if you can; I know it burns a bit.\u201d</p><p>She did this, rather quickly, and blinked. If it had been possible to stagger sitting down, she would have.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best put the lassie to bed, aye?\u201d Jamie stood up, gently holding her against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll come and see to it that her head stays upright\u2014just in case it should bleed again and run down her throat.\u201d I turned to thank the assistants and spectators, but Fanny beat me to it.</p> <p>\u201cMissus . . . Fraser?\u201d she said drowsily. \u201cI\u2014d-t-dth\u2014\u201d The tip of her tongue was sticking out of her mouth, and she looked cross-eyed toward it, astounded. She\u2019d never been able to stick her tongue out before and now wiggled it to and fro, like a very tentative snake testing the air. \u201cT-th\u2014\u201d She stopped, then, contorting her brow in a fearsome expression of concentration, said, \u201cTh-ank y-y-YOU!\u201d</p><p>Tears came to my eyes, but I managed to pat her head and say, \u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, Frances.\u201d She smiled at me then, a small, sleepy smile, and the next instant was asleep, her head on Jamie\u2019s shoulder and a tiny drooling line of blood trickling from the corner of her mouth onto his shirt.</p><p>A VISIT TO THE TRADING POST</p><p>BEARDSLEY\u2019S TRADING POST was perhaps no great establishment by comparison to the shops of Edinburgh or Paris\u2014but in the backcountry of the Carolinas, it was a rare outpost of civilization. Originally nothing but a run-down house and small barn, the place had expanded over the years, the owners\u2014or rather, her managers\u2014adding additional structures, some attached to the original buildings, other sheds standing free. Tools, hides, live animals, feed corn, tobacco, and hogsheads of everything from salt fish to molasses were to be found in the outbuildings, while comestibles and dry goods were in the main building.</p><p>People came to Beardsley\u2019s from a hundred miles\u2014literally\u2014in every direction. Cherokee from the Snowbird villages, Moravians from Salem, the multifarious inhabitants of Brownsville, and\u2014of course\u2014the inhabitants of Fraser\u2019s Ridge.</p> <p>The trading post had grown amazingly in the eight years since I had last set foot in the place. I saw campsites in the forest nearby, and a sort of free-lance flea market had sprung up alongside the trading post proper\u2014people who brought small things to trade directly with their neighbors.</p><p>The manager of the trading post, a lean, pleasant man of middle years named Herman Stoelers, had wisely welcomed this activity, understanding that the more people who came, the greater the variety of what was available, and the more attractive Beardsley\u2019s became overall.</p><p>And the wealthier became the owner of Beardsley\u2019s trading post\u2014an eight-year-old mulatto girl named Alicia. I wondered whether anyone besides Jamie and myself knew the secret of her birth, but if anyone did, they had wisely decided to keep it to themselves.</p><p>It was a two-day trek to the trading post, particularly as we had only Clarence, Jamie having taken Miranda and the pack mule\u2014a jenny named Annabelle\u2014to Salem. But the weather was good, and Jenny and I could walk, accompanied by Germain and Ian, leaving Clarence to carry Rachel and our trade goods. I\u2019d left Fanny with Amy Higgins. She was still shy of talking in front of people; it would take a good deal of practice before she could speak normally.</p><p>Even Jenny, sophisticate as she now was after Brest, Philadelphia, and Savannah, was impressed by the trading post.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen sae many outlandish-looking people in all my born days,\u201d she said, making no effort not to stare as a pair of Cherokee braves in full regalia rode up to the trading post, followed by several women on foot in a mixture of doeskins and European shifts, skirts, breeches, and jackets, these dragging bundles of hides on a travois or carrying huge cloth bundles full of squash, beans, corn, dried fish, or other salables on their heads or backs.</p> <p>I came to attention, seeing the knobbly bulges of ginseng root protruding from one lady\u2019s pack.</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on Germain,\u201d I said, shoving him hastily at Jenny, and dived into the throng.</p><p>I emerged ten minutes later with a pound of ginseng, having driven a good bargain for a bag of raisins. They were Amy Higgins\u2019s raisins, but I would get her the calico cloth she wanted.</p><p>Jenny suddenly raised her head, listening.</p><p>\u201cDid ye hear a goat just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear several. Do we want a goat?\u201d But she was already making her way toward a distant shed. Evidently we did want a goat.</p><p>I shoved my ginseng into the canvas bag I\u2019d brought and followed hastily.</p><p>\u201cWE DON\u2019T NEED that,\u201d a scornful voice said. \u201cPiece o\u2019 worthless trash, that is.\u201d</p> <p>Ian looked up from the mirror he was inspecting and squinted at a pair of young men on the other side of the store, engaged in haggling with a clerk over a pistol. They seemed somehow familiar to him, but he was sure he\u2019d never met them. Small and wiry, with yellowish hair cropped short to their narrow skulls and darting eyes, they had the air of stoats: alert and deadly.</p><p>Then one of them straightened from the counter and, turning his head, caught sight of Ian. The youth stiffened and poked his brother, who looked up, irritated, and in turn caught sight of Ian.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil . . . ? Cheese and rice!\u201d the second youth said.</p><p>Plainly they knew him; they were advancing on him, shoulder to shoulder, eyes gleaming with interest. And seeing them side by side, suddenly he recognized them.</p><p>\u201cA Dhia,\u201d he said under his breath, and Rachel glanced up.</p><p>\u201cFriends of thine?\u201d she said mildly.</p><p>\u201cYe might say so.\u201d He stepped out in front of his wife, smiling at the . . . well, he wasn\u2019t sure what they were just now, but they weren\u2019t wee lassies any longer.</p><p>He\u2019d thought they were boys when he\u2019d met them: a pair of feral Dutch orphans named\u2014they said\u2014Herman and Vermin, and they thought their last name was Kuykendall. In the event, they\u2019d turned out to be in actuality Hermione and Ermintrude. He\u2019d found them a temporary refuge with . . . oh, Christ.</p><p>\u201cGod, please, no!\u201d he said in Gaelic, causing Rachel to look at him in alarm.</p><p>Surely they weren\u2019t still with . . . but they were. He saw the back of a very familiar head\u2014and a still more familiar arse\u2014over by the pickle barrel.</p><p>He glanced round quickly, but there was no way out. The Kuykendalls were approaching fast. He took a deep breath, commended his soul to God, and turned to his wife.</p><p>\u201cDo ye by chance recall once tellin\u2019 me that ye didna want to hear about every woman I\u2019d bedded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said, giving him a deeply quizzical look. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well . . .\u201d He breathed deep and got it out just in time. \u201cYe said ye did want me to tell ye if we should ever meet anyone that I . . . er\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan Murray?\u201d said Mrs. Sylvie, turning round. She came toward him, a look of pleasure on her rather plain, bespectacled face.</p><p>\u201cHer,\u201d Ian said hastily to Rachel, jerking his thumb in Mrs. Sylvie\u2019s direction before turning to the lady.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Sylvie!\u201d he said heartily, seizing her by both hands in case she might try to kiss him, as she had occasionally been wont to do upon their meeting. \u201cI\u2019m that pleased to see ye! And even more pleased to present ye to my . . . er . . . wife.\u201d The word emerged in a slight croak, and he cleared his throat hard. \u201cRachel. Rachel, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend Sylvie,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cYes, I gathered as much. I\u2019m pleased to know thee, Sylvie.\u201d Her cheeks were somewhat flushed, but she spoke demurely, offering a hand in the Friends\u2019 manner rather than bowing.</p><p>Mrs. Sylvie took in Rachel\u2014and Oglethorpe\u2014at a glance and smiled warmly through her steel-rimmed spectacles, shaking the offered hand.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure entirely, I assure you, Mrs. Murray.\u201d She gave Ian a sidelong look and a quivering twitch of the mouth that said as clearly as words, \u201cYou? You married a Quaker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is him! Toldja so!\u201d The Kuykendalls surrounded him\u2014he didn\u2019t know how they managed it, there being only two of them, but he felt surrounded. Rather to his surprise, one of them seized him by the hand and wrung it fiercely.</p><p>\u201cHerman Wurm,\u201d he\u2014he?\u2014told Ian proudly. \u201cPleased to meetcha again, sir!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorm?\u201d Rachel murmured, watching them in fascination.</p><p>\u201cAye, Herman, I\u2019m that fettled to see ye doing so . . . er . . . well. And you, too . . .\u201d Ian extended a cautious hand toward what used to be Ermintrude, who responded in a high-pitched but noticeably gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cTrask Wurm,\u201d the youth said, repeating the vigorous handshake. \u201cIt\u2019s German.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Wurm,\u2019 they mean,\u201d Mrs. Sylvie put in, pronouncing it \u201cVehrm.\u201d She was pink with amusement. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t ever get the hang of spelling \u2018Kuykendall,\u2019 so we gave it up and settled for something simpler. And as you\u2019d made it quite clear that you didn\u2019t want them to become prostitutes, we\u2019ve reached a useful understanding. Herman and Trask provide protection for my . . . establishment.\u201d She looked directly at Rachel, who went a shade pinker but smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnybody messes with the girls, we\u2019ll take care of him right smart,\u201d the elder Wurm assured Ian.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard,\u201d the other said honestly. \u201cBreak just one of them bastards\u2019 noses with a hoe handle and the rest of \u2019em settle right down.\u201d</p><p>THERE WERE A dozen or so milch goats to choose from in the shed, in varying states of pregnancy. The Higginses had a good billy, though, so I needn\u2019t trouble about that. I chose two friendly young unbred nannies, one all brown, the other brown and white, with an odd marking on her side that looked like the rounded fit of two jigsaw-puzzle pieces, one brown and one white.</p><p>I pointed out my choices to the young man in charge of the livestock and, as Jenny was still deliberating over her own choice, stepped outside to look over the chickens.</p><p>I had some hopes of spotting a Scots Dumpy but found only the usual run of Dominiques and Nankins. Well enough of their kind, but I thought I must wait until Jamie had time to build a chicken coop. And while we could lead the goats home easily enough, I wasn\u2019t going to carry chickens for days.</p><p>I came out of the chicken yard and looked about, slightly disoriented. That\u2019s when I saw him.</p><p>At first, I had no idea who he was. None. But the sight of the big, slow-moving man froze me in my tracks and my stomach curled up in instant panic.</p><p>No, I thought. No. He\u2019s dead; they\u2019re all dead.</p><p>He was a sloppily built man, with sloping shoulders and a protruding stomach that strained his threadbare waistcoat, but big. Big. I felt again the sense of sudden dread, of a big shadow coming out of the night beside me, nudging me, then rolling over me like a thundercloud, crushing me into the dirt and pine needles.</p><p>Martha.</p><p>A cold swept over me, in spite of the warm sunshine I stood in.</p><p>\u201cMartha,\u201d he\u2019d said. He\u2019d called me by his dead wife\u2019s name and wept into my hair when he\u2019d finished.</p><p>Martha. I had to be mistaken. That was my first conscious thought, stubbornly articulated, each word spoken aloud inside my mind, each word set in place like a little pile of stones, the first foundation of a bulwark. You. Are. Mistaken.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t. My skin knew that. It rippled, a live thing, hairs rising in recoil, in vain defense, for what could skin do to keep such things out?</p><p>You. Are. Mistaken!</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t. My br**sts knew that, tingling in outrage, engorged against their will by rough hands that squeezed and pinched.</p><p>My thighs knew it, too; the burn and weakness of muscles strained past bearing, the knots where punches and brutal thumbs left bruises that went to the bone, left a soreness that lingered when the bruises faded.</p><p>\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d I said, whispering but aloud. \u201cMistaken.\u201d</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t. The deep soft flesh between my legs knew it, slippery with the sudden helpless horror of recollection\u2014and so did I.</p><p>I STOOD THERE hyperventilating for several moments before I realized that I was doing it, and stopped with a conscious effort. The man was making his way through the cluster of livestock sheds; he stopped by a pen of hogs and leaned on the fence, watching the gently heaving backs with an air of meditation. Another man employed in the same recreation spoke to him, and he replied. I was too far away to hear what was said, but I caught the timbre of his voice.</p><p>\u201cMartha. I know you don\u2019t want to, Martha, but you got to. I got to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>I was not going to be bloody sick. I wasn\u2019t. With that decision made, I calmed a little. I hadn\u2019t let him or his companions kill my spirit at the time; whyever would I let him harm me now?</p><p>He moved away from the pigs, and I followed him. I wasn\u2019t sure why I was following him but felt a strong compulsion to do so. I wasn\u2019t afraid of him; logically, there was no reason to be. At the same time, my unreasoning body still felt the echoes of that night, of his flesh and fingers, and would have liked to run away. I wasn\u2019t having that.</p><p>I followed him from pigs to chickens, back again to the pigs\u2014he seemed interested in a young black-and-white sow; he pointed her out to the swineherd and seemed to be asking questions, but then shook his head in a dejected fashion and walked away. Too expensive?</p><p>I could find out who he is. The thought occurred to me, but I rejected it with a surprising sense of violence. I didn\u2019t bloody want to know his name.</p><p>And yet . . . I followed him. He went into the main building and bought some tobacco. I realized that I knew he used tobacco; I\u2019d smelled the sour ash of it on his breath. He was talking to the clerk who measured out his purchase, a slow, heavy voice. Whatever he was saying went on too long; the clerk began to look strained, his expression saying all too clearly, \u201cWe\u2019re done here; go away. Please go away . . .\u201d And a full five minutes later, relief was just as clearly marked on the clerk\u2019s face as the man turned away to look at barrels full of nails. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019d known from what he said to me that his wife was dead. From his appearance and the way he was boring everyone he talked to, I thought he hadn\u2019t found another. He was plainly poor; that wasn\u2019t unusual in the back-country. But he was also grubby and frayed, unshaven, and unkempt in a way that no man who lives with a woman normally is.</p><p>He passed within a yard of me as he went toward the door, his paper twist of tobacco and his bag of nails in one hand, a stick of barley sugar in the other. He was licking this with a large, wet tongue, his face showing a dim, vacant sort of pleasure in the taste. There was a small port-wine stain, a birth-mark, on the side of his jaw. He was crude, I thought. Lumpish. And the word came to me: feckless.</p><p>Christ, I thought, with a mild disgust, this mingled with an unwilling pity that made me even more disgusted. I had had some vague thought\u2014and realized it only now\u2014of confronting him, of walking up to him and demanding to know whether he knew me. But he had looked right at me as he passed me, without a sign of recognition on his face. Perhaps there was enough difference between what I looked like now\u2014clean and combed, decently dressed\u2014and what I had looked like the last time he had seen me: filthy, wild-haired, half naked, and beaten.</p><p>Perhaps he hadn\u2019t really seen me at all at the time. It had been full dark when he came to me, tied and struggling for breath, trying to breathe through a broken nose. I hadn\u2019t seen him.</p> <p>Are you sure it\u2019s really him? Yes, I bloody was. I was sure when I heard his voice and, even more so, having seen him, felt the rhythm of his bulky, shambling body.</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t want to speak to him. What would be the point? And what would I say? Demand an apology? More than likely, he wouldn\u2019t even remember having done it.</p><p>That thought made me snort with a bitter amusement.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny, Grand-m\u00e8re?\u201d Germain had popped up by my elbow, holding two sticks of barley sugar.</p><p>\u201cJust a thought,\u201d I said. \u201cNothing important. Is Grannie Janet ready to go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, she sent me to look for ye. D\u2019ye want one of these?\u201d He generously extended a stick of candy toward me. My stomach flipped, thinking of the man\u2019s large pink tongue lapping his treat.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it home for Fanny? It would be wonderful exercise for her.\u201d Clipping her frenulum hadn\u2019t miraculously freed her speech, or even her ability to manipulate food; it just made such things possible, with work. Germain spent hours with her, the two of them sticking out their tongues at each other, wiggling them in all directions and giggling.</p><p>\u201cOh, I got a dozen sticks for Fanny,\u201d Germain assured me. \u201cAnd one each for Aidan, Orrie, and wee Rob, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous, Germain,\u201d I said, slightly surprised. \u201cEr . . . what did you buy them with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA beaver skin,\u201d he replied, looking pleased with himself. \u201cMr. Kezzie Beardsley gave it to me for taking his young\u2019uns down to the creek and minding \u2019em whilst he and Mrs. Beardsley had a lie-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lie-down,\u201d I repeated, my mouth twitching with the urge to laugh. \u201cI see. All right. Let\u2019s find Grannie Janet, then.\u201d</p> <p>IT TOOK NO little time to get organized for the journey back to the Ridge. It was a two-day ride; on foot, with goats, it would likely take four. But we had food and blankets, and the weather was fine. No one was in a hurry\u2014certainly not the goats, who were inclined to pause for a quick mouthful of anything in reach.</p><p>The peace of the road and the company of my companions did a great deal to settle my disturbed feelings. Rachel\u2019s imitation over supper of Ian\u2019s expressions on suddenly meeting Mrs. Sylvie and the Wurms did even more, and I fell asleep by the fire within moments of lying down, and slept without dreaming.</p><p>WOMAN, WILT THOU LIE WITH ME?</p><p>IAN COULDN\u2019T TELL whether Rachel was amused, appalled, angry, or all three. This discomfited him. He usually did know what she thought of things, because she told him; she wasn\u2019t the sort of woman\u2014he\u2019d known a few\u2014who expected a man to read her mind and got fashed when he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She\u2019d kept her own counsel on the matter of Mrs. Sylvie and the Wurms, though. They\u2019d done their wee bit of business, trading two bottles of whisky for salt, sugar, nails, needles, thread, a hoe blade, and a bolt of pink gingham, and he\u2019d bought her a dilled cucumber that was as long as the span of his outstretched fingers. She\u2019d thanked him for this but hadn\u2019t said much else on the way home. She was presently licking the vegetable in a meditative sort of way as she rocked along on Clarence.</p><p>It fascinated him to watch her do that, and he nearly walked straight off a steep rocky outcrop doing so. She turned round at his exclamation as he scrabbled for footing, though, and smiled at him, so she maybe wasn\u2019t that bothered about Sylvie.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye no mean to eat that?\u201d he inquired, coming up beside her stirrup.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said calmly, \u201cbut all in good time.\u201d She licked the substantial length of the warty green thing with a long, slow swipe of her tongue and then\u2014holding his eyes\u2014sucked deliberately on the end of it. He walked straight into a springy pine branch, which swiped him across the face with its needles.</p> <p>He swore, rubbing at his watering eyes. She was laughing!</p><p>\u201cYe did that on purpose, Rachel Murray!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs thee accusing me of propelling thee into a tree?\u201d she inquired, arching one brow. \u201cThee is an experienced Indian scout, or so I was led to believe. Surely one of those should look where he\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>She had pulled Clarence to a stop\u2014Clarence was always agreeable to stopping, particularly if there was anything edible in sight\u2014and sat there smiling at Ian, cheeky as a monkey.</p><p>\u201cGive me that, aye?\u201d She handed him the pickle willingly, wiping her damp hand on her thigh. He took a large bite, his mouth flooded with garlic and dill and vinegar. Then he jammed the cucumber into one of the saddlebags and extended a hand to her. \u201cCome down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. She was still smiling, but her body had shifted, leaning toward him but making no effort to get off. He understood that sort of conversation and reached up, took her by what was left of her waist, and pulled her off in a flurry of skirts. He paused for an instant to swallow the bite of pickle, then kissed her thoroughly, a hand on her bottom. Her hair smelled of pinecones, chicken feathers, and the soft soap Auntie Claire called shampoo, and he could taste the German sausage they\u2019d had for lunch, under the veil of pickling spice.</p><p>Her arms were round his neck, her belly pressed against him, and quite suddenly he felt a small hard shove in his own belly. He looked down in astonishment, and Rachel giggled. He hadn\u2019t realized that she wasn\u2019t wearing stays; her br**sts were bound with a simple band under her shift, but her belly was just there, round and firm as a pumpkin under her gown.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014or she\u2014is wakeful,\u201d she said, putting a hand on her bulge, which was moving slightly as tiny limbs poked experimentally here and there inside her. This was always fascinating in its own way, but Ian was still under the influence of her pickle-sucking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll rock him back to sleep for ye,\u201d he whispered in her ear, and, bending, lifted her in his arms. Nearly eight months gone, she was noticeably heavy, but he managed with no more than a slight grunt and, with a care to low-hanging branches and loose stones, carried her off into the forest, leaving Clarence to graze on a succulent clump of muhly grass.</p><p>\u201cI RATHER HOPE that it wasn\u2019t the meeting with thy former paramour that caused this outbreak of passion,\u201d Rachel remarked a short time later, flicking a wandering wood louse off her husband\u2019s forearm, which was just by her face. They were lying on their sides on Ian\u2019s plaid, naked and cupped together like spoons in a box. It was cool under the trees, but she seemed never to grow cold these days; the child was like a small furnace\u2014doubtless taking after its father, she thought. Ian\u2019s skin was usually warm, but for him the heat of passion was no mere metaphor; he blazed when they lay together.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s no my paramour,\u201d Ian murmured into her hair, and kissed the back of her ear. \u201cIt was only a commercial transaction.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like hearing that and stiffened a little.</p><p>\u201cI did tell ye I\u2019d gone wi\u2019 whores.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice was quiet, but she could hear the slight reproach in it. \u201cWould ye rather I had discarded lovers strewn about the countryside?\u201d</p><p>She took a breath, relaxed, and stretched her neck to kiss the back of his long, sun-browned hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s true\u2014thee did tell me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd while there is some small part of me that could wish thee came to me virgin, chaste and untouched . . . honesty obliges me to acknowledge some gratitude for the lessons learned from the likes of Mrs. Sylvie.\u201d She wanted to ask whether he\u2019d learned the things he\u2019d just been doing to her from Mrs. Sylvie or perhaps from his Indian wife\u2014but she had no wish to bring any thought of Works With Her Hands between them.</p><p>His hand lifted and cupped her breast, playing very gently with her nipple, and she squirmed involuntarily\u2014a slow, insinuating squirm that thrust her bu**ocks back against him. Her ni**les were very large these days and so sensitive that they couldn\u2019t bear the rubbing of stays. She squirmed again, and he laughed under his breath and rolled her over to face him so he could take her nipple in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDinna make noises like that,\u201d he murmured against her skin. \u201cThe others will be comin\u2019 along the trail any time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014will they think when they see Clarence alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone asks later, we\u2019ll say we were gatherin\u2019 mushrooms.\u201d</p><p>THEY MUSTN\u2019T STAY much longer, she knew that. But she longed to stay like this forever\u2014or at least for five minutes more. Ian lay once more behind her, warm and strong. But his hand was now on her stomach, tenderly stroking the rounded mystery of the child within.</p><p>He might have thought she was asleep. Perhaps he didn\u2019t mind if she heard him. He spoke in the G\u00e0idhlig, though, and while she didn\u2019t yet know enough of the tongue to make out all he said, she knew it was a prayer. \u201cA Dhia\u201d meant \u201cO God.\u201d And of course she knew what it was he prayed for.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said to him softly, when he had stopped, and put her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thee should think of thy first child\u2014children. I know thee does. And I know how much thee fears for this one,\u201d she added, still more softly.</p><p>He sighed deeply, his breath, still scented with dill and garlic, warm on her neck.</p><p>\u201cYe turn my heart to water, lass\u2014and should anything happen to you or to wee Oggy, it would punch a hole in me that would let my life run out.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to tell him that nothing would happen to them, that she wouldn\u2019t let it. But that was taking things upon herself that weren\u2019t hers to promise.</p><p>\u201cOur lives are in God\u2019s hand,\u201d she said, squeezing his. \u201cAnd whatever happens, we will be with thee forever.\u201d</p><p>DRESSED AGAIN, and as seemly as fingers combed through hair could make them, they reached the trail just as Claire and Jenny made their way around the bend, carrying packs and each leading two milch goats, friendly creatures who set up a loud mehh of greeting as they spotted the two strangers.</p><p>Rachel saw Ian\u2019s mother glance sharply at her son, and then her dark-blue gaze lifted at once to Rachel, perched on Clarence\u2019s back. She gave Rachel a smile that said, as plain as words, that she knew exactly what they\u2019d been doing and found it funny. Warm blood rose in Rachel\u2019s cheeks, but she kept her composure and inclined her head graciously to Jenny\u2014in spite of the fact that Friends did not bow their heads save in worship.</p><p>Still blushing, she\u2019d paid no attention to Claire, but after they had gone far enough ahead of the older women and the goats so as not to be overheard, Ian lifted his chin and gestured over his shoulder with it.</p><p>\u201cDoes aught seem amiss wi\u2019 Auntie Claire, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice. What does thee mean?\u201d</p><p>Ian lifted a shoulder, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cI canna say, quite. She was herself on the way to the trading post and when we first got there, but when she came back from hagglin\u2019 for the goats, she looked . . . different.\u201d He struggled to find words to explain what he meant.</p><p>\u201cNo quite what ye\u2019d say someone looks like if they\u2019ve seen a ghost\u2014not scairt, I mean. But . . . stunned, maybe? Surprised, or maybe shocked. But then when she saw me, she tried to act as though it was all as usual, and I was busy takin\u2019 the bundles out and forgot about it.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head again, looking over his shoulder, but the trail behind was empty. A faint mehhhh filtered down through the trees behind them, and he smiled\u2014but his eyes were troubled.</p><p>\u201cKen\u2014Auntie Claire canna hide things verra well. Uncle Jamie always says she\u2019s got a glass face, and it\u2019s true. Whatever it is she saw back there . . . I think it\u2019s with her, still.\u201d</p><p>THE DEEPEST FEELING ALWAYS SHOWS ITSELF IN SILENCE</p><p>IT WAS SOMETIME in the midafternoon of the third day that Jenny cleared her throat in a significant manner. We had paused by a creek where the wild grass grew long and thick and were dabbling our tired feet in the water, watching the hobbled goats disport themselves. One seldom goes to the trouble of hobbling a goat, since they can, if they want to, chew their way free in a matter of seconds. In the present instance, though, there was too much food available for them to want to waste time in eating rope, and the hobbles would keep them within our sight.</p><p>\u201cGot something caught in your throat?\u201d I inquired pleasantly. \u201cLuckily there\u2019s plenty of water.\u201d</p><p>She made a Scottish noise indicating polite appreciation of this feeble attempt at wit and, reaching into her pocket, withdrew a very battered silver flask and uncorked it. I could smell the liquor from where I sat\u2014a local forerunner of bourbon, I thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you bring that with you from Scotland?\u201d I asked, accepting the flask, which had a crude fleur-de-lis on the side.</p><p>\u201cAye, it was Ian\u2019s. He had it from when he and Jamie were soldiering in France; brought it back wi\u2019 him when he lost his leg. We\u2019d sit on the wall by his da\u2019s house and share a dram, while he was mending; he\u2019d need it, poor lad, after I made him walk up and down the road ten times every day, to learn the use of his peg.\u201d She smiled, slanted eyes creasing, but with a wistful turn to her lips.</p><p>\u201cI said I wouldna marry him, aye? Unless he could stand up beside me at the altar on two legs and walk me up the aisle after the vows.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not quite the way he told it.\u201d I took a cautious sip, but the liquid inside was amazingly good, fiery but smooth. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man named Gibbs, from Aberdeenshire. Ye wouldna think they ken anything about whisky-making there, but doubtless he learnt it somewhere else. He lives in a place called Hogue Corners; d\u2019ye ken it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it can\u2019t be that far away. It\u2019s his own make, is it? Jamie would be interested.\u201d I took a second mouthful and handed back the flask, holding the whisky in my mouth to savor.</p><p>\u201cAye, I thought so, too. I have a wee bottle for him in my sack.\u201d She sipped and nodded approvingly. \u201cWho was the dirty fat lumpkin that scairt ye at Beardsley\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>I choked on the whisky, swallowed it the wrong way, and nearly coughed my lungs out in consequence. Jenny put down the flask, kirtled up her skirts, and waded into the creek, sousing her hankie in the cold water; she handed it to me, then cupped water in her hand and poured a little into my mouth.</p> <p>\u201cLucky there\u2019s plenty of water, as ye said,\u201d she remarked. \u201cHere, have a bit more.\u201d I nodded, eyes streaming, but pulled up my skirts, got down on my knees, and drank for myself, pausing to breathe between mouthfuls, until I stopped wheezing.</p><p>\u201cI wasna in any doubt, mind,\u201d Jenny said, watching this performance. \u201cBut if I had been, I wouldn\u2019t be now. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bloody know,\u201d I said crossly, climbing back on my rock. Jenny wasn\u2019t one to be daunted by tones of voice, though, and merely raised one gull-wing-shaped brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I repeated, a little more calmly. \u201cI\u2014had just seen him somewhere else. I have no idea who he is, though.\u201d</p><p>She was examining me with the interested air of a scientist with a new microorganism trapped under her microscope.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye. And where was it ye saw the fellow before? Because ye certainly kent him this time. Ye were fair gobsmacked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I thought it would make the slightest bit of difference, I\u2019d tell you it\u2019s none of your business,\u201d I said, giving her a look. \u201cGive me that flask, will you?\u201d</p><p>She gave it to me, watching patiently while I took several tiny sips and made up my mind what to say. At last I drew a deep, whisky-scented breath and gave her back the flask.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I don\u2019t know whether Jamie told you that about five years ago a gang of bandits who were terrorizing the countryside came through the Ridge. They burnt our malting shed\u2014or tried to\u2014and hurt Marsali. And they\u2014they took me. Hostage.\u201d</p><p>Jenny handed back the flask, not speaking, but with a look of deep sympathy in her dark-blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cJamie . . . got me back. He brought men with him, and there was a terrible fight. Most of the gang was killed, but\u2014obviously a few got away in the darkness. That\u2014that man was one of them. No, it\u2019s all right, I don\u2019t need any more.\u201d I\u2019d held the flask like a talisman of courage while I told her but now handed it back. She took a long, meditative swallow.</p><p>\u201cBut ye didna try to find out his name? Folk there kent him, I could see; they\u2019d have told ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know!\u201d I spoke loudly enough that one of the goats nearby emitted a startled meh-eh-eh! and bounded over a tussock of grass, evidently not discommoded at all by its hobbles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said, less loudly but no less firmly. \u201cThe\u2014ringleaders\u2014are all dead; so are most of the others. This fellow . . . he . . . well, you can tell by looking at him, can\u2019t you? What did you call him\u2014\u2018a dirty fat lumpkin\u2019? That\u2019s just what he is. He\u2019s no danger to us. I just\u2014want to forget about him,\u201d I ended, rather lamely.</p> <p>She nodded, stifled a small belch, looked startled at the sound, and, shaking her head, corked the flask and put it away.</p><p>We sat for a bit in silence, listening to the rush of water and the birds in the trees behind us. There was a mockingbird somewhere nearby, running through its lengthy repertoire in a voice like brass.</p><p>After ten minutes or so, Jenny stretched, arching her back and sighing.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll remember my daughter Maggie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, smiling a little. \u201cI delivered her. Or, rather, I caught her. You did the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo ye did,\u201d she said, splashing one foot in the water. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a sharp look. If she had, it would be the first thing she ever had forgotten, at least to my knowledge, and I didn\u2019t think she was old enough to have begun forgetting things now.</p><p>\u201cShe was raped,\u201d she said, eyes on the water and her voice very steady. \u201cNot badly\u2014the man didna beat her\u2014but she got wi\u2019 child by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terrible,\u201d I said quietly, after a pause. \u201cIt\u2014not a government soldier, though, surely?\u201d That had been my first thought\u2014but Maggie would have been no more than a child during the years of the Rising and Cumberland\u2019s clearing of the Highlands, when the British army had burned, plundered, and, yes, indeed, raped their way through any number of villages and crofts.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jenny said thoughtfully. \u201cIt was her husband\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s what I said about it, when she told me.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cThat was the one good thing about it, though; Geordie\u2014that was the brother\u2014had the same color hair and eyes as her husband, Paul, so the bairn could be passed off easy enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014did she?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help asking. \u201cPass it off?\u201d</p><p>Jenny let out a long sigh and nodded, taking her feet out of the water and tucking them up beneath her petticoat.</p><p>\u201cShe asked me what to do, poor lassie. I prayed about it\u2014God, I prayed!\u201d she said, with sudden violence, then snorted a little. \u201cAnd I told her not to tell him\u2014tell Paul, I mean. For if she did, what would be the end of it? One of them dead\u2014for a Hieland man canna live wi\u2019 a man who\u2019s raped his wife nearby, nor should he\u2014and it might be Paul, as like as not. And even if he only beat Geordie and drove him off, everyone would get to know what was behind it, and the poor wee lad\u2014that was Wally, though of course we didna ken that yet, whilst we were talking it over\u2014but the bairn branded as a bastard and the child of rape\u2014what would become of it?\u201d</p><p>She leaned down and, scooping up a handful of water, threw it over her face. She put her head back, eyes closed and the water running off her high, sharp cheekbones, and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd the family\u2014Paul and Geordie\u2019s? A thing like that would tear them to pieces\u2014and put them at loggerheads wi\u2019 us, nay doubt, for they\u2019d be insisting up and down that Maggie was lying, rather than believe such a thing. Fat-heided creatures, the Carmichaels,\u201d she said judiciously. \u201cLoyal enough, but stubborn as rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus sayeth a Fraser,\u201d I remarked. \u201cThe Carmichaels must be something special in that line.\u201d</p><p>Jenny snorted but didn\u2019t reply for a moment or two.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said at last, turning to look at me, \u201cI said to Maggie that I\u2019d prayed about it, and it seemed to me that if she could bear it for the sake of her man and her bairns, she should say nothing. Try to forgive Geordie if she could, and if she couldn\u2019t, keep away from him\u2014but say nothing. And that\u2019s what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014did Geordie do?\u201d I asked curiously. \u201cDid he\u2014does he know that Wally is his son?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken. He left, a month after the bairn was born\u2014emigrated to Canada. No one was surprised at that; everyone kent he was mad in love wi\u2019 Maggie and beside himself when she chose Paul. I expect that made it easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of sight, out of mind? Yes, I\u2019d suppose so,\u201d I said dryly. I thought I shouldn\u2019t ask but couldn\u2019t help myself. \u201cDid Maggie ever tell Paul\u2014after Geordie left, I mean?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and stood up, a little stiffly, shaking down her skirts.</p><p>\u201cI dinna ken for sure, but I dinna think so. For her to tell him, after so long of keeping silent . . . how would he take that? And he\u2019d still hate his brother, even if he couldna kill him right away.\u201d Her blue eyes, so like Jamie\u2019s, looked at me with rueful amusement. \u201cYe canna have been marrit to a Hieland man all these years and not ken how deep they can hate. Come on\u2014we\u2019d best gather these creatures before they burst.\u201d And she waded off into the grass, shoes in her hand, calling out a G\u00e0idhlig charm for gathering livestock:</p><p>\u201cThe Three who are above in the City of glory,</p><p>Be shepherding my flock and my kine,</p><p>Tending them duly in heat, in storm, and in cold,</p><p>With the blessing of power driving them down</p><p>From yonder height to the sheiling fold.\u201d</p><p>I THOUGHT about it, after everyone had rolled up in their blankets and begun snoring that night. Well . . . I hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about it since I\u2019d seen the man. But in light of the story that Jenny had told me, my thoughts began to clarify, much as throwing an egg into a pot of coffee will settle the grounds.</p><p>The notion of saying nothing was of course the first one to come to my mind and was still my intent. The only difficulty\u2014well, there were two, to be honest. But the first one was that, irritating as it was to be told so repeatedly, I couldn\u2019t deny the fact that I had a glass face. If anything was seriously troubling me, the people I lived with immediately began glancing at me sideways, tiptoeing exaggeratedly around me\u2014or, in Jamie\u2019s case, demanding bluntly to know what the matter was.</p><p>Jenny had done much the same thing, though she hadn\u2019t pressed me for details of my experience. Quite plainly, she\u2019d guessed the outlines of it, though, or she wouldn\u2019t have chosen to tell me Maggie\u2019s story. It occurred to me belatedly to wonder whether Jamie had told her anything about Hodgepile\u2019s attack and its aftermath.</p><p>The underlying difficulty, though, was my own response to meeting the dirty fat lumpkin. I snorted every time I repeated the description to myself, but it actually helped. He was a man, and not a very prepossessing one. Not a monster. Not . . . not bloody worth making a fuss about. God knew how he\u2019d come to join Hodgepile\u2019s band\u2014I supposed that most criminal gangs were largely composed of feckless idiots, come to that.</p><p>And . . . little as I wanted to relive that experience . . . I did. He hadn\u2019t come to me with any intent of hurting me, in fact hadn\u2019t hurt me (which was not to say that he hadn\u2019t crushed me with his weight, forced my thighs apart, and stuck his c**k into me . . .).</p><p>I unclenched my teeth, drew a deep breath, and started over.</p><p>He\u2019d come to me out of opportunity\u2014and need.</p><p>\u201cMartha,\u201d he\u2019d said, sobbing, his tears and snot warm on my neck. \u201cMartha, I loved you so.\u201d</p><p>Could I forgive him on those grounds? Put aside the unpleasantness of what he\u2019d done to me and see him only as the pathetic creature that he was?</p><p>If I could\u2014would that stop him living in my mind, a constant burr under the blanket of my thoughts?</p><p>I put back my head, looking up at the deep black sky swimming with hot stars. If you knew they were really balls of flaming gas, you could imagine them as van Gogh saw them, without difficulty . . . and looking into that illuminated void, you understood why people have always looked up into the sky when talking to God. You need to feel the immensity of something very much bigger than yourself, and there it is\u2014immeasurably vast, and always near at hand. Covering you.</p><p>Help me, I said silently.</p><p>I never talked to Jamie about Jack Randall. But I knew from the few things he told me\u2014and the disjointed things he said in the worst of his dreams\u2014that this was how he had chosen to survive. He\u2019d forgiven Jack Randall. Over and over. But he was a stubborn man; he could do it. A thousand times, and still one more.</p><p>Help me, I said, and felt tears trickle down my temples, into my hair. Please. Help me.</p><p>THINGS COMING INTO VIEW</p><p>IT WORKED. NOT EASILY, and often not for more than a few minutes at a time\u2014but the shock faded and, back at home, with the peace of the mountain and the love of family and friends surrounding me, I felt a welcome sense of balance return. I prayed, and I forgave, and I coped.</p><p>This was greatly helped by distraction. Summer is the busiest time in an agricultural community. And when men are working with scythes and hoes and wagons and livestock and guns and knives\u2014they hurt themselves. As for the women and children\u2014burns and household accidents and constipation and diarrhea and teething and . . . pinworms.</p><p>\u201cThere, you see?\u201d I said in a low voice, holding a lighted candle a few inches from the bu**ocks of Tammas Wilson, aged two. Tammas, drawing the not unreasonable conclusion that I was about to scorch his bum or ram the candle up his backside, shrieked and kicked, trying to escape. His mother took a firmer grip on him, though, and pried his bu**ocks apart again, revealing the tiny white wriggles of female pinworms swarming round his less than ideally immaculate small anus.</p><p>\u201cChrist between us and evil,\u201d Annie Wilson said, letting go with one hand in order to cross herself. Tammas made a determined effort at escape and nearly succeeded in pitching himself headfirst into the fire. I seized him by one foot, though, and hauled him back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThose are the females,\u201d I explained. \u201cThey crawl out at night and lay eggs on the skin. The eggs cause itching, and so, of course, your wee lad scratches. That\u2019s what causes the redness and rash. But then he spreads the eggs to things he touches\u201d\u2014and, Tammas being two, he touched everything within reach\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s why your whole family is likely infected.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Wilson squirmed slightly on her stool, whether because of pinworms or embarrassment, I couldn\u2019t tell, and righted Tammas, who promptly wriggled out of her lap and made for the bed containing his two elder sisters, aged four and five. I grabbed him round the waist and lugged him back over to the hearth.</p><p>\u201cBride save us, what shall I do for it?\u201d Annie asked, glancing helplessly from the sleeping girls to Mr. Wilson, who\u2014worn out from his day\u2019s work\u2014was curled in the other bed, snoring.</p><p>\u201cWell, for the older children and adults, you use this.\u201d I took a bottle out of my basket and handed it over, rather gingerly. It wasn\u2019t actually explosive, but, knowing its effects, it always gave me that illusion.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tonic of flowering spurge and wild ipecac root. It\u2019s a very strong laxative\u2014that means it will give you the blazing shits,\u201d I amended, seeing her incomprehension, \u201cbut a few doses will get rid of the pinworms, provided you can keep Tammas and the girls from respreading them. And for the smaller children\u2014\u201d I handed over a pot of garlic paste, strong enough to make Annie wrinkle her nose, even though it was corked. \u201cTake a large glob on your finger and smear it round the child\u2019s bumhole\u2014and, er, up inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d she said, looking resigned, and took both pot and bottle. It probably wasn\u2019t the worst thing she\u2019d ever done as a mother. I gave her instructions regarding the boiling of bedding and strict advice about soap and religious hand-washing, wished her well, and left, feeling a strong urge to scratch my own bottom.</p><p>This faded on the walk back to the Higginses\u2019 cabin, though, and I slid into the pallet beside Jamie with the peaceful sense of a job well done.</p><p>He rolled over drowsily and embraced me, then sniffed.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name have ye been doing, Sassenach?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I assured him. \u201cWhat do I smell like?\u201d If it was just garlic, I wasn\u2019t getting up. If it was feces, though . . .</p><p>\u201cGarlic,\u201d he said, luckily. \u201cYe smell like a French gigot d\u2019agneau.\u201d His stomach rumbled at the thought, and I laughed\u2014quietly.</p><p>\u201cI think the best you\u2019re likely to get is parritch for your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d he said comfortably. \u201cThere\u2019s honey for it.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT AFTERNOON, there being no pressing medical calls, I climbed up to the new house site with Jamie. The shield-shaped green leaves and arching stems of the wild strawberries were everywhere, spattering the hillside with tiny, sour-sweet red hearts. I\u2019d brought a small basket with me\u2014I never went anywhere without one in spring or summer\u2014and had it half filled by the time we reached the clearing, with its fine view of the whole cove that lay below the Ridge.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like a lifetime ago that we came here first,\u201d I remarked, sitting down on one of the stacks of half-hewn timbers and pulling off my wide-brimmed hat to let the breeze blow through my hair. \u201cDo you remember when we found the strawberries?\u201d I offered a handful of the fruit to Jamie.</p> <p>\u201cMore like two or three. Lifetimes, I mean. But, aye, I remember.\u201d He smiled, sat down beside me, and plucked one of the tiny berries from the palm of my hand. He motioned at the more or less level ground before us, where he\u2019d laid out a rough floor plan with pegs driven into the earth and string outlining the rooms.</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll want your surgery in the front, aye? The same as it was? That\u2019s how I\u2019ve put it, but it\u2019s easy changed, if ye like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so. I\u2019ll be in there more than anywhere; be nice to be able to look out the window and see what sort of hideous emergency is coming.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d spoken in complete seriousness, but he laughed and took a few more strawberries.</p><p>\u201cAt least if they have to come uphill, it will slow them down a bit.\u201d He\u2019d brought up the rough writing desk he\u2019d made and now put it on his knee, opening it to show me his plans, neatly ruled in pencil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have my speak-a-word room across the hall from you, like we did before\u2014ye\u2019ll see I\u2019ve made the hallway wider, because of the staircase landing\u2014and I think I\u2019d maybe like a wee parlor there, between the speak-a-word room and the kitchen. But the kitchen . . . d\u2019ye think we should maybe have a separate cookhouse, as well, like John Grey did in Philadelphia?\u201d</p><p>I considered that one for a moment, my mouth puckering a bit from the astringent berries. I wasn\u2019t surprised that the thought had occurred to him; anyone who\u2019d lived through one house fire, let alone two, would have a very lively awareness of the dangers.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d I said at last. \u201cThey do that as much because of the summer heat as for the danger of fire, and that\u2019s not a problem here. We\u2019ll have to have hearths in the house, after all. The danger of fire can\u2019t be that much greater if we\u2019re cooking on one of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSurely that depends who\u2019s doin\u2019 the cooking,\u201d Jamie said, cocking an eyebrow at me.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean anything personal by that remark, you may retract it,\u201d I said coolly. \u201cI may not be the world\u2019s best cook, but I\u2019ve never served you cinders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, ye are the only member o\u2019 the family who\u2019s ever burnt the house down, Sassenach. Ye\u2019ve got to admit that much.\u201d He was laughing and put up a casual hand to intercept the mock blow I aimed at him. His hand completely enclosed my fist, and he pulled me effortlessly off my perch and onto his knee.</p><p>He put an arm round me and his chin on my shoulder, brushing my hair out of his face with his free hand. He was barefoot and wearing only a shirt and his threadbare green-and-brown working plaid, the one he\u2019d bought from a rag dealer in Savannah. It was rucked up over his thigh; I pulled the fold out from under my bottom and smoothed it down over the long muscle of his leg.</p><p>\u201cAmy says there\u2019s a Scottish weaver in Cross Creek,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you next go down, maybe you should commission a new plaid\u2014maybe one in your own tartan, if the weaver\u2019s up to a Fraser red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well. There\u2019re plenty other things to spend money on, Sassenach. I dinna need to be grand to hunt or fish\u2014and I work the fields in my shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go round day in and day out in a gray flannel petticoat with holes in it and it wouldn\u2019t make any difference to my work\u2014but you wouldn\u2019t want me to do that, would you?\u201d</p><p>He made a low Scottish noise of amusement and shifted his weight, settling me more firmly.</p><p>\u201cI would not. I like to look at ye now and then in a fine gown, lass, wi\u2019 your hair put up and your sweet br**sts showin\u2019. Besides,\u201d he added, \u201ca man\u2019s judged by how well he provides for his family. If I let ye go around in rags, folk would think I was either mean or improvident.\u201d It was clear from his tone which of these conditions would be the more frightful sin.</p><p>\u201cOh, they would not,\u201d I said, mostly teasing for the sake of argument. \u201cEveryone on the Ridge knows perfectly well that you\u2019re neither one. Besides, don\u2019t you think I like to look at you in all your glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s verra frivolous of ye, Sassenach; I should never have expected something like that from Dr. C.E.B.R. Fraser.\u201d He was laughing again but stopped abruptly as he turned a little.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said into my ear, and pointed down the side of the cove. \u201cJust there, on the right, where the creek comes out o\u2019 the trees. See her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d I said, spotting the smudge of white moving slowly among the green mats of cress and duckweed. \u201cIt can\u2019t be, surely?\u201d I couldn\u2019t make out details at that distance without my glasses, but from the way it moved, the object in question was almost certainly a pig. A big pig. A big white pig.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it\u2019s no the white sow, it\u2019s a daughter just like her. But my guess is that it\u2019s the auld besom herself. I\u2019d know that proud rump anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d I leaned back against him with a little sigh of satisfaction. \u201cNow I know we\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2019ll sleep under your own roof within a month, a nighean,\u201d he said, and I could hear the smile in his voice. \u201cMind, it may not be more than the roof of a lean-to, to start\u2014but it\u2019ll be our own. By the winter, though, I\u2019ll have the chimneys built, the walls all up, and the roof on; I can be puttin\u2019 in the floors and the doors while there\u2019s snow on the ground.\u201d</p><p>I put a hand up to cup his cheek, warm and lightly stubbled. I didn\u2019t fool myself that this was paradise or even a refuge from the war\u2014wars tended not to stay in one place but moved around, much in the manner of cyclones and even more destructive where they touched down. But for however long it lasted, this was home, and now was peace.</p><p>We sat in silence for a while, watching hawks circle over the open ground below and the machinations of the white sow\u2014if indeed it was she\u2014who had now been joined in her foraging by a number of smaller porcine blobs, doubtless this spring\u2019s litter. At the foot of the cove, two men on horseback came into sight from the wagon road, and I felt Jamie\u2019s attention sharpen, then relax.</p><p>\u201cHiram Crombie and the new circuit rider,\u201d he said. \u201cHiram said he meant to go down to the crossroads and fetch the man up, so he\u2019d not lose his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean so Hiram can make sure he\u2019s dour enough for the job,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cYou realize they\u2019ll have got out of the habit of thinking you\u2019re human, don\u2019t you?\u201d Hiram Crombie was head man of the little group of settlers that Jamie had acquired six years before. All of them were Presbyterians of a particularly rock-ribbed disposition and inclined to regard Papists as being deeply perverse, if not actually the spawn of Satan.</p><p>Jamie made a small noise, but it was one of tolerant dismissal.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get used to me again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d pay money to watch Hiram talk to Rachel. Here, Sassenach, my leg\u2019s gone asleep.\u201d He helped me off his lap and stood up, shaking his kilt into place. Faded or not, it suited him, and my heart rose to see him looking so much as he should: tall and broad-shouldered, head of his household, once more master of his own land.</p><p>He looked out over the cove again, sighed deeply, and turned to me.</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of hideous emergencies,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cye do want to see them coming. So ye can be fettled against them, aye?\u201d His eyes met mine directly. \u201cWould now be a good time to tell me what\u2019s coming, d\u2019ye think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHERE\u2019S NOTHING wrong,\u201d I said, for probably the tenth time. I picked at a scab of bark still clinging to the timber I sat on. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly all right. Really.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was standing in front of me, the cove and the clouded sky bright behind him, his face shadowed.</p><p>\u201cSassenach,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cI\u2019m a great deal more stubborn than you are, and ye ken that fine. Now, I know something upset ye when ye went to Beardsley\u2019s place, and I know ye dinna want to tell me about it. Sometimes I ken ye need to fettle your mind about a matter before ye speak, but you\u2019ve had time and more to do that\u2014and I see that whatever it is is worse than I thought, or ye\u2019d have said by now.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, trying to think of something to tell him that perhaps wasn\u2019t quite . . . I looked up at him and decided that, no, I couldn\u2019t lie to him\u2014and not only because he\u2019d be able to tell immediately that I was lying.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember,\u201d I said slowly, looking up at him, \u201con our wedding night? You told me you wouldn\u2019t ask me to tell you things that I couldn\u2019t. You said that love had room for secrets, but not for lies. I won\u2019t lie to you, Jamie\u2014but I really don\u2019t want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight from one leg to the other and sighed.</p><p>\u201cIf ye think that\u2019s going to relieve my mind, Sassenach . . .\u201d he said, and shook his head. \u201cI didna say that, anyway. I do remember the occasion\u2014vividly\u201d\u2014and he smiled a little at me\u2014\u201cand what I said was that there was nothing between us then but respect\u2014and that I thought respect maybe had room for secrets, but not for lies.\u201d</p><p>He paused for a moment, then said very gently, \u201cD\u2019ye no think there\u2019s more than respect between us now, mo chridhe?\u201d</p><p>I took a very deep breath. My heart was thumping against my stays, but it was just normal agitation, not panic.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, looking up at him. \u201cJamie . . . please don\u2019t ask me just now. I truly think it\u2019s all right; I\u2019ve been praying about it, and\u2014and\u2014I think it will be all right,\u201d I ended, rather lamely. I stood up, though, and took his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I think I can,\u201d I said. \u201cCan you live with that?\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened as he thought. He wasn\u2019t a man for facile answers. If he couldn\u2019t live with it, he\u2019d tell me.</p><p>\u201cIs it a matter that I might need to make preparation for?\u201d he asked seriously. \u201cIf it might cause a fight of some kind, I mean, I should need to be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I let out the breath I\u2019d been holding, somewhat relieved. \u201cNo. No, it isn\u2019t anything like that. More of a moral question kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>I could see that he wasn\u2019t happy about that; his eyes searched my face, and I saw the troubled look in them, but at last he nodded, slowly.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll live with it, a nighean,\u201d he said softly, and kissed my forehead. \u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>INTERRUPTUS</p><p>THE OTHER MAJOR THINGS requiring a healer\u2019s attention in summer were pregnancy and birth. I prayed every day that Marsali had safely delivered her child. Even though it was already June 1, it would likely be months before we had any news, but I had examined her before we parted company\u2014with tears\u2014in Charleston, and all seemed normal.</p><p>\u201cDo ye think this one might be . . . like Henri-Christian?\u201d She spoke the name with difficulty and pressed a hand to her swelling belly.</p> <p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I said, and saw the emotions ripple across her face like wind passing over water. Fear, regret . . . relief.</p><p>I crossed myself, with another quick prayer, and walked up the path to the MacDonald cottage, where Rachel and Ian were staying until Ian could build them a place of their own. Rachel was sitting on the bench out front, shelling peas into a basin, the basin sitting comfortably atop her stomach.</p><p>\u201cMadainn mhath!\u201d she said, smiling in delight when she saw me. \u201cIs thee not impressed with my linguistic facility, Claire? I can say \u2018Good morning,\u2019 \u2018Good night,\u2019 \u2018How are you?\u2019 and \u2018Bugger off to St. Kilda\u2019 now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d I said, sitting down next to her. \u201cHow does that last one go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRach a h-Irt,\u201d she told me. \u201cI gather \u2018St. Kilda\u2019 is actually a figure of speech indicating some extremely remote location, rather than being specified as the actual destination.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised. Do you try to impose the principles of plain speech on G\u00e0idhlig, or is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cMother Jenny proposes to teach me the Lord\u2019s Prayer in G\u00e0idhlig. Perhaps I can tell from that, as presumably one addresses the Creator in the same sort of voice that one uses for plain speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought about that, but it was sensible. \u201cSo you call God \u2018Thee\u2019 when speaking to Him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Who should be a closer Friend?\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t occurred to me, but presumably that was why one used \u201cthou,\u201d \u201cthy,\u201d et cetera, in prayer; that was originally the familiar form of the singular pronoun \u201cyou,\u201d even though common English speech had now moved on and lost the distinction, save for the Friends\u2019 plain speech.</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd how is Oggy today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRestless,\u201d she said, catching the edge of the basin as a vigorous kick made it bounce, scattering peas. \u201cSo am I,\u201d she added, as I brushed the spilled peas off her petticoat and poured them back into the pan.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cPregnancy actually does last forever\u2014until suddenly you go into labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d she said fervently. \u201cNeither can Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>A slow, glorious blush rose up from the neck of her shift and suffused her to the hairline.</p><p>\u201cI wake him six times a night, rising to piss,\u201d she said, avoiding my eye. \u201cAnd Oggy kicks him, nearly as much as he does me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I said invitingly.</p><p>The blush deepened slightly.</p> <p>\u201cHe says he can\u2019t wait to, er, suckle me,\u201d she said diffidently. She coughed and then looked up, the blush fading a little.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d she said, now serious, \u201che\u2019s anxious for the child. Thee knows about his children by the Mohawk woman; he said he\u2019d told thee, making up his mind if it was right for him to marry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Yes, he would be.\u201d I laid a hand on her belly, feeling the reassuring pressure of a thrusting foot and the long curve of a tiny back. The baby hadn\u2019t dropped, but Oggy was at least head-down. That was a great relief.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d I said, and squeezed her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid for myself at all,\u201d she said, smiling and squeezing back. The smile faded a little as she put her hand on her stomach. \u201cBut very much afraid for them.\u201d</p><p>THE WEATHER being fine\u2014and the smallest Higgins teething\u2014we took a pair of quilts and walked up to the house site after supper, to enjoy the long twilight. And a little privacy.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think we\u2019re likely to be interrupted by a bear or some other form of wildlife, do you?\u201d I asked, shimmying out of the rough gown I wore for foraging.</p><p>\u201cNo. I spoke wi\u2019 Jo Beardsley yesterday; he told me the nearest bear is a good league that way\u2014\u201d He nodded toward the far side of the cove. \u201cAnd they dinna travel far in the summer, while the eating\u2019s good where they are. And painters wouldna trouble wi\u2019 people while there are easier things to kill. I\u2019ll make a bitty fire, though, just on principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Lizzie?\u201d I asked, unfolding the quilts as I watched him assemble a small fire with deft efficiency. \u201cDid Jo say?\u201d</p><p>Jamie smiled, eyes on what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cHe did, at some length. The meat of it bein\u2019 that she\u2019s well enough but summat inclined to bite pieces out o\u2019 him and Kezzie to distract her mind. That\u2019s why Jo was out hunting; Kezzie stays in when she\u2019s frachetty, because he canna hear her so well.\u201d The Beardsley twins were identical, and so alike that the only sure way to tell which you were talking to was that Keziah was hard of hearing, as the result of a childhood infection.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. No malaria, I mean.\u201d I\u2019d visited Lizzie soon after our arrival and found her and the brood thriving\u2014but she\u2019d told me that she\u2019d had a few \u201cspells\u201d of fever during the last year, doubtless owing to lack of the Jesuit bark. I\u2019d left her with most of what I\u2019d brought from Savannah. I should have thought to ask if they had any at the trading post, I thought\u2014and pushed away the heavy sense of uneasiness that came with the thought of that place, thinking firmly, I forgive you.</p><p>The fire built, we sat feeding it sticks and watching the last of the sunset go down in flaming banners of golden cloud behind the black pickets of the farthest ridge.</p><p>And with the light of the fire dancing on the stacked timbers and the piles of foundation stones, we enjoyed the privacy of our home, rudimentary as said home might be at the moment. We lay peacefully afterward between our quilts\u2014it wasn\u2019t cold but, so high up, the heat of the day vanished swiftly from the air\u2014and watched the flickering lights of chimney sparks and lighted windows, in the few houses visible among the trees of the cove. Before the lights were extinguished for the night, we were asleep.</p><p>I woke sometime later from an erotic dream, squirming slowly on the lumpy quilt, limbs heavy with desire. This seemed to happen more frequently as I grew older, as though making love with Jamie ignited a fire that didn\u2019t quite die but continued to smolder through the night. If I didn\u2019t wake enough to do something about it, I\u2019d wake in the morning stupid and foggy with unslaked dreams and unquiet sleep.</p><p>Fortunately, I was awake and, while still very pleasantly drowsy, quite capable of doing something about it, the process made much easier by the presence of the large, warm, pungent-smelling male beside me. He shifted a little as I edged onto my back, making a little space between us, but resumed his regular heavy breathing at once, and I edged my hand downward, encountering tumid warmth. It wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jamie shifted again, and my hand stilled between my thighs. Then his hand slid swiftly under the quilt and touched me in the same place, nearly stopping my heart.</p><p>\u201cI dinna mean to interrupt ye, Sassenach,\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cBut would ye like a bit of help wi\u2019 that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I said rather faintly. \u201cAh . . . what did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>In answer, the tip of his tongue darted into my ear, and I let out a small shriek. He snorted with amusement and cupped his hand between my legs, dislodging my own fingers, which had gone rather limp. One large finger stroked me delicately, and I arched my back.</p><p>\u201cOoh, ye\u2019re well started, then,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYe\u2019re slick and briny as an oyster, Sassenach. Ye hadna finished yet, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014how long were you listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, long enough,\u201d he assured me, and, ceasing operations for a moment, took hold of my disengaged hand and folded it firmly round a very enthusiastic bit of his own anatomy. \u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cWell . . .\u201d My legs had taken stock of the situation much more quickly than my mind had, and so had he. He lowered his head and kissed me in the dark with a soft, eager thoroughness, then pulled his mouth away long enough to ask, \u201cHow do elephants make love?\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, he didn\u2019t wait for an answer, as I hadn\u2019t got one. He rolled over me and slid home in the same movement, and the universe shrank suddenly to a single vivid point.</p><p>A few minutes later, we lay under the blazing stars, quilt thrown off and hearts thumping slowly back to normal.</p><p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d I said, \u201cthat your heart actually does stop for a moment at the point of climax? That\u2019s why your heartbeat is slow for a minute or two after; the sympathetic nervous system has fired all its synapses, leaving the parasympathetic to run your heart, and the parasympathetic decreases heart rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed it stopped,\u201d he assured me. \u201cDidna really care why, as long as it started again.\u201d He put his arms over his head and stretched luxuriously, enjoying the cool air on his skin. \u201cActually, I never cared whether it started again, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man for you,\u201d I remarked tolerantly. \u201cNo forethought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe dinna need forethought for that, Sassenach. What ye were doing when I interrupted ye, I mean. I admit, if there\u2019s a woman involved, ye have to think of all sorts of things, but no for that.\u201d He paused for a moment.</p><p>\u201cUm. Did I not . . . serve ye well enough earlier, Sassenach?\u201d he asked, a little shyly. \u201cI would ha\u2019 taken more time, but I couldna wait, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d I assured him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that\u2014I mean, I just . . . enjoyed it so much I woke up wanting more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed with a deep, contented sigh, closing his eyes. There was a waxing moon and I could see him clearly, though the moonlight washed all color from the scene, leaving him a sculpture in black and white. I ran a hand down his chest and lightly over his still-flat belly\u2014hard physical labor had its price, but also its benefits\u2014and cupped his genitals, warm and damp in my hand.</p><p>\u201cTha ball-ratha s\u00ecnte riut,\u201d he said, putting a big hand over mine.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d I said. \u201cA lucky . . . leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, limb, really; leg would be overstating it by a good deal. \u2018There is a lucky limb stretched against you.\u2019 It\u2019s the first line of a poem by Alasdair mac Mhaighistir Alasdair. \u2018To an Excellent Penis,\u2019 it\u2019s called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought highly of himself, did Alasdair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesna say it\u2019s his\u2014though I admit that\u2019s the implication.\u201d He squinted a little, eyes still closed, and declaimed:</p><p>\u201cTha ball-ratha s\u00ecnte riut</p><p>A choisinn m\u00ecle buaidh</p><p>S\u00e0r-bodh iallach acfhainneach</p><p>Rinn-gheur sgaiteach cruaidh</p><p>\u00d9illeach feitheach feadanach</p><p>L\u00e0idir seasmhach buan</p><p>Be\u00f2dha tre\u00f2rach togarrach</p><p>Nach di\u00f9ltadh bog no cruaidh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay,\u201d I said. \u201cDo it in English; I believe I\u2019ve missed a few of the finer points. He can\u2019t really have compared his penis to a bagpipe\u2019s chanter, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, he did,\u201d Jamie confirmed, then translated:</p><p>\u201cThere is a lucky limb stretched against you</p><p>That has made a thousand conquests:</p><p>An excellent penis that is leathery, well-equipped,</p><p>Sharp-pointed, piercing, firm,</p><p>Lubricated, sinewy, chanter-like,</p><p>Strong, durable, long-enduring,</p><p>Vigorous, powerful, joyous,</p><p>That would not jilt either soft or hard body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeathery, is it?\u201d I said, giggling. \u201cI don\u2019t wonder, after a thousand conquests. What does he mean, \u2018well-equipped,\u2019 though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldna ken. I suppose I must have seen it once or twice\u2014havin\u2019 a piss by the side o\u2019 the road, I mean\u2014but if so, I wasna greatly struck by its virtues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew this Alasdair?\u201d I rolled over and propped my head on my arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye. So did you, though ye maybe didna ken he wrote poetry, you not having much G\u00e0idhlig in those days.\u201d</p><p>I still didn\u2019t have a great deal, though now that we were among G\u00e0idhlig-speaking people again, it was coming back.</p><p>\u201cWhere did we know him? In the Rising?\u201d</p><p>He was Prince Tearlach\u2019s G\u00e0idhlig tutor.</p><p>\u201cAye. He wrote a great many poems and songs about the Stuart cause.\u201d And now that he reminded me, I thought I did perhaps recall him: a middle-aged man singing in the firelight, long-haired and clean-shaven, with a deep cleft in his chin. I\u2019d always wondered how he managed to shave so neatly with a cutthroat razor.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d I had distinctly mixed feelings about people like Alasdair. On the one hand, without them stirring the pot and exciting irrational romanticism, the Cause might easily have withered and died long before Culloden. On the other . . . because of them, the battlefields\u2014and those who had fallen there\u2014were remembered.</p><p>Before I could think too deeply on that subject, though, Jamie interrupted my thoughts by idly brushing his penis to one side.</p><p>\u201cThe schoolmasters made me learn to write wi\u2019 my right hand,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut luckily it didna occur to anyone to force me to abuse myself that way, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy call it that?\u201d I asked, laughing. \u201cAbusing yourself, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, \u2018masturbate\u2019 sounds a great deal more wicked, aye? And if ye\u2019re abusing yourself, it sounds less like ye\u2019re havin\u2019 a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong, durable, long-enduring,\u201d I quoted, stroking the object in question lightly. \u201cPerhaps Alasdair meant something like glove leather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVigorous and powerful it may be, Sassenach, and certainly joyous\u2014but I tell ye, it\u2019s no going to rise to the occasion three times in one night. Not at my age.\u201d Detaching my hand, he rolled over, scooping me into a spoon shape before him, and in less than a minute was sound asleep.</p> <p>When I woke in the morning, he was gone.</p><p>VISIT TO A HAUNTED GARDEN</p><p>I BLOODY KNEW. From the moment I woke to birdsong and a cold quilt beside me, I knew. Jamie often rose before dawn, for hunting, fishing, or travel\u2014but he invariably touched me before he left, leaving me with a word or a kiss. We\u2019d lived long enough to know how chancy life could be and how swiftly people could be parted forever. We\u2019d never spoken of it or made a formal custom of it, but we almost never parted without some brief token of affection.</p><p>And now he\u2019d gone off in the dark, without a word.</p><p>\u201cYou bloody, bloody man!\u201d I said, and thumped the ground with my fist in frustration.</p> <p>I made my way down the hill, quilts folded under my arm, fuming. Jenny. He\u2019d gone and talked to Jenny. Of course he had; why hadn\u2019t I foreseen that?</p><p>He\u2019d agreed not to ask me. He hadn\u2019t said he wouldn\u2019t ask anyone else. And while Jenny clearly loved me, I\u2019d never been under any illusions as to where her ultimate loyalty lay. She wouldn\u2019t have voluntarily given up my secret, but if her brother asked her, point-blank, she would certainly have told him.</p><p>The sun was spreading warmth like honey over the morning, but none of it was reaching my cold bones.</p><p>He knew. And he\u2019d gone a-hunting.</p><p>I DIDN\u2019T NEED to look but looked anyway. Jamie\u2019s rifle was gone from its place behind the door.</p><p>\u201cHe came in early,\u201d Amy Higgins told me, spooning out a bowl of parritch for me. \u201cWe were all in bed still, but he called out soft, and Bobby got up to unbar the door. I would have fed him, but he said he was well enough and away he went. Hunting, he said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. The bowl was warm to my hands, and in spite of what I thought\u2014what I knew\u2014was going on, the thick grainy smell of it was enticing. And there was honey, and a little cream kept back from the butter-making; Amy allowed these in deference to Bobby\u2019s debauched English tastes, though she stuck to the usual virtuously Scottish salt on parritch herself.</p><p>Eating settled me, a little. The blunt fact was that there was absolutely nothing I could do. I didn\u2019t know the lumpkin\u2019s name or where he lived. Jamie might. If he\u2019d talked to Jenny right away, he could easily have sent word to Beardsley\u2019s trading post and asked who was the fat man with the port-wine stain on his face. Even if he didn\u2019t yet know and was on his way to find out, I had no means of catching up with him\u2014let alone stopping him.</p><p>\u201cA Hieland man canna live wi\u2019 a man who\u2019s raped his wife nearby, nor should he.\u201d That\u2019s what Jenny had said to me. In warning, I now realized.</p><p>\u201cGak!\u201d It was wee Rob, toddling round the room, who had seized my skirt in both hands and was giving me a toothy smile\u2014all four teeth of it. \u201cHungy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallo, there,\u201d I said, smiling back despite my disquiet. \u201cHungry, you say?\u201d I extended a small spoonful of honeyed parritch in his direction, and he went for it like a starving piranha. We shared the rest of the bowl in companionable silence\u2014Rob wasn\u2019t a chatty child\u2014and I decided that I would work in the garden today. I didn\u2019t want to go far afield, as Rachel could go into labor at any moment, from the looks of it. And a short spell of solitude amid the soothing company of the vegetable kingdom might lend me a bit of much-needed calm.</p><p>It would also get me out of the cabin, I reflected, as Rob, having licked the bowl, handed it back to me, toddled across the cabin, and, lifting his dress, peed in the hearth.</p><p>THERE WOULD BE a new kitchen garden near the new house. It was measured and planned, the earth broken, and poles for the deer fence had begun accumulating. But there was little point in walking that far each day to tend a garden when there was not yet a house to live in. I minded Amy\u2019s plot in the meantime, sneaking occasional seedlings and propagules into it between the cabbages and turnips\u2014but today I meant to visit the Old Garden.</p><p>That\u2019s what the people of the Ridge called it, and they didn\u2019t go there. I privately called it Malva\u2019s Garden, and did.</p> <p>It was on a small rise behind where the Big House had stood. With the new house rising already in my mind, I passed the bare spot where the Big House had been, without a qualm. There were more exigent things to be qualm about, I thought, and sniggered.</p><p>\u201cYou are losing your mind, Beauchamp,\u201d I murmured, but felt better.</p><p>The deer fence had weathered and broken down in spots, and the deer had naturally accepted the invitation. Most of the bulbs had been pawed up and eaten, and while a few of the softer plants, like lettuce and radishes, had escaped long enough to reseed themselves, the growing plants had been nibbled to scabby white stalks. But a very thorny wild rose brier flourished away in one corner, cucumber vines crawled over the ground, and a massive gourd vine rippled over a collapsed portion of the fence, thick with infant fruits.</p><p>A monstrous pokeweed rose from the center of the patch, nearly ten feet high, its thick red stem supporting a wealth of long green leaves and hundreds of purplish-red flower stalks. The nearby trees had grown immensely, shading the plot, and in the diffuse green light the long, nubbly stalks looked like nudibranchs, those colorful sea slugs, gently swaying in currents of air rather than water. I touched it respectfully in passing; it had an odd medicinal smell, well deserved. There were a number of useful things one could do with pokeweed, but eating it wasn\u2019t one of them. Which was to say, people did eat the leaves on occasion, but the chances of accidental poisoning made it not worth the trouble of preparation unless there was absolutely nothing else to eat.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t remember the exact spot where she\u2019d died. Where the pokeweed grew? That would be entirely apropos, but maybe too poetic.</p><p>Malva Christie. A strange, damaged young woman\u2014but one I\u2019d loved. Who perhaps had loved me, as well as she could. She\u2019d been with child and near her time when her brother\u2014the child\u2019s father\u2014had cut her throat, here in the garden.</p><p>I\u2019d found her moments later and tried to save the child, performing an emergency cesarean with my gardening knife. He\u2019d been alive when I pulled him from his mother\u2019s womb but died at once, the brief flame of his life a passing blue glow in my hands.</p><p>Did anyone name him? I wondered suddenly. They\u2019d buried the baby boy with Malva, but I didn\u2019t recall anyone mentioning his name.</p><p>Adso came stalking through the weeds, eyes intent on a fat robin poking busily for worms in the corner. I kept still, watching, admiring the lithe way in which he sank imperceptibly lower as he came more slowly, creeping on his belly for the last few feet, pausing, moving, pausing again for a long, nerve-racking second, no more than the tip of his tail a-twitch.</p><p>And then he moved, too fast for the eye to see, and in a brief and soundless explosion of feathers, it was over.</p><p>\u201cWell done, cat,\u201d I said, though in fact the sudden violence had startled me a little. He paid no attention but leapt through a low spot in the fence, his prey in his mouth, and disappeared to enjoy his meal.</p><p>I stood still for a moment. I wasn\u2019t looking for Malva; the Ridge folk said that her ghost haunted the garden, wailing for her child. Just the sort of thing they would think, I thought, rather uncharitably. I hoped her spirit had fled and was at peace. But I couldn\u2019t help thinking, too, of Rachel, so very different a soul, but a young mother, as well, so near her time, and so nearby.</p><p>My old gardening knife was long gone. But Jamie had made me a new one during the winter evenings in Savannah, the handle carved from whalebone, shaped, as the last one had been, to fit my hand. I took it from its sheath in my pocket and nicked my wrist, not stopping to think.</p><p>The white scar at the base of my thumb had faded, no more now than a thin line, almost lost in the lines that scored my palm. Still legible, though, if you knew where to look: the letter \u201cJ\u201d he had cut into my flesh just before Culloden. Claiming me.</p><p>I massaged the flesh near the cut gently, until a full red drop ran down the side of my wrist and fell to the ground at the foot of the pokeweed.</p><p>\u201cBlood for blood,\u201d I said, the words quiet in themselves but seeming drowned by the rustle of leaves all around. \u201cRest ye quiet, child\u2014and do no harm.\u201d</p><p>DO NO HARM. Well, you tried. As doctor, as lover, as mother and wife. I said a silent goodbye to the garden and went up the hill, toward the MacDonalds\u2019 cottage.</p><p>How would Jamie do it? I wondered, and was surprised to find that I did wonder, and wondered in a purely dispassionate way. He\u2019d taken the rifle. Would he pick the man off at a distance, as if he were a deer at water? A clean shot, the man dead before he knew it.</p><p>Or would he feel he must confront the man, tell him why he was about to die\u2014offer him a chance to fight for his life? Or just walk up with the cold face of vengeance, say nothing, and kill the man with his hands?</p><p>\u201cYe canna have been marrit to a Hieland man all these years and not ken how deep they can hate.\u201d</p><p>I really didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>Ian had shot Allan Christie with an arrow, as one would put down a rabid dog, and for precisely similar reasons.</p><p>I\u2019d seen Jamie\u2019s hate flame bright the night he saved me and said to his men, \u201cKill them all.\u201d</p><p>How was it now for him? If the man had been found on that night, there would have been no question that he would die. Should it be different now, only because time had passed?</p><p>I walked in the sun now but still felt cold, the shadows of Malva\u2019s Garden with me. The matter was out of my hands; no longer my business, but Jamie\u2019s.</p><p>I MET JENNY on the path, coming up briskly, a basket on her arm and her face alight with excitement.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cAye, Matthew MacDonald came down a half hour ago to say her water\u2019s broken. He\u2019s gone to find Ian now.\u201d</p><p>He had found Ian; we met the two young men in the dooryard of the cabin, Matthew bright red with excitement, Ian white as a sheet under his tan. The door of the cabin was open; I could hear the murmur of women\u2019s voices inside.</p><p>\u201cMam,\u201d Ian said huskily, seeing Jenny. His shoulders, stiff with terror, relaxed a little.</p><p>\u201cDinna fash yourself, a bhalaich,\u201d she said comfortably, and smiled sympathetically at him. \u201cYour auntie and I have done this a time or two before. It will be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrannie! Grannie!\u201d I turned to find Germain and Fanny, both covered with dirt and with sticks and leaves in their hair, faces bright with excitement. \u201cIs it true? Is Rachel having her baby? Can we watch?\u201d</p><p>How did it work? I wondered. News in the mountains seemed to travel through the air.</p><p>\u201cWatch, forbye!\u201d Jenny exclaimed, scandalized. \u201cChildbed isna any kind of a place for men. Be off with ye this minute!\u201d</p><p>Germain looked torn between disappointment and pleasure at being called a man. Fanny looked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no-t a man,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jenny and I both looked dubiously at her and then at each other.</p><p>\u201cWell, ye\u2019re no quite a woman yet, either, are ye?\u201d Jenny said to her. If not, she was close. Tiny br**sts were beginning to show when she was in her shift, and her menarche wasn\u2019t far off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve s-seen babies bor-n.\u201d It was a simple statement of fact, and Jenny nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cAye. All right, then.\u201d</p><p>Fanny beamed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Germain demanded, indignant. \u201cUs men.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and Jenny gave a deep chuckle that was older than time. Ian and Matthew looked startled, Germain quite taken aback.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle did his part of the business nine months ago, lad, just as ye\u2019ll do yours when it\u2019s time. Now, you and Matthew take your uncle awa\u2019 and get him drunk, aye?\u201d</p><p>Germain nodded quite seriously and turned to Ian.</p><p>\u201cDo you want Amy\u2019s wine, Ian, or shall we use Grandda\u2019s good whisky, do ye think?\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s long face twitched, and he glanced at the open cabin door. A deep grunt, not quite a groan, came out and he looked away, paling further. He swallowed and groped in the leather bag he wore at his waist, coming out with what looked like a rolled animal skin of some kind and handing it to me.</p><p>\u201cIf\u2014\u201d he started, then stopped to gather himself and started again. \u201cWhen the babe is born, will ye wrap him\u2014or her,\u201d\u2014he added hastily, \u201cin this?\u201d</p><p>It was a small skin, soft and flexible, with very thick, fine fur in shades of gray and white. A wolf, I thought, surprised. The hide of an unborn wolf pup.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Ian,\u201d I said, and squeezed his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will be all right.\u201d</p><p>Jenny looked at the small, soft skin and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI doubt, lad, if that will half-cover your bairn. Have ye no seen the size o\u2019 your wife lately?\u201d</p><p>AND YOU KNOW THAT</p><p>JAMIE CAME HOME three days later, with a large buck tied to Miranda\u2019s saddle. The horse seemed unenthused about this, though tolerant, and she whuffed air through her nostrils and shivered her hide when he dragged the carcass off, letting it fall with a thump.</p><p>\u201cAye, lass, ye\u2019ve done brawly,\u201d he said, clapping her on the shoulder. \u201cIs Ian about, a nighean?\u201d He paused to kiss me briefly, glancing up the hill toward the MacDonald cottage. \u201cI could use a bit of help wi\u2019 this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s here,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll come skin your deer for you, though. He\u2019s got a new son and won\u2019t let the baby out of his sight.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s face, rather tired and worn, broke into a grin.</p><p>\u201cA son? The blessing of Bride and Michael be on him! A braw lad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d I assured him. \u201cI think he must weigh almost nine pounds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoor lass,\u201d he said, with a sympathetic grimace. \u201cAnd her first, too. Wee Rachel\u2019s all right, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather tired and sore, but quite all right,\u201d I assured him. \u201cShall I bring you some beer, while you take care of the horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good wife is prized above rubies,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cCome to me, mo nighean donn.\u201d He reached out a long arm and drew me in, holding me close against him. I put my arms around him and felt the quiver of his muscles, exhausted, and the sheer hard strength still in him, that would hold him up, no matter how tired he might be. We stood quite still for some time, my cheek against his chest and his face against my hair, drawing strength from each other for whatever might come. Being married.</p><p>AMID THE GENERAL rejoicing and fuss over the baby\u2014who was still being called Oggy, his parents being spoiled for choice regarding his name\u2014the butchering of the deer, and the subsequent feasting lasting well into the night, it was late morning of the next day before we found ourselves alone again.</p><p>\u201cThe only thing lacking last night was cherry bounce,\u201d I remarked. \u201cI never saw so many people drink so much of so many different things.\u201d We were making our way\u2014slowly\u2014up to the house site, carrying several bags of nails, a very expensive small saw, and a plane that Jamie had brought back in addition to the deer.</p> <p>Jamie made a small amused sound but didn\u2019t reply. He paused for a moment to look up at the site, presumably envisioning the outline of the house-to-be.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019ye think it should maybe have a third story?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe walls would bear it easily enough. Take careful building of the chimneys, though, Keeping them plumb, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we need that much room?\u201d I asked doubtfully. There had certainly been times in the old house when I\u2019d wished we\u2019d had that much room: influxes of visitors, new emigrants, or refugees had often filled the place to the point of explosion\u2014mine. \u201cProviding more space might just encourage guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe make it sound like they\u2019re white ants, Sassenach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014oh, termites. Well, yes, there\u2019s a strong superficial resemblance.\u201d</p><p>Arrived at the clearing, I piled the nails conveniently and went to bathe my face and hands in water from the tiny spring that flowed from the rocks a little way up the hill. By the time I came back, Jamie had stripped off his shirt and was knocking together a pair of rough sawhorses. I hadn\u2019t seen him with his shirt off for a long time and paused to enjoy the sight. Beyond the simple pleasure of seeing his body flex and move, whipcord muscles moving easily under his skin, I liked knowing that he felt himself safe here and could ignore his scars.</p> <p>I sat down on an upturned bucket and watched for a time. The blows of his hammer temporarily silenced the birds, and when he stopped and set the sawhorse on its feet, the air rang empty in my ears.</p><p>\u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t felt you had to do it,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply for a moment but pursed his lips as he squatted and picked up a few stray nails. \u201cWhen we wed\u2014\u201d he said, not looking at me. \u201cWhen we wed, I said to ye that I gave ye the protection of my name, my clan\u2014and my body.\u201d He stood up then and looked down at me, serious. \u201cDo ye tell me now that ye no longer want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014no,\u201d I said abruptly. \u201cI just\u2014I wish you hadn\u2019t killed him, that\u2019s all. I\u2019d\u2014managed to forgive him. It wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do, but I did it. Not permanently, but I thought I could do it permanently, sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched a little.</p><p>\u201cAnd if ye could forgive him, he needn\u2019t die, ye\u2019re saying? That\u2019s like a judge lettin\u2019 a murderer go free, because his victim\u2019s family forgave him. Or an enemy soldier sent off wi\u2019 all his weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a state at war, and you are not my army!\u201d</p><p>He began to speak, then stopped short, searching my face, his eyes intent.</p> <p>\u201cAm I not?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>I opened my mouth to reply but found I couldn\u2019t. The birds had come back, and a gang of house finches chittered at the foot of a big fir that grew at the side of the clearing.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d I said reluctantly, and, standing up, wrapped my arms around him. He was warm from his work, and the scars on his back were fine as threads under my fingers. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t have to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d he said, and held me close. After a bit, we walked hand in hand to the biggest pile of barked timber and sat down. I could feel him thinking but was content to wait until he had formed what he wanted to say. It didn\u2019t take him long. He turned to me and took my hands, formal as a man about to say his wedding vows.</p><p>\u201cYe lost your parents young, mo nighean donn, and wandered about the world, rootless. Ye loved Frank\u201d\u2014his mouth compressed for an instant, but I thought he was unconscious of it\u2014\u201cand of course ye love Brianna and Roger Mac and the weans . . . but, Sassenach\u2014I am the true home of your heart, and I know that.\u201d</p><p>He lifted my hands to his mouth and kissed my upturned palms, one and then the other, his breath warm and his beard stubble soft on my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI have loved others, and I do love many, Sassenach\u2014but you alone hold all my heart, whole in your hands,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAnd you know that.\u201d</p><p>WE WORKED through the day then, Jamie fitting stones for the foundation, me digging the new garden and foraging through the woods, bringing back pipsissewa and black cohosh, mint and wild ginger to transplant.</p><p>Toward late afternoon we stopped to eat; I\u2019d brought cheese and bread and early apples in my basket and had put two stone bottles of ale in the spring to keep cold. We sat on the grass, leaning back against a stack of timber that was shaded by the big fir, tired, eating in companionable silence.</p><p>\u201cIan says he and Rachel will come up tomorrow to help,\u201d Jamie said at last, thriftily eating his apple core. \u201cAre ye going to eat yours, Sassenach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, handing it over. \u201cApple seeds have cyanide in them, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He pulled off the stem and ate the core. \u201cHave they settled on a name for the wee lad yet?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and leaned back into the shade of the big fir, enjoying its sharp, sun-warmed scent.</p><p>\u201cHmm. The last I heard, Rachel was suggesting Fox\u2014for George Fox, you know; he was the founder of the Society of Friends, but naturally they wouldn\u2019t call the baby George, because of the king. Ian said he doesn\u2019t think highly of foxes, though, and what about Wolf, instead?\u201d</p><p>Jamie made a meditative Scottish noise.</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s no bad. At least he\u2019s not wanting to call the wean Rollo.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, opening my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that\u2019s what he has in mind? I know people name their children for deceased relatives, but naming one for your deceased dog . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, well,\u201d Jamie said judiciously. \u201cHe was a good dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but\u2014\u201d A movement down on the far side of the cove caught my eye. People coming up the wagon road. \u201cLook, who\u2019s that?\u201d There were four small moving dots, but at this distance I couldn\u2019t make out much more than that without my glasses.</p><p>Jamie shaded his eyes, peering.</p><p>\u201cNo one I ken,\u201d he said, sounded mildly interested. \u201cIt looks like a family, though\u2014they\u2019ve a couple of bairns. Maybe new folk, wanting to settle. They havena got much in the way of goods, though.\u201d</p><p>I squinted; they were closer now, and I could make out the disparity of height. Yes, a man and a woman, both wearing broad-brimmed hats, and a boy and girl.</p><p>\u201cLook, the lad\u2019s got red hair,\u201d Jamie said, smiling and raising his chin to point. \u201cHe minds me of Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he does.\u201d Curious now, I got up and rummaged in my basket, finding the bit of silk in which I kept my spectacles when not wearing them. I put them on and turned, pleased as I always was to see fine details spring suddenly into being. Slightly less pleased to see that what I had thought was a scale of bark on the timber near where I\u2019d been sitting was in fact an enormous centipede, enjoying the shade.</p><p>I turned my attention back to the newcomers, though; they\u2019d stopped\u2014the little girl had dropped something. Her dolly\u2014I could see the doll\u2019s hair, a splotch of color on the ground, even redder than the little boy\u2019s. The man was wearing a pack, and the woman had a large bag over one shoulder. She set it down and bent to pick up the doll, brushing it off and handing it back to her daughter.</p><p>The woman turned then to speak to her husband, throwing out an arm to point to something\u2014the Higginses\u2019 cabin, I thought. The man put both hands to his mouth and shouted, and the wind carried his words to us, faint but clearly audible, called out in a strong, cracked voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, the house!\u201d</p><p>I was on my feet, and Jamie stood and grabbed my hand, hard enough to bruise my fingers.</p><p>Movement at the door of the cabin, and a small figure that I recognized as Amy Higgins appeared. The tall woman pulled off her hat and waved it, her long red hair streaming out like a banner in the wind.</p><p>\u201cHello, the house!\u201d she called, laughing.</p><p>Then I was flying down the hill, with Jamie just before me, arms flung wide, the two of us flyng together on that same wind.</p>  </body></html>"]
