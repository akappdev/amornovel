Their base, animalistic natures were betrayed by their unmitigated aggression and ruthlessness. Through their exertions, their bodies displayed a power that stirred a woman\u2019s most primitive instincts.</p><p>Lady Jessica Sheffield was not immune, as she\u2019d been taught a lady should be.</p><p>She could not take her eyes off the two young men wrestling exuberantly on the lawn on the opposite side of a narrow, shallow pond. One would soon be her brother-in-law; the other was his friend, a scapegrace whose wickedly handsome countenance spared him much of the censure he should rightly face.</p> <p>\u201cI would like to tumble about as they do,\u201d her sister said wistfully. Hester, too, watched from where they sat beneath the shade of an ancient oak tree. A gentle breeze swept by them, ruffling the blades of grass flowing along the parkland to the impressive Pennington manse. The home sprawled beneath the protective shield of a wooded hill, its golden stone fa\u00e7ade and gilded window frames catching the sunlight and creating a feeling of serenity for all who visited.</p><p>Jess returned her attention to her needlework, regretting that she had to chastise her sister for staring when she was guilty of the same conduct. \u201cSuch play is lost to women after childhood. Best not to covet what is beyond our grasp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can men be boys all of their lives, but we women must grow old while we are yet young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world was made for men,\u201d Jess said softly.</p><p>Beneath the wide brim of her straw hat, she snuck another glance at the two grappling young gentlemen. A barked command stilled them midscuffle and caused her spine to stiffen. Simultaneously, all their heads turned in the same direction. She found her betrothed approaching the two younger men, and the tension left her in a slow abatement, like the receding of a tide after a crashing wave. Not for the first time, she wondered if she would ever lose the sharp apprehension she felt whenever discord was evident or if she was so well trained to fear a man\u2019s anger that she would never be free of it.</p> <p>Tall and elegantly dressed, Benedict Reginald Sinclair, Viscount Tarley and future Earl of Pennington, strode across the lawn with the purpose of a man who knew well the power he wielded. She was both reassured by that inherent blue-blooded arrogance and wary of it. Some men were content with the knowledge of their own importance, while others felt the need to wield it indiscriminately.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is a woman\u2019s contribution to the world?\u201d Hester asked with an obstinate pout that made her look younger than her ten and six years. With an impatient swipe at her cheek, she brushed back a honey-hued curl the exact shade of Jessica\u2019s hair. \u201cTo serve men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo create them.\u201d Jess returned Tarley\u2019s brisk wave. They would be wed in the Sinclair family chapel tomorrow before a carefully selected and elite gathering of Society. She looked forward to the occasion for a variety of reasons, not the least of which being that she would finally be free of her father\u2019s unpredictable and seemingly unprovoked rages. She did not begrudge the Marquess of Hadley his right to stress the value of social esteem and her part in securing it. It was the harsh manner in which he redressed her shortcomings that she deplored.</p><p>Hester made a sound suspiciously like a snort. \u201cThose are our pater\u2019s words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the dominant view of the world at large. Who would know that better than you and I?\u201d Their mother\u2019s ceaseless efforts to bear the Hadley heir had cost her life. Hadley had been forced to suffer through another wife, another daughter, and five years before finally seeing the birth of his precious son.</p><p>\u201cI do not believe Tarley looks upon you as a breed mare,\u201d Hester said. \u201cIn fact, I think he has a tendre for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would be fortunate if that were so. However, he would not have offered for me had I lacked a suitable bloodline.\u201d Jess watched as Benedict chastised his younger sibling for his rough play. Michael Sinclair looked sufficiently contrite, but Alistair Caulfield looked anything but. His posture, while not overtly defiant, was too proud to be remorseful. The three males made a riveting grouping\u2014the Sinclairs with their rich chocolate-hued tresses and powerfully lean frames, and Caulfield, who was said to be favored by Mephistopheles himself with his ink-dark hair and devilishly attractive features.</p><p>\u201cTell me you will be happy with him,\u201d Hester entreated, leaning forward. Her irises were the same brilliant green as the lawn beneath their feet, and they were filled with concern. Her eye color was a trait inherited from their mother along with their pale tresses. Jess had taken their father\u2019s gray eyes. It was the only part of himself he\u2019d ever given her. That was not a lamentable circumstance in her opinion.</p><p>\u201cI intend to be.\u201d There was no way to ensure that, but what point was there in worrying Hester needlessly? Tarley was their father\u2019s choice, and Jess would have to become accustomed to it, whatever the outcome.</p><p>Hester pressed on. \u201cI want neither of us to leave this world with the pitiful relief our mother did. Life is meant to be savored and enjoyed.\u201d</p><p>Jess twisted on the marble half-moon bench upon which she sat and placed her needlepoint carefully in the bag beside her. She prayed Hester would always retain her sweet, hopeful nature. \u201cTarley and I respect one another. I have always enjoyed his company and discourse. He is intelligent and patient, considerate and polite. And he is an extremely fine specimen of a man. One cannot overlook that.\u201d</p><p>Hester\u2019s smile brightened their shady location better than the sun could have. \u201cYes, he is. I can only pray that Father will make an equally handsome choice for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you set your cap for a particular gentleman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely, no. I am still in search of the perfect combination of traits that will suit me best.\u201d Hester looked at the three men, now talking with some seriousness. \u201cI should like a husband of Tarley\u2019s station, but with Mr. Sinclair\u2019s more jovial personality and Mr. Caulfield\u2019s appearance. Although I do believe Alistair Caulfield is likely the handsomest man in all of England\u2014if not farther reaches\u2014so I will have to settle for less in that regard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe is too young for me to assess in that manner,\u201d Jess lied, eying the object of discussion.</p><p>\u201cStuff. He is mature for his age; everyone says so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is jaded from lack of guidance. There is a difference.\u201d Though Jess was plagued by too much restriction, Caulfield suffered from none at all. With his three older brothers taking up the expected roles of heir, military officer, and clergyman, there had been no role for him to fill. An overly doting mother had only worsened his prospects of learning any responsibility. He was infamous for his risk taking and inability to walk away from any bet or challenge. In the handful of years Jess had known him, he\u2019d grown wilder with every passing season.</p><p>\u201cTwo years\u2019 gap is no gap at all,\u201d Hester argued.</p><p>\u201cNot when comparing a score and ten to thirty-two, perhaps. But comparing ten and six to ten and eight? That is an age.\u201d</p><p>Jess caught sight of Benedict\u2019s mother hurrying toward her, a sure sign that her brief respite from the whirlwind of final-hour preparations was over. She stood. \u201cIn any case, your admiration is best directed elsewhere. Mr. Caulfield has little chance of serving a useful purpose in this life. His lamentable position as the superfluous fourth son practically ensures he will achieve little consequence. It is a shame he has chosen to cast off the benefit of his good name in favor of reckless pursuits, but that is his mistake and it should not be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have heard it said that his father has given him a ship and a sugarcane plantation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is highly likely Masterson did so in the hopes his son would take his dangerous proclivities to a distant shore.\u201d</p><p>Hester sighed. \u201cI sometimes wish I could travel far, far away. Am I alone in such longings?\u201d</p><p>Not at all, Jess wished to say. She thought of escape in passing, but her station was so narrowly defined. In that regard, she was at a greater disadvantage than women of common birth. Who was she if not the Marquess of Hadley\u2019s daughter and the future Viscountess Tarley? If neither of them wished to travel extensively, she would never be given the opportunity. But sharing such ruminations with her impressionable sibling would be inappropriate and unfair. \u201cGod willing,\u201d she said instead, \u201cyou will have a spouse eager to indulge you in all things. You deserve it.\u201d</p><p>Jess untied the leash of her beloved pug, Temperance, and gestured to her abigail to collect her bag. As she moved to pass her sister, she paused and bent to press a kiss to Hester\u2019s forehead. \u201cCast your eye upon Lord Regmont at supper this evening. He is comely, most charming, and recently returned from his Grand Tour. You will be one of the first diamonds he meets since his return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have to wait two years for my presentation,\u201d Hester retorted with more than a little disgruntlement.</p><p>\u201cYou are worth the wait. Any man of discerning taste will see that straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I shall have a choice in the matter, even if he was to find me intriguing.\u201d</p><p>Winking, Jess lowered her voice and said, \u201cRegmont is a close associate of Tarley\u2019s. I am certain Benedict would speak highly of him to our pater should that become necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Hester\u2019s shoulders wriggled with the fevered anticipation of youth. \u201cYou must introduce us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a certainty.\u201d Jess set off with a wave. \u201cCast your eyes away from ne\u2019er-do-wells until then.\u201d</p><p>Hester made a show of covering her eyes, but Jess expected her sister would return to her perusal of the men as soon as the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>Jess certainly would.</p><p>\u201cTarley\u2019s tension is high,\u201d Michael Sinclair noted, dusting himself off and staring at his brother\u2019s retreating back.</p><p>\u201cYou expected otherwise?\u201d Alistair Caulfield collected his jacket from the ground and shook off the few blades of grass clinging to the superfine. \u201cHe gains a leg shackle tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the Diamond of the Season. Not such a bad fate. My mother says Helen of Troy could not have been more beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a marble statue more cold.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked at him. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>From across the shallow terrace pool separating them, Alistair watched Lady Jessica Sheffield cross the lawn toward the house with her little dog in tow. Her slender figure was encased from neck to wrist to ankle in pale floral muslin that clung to her with the breeze. Her face was turned away from him and shielded from the sun by a hat, but he knew her features from memory. He was irresistibly drawn to stare at such beauty. Many men were.</p><p>Her hair was a delight of nature, the strands longer and thicker than any other blonde he had ever seen. The tresses were so pale as to be almost silver, with streaks of darker gold adding richness to the whole. She\u2019d worn it down on occasion before her presentation, but now it was as restrained as her deportment. For someone so young, she had the cool demeanor and reserve of a more mature woman.</p><p>\u201cThat pale hair and creamy skin,\u201d Alistair murmured, \u201cand those gray eyes ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Alistair noted the amusement in his friend\u2019s voice and strengthened his own. \u201cHer coloring suits her temperament perfectly,\u201d he said briskly. \u201cShe is an ice princess, that one. Your brother had best pray she breeds quickly or risk losing his cock to frostbite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had best watch your tongue,\u201d Michael warned, repairing his dark brown hair with a quick combing with both hands, \u201clest I take offense. Lady Jessica is soon to be my sister-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Nodding absently, Alistair found his attention once again drawn to the graceful girl who was so perfect in both physical and social deportment. He was fascinated with watching her and waiting for some crack in the porcelain-smooth exterior. He wondered how she bore the pressure at her age, the very pressure he had grown intolerant of and now rebelled against. \u201cApologies.\u201d</p><p>Michael studied him. \u201cHave you some quarrel with her? There is an edge to your tone suggesting so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps there is a slight sting,\u201d he admitted gruffly, \u201cfrom her failure to acknowledge me the other evening. Her cut direct was a marked difference in manner from that of her sister, Lady Hester, who is quite charming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Hester is a delight.\u201d Michael\u2019s admiring tone was so like Alistair\u2019s when speaking of Lady Jessica that Alistair raised his brows in silent inquiry. Flushing, Michael went on, \u201cLikely Jessica did not hear you.\u201d</p><p>Alistair shrugged into his jacket. \u201cI was directly beside her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the left side? She is deaf in that ear.\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to absorb the information and reply. He had not imagined any imperfections in her, although he felt some relief to know there was one. It made her more mortal and less Grecian goddess. \u201cI was not aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the most part, no one takes note. Only when the noise is high, during large gatherings, does it become a hindrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I see why Tarley selected her. A wife who only half listens to rumormongers would be a blessing indeed.\u201d</p><p>Michael snorted and started toward the house. \u201cShe is reserved,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut then the future Countess of Pennington should be. Tarley assures me there are hidden depths to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound doubtful, but despite your excessively comely face, your experience with women is not equal to Tarley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s mouth curved wryly. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering the irrefutable fact that he has ten years\u2019 advantage on you, I would say so.\u201d Michael threw his arm around Alistair\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI suggest you concede that his greater maturity likely gives him a superior platform from which to note hidden qualities in his own betrothed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI dislike conceding anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, my friend. However, you really should concede defeat in our recently interrupted wrestling match. You were moments away from seeing me the victor.\u201d</p><p>Alistair elbowed him in the ribs. \u201cIf Tarley had not spared you, you would be pleading for mercy now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHo! Shall we determine the winner with a race to the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Alistair was running before the last word was out.</p><p>Within hours, she would be wed.</p><p>As the dark of night lightened into the gray of predawn, Jessica hugged her shawl tighter about her shoulders and walked Temperance deeper into the forest surrounding the Pennington manse. The pug\u2019s rapid steps crunched atop the loose gravel trail in a staccato that was soothing in its familiarity.</p><p>\u201cWhy must you be so picky?\u201d Jess chastised. Her breath puffed visibly in the chill air, making her long for the warmth of the bed she had yet to crawl into. \u201cAny spot should suffice.\u201d</p><p>Temperance glanced up with an expression Jess swore was akin to exasperation.</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said reluctantly, unable to refuse that look. \u201cWe\u2019ll go a bit farther.\u201d</p><p>They rounded a corner and Temperance paused, sniffing. Apparently satisfied with the location, the pug presented her back to Jess and squatted in front of a tree.</p><p>Smiling at the bid for privacy, Jess turned away and took in her surroundings, deciding to explore the trail more thoroughly in the light of day. Unlike so many estates where the gardens and woodlands were invaded by obelisks, reproductions of Grecian statues and temples, and the occasional pagoda, the Pennington estate displayed a welcome appreciation of the natural landscape. There were places along the pathway where it felt as if civilization and all its inhabitants were miles away. She had not expected to enjoy the feeling so much but found she did, especially after hours of meaningless interactions with people who cared only for the title she was marrying into.</p><p>\u201cI shall enjoy walking you through here,\u201d she said over her shoulder, \u201cwhen the sun is up and I am properly attired for the activity.\u201d</p><p>Temperance finished her business and moved into view. The pug started back toward the house, tugging on the leash with notable impatience after taking so long to find a proper piddle spot. Jess was following when a rustling noise to the left put Temperance on alert. The dog\u2019s dark ears and tail perked up, while her tan muscular body tensed with expectation.</p><p>Jess\u2019s heart beat faster. If it was a wild boar or feral fox, the situation would be disastrous. She would be devastated if something untoward happened to Temperance, who was the only creature on earth who did not judge Jess by standards she struggled greatly to meet.</p> <p>A squirrel darted across the path. Jess melted with relief and gave a breathless laugh. But Temperance did not stand down. The pug lunged, ripping her leash from Jess\u2019s slackened grip.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. Temperance!\u201d</p><p>In a flash of tiny limbs and fur, the two creatures were gone. The sounds of the chase\u2014the rustling of leaves and the pug\u2019s low growling\u2014quickly faded.</p><p>Tossing up her hands, Jess left the walkway and followed the path of trampled foliage. She was so focused on tracking, she failed to realize she\u2019d come upon a large gazebo until she very nearly ran into it. She veered to the right ...</p><p>A female\u2019s throaty laugh broke the quiet. Jess stumbled to a startled halt.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Lucius,\u201d the woman urged breathlessly. \u201cTrent will note my absence.\u201d</p><p>Wilhelmina, Lady Trent. Jess stood unmoving, barely breathing.</p><p>There was a slow, drawn-out creaking of wood.</p> <p>\u201cPatience, darling.\u201d A recognizable masculine voice rejoined in a lazy, practiced drawl. \u201cLet me give you what you paid for.\u201d</p><p>The gazebo creaked again, louder this time. Quicker and harder. Lady Trent gave a thready moan.</p><p>Alistair Lucius Caulfield. Inflagrente delicto with the Countess of Trent. Dear God. The woman was nearly a score of years his senior. Beautiful, yes, but of an age with his mother.</p><p>The use of his middle name was startling. And, perhaps, telling ... ? Aside from the obvious, perhaps they were intimate in a deeper sense. Was it possible the roguish Caulfield had a tendre for the lovely countess, enough that she would have reason to call him by a name not used by others?</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d the countess purred, \u201care worth every shilling I pay for you.\u201d</p><p>Dear God. Perhaps not an intimacy at all, but a ... transaction. An arrangement. With a man providing the services ...</p><p>Hoping to move on without giving herself away, Jess took a tentative step forward. A slight movement in the gazebo prompted her to still again. Her eyes narrowed, struggling to overcome the insufficient light. It was her misfortune to be bathed in the faint glow of the waning moon while the interior of the gazebo remained deeply shadowed by its roof and overhanging trees.</p><p>She saw a hand wrapped around one of the domed roof\u2019s supporting poles and another set a short ways above it. A man\u2019s hands, gripping for purchase. From their height on the beam, she knew he was standing.</p><p>\u201cLucius ... For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t stop now.\u201d</p><p>Lady Trent was pinned between Caulfield and the wood. Which meant he was facing Jess.</p><p>Twin glimmers in the darkness betrayed a blink.</p><p>He saw her. Was in fact staring at her.</p><p>Jess wished the ground would open and swallow her whole. What was she to say? How was one supposed to act when caught in such a situation?</p><p>\u201cLucius! Damn you.\u201d The weathered wood whined in response to its pressures. \u201cThe feel of your big cock in me is delicious, but far more so when it\u2019s moving.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s hand went to her throat. Despite the cold, perspiration misted her forehead. The horror she should have felt at finding a man engaged in sexual congress was markedly absent. Because it was Caulfield, and he fascinated her. It was a terrible sort of captivation with which she viewed him\u2014a mixture of envy for his freedom and horror at the ease with which he disregarded public opinion.</p><p>She had to get away before she was forced to acknowledge her presence to Lady Trent. She took a careful step forward ...</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Caulfield\u2019s voice was gruffer than before.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cI cannot!\u201d Lady Trent protested breathlessly.</p><p>But it was not the countess Caulfield spoke to.</p><p>One of his hands was outstretched, extended toward Jess. The request stunned her into immobility.</p><p>A long moment passed in which her gaze remained fixed on the twin sparkles of his eyes. His breathing became harsh and audible.</p><p>Then, he gripped the pole again and began to move.</p><p>His thrusts began slowly at first, then became more fervent with a building tempo. The rhythmic protests of the wood battered Jess from all sides. She could see no detail beyond those two hands and glistening gaze that smoldered with a tangible heat, but the sounds she heard filled her mind with images. Caulfield never took his eyes from her, even as he rutted so furiously she wondered how the countess could take pleasure in such violence of movement. Lady Trent was nearly incoherent, coarse words of praise spilling from her lips between high-pitched squeals.</p><p>Jess was riveted by this exposure to a side of sexual congress she\u2019d been mostly ignorant of. She knew the mechanics; her stepmother had been most thorough. Do not cringe or cry when he enters you. Try to relax; it will decrease the discomfort. Make no sound of any kind. Never voice a complaint. And yet Jess had seen the knowing looks of other women and heard whispers behind fans that hinted at more. Now she had the proof. Every pleasured sound Lady Trent made echoed through her, tripping over her senses like a stone skipping over water. Her body responded instinctively\u2014her skin became sensitive and her breathing came in quick pants.</p><p>She began to quiver under the weight of Caulfield\u2019s gaze. Although she longed to run from the purloined intimacy, she was unable to move. It was impossible, but it seemed as if he looked right through her, past the fa\u00e7ade forged by her father\u2019s hand.</p><p>The bonds holding her in place broke only when Caulfield did. His serrated groan at the moment of crisis acted like a spur to her flank. She ran then, clinging to her shawl with both arms crossed over full and aching breasts. When Temperance dashed out of a bush to greet her, Jess sobbed with relief. Scooping up the pug, she rushed toward the trail leading back to the manse.</p><p>\u201cLady Jessica!\u201d</p><p>The calling of her name as Jess returned to the relative safety of the rear garden caused her to stumble. Her heart raced anew at being caught. She spun in a flurry of pale blue satin skirts, searching for the caller and mortified at the thought it might be Alistair Caulfield with a plea for discretion. Or worse, her father.</p><p>\u201cJessica. By God, I\u2019ve been searching all over for you.\u201d</p><p>She was relieved to see Benedict approaching from the direction of the house, but relief bled into wariness. He maneuvered through the yew-lined garden paths with such a brisk, determined stride. A shiver moved through her. Was he angry?</p><p>\u201cIs something amiss?\u201d she queried carefully as he neared, knowing it must be to cause him to seek her out at this hour.</p><p>\u201cYou have been gone at length. Half an hour ago, your abigail said you\u2019d left to walk Temperance, and you had already been absent for a quarter hour when I inquired.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lowered to avoid any appearance of challenge. \u201cI apologize for causing you concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for apologies,\u201d he said in a clipped tone. \u201cI simply wished to have a word with you. We are to be wed today, and I wanted to allay any nerves that might plague you before the event.\u201d</p><p>Jess blinked and looked up, startled by his consideration. \u201cMy lord\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedict,\u201d he corrected, catching up her hand. \u201cYou are chilled to the bone. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>The concern in his tone was unmistakable. She wasn\u2019t certain at first how to respond. His reaction was so different from the one her father would have had.</p><p>Thrown off guard by her own confusion, she began to reply almost without thinking. As she relayed the tale of Temperance leading her on a merry chase after a squirrel, Jess studied her future spouse with more care than she\u2019d invested in a very long time. He had become a staple in her life, an obligation she accepted without need for deep contemplation. Inasmuch as she was able, she had grown comfortable with the inevitability of sharing a life with him. But she did not feel comfortable now. She remained flushed and agitated by the way Caulfield had used her to further his own pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI would have walked with you, if you had asked,\u201d Benedict said when she finished. He gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cIn the future, I pray you do so.\u201d</p><p>Emboldened by his gentle manner and the lingering effects of the wine she\u2019d drunk too liberally of at supper, Jess pressed on recklessly. \u201cTemperance and I found something else in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>She told him about the couple in the gazebo, her voice low and faltering, her words tumbling over themselves because she lacked the vocabulary and confidence. She did not speak of the coin exchanged between the countess and Caulfield, nor did she divulge their identities.</p><p>Benedict didn\u2019t move the entirety of the short time she spoke. When she finished, he cleared his throat and said, \u201cDamnation, I am horrified that you were exposed to such unpleasantness on the eve of our wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did not seem to find the encounter unpleasant at all.\u201d</p><p>He flushed. \u201cJessica\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke of allaying my nerves,\u201d she said quickly, before losing her courage. \u201cI should like to be honest with you, but I fear overstepping the limits of your forbearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will advise you if that limit is reached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what manner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d Benedict frowned.</p><p>Jess swallowed. \u201cIn what manner will you advise me? With a word? A loss of privilege? S-something more ... definitive?\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cI would never lay a hand to you or any woman; I would certainly never fault you for honesty. I expect I will be far more lenient with you than with anyone else of my acquaintance. You are a great prize to me, Jessica. I have waited impatiently for the day when you would be mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a beautiful woman,\u201d he said gruffly. Astonishment swept through her, followed by a rush of unexpected hope. \u201cMy lord, would you be displeased to know that I find myself praying for the physical aspect of our marriage to be ... pleasurable? For both of us.\u201d</p><p>God knew she would not be able to dally as Lady Trent did. Such behavior was not in her nature.</p><p>He displayed his unease with the topic by pulling at the elegant knot of his cravat. \u201cI have always intended to make it so. I will make it so, if you trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedict.\u201d She inhaled the scent clinging to him\u2014spice, tobacco, and a fine port. Despite wading through a discussion he would certainly never expect to have with his lady wife, his responses were as direct as his gaze. She liked him more each moment that passed. \u201cYou are taking this conversation so well. I cannot help wondering how far I can press you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, speak freely,\u201d he urged. \u201cI want you to come to the altar with no doubts or reservations.\u201d</p><p>Jess spoke in a rush. \u201cI should like to retire with you to the summerhouse by the lake. This moment.\u201d</p><p>His exhale was harsh, as were his features. His grip on her hand tightened almost painfully. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have angered you.\u201d Averting her gaze, she backed away. \u201cForgive me. And pray, do not doubt my innocence. The hour is late and I am not myself.\u201d</p><p>Benedict pulled her hand to his chest, bringing her close again. \u201cLook at me, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>She did as he asked and was made dizzy by his regard. He no longer looked at her with discomfort or concern.</p><p>\u201cWe are mere hours away from the marriage bed,\u201d he reminded her in a voice hoarser than she\u2019d ever heard it. \u201cI collect that the events you witnessed in the woods stirred reactions you do not yet understand, and I cannot tell you how it affects me to learn you are fascinated by your response and not repulsed, as some women might be. But you are to be my wife and you deserve the respect of that station.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou would not respect me in the summerhouse?\u201d</p><p>For the length of a heartbeat, he looked taken aback. Then, he threw his head back and laughed. The rich, deep sound carried over the garden. Jess was smitten by how merriment transformed him, making him more approachable and\u2014if possible\u2014more handsome.</p><p>Pulling her even closer, Benedict pressed his lips to her temple. \u201cYou are a treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand,\u201d she whispered, leaning into his warmth, \u201cduty lies in the marital bed, while pleasure exists outside of it with paramours. Do I reveal a defect in my character by confessing that I should prefer you to want me in the manner of a mistress rather than a wife, insofar as the bedroom is concerned?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no defects. You are as perfect a woman as I have ever seen or become acquainted with.\u201d</p><p>She was far from perfect, as the remembered lash of a switch to the backs of her thighs attested. Learning to disguise her shortcomings had been a necessity.</p><p>How had Caulfield sensed that she would be open to his request to watch him? How had he somehow recognized an aspect of her character of which even she was unaware?</p><p>However he\u2019d managed it, Jess was dizzily relieved to know that Benedict did not find her sudden self-awareness threatening or undesirable. Her betrothed\u2019s acceptance gave her unusual courage. \u201cIs it possible you might find such an interest in me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than possible.\u201d Benedict\u2019s mouth sealed over hers, swallowing the words of relief and gratitude she meant to speak. It was a questing kiss, tender and cautious, yet assured. She caught at his lapels, her chest heaving from the effort to find the breath he was stealing from her.</p> <p>His tongue slid along the seam of her lips, then teased them apart. When he entered her mouth with a quick thrust, her knees weakened. He pulled her tighter against him, exposing his need in the hard ridge of arousal pressing into her hip. His fingers kneaded her skin, betraying a growing agitation. When he broke away and pressed his temple to hers, his breathing was labored.</p><p>\u201cGod help me,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cAs innocent as you are, you have nevertheless seduced me with consummate skill.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her into his arms, he carried her swiftly to the summerhouse.</p><p>Sensitive to the highly charged situation, Temperance walked silently beside them. Then, she waited on the porch with unusual meekness and watched the sun rise.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Seven years later ...</p> <p>\u201cI beg you to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Jessica, Lady Tarley, reached over the small tea table in the Regmont family parlor and gave her sister\u2019s hand a brief squeeze. \u201cI feel I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The corners of Hester\u2019s mouth turned downward. \u201cI would understand if Tarley was with you, but now that he has passed ... Is it safe for you to travel such a distance alone?\u201d</p><p>It was a question Jess had asked herself many times, yet the answer was moot. She was determined to go. She had been given a brief window of time in which she could do something extraordinary. It was highly doubtful she would ever be presented with the opportunity again.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s safe,\u201d she said, straightening. \u201cTarley\u2019s brother, Michael\u2014I should become accustomed to referring to him as Tarley now\u2014made the arrangements for the voyage, and I will be met at the dock by someone from the household. All will be well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not reassured.\u201d Toying with the handle of her floral-patterned teacup, Hester looked pensive and unhappy.</p><p>\u201cYou once wanted to travel to faraway places,\u201d Jess reminded, hating to see her sister so distressed. \u201cHave you lost that wanderlust?\u201d</p><p>Hester sighed and looked out the window beside her. Through the sheers that afforded some privacy, one could see the steady flow of Mayfair traffic in front of the town house, but Jess\u2019s attention was focused solely on her sister. Hester had matured into a beautiful young woman, lauded for her golden glamour and stunning verdant eyes framed by thick, dark lashes. She\u2019d once been curvier than Jess and more vivacious, but the years had tempered both traits, forging a woman who was slender as a reed and serenely elegant. The Countess of Regmont had acquired a reputation for notable reserve, which surprised Jess considering how charming and outgoing Lord Regmont was. She blamed the change on their father, and his blasted pride and misogyny.</p> <p>\u201cYou look pale and thin,\u201d Jess observed. \u201cAre you unwell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grieve for your loss. And I must confess, I have not slept well since you first announced your intent to travel.\u201d Hester looked back at her. \u201cI simply cannot comprehend your motivation.\u201d</p><p>Nearly a year had passed since Benedict had gone on to his reward, and he had been severely ill for three months prior to that. There had been time enough for Jess to reach a state of resigned acceptance to life without him. Still, bereavement clung to her like fog over water. Family and friends looked to her for the cue to leave the past behind, and she had no notion of how to give it to them. \u201cI require distance from the past in order to grasp the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely retiring to the country would suffice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did not suffice last winter. Now another Season is upon us, and we are all still trapped beneath this cloud hovering over me. It is necessary for me to break away from the routine into which I have fallen, so everyone can move forward with life as we now face it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God, Jess,\u201d Hester breathed, looking pale. \u201cYou cannot mean to say that you must leave us as Tarley did for all to heal. You are still young and marriageable. Your life is far from over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Pray do not worry over me.\u201d Jess refilled Hester\u2019s teacup and dropped two lumps of sugar into it. \u201cI will be gone only long enough to make arrangements for the sale of the plantation. I shall return refreshed and revitalized, which, in turn, will reinvigorate all who love and worry over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still cannot believe he bequeathed that place to you. What was he thinking?\u201d</p><p>Jessica smiled fondly, her gaze moving around the cheery parlor with its yellow silk drapes and blue floral accents. Hester had redesigned the space shortly after her marriage, and its style reflected the optimism so innate to her. \u201cHe wanted me to be entirely self-sufficient, and it was a sentimental gesture. Tarley knew how much I loved our trip to Calypso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSentimentality is all well and good, until it sends you on a journey halfway around the world,\u201d Hester muttered.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, I want to go. I will go so far as to say I need to go. It is somewhat of a farewell for me.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Hester finally capitulated. \u201cYou promise to write and return as soon as you are able?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And you promise to write back.\u201d</p><p>Hester nodded, then picked up her cup and saucer. She downed her hot tea in one unladylike swallow. A fortifying drink.</p><p>Jess understood. She\u2019d needed a few of those herself as the anniversary of Tarley\u2019s death loomed. \u201cI will bring you gifts,\u201d she promised in a deliberately light tone, hoping to elicit a smile.</p><p>\u201cJust bring yourself back,\u201d Hester admonished with a wag of her finger.</p><p>The gesture was so reminiscent of their childhood. Jess couldn\u2019t resist asking, \u201cWill you come after me if I tarry overlong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegmont would never allow it. However, I could likely convince someone to go after you. Perhaps some of the matrons who are so concerned over your welfare ... ?\u201d</p><p>Jess gave a mock shudder. \u201cPoint taken, my ruthless sister. I shall return posthaste.\u201d</p><p>Alistair Caulfield\u2019s back was to the door of his warehouse shipping office when it opened. A salt-tinged gust blew through the space, snatching the manifest he was about to file right out of his hand.</p><p>He caught it deftly, then looked over his shoulder. Startled recognition moved through him. \u201cMichael.\u201d</p><p>The new Lord Tarley\u2019s eyes widened with equal surprise, then a weary half-smile curved his mouth. \u201cAlistair, you scoundrel. You didn\u2019t tell me you were in Town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only just returned.\u201d He slid the parchment into the appropriate folder and pushed the drawer closed. \u201cHow are you, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Michael removed his hat and ran a hand through his dark brown hair. The assumption of the Tarley title appeared to weigh heavily on his broad shoulders, grounding him in a way Alistair had never seen before. He was dressed somberly in shades of brown, and he flexed his left hand, which bore the Tarley signet ring, as if he could not accustom himself to having it there. \u201cAs well as can be expected under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy condolences to you and your family. Did you receive my letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Thank you. I meant to reply, but time is stretched so thin. The last year has raced by so quickly; I\u2019ve yet to catch my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to see you again, my friend. You have been gone far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe life of a merchant.\u201d He could have delegated more, but staying in England meant crossing paths with both his father and Jessica. His father complained about Alistair\u2019s success as a tradesman with as much virulence as he\u2019d once complained about Alistair\u2019s lack of purpose. It was a great stressor for his mother, which he was only able to alleviate by being absent as much as possible.</p><p>As for Jessica, she\u2019d been careful to avoid him whenever they were in proximity. He had learned to reciprocate when he saw how marriage to Tarley had changed her. While she remained as cool in deportment as ever, he\u2019d seen the blossoming of her sensual nature in the languid way she moved and the knowledge in those big, gray eyes. Other men coveted the mystery of her, but Alistair had seen behind the veil, and that was the woman he lusted for. Forever beyond his reach in reality, but a fixture in his mind. She was burned into his memory by the raging hungers and the impressions of youth, and the years hadn\u2019t lessened the vivid recollection one whit.</p><p>\u201cI find myself grateful for your enterprising sensibilities,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYour captains are the only ones I would entrust with the safe passage of my sister-in-law to Jamaica.\u201d</p><p>Alistair kept his face impassive thanks to considerable practice, but the sudden awareness gripping him tensed his frame. \u201cLady Tarley intends to travel to Calypso?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This very morning, which is why I\u2019m here. I intend to speak to the captain myself and see he looks after her until they arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho travels with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly her maid. I should like to accompany her, but I can\u2019t leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she will not delay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Michael\u2019s mouth curved wryly. \u201cAnd I cannot dissuade her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot say no to her,\u201d Alistair corrected, moving to the window through which he could view the West India docks. Ships entered the Northern Dock to unload their precious imports, then sailed around to the Southern Dock to reload with cargo for export. Around the perimeter, a high brick wall deterred the rampant theft plaguing the London wharves. The same wall increased his shipping company\u2019s appeal to West Indian landowners requiring secure transportation of goods.</p><p>\u201cNeither can Hester\u2014forgive me, Lady Regmont.\u201d</p><p>The last was said with difficulty. Alistair had long suspected his friend nursed deeper feelings for Jessica\u2019s younger sister and had assumed Michael would pay his addresses. Instead, Hester had been presented at court, then immediately betrothed, breaking the hearts of many hopeful would-be swains. \u201cWhy is she so determined to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenedict bequeathed the property to her. She claims she must see to its sale personally. I fear the loss of my brother has affected her deeply and she seeks a purpose. I\u2019ve attempted to anchor her, but duty has me stretched to wit\u2019s end.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s reply was carefully neutral. \u201cI can assist her in that endeavor. I can make the necessary introductions, as well as provide information that would take her months to discover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA generous offer.\u201d Michael\u2019s gaze was searching. \u201cBut you\u2019ve just returned. I can\u2019t ask you to depart again so soon.\u201d</p><p>Turning, Alistair said, \u201cMy plantation borders Calypso, and I should like to expand. It\u2019s my hope to position myself as the best purchaser of the property. I will pay her handsomely, of course.\u201d</p><p>Relief swept over Michael\u2019s expressive features. \u201cThat would ease my mind considerably. I\u2019ll speak to her at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should leave that to me. If, as you say, she needs a purpose, then she\u2019ll want to maintain control of the matter in all ways. She should be allowed to set the terms and pace of our association to suit her. I have all the time in the world, but you do not. See to your most pressing affairs, and entrust Lady Tarley to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been a good friend,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI pray you return to England swiftly and settle for a time. I could use your ear and head for business. In the interim, please encourage Jessica to write often and keep me abreast of the situation. I should like to see her return before we retire to the country for the winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>Alistair waited several minutes after Michael departed, then moved to the desk. He began a list of new provisions for the journey, determined to create the best possible environment. He also made some quick but costly adjustments to the passenger list, moving two additional travelers to another of his ships.</p><p>He, Jessica, and her maid would be the only non-crewmen aboard the Acheron.</p><p>She would be within close quarters for weeks\u2014it was an extraordinary opportunity Alistair was determined not to waste.</p><p>From the familiar comfort of her town coach, Jessica stared at the sleek ship before her, her gaze following the proud line of its polished deck and the soaring height of its three masts. It was one of the most impressive vessels docked, which she should have expected considering how anxious Michael was about her making the journey. He would have taken great pains to secure her comfort and welfare. She suspected it helped him grieve to hover over his brother\u2019s widow, but that was one of the aftereffects of losing Tarley that made her want to flee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The scent of the ocean drew her attention back to the industriously noisy West India docks. Excitement made her heart race, or perhaps it was apprehension. Society on the lush Caribbean island\u2014such as it was\u2014had fewer preconceived notions about her, and the pace and structure of social interactions were more relaxed. She looked forward to enjoying moments of solitude after the past few months of well-intentioned suffocation.</p><p>Jess watched as in quick succession her footmen carried her trunks up the gangplank to the main deck. The bright blue of Pennington livery was conspicuous among the less colorful attire of the seamen around them. Soon enough, there was no reason for her to delay in the carriage any longer.</p><p>She alighted with the help of a footman, smoothed her pale lavender silk skirts, and then set off without looking back. As she gained the deck, she felt the rolling of the ship beneath her feet and took a moment to absorb the sensation.</p><p>\u201cLady Tarley.\u201d</p> <p>Jess turned her head and watched a portly, distinguished gentleman approach. Even before he spoke, his attire and bearing told her he was the captain.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Smith,\u201d he introduced himself, accepting the hand she offered him with a bow \u201cA pleasure to \u2019ave you aboard, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is mine,\u201d she demurred, returning the smile he offered from the depths of a coarse white beard. \u201cYou command an impressive ship, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that she is.\u201d He tipped up his hat to get a better look at her. \u201cI would be \u2019onored to \u2019ave you join me for the evenin\u2019 meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would enjoy that very much, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Smith gestured at a young seaman. \u201cMiller \u2019ere will show you to yer cabin. If you \u2019ave any questions or concerns, \u2019e can see to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very much obliged.\u201d As the captain went about the business of preparing to set sail, Jess turned to Miller, who she guessed was no more than ten and seven.</p><p>\u201cMilady.\u201d He gestured ahead to an open companionway and stairs leading below deck. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>She followed him across the midship, fascinated by the courage of the men climbing the rigging like industrious little crabs. But as she descended the stairs, her admiration was redirected to the vessel\u2019s impressive interior.</p><p>The paneled companion- and passageway gleamed with polish, as did the brass hardware that secured the doors and hung the flashlamps. She\u2019d been uncertain of what to expect, but this attention to detail was a surprise and a delight. Miller paused before a door and knocked, which elicited a shouted permission to enter from Jess\u2019s abigail, Beth.</p><p>The cabin Jess entered was small but well appointed; it held a narrow bed, a modestly sized rectangular window, and a wooden table with two chairs. On the sole by one of her trunks sat a crate of her favorite claret. Although it was the smallest space she\u2019d ever occupied as a bedchamber, she found the limits of the cabin comforting. And she was deeply appreciative that, for the next few weeks at least, she would not have to anticipate how to respond to others in a manner that made them feel better.</p> <p>Reaching up, she withdrew the pin securing her hat and handed both to Beth.</p><p>Miller promised to return at six to take her to supper, then ducked back out to the passageway. After the door shut, Jess\u2019s gaze met Beth\u2019s.</p><p>The abigail bit her lower lip and spun in a quick circle. \u201cThis is a grand adventure, milady. I\u2019ve missed Jamaica since we left.\u201d</p><p>Jess exhaled to ease the knot in her stomach, then smiled. \u201cAnd a certain young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the maid agreed. \u201c \u2019Im, too.\u201d</p><p>Beth had been a blessing the past few days, keeping Jess\u2019s spirits high while everyone around her had been so disapproving of her plans.</p><p>\u201cAn adventure,\u201d Jess repeated. \u201cI think it will be.\u201d</p><p>When the knock came at Jess\u2019s cabin door shortly before six, she set aside the book she\u2019d been reading and stood with some reluctance. Beth was mending a stocking on the opposite side of the small table, and the quiet companionship had been most welcome.</p> <p>Setting her work down, Beth went to answer the door. As the panel swung open, Miller\u2019s young face was revealed. He smiled shyly, showing slightly crooked teeth. Jess dismissed Beth to enjoy her own meal, then followed the young crewman to the captain\u2019s great cabin. As they neared the wide door marking the end of the passageway, the plaintive notes of a violin grew in volume. The instrument was consummately played, the tune sweet yet haunting. Enamored with the music, she quickened her step. Miller knocked once, then opened the door without waiting for a reply. He gestured her into the sizable cabin with a gallant sweep of his arm.</p><p>She entered with a practiced smile, her gaze locating Captain Smith as he pushed to his feet at a long dining table, along with two other gentlemen who were introduced to her as the Chief Mate and ship\u2019s surgeon. She exchanged the expected pleasantries, then turned her attention to the violin player. He stood with his back to her before the large gallery windows wrapping the stern. He was sans tailcoat, which caused her to glance hastily away. But when the captain approached to escort her to the table, she risked another furtive glance at the scandalously semi-dressed gentleman. Without tails to block her gaze, she was afforded a prime view of the man\u2019s derriere, which was quite noteworthy. It was not a part of the male anatomy she\u2019d had cause to study before. She found she quite enjoyed the ogling when the buttocks on display were so firm and well-shaped.</p><p>As she conversed with the ship\u2019s officers, Jess glanced frequently at the dark-haired musician who coaxed such beautiful notes from the violin. The fluid, practiced movement of his arm caused his back and shoulders to flex in a manner that had always fascinated her. The male body was so much larger and more powerful than a woman\u2019s\u2014capable of fierce aggression while also being sleek and graceful.</p><p>The tune ended. The player pivoted to return the violin and bow to their case waiting on the chair beside him. Jess caught a quick glimpse of his profile. A frisson of awareness swept over her skin. He collected his jacket from the chair where it was draped, then shrugged into it. She hadn\u2019t thought it possible that the act of putting clothes on could be as arousing as watching them come off, but this man made it so. The graceful economy of his movements was inherently sensual, which suited his air of unwavering confidence and command.</p><p>\u201cAnd this,\u201d the captain said, turning slightly to gesture at the gentleman, \u201cis Mr. Alistair Caulfield, owner of this fine vessel and brilliant violinist, as you \u2019eard.\u201d</p><p>Jess swore her heart ceased beating for a moment. Certainly, she stopped breathing. Caulfield faced her and sketched a perfectly executed, elegant bow. Yet his head never lowered and his gaze never left hers.</p><p>Dear God ...</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>What were the odds that they would cross paths this way?</p><p>There was very little of the young man Jess had once known left in the man who faced her. Alistair Caulfield was no longer pretty. The planes of his face had sharpened, etching his features into a thoroughly masculine countenance. Darkly winged brows and thick lashes framed those infamous eyes of rich, deep blue. In the fading light of the setting sun and the flickering flames of the turpentine lamps, his coal-black hair gleamed with health and vitality. Previously his beauty had been striking, but now he was larger. More worldly and mature. Undeniably formidable.</p><p>Breathtakingly male.</p><p>\u201cLady Tarley,\u201d he greeted her, straightening. \u201cIt is a great pleasure to see you again.\u201d</p><p>His voice was lower and deeper in pitch than she remembered. It had a soft, rumbling quality. Almost a purr. He walked with equal feline grace, his step light and surefooted despite his powerful build. His gaze was focused and intense, assessing. Challenging. As before, it seemed he looked right into the very heart of her and dared her to deny that he could.</p><p>She sucked in a shaky breath and met him halfway, offering her hand. \u201cMr. Caulfield. It has been some time since we last met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>His look was so intimate she couldn\u2019t help thinking of that night in the Pennington woods. A rush of heat swept up her arm from where their skin connected.</p><p>He went on. \u201cPlease accept my condolences on your recent loss. Tarley was a good man. I admired him and liked him quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour thoughts are appreciated,\u201d she managed in spite of a suddenly dry mouth. \u201cI offer the same to you. I was deeply sorry to hear that your brother had passed.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened and he released her, sliding his hand away so that his fingertips stroked over the center of her palm. \u201cTwo of them,\u201d he replied grimly.</p><p>Jess caught her hand back and rubbed it discreetly against her thigh, to no avail. The tingle left by his touch was inerasable.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d the captain said, tilting his head toward the table.</p><p>Caulfield took a seat on the bench directly across from her. She was discomfited at first, but he seemed to forget her the moment the food was brought in. To ensure a steady flow of conversation, she took pains to direct the discussion to topics addressing the ship and seafaring, and the men easily followed. No doubt they were relieved not to have to focus on her life of limited scope, which was of little interest to men. What followed was a rather fantastic hour of food and conversation the likes of which she\u2019d never been exposed to before. Gentlemen did not often discuss matters of business around her.</p><p>It quickly became clear that Alistair Caulfield was enjoying laudable financial success. He didn\u2019t comment on it personally, but he participated in the discussion about the trade, making it clear he was very involved in the minutiae of his business endeavors. He was also expertly dressed. His coat was made with a gray-green velvet she thought quite lovely, and the stylishly short cut of the shoulders emphasized how fit he was.</p><p>\u201cDo you make the trip to Jamaica often, Captain?\u201d Jess asked.</p><p>\u201cNot as often as some of Mr. Caulfield\u2019s other ships do.\u201d He set his elbows on the table and toyed with his beard. \u201cLondon is where we berth most often. The others dock in Liverpool or Bristol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many ships are there?\u201d</p><p>The captain looked at Caulfield. \u201c \u2019Ow many are there now? Five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d Caulfield said, looking directly at Jess.</p><p>She met his gaze with difficulty. She couldn\u2019t explain why she felt as she did, but it was almost as if the intimacies she had witnessed that night in the woods had been between Caulfield and herself, not another woman. Something profound had transpired in the moment they\u2019d first become aware of each other in the darkness. A connecting thread had been sewn between them, and she had no notion how to sever it. She knew things about the man she should not know, and there was no way for her to return to blissful ignorance.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations on your success,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI can say the same to you.\u201d He set one forearm on the table. The cuff of his coat was of fashionable length, covering his hand near to the knuckle. Still, the sight of his fingers reminded her of another time ... a night when those hands had clung to a gazebo post to leverage the thrust of his hips.</p><p>He drummed his fingertips onto the tablecloth-covered wood, breaking her reverie. \u201cOh?\u201d she managed, after a fortifying swallow of wine.</p><p>\u201cMy ships also provide transport for Calypso goods.\u201d</p><p>Jess was not surprised to learn that. \u201cI should like to discuss that arrangement with you further, Mr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>His brows arched, and the other men grew quiet.</p><p>\u201cWhen you have time,\u201d she qualified. \u201cThere is no urgency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time now.\u201d</p><p>She recognized the hawklike precision of his gaze and understood she\u2019d engaged his mind for business. A moment of disquiet affected her, but she prayed she hid it. By necessity, she\u2019d come to recognize the type of men it was best not to cross, and Alistair Caulfield was certainly one of them. He flashed a bright, charming smile with ease, but it did not reach his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your willingness to accommodate me,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Jess watched as he stood. Rounding the table quickly but without haste, he assisted her with extracting herself from the bench.</p><p>She looked at the head of the table. \u201cThank you very much for a charming evening, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2019ope you\u2019ll join us every night.\u201d</p><p>Although she deported herself without noticeable fault, she was achingly aware of Caulfield standing very close beside her. When they left the great cabin together, that awareness increased tenfold. The door shut behind them, and she felt the click of the brass latch vibrate across overly taut nerves. Tarley had gone to great lengths to make her feel secure and without stress, while Caulfield so easily skewed her prized equanimity. He had an indefinable quality that heightened her cognizance of everything that made her feminine and, therefore, vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cShall we take a stroll on the deck?\u201d he asked in a subdued tone that swirled in the enclosed space around her. He stood almost too near, his head bent to accommodate the moderate height of the deckhead.</p><p>The scent clinging to him was delicious, filling her nostrils with sandalwood, musk, and the barest hint of verbena.</p><p>\u201cI will need to fetch a shawl.\u201d Her voice was huskier than she would have liked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He escorted her to her cabin in silence, which allowed other sounds to dominate\u2014the surefooted confidence of his steps, the accelerated rate of her breathing, the steady whoosh of the water against the hull.</p><p>She entered her room in a breathless rush and shut the door with indecorous haste. Sucking in a gasping breath, she drew Beth\u2019s widened eyes to her. The abigail dropped her darning on the table and stood.</p><p>\u201cLord, but yer flushed,\u201d Beth said in the calm, authoritative voice that made everything\u2014including a journey to Jamaica\u2014seem both possible and well in hand. She moved to the pitcher and basin by the bed to fetch a damp cloth. \u201cYer not falling ill, are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jess accepted the compress and held it to her cheeks. \u201cPerhaps I had more wine than I should have with supper. Can you fetch me a shawl?\u201d</p><p>Beth dug into the trunk at the foot of the bed and withdrew a black silk shawl. Jess traded the cloth for the garment with a grateful smile.</p><p>But Beth\u2019s frown did not diminish. \u201cMaybe you should rest, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jess agreed, damning herself for opening a discussion with Caulfield. She could have waited until daylight, at least. Or better yet, she should have left the questions to her steward, who could have subsequently provided her the answers with no discomfort necessary. \u201cI shan\u2019t be long, then you can retire to your quarters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurry yerself on my account. I\u2019m too excited to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jess draped the shawl over her shoulders and exited back to the passageway.</p><p>Caulfield had been leaning casually against the far bulkhead, but he straightened when Jess stepped out. Cast in the brighter light spilling out of her cabin, his face revealed a stark appreciation of her appearance that caused her to flush all over again. The smoldering in his gaze was quickly masked and replaced with an easy smile, but she remembered the feel of that stare from long ago. It had a similarly paralyzing effect on her now.</p><p>He gestured toward the stairs, and the gentle prod gave her the impetus to move. She preceded him up to the deck, grateful for the cool ocean breeze and low-hanging, yellow moon that stripped the world of color. Everything was rendered in black and shades of gray, which helped to mitigate the overwhelming vibrancy that had always distinguished Alistair Caulfield.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the chances,\u201d she began, just to break the weighty silence, \u201cthat you and I would find ourselves traveling on the same ship at the same time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent, considering I arranged it,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been comfortable so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could anyone be uncomfortable? This is a magnificent ship.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved, and a flutter tickled her stomach. \u201cIt pleases me to hear you say so. Should you require anything, I\u2019m at your service. Once we\u2019ve reached our destination, I have assured Michael that I\u2019ll make the necessary introductions and provide what information I can to assist you with the sale of Calypso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d she breathed, startled to realize she had been entrusted to the care of Alistair Caulfield\u2014a man who had always made her feel far from safe\u2014by her very own overprotective brother-in-law. \u201cI was unaware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive him. I told him I would discuss the matter with you. He\u2019s overwhelmed at the moment, and I wanted to alleviate some of his burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. That was very considerate.\u201d She started walking toward the forecastle to ease the tension gripping her. She didn\u2019t know Caulfield well enough to say he\u2019d changed, yet the man she spoke to did not fit the image of reckless, untamed youth she had carried in her mind all these years.</p> <p>\u201cMy motivation is not entirely altruistic,\u201d he qualified, falling into step beside her. His hands were clasped at the small of his back, emphasizing the strength of his shoulders and the breadth of his chest. He had always been more muscular than the Sinclairs. More so than even his own brothers.</p><p>She admired his build in ways she shouldn\u2019t. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He glanced aside at her. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of the country for many years, with only brief visits as necessary to prevent my mother from sending a search party after me. It\u2019s my hope that you will assist my acclimation to English society when I return, as I\u2019ll do for you in Jamaica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re returning to England for a longer stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked forward again.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Dear God, she sounded breathless once more. \u201cYour family and friends will be delighted, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>Caulfield\u2019s chest expanded on a deep breath.</p><p>Recalling that the family he\u2019d left behind was halved now, she said hastily, \u201cYour brothers ...\u201d</p> <p>Jess\u2019s head lowered. She regretted making him feel ill at ease, because she knew precisely how it felt to be continually reminded of what was forever lost to her.</p><p>He stopped beside the main mast. With a soft hand at her elbow, he urged her to halt as well.</p><p>She faced him. He took an unnecessary step closer. Near enough to dance. \u201cI\u2019m returning to England because the reason I stayed away no longer exists, and a reason to return has unexpectedly presented itself.\u201d</p><p>Caulfield\u2019s tone was intimate. Jess couldn\u2019t help wondering if a woman was luring him back.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI will endeavor to be as useful to you as you\u2019ll certainly be to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He hesitated, as if he considered saying something more. In the end, he held his tongue and gestured for her to continue walking. \u201cYou wished to discuss the transport of product from Calypso?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever obligations Calypso has are now my obligations, and I should be aware of them. That was all I wished to say. I can bring up the matter with my steward. Please, pay me no mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the answers you seek. I want to be the one who provides them to you. Come to me with whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at him, she found him intently focused on her. \u201cYou must be a very busy man. I don\u2019t wish to impose on your time unnecessarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could never be an imposition. I would take great pleasure in seeing to whatever you may desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>The warmth of Caulfield\u2019s voice changed, taking on a slight edge. \u201cYour tone suggests displeasure.\u201d</p><p>As he\u2019d done so long ago, he somehow managed to encourage Jess to speak more bluntly than she would have thought possible. \u201cThough I\u2019m grateful for your attentiveness, Mr. Caulfield, I am also weary of such consideration. I\u2019m not a woman made of glass who is prone to shattering without care. I arranged this trip, in part, to distance myself from those who insist on treating me as if I am fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea how to coddle a woman,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cIf that was my aim, I would certainly fail miserably. In truth, having met your steward on several occasions, I suspect he might have difficulty being completely forthcoming with a female. I want you to possess all the facts. The only way to be certain you have confidence in my ability to see to your interests is to be the one who shows you the contracts and terms myself, and explains whatever might be confusing.\u201d</p><p>His smile was filled with mischief. \u201cI want to expose you. Not shield you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved slightly. He was charming in his own wicked way.</p><p>\u201cThe hour grows late,\u201d he said as they neared the companionway again. \u201cAllow me to escort you back to your cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She was startled to realize she enjoyed his company.</p><p>Once they reached her door, he sketched an abbreviated bow in the narrow space. \u201cI bid you good night, Lady Tarley. Sweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>He was gone before she could reply, leaving behind a rather marked emptiness in the space he\u2019d occupied.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Michael Sinclair, Viscount Tarley, found himself in front of the Regmont town house in Mayfair thirty minutes into the two-hour block of time in which Lady Regmont was known to be at home to callers. He dismounted before he could change his mind and passed the reins to the waiting footman, then took the steps up to the front door two at a time. He resisted the urge to check his cravat, which he\u2019d styled modestly with a simple barrel knot. His anxiousness was extreme, to the point that he\u2019d dithered over which of his waistcoats was the most attractive foil for the deep blue coat he wore for her, because she had once said blue was a very attractive color on his person.</p><p>In short order, he was announced into a drawing room holding half a dozen callers. Hester sat in a butter-colored wingback in the center of the assemblage, looking as fragile and beautiful as he had ever seen her.</p><p>\u201cLord Tarley,\u201d she greeted, extending her hands to him without rising.</p><p>He crossed the oriental rug with swift strides and kissed the back of each pale, slender hand. \u201cLady Regmont. My day is brighter for having begun it in your presence.\u201d</p><p>His pleasure would be dimmed when he left, as if he stepped out of the sunlight and into a shadow. He believed she was made for him, so much so he\u2019d never once contemplated marrying anyone else. In his youth, he had thought it would be perfect for the Sinclair brothers to marry the Sheffield sisters and live parallel, harmonious lives. But Hadley had nursed grander plans for his daughters, and Michael\u2019s position as second son was not of sufficient consequence even to bear consideration.</p><p>He\u2019d never had a chance to have her.</p><p>To add insult to injury, Hester was denied even a proper Season, just as her sister had been. She was betrothed almost from the moment she was presented at court.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had forgotten me,\u201d she said to him. \u201cIt has been ages since you last called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never forget you.\u201d Although there were nights when he prayed for such to be possible.</p><p>She looked over his shoulder with a telling glance. A moment later, an efficient servant moved a damask-upholstered wooden chair to a place beside her. The other guests returned Michael\u2019s brisk nods of greeting with smiles and effusive welcomes.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Hester said, gesturing at the chair. \u201cSit. Tell me everything that has transpired in your life since the last time we spoke.\u201d</p><p>He settled into the seat, his gaze ravenous as it swept over her glorious features. Her golden hair was styled fashionably, with ringlets on her forehead and hanging over her ears. She wore a lovely gown of rose pink, and her neck was adorned with a cameo secured by a thick black ribbon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to reassure you. Jessica is in good hands. Alistair Caulfield has agreed to look after her while she is away. He\u2019s lived in Jamaica for some years now and is well versed in the flow of Society and the personages in residence there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Caulfield, you say.\u201d A frown marred the line of her brows. \u201cI am not certain she ever cared much for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the feeling might be mutual. The few times I\u2019ve seen them together, they both became noticeably discomfited. However, they are adults now and she requires some guidance in matters in which Caulfield has expertise. In addition, she seeks to sell the plantation, and Caulfield\u2019s property borders hers, so she has the impetus and means to conclude her affairs posthaste and return to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Hester\u2019s lovely green eyes warmed. \u201cYou are deviously clever. I adore that trait in you.\u201d</p><p>Her last words caused a pang in his chest. Her adoration was only a small portion of what he wanted from her. \u201cI cannot take all the credit. Caulfield rather fell into my lap and volunteered. I was simply in the correct place at the correct time to take advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a godsend.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cI miss her terribly already and she has been gone only one day. But listen to me go on so selfishly. She made a great attempt to hide it, but it was clear she anticipated the trip. In fact, she was quite eager. I should at least make an attempt to be excited for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is why I came by today. I know how close you are to Jessica and how her absence will pain you. I want you to know ... I am at your disposal, for whatever you require, in the interim until she returns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have always been so wonderful to me.\u201d She reached out and gently, all-too-briefly touched his forearm. An air of melancholy clung to her that disturbed him. \u201cBut you have enough new burdens without adding me to the mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never be a burden to me. It is my privilege to be available to you whenever you may need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may live to regret that offer one day,\u201d she teased, brightening. \u201cI am certain I could devise ways to torment you with it.\u201d</p><p>Although her meaning was innocent, his reaction to her words was less so. \u201cDo your worst,\u201d he challenged in a husky voice. \u201cI am eager to prove myself up to the task.\u201d</p><p>A blush brought welcome color to her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMilady.\u201d The butler approached with a small, beribboned box on a silver salver. He presented the gift to her.</p><p>One of Hester\u2019s guests, the Marchioness of Grayson, began to tease her about secret admirers and how jealous Regmont would be, since his possessiveness over his wife was well known. He was unfashionably doting.</p><p>Hester opened the small accompanying card first, then set it on the chair arm beside her. Michael noted that her fingers were shaking as she opened the box, revealing a jewel-encrusted broach of obvious expense. Noting the pinched look around her eyes, he glanced at the card, which had been only partially refolded. He could make out very little of the slashing scrawl, but \u201cforgive me\u201d was legible enough. It tautened his jaw and sent a rush of questions through his mind.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Lady Bencott asked. \u201cDo not keep us in an agony of curiosity. What is it and who sent it?\u201d</p><p>Hester passed the gift into the countess\u2019s waiting hand. \u201cRegmont, of course.\u201d</p><p>As the broach made its way around the room to much approbation, Michael thought Hester\u2019s wide smile looked forced. Certainly she was too pale not to raise some concern.</p><p>He excused himself, unable to bear the feeling that something was wrong in her world, and he lacked the right to do anything about it.</p><p>It was late afternoon, and Jessica had yet to make an appearance on deck.</p><p>Alistair restrained himself from pacing by dint of will alone. If she decided to avoid him on the ship, it would make wooing her more difficult, but he was not a man who accepted defeat gracefully. He intended to build a rapport with her during the journey, and he would find a way to do it. There had to be means of establishing at least the beginnings of a deeper association. He simply had to puzzle out the key to unlocking her. Last night, he\u2019d thought forthrightness might be the avenue of least resistance, but perhaps he had misread her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gripping the gunwale, he stared down at the water. It did not escape his notice that the sea was presently the same gray hue as Jessica\u2019s eyes.</p><p>By God, she was breathtaking.</p><p>He remembered her entering the great cabin for supper. She\u2019d altered the very air around her, allowing him to feel her come in. The weight and heat of her regard had flowed over his spine like a physical caress. He\u2019d arranged to be standing as he was, coatless and occupied, at the time of her arrival. He wanted her to see him as the man he was now\u2014cultured and learned. Polished. His presentation was meant to be the first salvo in what was intended to be a slow, careful seduction.</p><p>In actuality, however, she\u2019d struck him a blow that carried equal fierceness. She had stood there before him with guinea-blond hair piled high, her pale skin as flawless as the finest porcelain, her once slender body matured into that of a woman ... Full, high breasts. Delicate waist. Long legs he desired to feel wrapped around his hips. There was something inherently vulnerable about her that called to every base and primitive instinct inside him.</p> <p>He wanted to ravish her. Possess her.</p><p>For a taut moment, her features had betrayed her response to the realization of who he was. Seven years ago and now, she\u2019d been drawn to him. He could use that against her, if he tread very carefully.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. Even the sound of her voice could send lewd imaginings through his mind. It was as precise and restrained as her deportment. He wanted to turn that clipped intonation into something throatier. Softer. He wanted to hear her say his name while hoarse from pleasured cries.</p><p>With a deep breath, he faced her. \u201cLady Tarley. You look rested. I trust you slept well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did, thank you.\u201d</p><p>She looked more than rested; she looked stunningly beautiful. Dressed in a deep blue gown and carrying a delicate parasol, she was a vision on the deck of his ship. He did not look away from her, but knew every man within eyesight had to be equally mesmerized. She was impossibly perfect in every way.</p><p>Joining him at the gunwale, Jessica set one gloved hand atop the wood and looked out at the endless ocean around them. \u201cI have loved sailing from the very first,\u201d she offered in a rush of words. \u201cThere is something so freeing yet calming about the lack of visual obstruction. Although I would not wish to be so isolated while alone, on a ship as fine as this, and with such a large crew, there is nothing to mar the joy. Lord and Lady Masterson must be very proud of your successes.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his father\u2019s title had the customary effect of making his hackles rise. He shook off the tension by rolling his shoulders back. \u201cPride is, perhaps, not the word I would use. But they are certainly aware of my endeavors.\u201d</p><p>Jessica glanced at him. The nervousness revealed by her quick speech was also evident in the way she worried her lower lip between her teeth. Though neither of them had yet to acknowledge the memory of that long-ago night in the Pennington woods, the recollection was wedged between them, more pervasive because they avoided addressing it. He wished to. God, how he wished to. There were so many questions he wanted to ask her.</p><p>Instead, he redirected her back to a topic they could both be comfortable with. \u201cI agree the wide ocean is like a blank slate. The possibilities and mysteries of it are endless.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile was lovely. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. My brother is at Oxford now. Hadley is quite pleased, of course. And my sister has become a hostess of some renown. She will be most helpful to you once you return to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wed the Earl of Regmont, did she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I introduced them on the eve of my wedding, and the meeting led to a love match, as horribly unfashionable as that is.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cA night to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d A soft blush tinged her cheeks. \u201cHow do they fare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs expected. My brother Albert\u2014Lord Baybury now\u2014has yet to produce an heir, a fact that disturbs Masterson greatly. He fears I may one day inherit the dukedom, which would be his worst nightmare realized.\u201d</p> <p>She shot him a castigating look. \u201cNonsense. It is difficult for everyone when there is a failure to conceive. Certainly, it is distressing for Lady Baybury as well.\u201d</p><p>The sympathy in her tone clearly sprang from a deeply rooted place, which reminded Alistair that six years of marriage had not produced a child for Jessica, either.</p><p>He swiftly changed the course of discussion. \u201cI cannot recall the time of year Tarley took you to Calypso, but the weather now is tolerably hot. On occasion, there are brief spates of afternoon rain, but sunshine swiftly follows. Most find it quite delightful, and I trust you will as well.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved in a way not meant to be seductive, but he found it so. \u201cYou navigate through difficult conversations with remarkable aplomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA necessity in many business transactions.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cAre you surprised? Impressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>One perfectly arched brow rose. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou exemplify the epitome of social grace. One can only think highly of those who receive your approval.\u201d</p><p>Her expression was wry. \u201cYou grant me more credit than I deserve.\u201d</p><p>Turning slightly, he faced her and leaned casually into the gunwale. \u201cThen allow me to say that I would be most pleased to earn your esteem.\u201d</p><p>Jessica tipped her parasol in a way that shielded her face from him. \u201cYou are doing a fine job so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. However, do not fault me for trying harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are trying quite hard enough.\u201d</p><p>Her prim tone caused his smile to turn into a grin.</p><p>This time, she was the one to change the subject. \u201cIs the water around the island as clear as I remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear as glass. From the shore, one can watch the fish swim. And there are places along the coast where the depth is shallow for a great distance, far enough that one can wade out to the reefs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have to find one of those places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you.\u201d</p><p>The parasol lifted then. \u201cSurely your obligation to Michael does not extend that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would enjoy nothing more.\u201d The moment the words were out, he knew he\u2019d revealed too much in the huskiness of his voice. It couldn\u2019t be helped. Not with the image of her wet and playful in the water, with her skirts lifted high enough to bare slender ankles. Perhaps shapely calves ...</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ve had enough sun today,\u201d Jessica pronounced, stepping back. \u201cIt was lovely speaking with you, Mr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>Alistair straightened. \u201cI will be here for the next several weeks,\u201d he teased, \u201cif you should like to share the sun again.\u201d</p><p>As she glided away, she spoke over her shoulder. \u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>The soft note of flirtation in her tone sent a surge of satisfaction through him. It was a small victory, but he\u2019d long ago learned to take whatever he could.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>As Jessica enjoyed another surprisingly delicious evening meal in the great cabin, she glanced repeatedly across the table at Alistair Caulfield. She couldn\u2019t help marveling at the man he had become. He easily held his own against the formidable, and much senior, captain. The ship\u2019s surgeon\u2014a man who\u2019d been introduced only as Morley\u2014also deferred to him in a manner beyond that of employee to employer. Both men seemed to admire Alistair and respect his opinions. In return, he spoke to them as equals, which impressed Jess very much.</p><p>As she had the night before, she endeavored to ease the flow of conversation by directing it toward topics the gentlemen were most conversant with. Presently, they were discussing the slave trade, a subject she knew was a heated one in some circles. At first, Caulfield hesitated to expound upon his views and the manner in which he supplied labor to his plantation. But when Jess showed interest, he indulged her. She remembered how she\u2019d once derided the ease with which he deviated from established mores, but now she appreciated that trait in him. Neither her father nor Tarley had ever discussed business or political matters in her presence. Caulfield\u2019s willingness to do so emboldened her, giving her the courage to broach areas she would never have otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDo most plantations still rely on slave labor?\u201d she asked, well aware that the abolition of the slave trade had not abolished slavery itself.</p><p>The captain tugged on his beard. \u201cLike pirates, a law of the land won\u2019t change a trader\u2019s ways. The Preventative Squadron is too small as yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre pirates a problem for you, Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a plague on all ships, but I\u2019m proud to say no ship under my command \u2019as ever been boarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with conviction, which earned her a beaming smile from Captain Smith. She turned her attention to Alistair, steeling herself for the impact the sight of him would have. The effort was made in vain. The effect of his comeliness on the female senses did not lessen with time or exposure. \u201cIs Calypso reliant on slave labor?\u201d</p><p>Alistair nodded. \u201cMost plantations remain dependent upon it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding yours?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his seat. His lips pursed before replying, as if he had to contemplate his answer before offering it. She appreciated his circumspection, a trait she had not attributed to him before now. \u201cFrom a business perspective, slavery is cost effective. From a personal standpoint, I prefer to have individuals working for me who desire to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are evading my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not use slaves on Sous la Lune,\u201d he said, watching her in a way that indicated an interest in her reaction. \u201cI use indentured servants. Mostly Chinese or Indians. I do have several Negroes under my employ, but they are free men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder the Moon ...\u201d she murmured, translating the name of his plantation. \u201cHow lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His smile held a secret. \u201cCall me sentimental.\u201d</p><p>Gooseflesh swept over Jess\u2019s arms. Once again, he seemed to reference that night in the Pennington woods. But if so, he was not going about it in the manner she would have expected. His tone was warm and intimate, not mocking or laden with indiscreet suggestion.</p><p>But why would such a lewd incident hold sentimental value for him?</p><p>Caulfield lifted his glass to his lips, his gaze lingering on her over the rim. His cool blue eyes held such appreciation, she felt it on her skin as she would the rays of the sun.</p><p>Jess reconsidered her own view of that night. The act he\u2019d been engaged in had been obscene, and for so long she had thought only of that aspect. Yet in those moments when their gazes held, there had been ... something else as well. She couldn\u2019t understand it, nor could she explain it, which was part of what frightened her. If someone were to describe the incident to her, she would be appalled and find nothing positive to attach to it. But it had happened to her, and her subsequent discussion with Tarley that night had changed her life irrevocably. She\u2019d been incited into recognizing unknown needs and given the tenacity through desire to make those needs known to the man she\u2019d wed. The six years of her marriage had been precious to her as a result. Perhaps Alistair had gained something, too? She hoped to muster the courage to ask him one day.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Tarley continue to use slaves if there were alternate means available?\u201d she asked, needing to find something less personal to focus on.</p><p>\u201cDo not think ill of him,\u201d Alistair replied. \u201cHe was not directly responsible for the oversight of Calypso. There is a foreman and steward who handle such details, and they act in the best interests of their employer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey act in the interests of profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two are one and the same, are they not?\u201d He leaned forward and gave her a hard look. \u201cI pray you appreciate that. Ideals are all well and good, but they will not feed, clothe, and keep you warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou utilize other means,\u201d Jess argued. It did not sit well with her to think that her gowns, jewels, sprightly curricle, and a multitude of other luxuries had been purchased at the expense of the labors of enslaved men. She knew well what it felt like to be powerless and at the mercy of the whims of another.</p><p>\u201cMy other business interests afford me a bit more license.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am to understand that ideals are bought with coin? Those who have enough are provided the means, while those who do not must\u2014in effect\u2014sell them for gain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnromantic, perhaps,\u201d he said unapologetically, \u201cbut true.\u201d</p><p>There he was. The young man who would accept any wager and take coin for stud servicing. She had wondered where he\u2019d gone and now saw he hadn\u2019t gone anywhere at all. He had simply acquired some polish to disguise the rough edges.</p><p>\u201cMost enlightening,\u201d she murmured, taking an overly large swallow of wine.</p><p>As soon as she was able, Jess excused herself and headed directly toward her cabin. She traversed the passageway with as much haste as decorously possible.</p><p>\u201cJessica.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her given name in Alistair\u2019s deep voice was enervating. She waited until she reached her door before halting and facing him. \u201cYes, Mr. Caulfield?\u201d</p><p>As he had the night before, he took up all the space in the narrow hallway. \u201cIt was not my intent to upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Although he looked composed, the sudden rough raking of his hand through his inky dark hair suggested otherwise. \u201cI do not want you to think ill of Tarley for the decisions he made that helped to provide for you. He was not a fool; he took the opportunities presented to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand,\u201d she said evenly, feeling a rare exhilaration. As with Benedict, she did not fear reprisal for speaking her mind to Alistair. \u201cI do not fault common sense, practicality, or even well-intentioned avarice. It is being underestimated that is bothersome to me. I know well enough not to weaken my interests, even for the sake of my higher sensibilities. However, I may renegotiate Calypso\u2019s contract with you to gain the funds to acquire indentured servants. Or I may find that purchasing my own ship and crew will be more profitable in the long term, thereby freeing up funds in that manner. Or perhaps increasing the production of rum is a matter I should look into. In any case, it\u2019s possible I can find the means to have ideals, if I so desire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes glittered in the dim light of the flashlamps. \u201cI am duly chastened, my lady. I was under the impression that you meant to sell Calypso, in which case your questions pertained to the past and not the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ...\u201d She remained skeptical.</p><p>\u201cI once underestimated you,\u201d he admitted, clasping his hands behind his back. \u201cBut that was long ago.\u201d</p><p>Jess could not check the impulse to ask, \u201cWhat altered your opinion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did.\u201d He flashed his infamously wicked smile. \u201cWhen faced with the choice of fleeing or staying, you stay.\u201d</p><p>The sharp pang in her chest caused her shaky courage to flee. She turned to open her door, but paused to look over her shoulder before she entered her cabin. \u201cI have never underestimated you.\u201d</p><p>Alistair bowed smartly. \u201cI suggest you don\u2019t start now. Good night, Lady Tarley.\u201d</p><p>Once inside her cabin, Jess leaned into the closed door and willed her heart to stop racing.</p><p>Ever prepared, Beth had a damp cloth waiting. As Jess pressed the coolness against her cheeks, she saw the knowing look in the abigail\u2019s eyes. She turned and presented the row of buttons fastening her gown.</p> <p>One person who could see right through her was enough for the night.</p><p>Hester had just arranged the last white plume in her upswept hair when her husband entered her boudoir in a state of partial undress. His cravat hung undone around his neck, and his waistcoat was unbuttoned. Regmont was freshly bathed and shaved, if his damp hair and shadow-free jaw-line were any indication. He was undeniably handsome with his honey-hued hair and robin\u2019s egg blue eyes. Together they formed a striking golden couple\u2014he with his boundless exuberance and silken charm, and she with her mantle of reservation and faultless deportment.</p><p>Regmont jerked his head toward her abigail, Sarah, who was smoothing out minute wrinkles in the new blue gown Hester intended to wear. \u201cI was hoping to see you in the pink with lace. It\u2019s ravishing on you, especially with my mother\u2019s pearls.\u201d</p><p>She met the maid\u2019s gaze in the mirror and nodded, ceding to her husband\u2019s wishes. The alternative was an argument best avoided.</p><p>The abigail quietly and efficiently exchanged the dresses. After the pink gown had been laid out on the bed, Regmont dismissed the servant. Sarah paled and looked miserable as she left the room in haste, no doubt fearing the worst. Although there was a pattern to the escalation of Regmont\u2019s moods, violence defied reason.</p><p>When they were alone, he cupped Hester\u2019s shoulders and nuzzled the tender spot beneath her ear. As his fingers kneaded, she flinched and he noticed. Stiffening, he looked at the spot he touched.</p> <p>Hester watched him in the mirror, waiting for the remorse to cross his expressive features. In that respect, he differed from her father. Hadley never regretted his actions.</p><p>\u201cDid you receive my gift?\u201d he whispered, gentling his touch over the darkening bruise marring her right shoulder blade.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gestured to where it sat on the vanity in front of her. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut pales in comparison to you.\u201d The movement of his lips tickled the shell of her ear. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>She often thought they deserved each other. For all the times Jess had interceded on her behalf and taken the brunt of their father\u2019s fury, it had been her due to take it while Jess had found at least temporary peace during her happy marriage. It was the saddest sort of irony that Hester had once thought she and Regmont had a precious affinity because both of their childhood homes had been marred by paternal abuse. They understood the scars left behind and the particular traits a child acquired to survive, but she\u2019d learned other traits seeped into the characters of those who suffered while too young. An imprint was left on the soul, manifesting itself in ways not readily evident. As was said, an apple does not fall far from the tree.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLong. I spent the whole of it thinking of you.\u201d He urged her to turn and she did, sliding carefully around on the small vanity stool so that the mirror was to her back.</p><p>Regmont knelt before her, his hands moving to clasp the back of her calves. Laying his head in her lap, he said, \u201cForgive me, my darling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEdward.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou are everything to me. No one understands me the way you do. I would be lost without you.\u201d</p><p>She touched his damp hair, running her fingers through it. \u201cYou\u2019re not yourself when you drink spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he agreed, rubbing his cheek against her bruised thigh. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to control myself. You know I would never deliberately do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>They kept no liquor in any of their homes, but he easily found it elsewhere. By all accounts he was a jovial drunk, a most entertaining and amusing fellow. Until he returned home to her, where the demons plaguing him resided.</p><p>She felt the wet of his tears soak through her chemise and pantalettes.</p><p>He lifted his head and looked at her with reddened eyes. \u201cCan you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>Every time he asked her the question, it became harder to answer. He was most often the perfect husband. Kind and thoughtful. He spoiled her with gifts and tokens of affection, love letters and favorite treats. He listened when she spoke and remembered anything she admired. She\u2019d learned swiftly to be very careful with what she voiced a liking for, because he would attain it for her by whatever means necessary. But there were times when he was a monster.</p><p>There was still a part of her that was madly in love with the sweet memories they\u2019d created in the infancy of their marriage. Yet she hated him, too.</p><p>\u201cMy dearest Hester,\u201d he murmured, his hands sliding up to the ties at her waist. \u201cAllow me to make restitution. Let me worship you, as you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord, please.\u201d She circled his wrists with her fingers. \u201cWe are expected at the Grayson ball. My hair has already been arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not disturb it,\u201d he promised in the low seductive tone that had once been capable of luring her into carnal depravity in carriages and alcoves and anywhere else they could find a modicum of privacy. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>Regmont looked at her with slumberous eyes. He was passion flushed and determined. When it came to his amorous inclinations, \u201cno\u201d was not an answer he accepted. The few times she\u2019d attempted it, unable to bear the thought of his hands on her again even in tenderness, he had drunk himself into furies that made her regret denying him. Then he\u2019d take her anyway, excusing himself with the orgasms he wrung from her. After all, he reasoned, she must have been willing if she\u2019d enjoyed it so much. She almost preferred the pain of his fists to the humiliation of her own traitorous body.</p><p>Her pantalettes were wriggled out from under her, then slid over her stocking-clad calves and removed completely. His large hands cupped her knees and urged them apart. His breath caressed the flesh of her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he praised, parting her with questing fingers. \u201cSo soft and sweet and as pink as a seashell.\u201d</p><p>The Earl of Regmont had been a gazetted rake before offering for her. He\u2019d acquired more sexual skill with his hands, mouth, and cock than any man should have a right to. When he unleashed those talents on her body, it always betrayed her. No matter how determined she was to be angry for the sake of her own survival and mental well-being, he was more stubborn than she. Minutes or hours, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He proved his mastery over her again now, fluttering the pointed tip of his tongue over her clitoris. She vainly fought against the pleasure with closed eyes, gritted teeth, and hands clenching the edge of the upholstered stool. When the inevitable climax shuddered through her, tears sprang to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>What did it say about her, that she could experience pleasure from the touch of a man who brought her such pain? Perhaps her father\u2019s legacy was more clearly revealed by her private life than her public one.</p><p>Regmont began his sensual assault again, urging her to lean back and open herself more fully. As he pushed his tongue inside her, her mind retreated into a darkened space separate from her body. A small blessing, that. But a welcome one.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cSail O!\u201d</p><p>Beth looked up at the deckhead as if she could see through it to the sudden burst of activity thundering above. \u201cLord, what\u2019s the meaning of that?\u201d</p><p>Jess set her book aside with a frown. It was midafternoon, and she had remained in her cabin to contemplate her growing fascination with Alistair Caulfield. It was rather frightening, this slow careful exploration of a man she was undeniably attracted to. A man so far removed from the life she had been raised to lead that she couldn\u2019t see how he would ever fit into it beyond transient pleasure. This fascination could prove dangerous, considering her most valuable asset was her reputation.</p><p>Not that she could ever be any man\u2019s mistress, even if she possessed the reckless nature required. Her experience with flirtation and seduction was limited to nonexistent. She\u2019d been promised to Tarley before her presentation. She had no notion of how one managed clandestine sexual liaisons. How many were conducted while standing in gazebos? How many forbidden lovers passed one another at public events without a look or smile or modicum of affection? How could such an interaction be anything but tawdry? She couldn\u2019t imagine not feeling cheapened by such careless experiences.</p><p>In the passageway, the stomping of feet and barked orders gave weight to the sense that something was amiss. The sound of a heavy object being rolled across a deck further raised her concerns.</p><p>\u201cCannons?\u201d Beth asked, with eyes wide.</p><p>Jess stood. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>Opening the door, she discovered a ship in chaos. The passageway was clogged with sailors pushing past each other as some went above deck and others came below.</p><p>She shouted in an attempt to be heard. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPirates, milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Beth muttered while peering over Jess\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe captain assured me he has never commanded a ship that has been boarded by pirates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the panic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing prepared is not a sign of defeat or fear,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWould you not rather have the pirates see us willing and able to fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather they not see us at all.\u201d</p><p>Jess gestured at the crate of claret. \u201cHave a drink. I will return shortly.\u201d</p><p>Thrusting herself into the swarm of seamen in the passageway, Jess moved with the upward tide of bodies until she reached the open deck. She spun about, looking for another ship, but saw nothing but sea. However, at the helm of the Acheron, she discovered a sight that took her breath away\u2014Alistair steered the vessel, looking very much like a pirate himself. Sans coat and waistcoat, he stood on the quarterdeck with legs planted wide and a cutlass strapped around his lean hips.</p><p>She was riveted by the sight of him. The wind whipped through his dark hair and billowed through the voluminous linen of his shirtsleeves. The dangerous, reckless air about him caused her heart to race.</p><p>He saw her. Something fierce passed over his features. He shook his head, but he might as well have beckoned her to him.</p><p>Maneuvering through the roiling crush on the deck, Jess was breathless by the time she reached him. He caught her by the wrist when she came close enough, yanking her to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous up here.\u201d Somehow, his voice carried over all the noise without his seeming to yell. \u201cGo below and stay away from the portholes.\u201d</p><p>Looking out across the ocean again, she shouted, \u201cI do not see any pirates. Where are they?\u201d</p><p>Before she knew what he was about, he had pulled her in front of him. She stood between the wheel and his body. \u201cToo close,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Yes, he was. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He spoke with his lips to her right ear. \u201cSince you intend to converse with me under hazardous circumstances, I must shield you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary. I\u2019ll go\u2014\u201d</p><p>A boom caused her to jump. A moment later, a cannonball hit the water behind them, sending water splashing high into the air.</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d His frame was rigid against her back, hard as stone but sun warmed. \u201cI can\u2019t risk you.\u201d</p><p>Every breath he took gusted across her ear and sent tingles coursing down her spine. It seemed impossible that she should become aroused while on display for so many strangers, but there was no denying the tautness of her nipples, now aching from what seemed to be a sudden chill in the breeze sweeping over her muslin bodice.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s arm hitched, pressing her more tightly against him. Her breasts spilled over his forearm. Behind her, she felt the undeniable evidence of his physical response to her.</p><p>All that stood between her and Alistair Caulfield\u2014noted scapegrace and careless disregarder of Society\u2019s esteem\u2014were a few layers of material. She wished there was nothing between them at all. She missed the feel of a man\u2019s larger, more powerful body over her, in her ...</p><p>A year alone and a flirtatious, handsome man had made her a wanton.</p><p>Dear God ... a year. The date. As the significance of the month and day struck her, her body stiffened. Only a year tomorrow since Tarley had passed. Yet here she was, pressing her derriere against a man who could have no honorable intentions toward her, and all the while she was thinking it had been seven years since she\u2019d felt so ... vibrant. Her desire felt like such a betrayal. She was the widow of a fine man who had given her the kind of peace and security she\u2019d never dared to dream about. A man who had truly loved her. Why, then, did she feel so connected to the rakehell behind her? And fascinated in a way she\u2019d never been with her darling husband.</p><p>Sensing the change in her bearing, Alistair queried, \u201cJessica?\u201d</p><p>A sailor shouted directly to her right, jolting her. His coarse voice echoed through her one good ear, making her intensely aware of the chaos around them. Every yell and cry, every thud and crash reverberated through her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another boom followed by the splash of a too-near cannonball.</p><p>Panic welled.

She was bombarded with memories of her father shouting ... her mother\u2019s cries ... shattered glass ... the whistle of a switch ... the report of a gun ... her own whimpers of distress ... Her recollections blended with the bustle around her into a barrage of sound and sensation she couldn\u2019t absorb. The commotion pounded against the one ear that could process sound, leaving her unbalanced. Off-kilter.</p><p>Reckless in her haste, Jess stumbled through the seamen in her way and increased her pace, desperate to return to the safety of her cabin.</p><p>Alistair slept fitfully and rose before the sun. He went on deck to work with the crew, needing an outlet for the aggravated energy that made him so restless.</p><p>Jessica had declined to take her evening meal in the great cabin the night before. And as the sun set on the new day, she had yet to appear.</p> <p>What had possessed him to grab her as he had? What little progress he\u2019d made since setting sail had been ruined in a few brash moments.</p><p>He knew the fault lay entirely at his feet. With the wind in his face and excitement all around, his blood had been hot before she appeared, and once she had, everything had coalesced into the irresistible urge to wrap himself around her and hang on.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to pursue her when she fled, but he couldn\u2019t leave the helm. His disappointment in not seeing her at supper had been fierce. She enlivened the table with her skilled deportment and quick wit. Her forthrightness was a delight, and he relished watching how easily she enchanted the other men at the table.</p><p>He was debating the merits of seeking her out when her maid appeared on deck. The abigail\u2019s dark hair was covered by a frilly cap, and a sturdy woolen shawl was wrapped around her shoulders. She waved at Miller, who gawked in the manner of besotted youth, then moved to the gunwale to gaze at the sea.</p><p>Alistair crossed the distance between them and greeted her.</p><p>She gave a quick curtsy in reply. \u201cSir?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI pray your mistress is well. She was sorely missed last night. If there is anything she requires, please do not hesitate to ask.\u201d</p><p>She offered a reassuring smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2019elp for her, I\u2019m afraid. \u2019Tis a year to the day since \u2019is lordship \u2019urried on to \u2019is reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarley\u2019s death is what ails her?\u201d He frowned. Jessica had left the deck so abruptly the afternoon before ... surely he\u2019d had some part in that distress?</p><p>\u201cShe just needs some time alone, I think, sir. She dismissed me and means to retire early. Everything will look brighter on another day.\u201d</p><p>Giving a brief nod, he turned away. His jaw was clenched tight enough to pain him.</p><p>Bloody hell, he was jealous of a dead man. Had been envious for many years. Ever since he\u2019d followed Jessica out of the Pennington woods and watched her seduce the very proper Viscount Tarley into satisfying the craving he\u2019d roused in her. He had woken her passions, but Tarley had the right to sate them. The thought that history might have repeated itself yesterday ...</p><p>Had the lush melting of her body against his made her hunger for Tarley?</p><p>Growling softly, he moved to the companionway and descended the stairs. He reached her door, ensured there were no witnesses, and then walked straight in.</p> <p>He came to an abrupt halt. His brain processes stopped altogether. The sight greeting him stunned him to the point that it took a long moment to remember to close the door. But when the realization came to him, he did so quickly. One last look in the passageway before the portal swung closed assured him no one else had been granted the view shredding his innards to ribbons.</p><p>\u201cMr. Caulfield,\u201d the object of his obsession purred. \u201cDid no one teach you to knock?\u201d</p><p>One long, slender, very bare leg stretched out over the rim of a copper slipper tub. Jessica was flushed from the heat of the bathwater and too much claret ... if her slurred words, lack of modesty, and the bottle on the stool beside her were any indication. Her hair was piled haphazardly atop her head, giving her a disheveled, recently tumbled look embodying every carnal imagining he\u2019d ever had about her. He was more than satisfied with the lush figure on display for him. She had lovely peaches-and-cream skin, breasts fuller than he\u2019d pictured, and legs longer than he\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>Bloody hell, his decision to indulge her by storing extra barrels of water for bathing had been a stroke of genius.</p><p>As his inability to speak drew out, Jessica arched one brow and asked, \u201cWould you care for a glass?\u201d</p><p>Alistair walked over to the stool with as much aplomb as he could muster with a raging cockstand. He collected the bottle, then drank straight from it. There was little remaining. And as excellent a vintage as it was, it failed to dull the sharp edge of his hunger, which was aggravated by his new vantage\u2014he could see every inch of the front side of her.</p><p>Her head tilted back, and she looked up at him with slumberous eyes. \u201cYou are notably comfortable witnessing a lady\u2019s toilette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are notably comfortable being witnessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you do this sort of thing often?\u201d</p><p>Discussing past lovers was never wise. He certainly was not going to begin now. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a first for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored.\u201d He moved to one of the chairs at the table and wondered how best to proceed. The territory was unfamiliar to him. Yesterday, he\u2019d pushed too far too soon. He could not afford to make a similar mistake today, and yet he was presented with a naked, inebriated, uninhibited woman he had been lusting after for years. Even a saint would be sorely pressed for restraint, and God knew he was far from saintly.</p><p>As Alistair sat, he noted the case of claret by the foot of the bed. The quantity spoke of a woman who occasionally sought oblivion. It troubled him to think she\u2019d been so attached to Tarley. How could he compete with a specter? Especially one who had so perfectly suited her in ways Alistair never could.</p><p>\u201cAre you preparing to join us for supper?\u201d he asked in as casual a tone as he could manage.</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t be joining you.\u201d Jessica leaned her head back against the rim and closed her eyes. \u201cAnd you should not be joining me in my cabin, Mr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair,\u201d he corrected. \u201cSo ask me to leave. Although you should have someone here to assist you. Since your maid has been dismissed for the evening, I would be happy to make the substitution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou learned of my solitude and pounced straightaway. You are so reckless and impetuous and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014apologetic about the upset you experienced yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. He waited for her to explain. Instead she said, \u201cMy reputation is very important to me.\u201d</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t said, he understood the implication that it was not a concern they shared. \u201cYour good name is important to me, as well.\u201d</p><p>One gray eye opened. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it matters to you.\u201d</p><p>That lone, assessing eye might have been disconcerting if he hadn\u2019t been determined to be completely honest with her. With a nod, the eye closed again.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy the feel of your gaze on me,\u201d she said with surprising candor. \u201cThat enjoyment is quite distressing.\u201d</p><p>He hid a smile behind the rim of the bottle. She was an honest drunk. \u201cI enjoy looking at you. I always have. I doubt I could change that. You are not alone in this attraction between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has no place in either of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Stretching out his legs in front of him, Alistair said, \u201cBut we are not in our lives now. Nor will we be for the next few months, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I are very different individuals. Perhaps you think my paralysis that night in the Pennington woods hints at some deeper, more intriguing aspect of my character, but I assure you, nothing of the sort exists. I was confused and mortified; there is nothing of note beyond that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet here you are. Traveling alone a great distance. Not by necessity, but by choice. I find that very intriguing. Tarley bequeathed you a source of great income. Why was he so determined to see you not merely taken care of, but exceptionally wealthy? In doing so, he provided you with the means to go in any direction you choose, while also forcing you to conduct business on a large scale. He shielded you with one hand, while pushing you into a new world with the other. I find that intriguing also.\u201d</p><p>Jessica drank the last of the wine in her glass and set it on the stool where the bottle had previously been. Sitting up, she wrapped her arms around her bent knees and looked at the door. \u201cI cannot be your mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never ask you to be.\u201d He draped one arm over the tabletop, his focus narrowed to the wet curl adhering to the pale curve of her back. He was hard as a poker, throbbing and on display due to the tailored fit of his breeches. \u201cI want no arrangement with you. I do not want to be serviced. What I desire is your willingness, your needs, and your demands.\u201d</p><p>She turned those big gray eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cI want to service you, Jessica. I want to finish what we began seven years ago.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Alistair could see Jessica considering his suggestion.</p><p>\u201cI cannot fathom how it is,\u201d she said at length, \u201cthat I am having this discussion with you, today of all days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why Tarley settled Calypso on you? Because he wanted to preserve you as his? Because he wished to leave you with no excuse to turn to a man to look after you?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and rested her cheek on her bent knees. \u201cHe was too dear a man for such selfishness. He told me to be happy. To love again. To make my own choice this time around. But I am certain he was thinking of marriage, not an affair with a man who dallies about promiscuously.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s hand tightened on his glass, but he wisely held his tongue.</p><p>\u201cMen have so much more freedom,\u201d she said on a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>\u201cIf freedom is what you seek, why marry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of doing so. What purpose would it serve? I do not need the support, and since I am barren, I have nothing to offer men of suitable station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinancial considerations are valid ones, of course. But what of your needs as a woman? Will you deny yourself the pleasure of a man\u2019s touch forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men\u2019s hands give nothing but pain.\u201d</p><p>He knew she could not be speaking of Tarley. The rapport between them had been evident to one and all. \u201cOf whom do you speak?\u201d</p><p>She moved. Gripping the rim of the tub, she rose from the water like Botticelli\u2019s Venus. Dripping wet and unashamedly bare. Her hands ran over her full breasts, then across her abdomen, her gaze following her own touch. When she lifted her head to look at him, his breath seized in his lungs. It was a siren\u2019s look she gave him. One full of heat and longing and hunger.</p><p>\u201cBy God,\u201d he said gruffly, aching. \u201cYou are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He was in a riot of lust, half mad with the need to spread her beneath him and sate the damned spurring longing that had haunted him far too long.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel as if I am.\u201d One slender leg lifted over the edge of the tub. The sinuous invitation in her movements wasn\u2019t lost on him. It seemed drink also roused her passions.</p><p>\u201cI can make you feel a great deal more.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples were a soft rose hue and luxuriously long. Puckered by the chill of air on wet skin, they begged for the attentions of his mouth and hands. He stroked his tongue deliberately along the curve of his bottom lip, teasing her visually with a physical enactment of the thoughts smoldering in his mind. He could please her to madness. Sex had been one of his trades, and he was damned good at it. If she but gave him the chance, he could ruin her for other men. He was determined to do so.</p><p>She did not fail to register his intent or to assess his condition; the color of her blush deepened. Looking at her towel and robe, she seemed to consider whether or not she wanted to retrieve them.</p><p>If he could, he would help her with that, if only to restore some semblance of his sanity by covering her. But he couldn\u2019t move. His body was not his own. Every muscle was tense and straining, while his cock hung heavily between his thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou see how much I want you,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cYou have no shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be ashamed if I didn\u2019t desire you. I wouldn\u2019t be a man.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile curved her lips as she reached for the folded towel. \u201cPerhaps it was inevitable, then, that I should want you as well. Every other woman is susceptible. It would be curious if I was not.\u201d</p><p>His smile came with a host of wicked intentions. \u201cThen the only question remaining is: what will you do about it?\u201d</p><p>Jess paused with her fingers curled into the towel. It was madness that she should be standing before Alistair Caulfield without a stitch on. She did not recognize herself or the way she felt\u2014uninhibited, greedy, empty.</p><p>What would she do about it? It was a sign of her ignorance that she hadn\u2019t considered doing anything at all. However, faced with the choice of taking action or not, she realized she had power. She hadn\u2019t thought of her fascination with Alistair in terms of balance of power at all. She had, in fact, felt quite powerless.</p><p>She released the towel and faced him. \u201cIf I wanted you to touch me, where would you begin?\u201d</p><p>He set the bottle on the table and sat up with what appeared to be some discomfort. She could imagine why, considering the size of the erection so prominently tenting his smalls and breeches. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said in the rich deep voice she was enamored with. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wavered, her first steps not quite steady. Whether that was from the wine or her own nervousness, she couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>He was impossibly handsome. Irresistibly so. He lounged in the insubstantial chair like a sleek panther, all restrained power and suppressed violence. The muscles of his thighs were clearly defined, reminding her of his strength, which had always captivated her. It was all too easy to imagine how his body would work on a woman\u2019s ... on hers ...</p><p>A shiver moved through her as she remembered the sight of his strong hands gripping the gazebo post.</p><p>\u201cI can warm you,\u201d he murmured, reaching out to her. He heated her simply by looking at her. \u201cI fear you are too much for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>With her eyes on the bulge in his breeches, she answered, \u201cIn every way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllow me to prove you wrong.\u201d He beckoned her with a rather arrogant crook of his finger.</p><p>She looked at her glass, wishing it wasn\u2019t empty.</p><p>\u201cI have the bottle here,\u201d he reminded. \u201cBring your glass and I will pour what remains of it.\u201d</p> <p>She decided to forgo the wine but take everything else on offer. It was a conclusion hastily reached, and she rushed to him before her mind could be altered by sobriety or common sense. Knowing he could make her forget everything but him, she hurried to feel his hands on her and lost her footing on the polished wood sole. Her wet heel slipped, sending her into an ignoble tumble.</p><p>He stood so swiftly to catch her, she barely registered his movement. All she knew was one moment the sole was racing up to meet her, and the next she was flattened against Alistair\u2019s large, hard body.</p><p>\u201cFortunate that you left the glass behind,\u201d he teased, but his voice was whisky-rough. His blue eyes were dark as sapphires.</p><p>For a moment, Jess was at a loss for what to do. Her mind was too engaged by the feel of his body against hers and the smell of his skin.</p><p>He sat and draped her over him. \u201cDamned if you haven\u2019t made me weak in the knees.\u201d</p><p>At eye level with him, she was riveted by the fierceness of his gaze. For lack of something wittier, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve made you all wet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my turn to perform a like service for you.\u201d</p><p>The licentiousness of his reply made her laugh.</p><p>One dark, winged brow rose. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wise. It could have been painful had you not been so agile.\u201d Thoughts of his agility had a now predictable effect.</p><p>\u201cNot the fall,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cThe giggle.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cI think not. I do not giggle on command.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s fingers fluttered along her rib cage. Tickled, she writhed and laughed.</p><p>He quit as quickly as he\u2019d begun. \u201cNo more of that. Any further wriggling on your part will take this farther than I intend while you\u2019re impaired.\u201d</p> <p>She realized his erection was pressing rather insistently against her thigh. The understanding that she\u2019d been rubbing against that part of his anatomy made the blood rush to her head, which increased her intoxication.</p><p>\u201cWe are being very naughty,\u201d she pronounced.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly naughty enough, but I intend to address that. Hold tight.\u201d He pushed to his feet and crossed to the bed. Setting her down on the edge of the mattress, he urged her to lie back, then sprawled beside her with his head propped in his hand.</p><p>The change in position affected her immediately, thickening her blood and slowing her ability to reason. She felt more naked on the bed than she had while standing. Her arms crossed her breasts.</p><p>His smile was warm and very amused. He stroked a finger across the back of her forearm, sending tingles racing through her body. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather touch me, than yourself?\u201d</p><p>The thought was extremely tempting. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere you like.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling audibly, she lifted one hand to cup his cheek. His skin was whisker-coarse due to the hour. She liked it. A sweet warmth moved through her before she realized what she was doing.</p><p>His smile faded, and he grew very tense. Alarmingly so.</p><p>She pulled away abruptly. \u201cClearly I do not know how to conduct an affair properly.\u201d</p><p>After a sharply drawn breath, he pulled her hand back to where it had been. \u201cAffairs are meant to be improper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not romantic,\u201d she argued. \u201cI will endeavor to touch you with only consummation in mind.\u201d</p><p>Alistair rolled to his back and laughed. He continued to laugh until she took his former position by lying on her side. His amusement was catching; she stared down at him with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou succeeded beautifully,\u201d he said finally, his eyes still crinkled at the corners. \u201cThat is singularly the most unromantic utterance I have ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Jess felt silly, but accepted for her silliness. It was lovely being encouraged to be herself.</p><p>He reached up and cupped her cheek as she\u2019d done to him. The tenderness behind the gesture was a surprise delight.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too, when you did the same to me. Why don\u2019t we agree to do whatever feels natural to each of us?\u201d</p><p>Lowering her head, she licked her lips and moved to kiss him. She saw the understanding of what she was about move through his eyes. Once again, he grew very still. Expectant. Watchful. He gave her the lead in the approach, but when their lips connected, he took over. Snaring her nape with his hand, he adjusted the fit of her mouth, his lips opening under hers with barely tempered hunger.</p><p>Jess gasped as she fell into him, the lone support of her arm giving way. His lips were firm, but soft; his skill evident, but restrained. Where Tarley\u2019s kisses had been reverent, Alistair\u2019s were laced with sheer carnality. There was a wicked decadence to the way he tasted her. The approving groans, bouts of sudden fervency followed by savoring licks, and the gentle movements of his lips made her mad for a deeper connection.</p><p>Canting her head, she tried to take what she wanted. Surprisingly, he allowed her to. His touch at the back of her neck did not restrain her. It kneaded, as if he couldn\u2019t help but touch and was restraining himself to an innocuous part of her anatomy.</p><p>As if she would or could protest a roving exploration.</p><p>She turned her head to gulp down much needed air. The tender pressure of his fingertips spread outward from that one relatively innocent place, creating the phantom feel of his fingers running down her spine and between her legs. \u201cAlistair ...\u201d</p><p>His given name slipped from her lips with remarkable, breathless ease. He reacted to it abruptly, rolling until she was once again on her back and he loomed over her. As he took her mouth, his hand ran down the length of her torso, stroking along her waist and coming to rest at her hip. He gripped her hip bone with a clenching of his palm, nowhere near painful but more than enough to relay his fervency. That telltale grasp excited her, made her feel powerfully feminine and seductive.</p><p>Her hands lifted to his hair, pushing into the thick tresses, gripping the strands by the root and tugging\u2014a returning message to him that she was feeling equally passionate. The slow, deep thrusts of his tongue into her mouth so perfectly mimicked what she wished would happen between them that she grew slick and hot between her legs, the sensitive flesh of her sex swelling and throbbing.</p><p>She arched upward, pressing her aching breasts into the embroidered silk of his waistcoat. His grip on her hip tightened, pinning her down.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he crooned, caressing her as if gentling a skittish mare. \u201cI have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she breathed, feeling as if her body was no longer her own. \u201cNot enough.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s mouth moved to her jaw, then to her right ear. \u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His lips slid along her throat, sucking soft enough to be felt but not enough to mark her. The sweet greediness of his mouth on her skin burned across her nerve endings in delicious torment. Her fingers spasmed in his hair, her toes pointing as he kissed across her collarbone. He made her feel more intoxicated than the wine had, while also heightening her senses. It was the best and worst sort of madness.</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d he asked, his breath gusting over the pebbled tip of her breast. He watched her as his tongue flicked lightly over her nipple. Dark satisfaction burned in his gaze when she cried out and clung to his shoulders. The velvet of his coat was soft beneath her touch, reminding her that he was completely clothed while she was completely bare.</p><p>She found the dichotomy delicious. It made her feel wanton and unabashed, two descriptors that had never been applicable to her before. \u201cPlease touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where better than I!\u201d she cried, trying to tug his head to her breast, but unable to overcome his greater strength.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised in a low tone. \u201cI will know your body better than anyone ever has, better than you. But for now I am still learning. Tell me what you like and how you like it.\u201d</p><p>Arching her shoulders back, she lifted her nipple to his mouth in flagrant offering. \u201cThere. More.\u201d</p><p>Alistair bared his teeth in a look of such feral pleasure only a fool would call it a smile. He wrapped one hand around her breast and squeezed with just enough pressure to make her want more. \u201cWith my hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your mouth.\u201d It was the claret that gave her the courage to be so bold, and even with the added bravery, she closed her eyes against the overpowering feeling of vulnerability.</p><p>She felt the humid warmth of his exhale the second before his lips wrapped around her. The sound that left her was so raw and needy she could not believe she\u2019d made it. Then his tongue curled around her nipple and his cheeks hollowed on a drawing pull she felt all the way to her womb, and she no longer cared what desperate sounds she made.</p><p>Lifting her leg, she wrapped it around his boot-clad calf and moved sinuously beneath him. He\u2019d slid beneath her skin seven years ago, and he was finally relieving the itch he had left behind.</p><p>His talented mouth lifted from her, leaving her bereft.</p><p>\u201cLie still,\u201d he ordered gruffly. His face was flushed and his eyes bright, almost feverishly so.</p><p>Alistair was as lost to the lust as she was. Emboldened by his tenuous control, she offered a woman\u2019s knowing smile. \u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Alistair was riveted by the woman beneath him. She burned too hot to be the same icily reserved girl he used to follow with his gaze. Whether it was the claret or her passion for him, he didn\u2019t care. He was damned grateful. Still, if she continued to writhe against him, he wouldn\u2019t have the wherewithal to stop himself from fucking her raw, a step he would prefer to take when she was fully sober and in complete possession of her mental faculties.</p><p>\u201cMake you,\u201d he repeated finally, as her self-satisfied smile widened and she tested him again with another seductive wriggle. \u201cAnd how would you suggest I go about doing that?\u201d</p><p>The slight marring of a wrinkle between her brows ruined the image of worldly seductress. She had no idea, he suspected. He, however, had a delicious one in mind.</p><p>\u201cYou could exhaust me,\u201d she said finally, biting her lower lip. The gesture did not hide the avid manner in which she awaited his response.</p><p>Too much for her, she\u2019d said. He had a niggling suspicion that once she\u2019d lost all her reserve in bed, he might have a devil of a time keeping up. And God knew his appetite was ravenous when it came to her. The thought brought beads of perspiration to his forehead. How in hell was he going to walk out of this room with his cock as swollen as it was?</p><p>\u201cUntie my cravat,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cUmm ...\u201d she purred, clearly pleased with the notion of removing clothing from his person. Her hands went to the knot at his throat and began working as efficiently as her inebriated state allowed.</p><p>For his part, he was delighted that the thought of undressing him was such a pleasing one for her. He could not have chosen a better location to conduct their affair than Jamaica, where the humidity and heat lent themselves well to wearing as few clothes as possible.</p><p>When she pulled the length of linen from around his neck, he caught her wrist and grinned. Bending his head, he took her mouth, distracting her with a lush kiss. Her fervent response damn near distracted him as well, but he managed to turn her body to lie parallel on the mattress instead of perpendicular, and to secure the cravat to one of the headboard posts. Even when he caught her wrist and raised it above her head, she didn\u2019t struggle. Instead she groaned into his mouth and sucked on the tip of his tongue, jolting him so violently he felt a scorching drop of pre-ejaculate bead on the tip of his cock. She tasted of wine and lust and sin, and he wanted to drink her down. Every drop. Suspecting that even if he did, his thirst for her would go unquenched.</p><p>Only when the knot tightened around her slender wrist did reality return to her. She gasped and yanked her mouth away, her neck arching to see what he\u2019d done. Kneeling, he caught the other wrist and secured it before she could protest.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she cried, her gray eyes wide with excitement but tinged with wariness.</p><p>\u201cMade you lie still, as you challenged. You should know how I am in regard to challenges.\u201d</p><p>She spoke in a small voice. \u201cI am not certain I like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d By necessity, he\u2019d perfected the fine art of bestowing carnal pleasure. It had not been in his best interests to satisfy a woman to the extent that her interest in him was appeased; satiety alone would not have kept him afloat. No, what he\u2019d needed was to create an addiction to his touch and the bullish stamina of his cock. He had focused single-mindedly on pursuit of that knowledge, all the while telling himself that he was honing his skills for Jessica. That he was not ruined for her, but more valuable. It was an argument he did not fully believe, but he couldn\u2019t allow himself to think of the alternative\u2014that she might reject him for his past. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alistair renewed his attention to her breasts. He could swear he\u2019d never seen a more beautiful pair. They were the perfect size for her slender frame, emphasizing the petite curvature of her waist and balancing lusciously curved hips. What a travesty the latest styles were, with their high waists and straight, shapeless skirts. While he\u2019d imagined her having a magnificent bosom, the reality was a treasure found. It would take a great deal of time to become indifferent to such charms. He would have to do his best to extend her stay on the island. When she left him, he wanted to be certain he\u2019d had his fill of her. He could not return to having the damnable cravings that had plagued him the past several years.</p><p>He straddled her. Taking a moment to enjoy the view of her upthrust breasts and taut belly, he debated where to begin.</p><p>\u201cAlistair,\u201d she breathed, tugging at her bindings.</p><p>Brute that he was, he found that slight show of struggle profoundly arousing. Combined with the breathless way she said his name, he was sorely pressed to hold himself back for sobriety\u2019s sake. He reached down and adjusted the fit of his breeches over his cockstand.</p><p>Jessica stilled, eyes riveted to the movement of his hands. She licked her lower lip, and he wondered if she\u2019d ever taken a man in her mouth before. Today was not the day to progress to such bedsport, but one day ...</p><p>Made as comfortable as he could expect to be under the circumstances, Alistair decided to continue working his way down her torso. He set one hand on either side of her head and lowered his chest to hers. He slid his knees back so he was levered over her. His thighs pinned hers down, while the spread between them allowed his aching cock to be cradled between her closed shins.</p><p>He settled in to feast, his mouth seeking and embracing the nipple he hadn\u2019t yet had the pleasure of attending to. She hissed as he suckled, the tip of her breast puckering against his tongue. She was so sensitive, and very responsive. The sounds she made as he licked the tautened peak were a bawdy delight. For all the civility she displayed in public, in bed she was unrestrained in vocalizing her pleasure. The sounds she made, the low moans and sharp pants, became aphrodisiacs.</p><p>This was the woman he\u2019d seen in the Pennington woods. This was the lover he had dreamed of and hungered for until his gut ached.</p><p>Cupping her other breast in his hand, he kneaded the swollen flesh, relishing a surge of pure masculine satisfaction. Her body readily responded to his ministrations. He knew she had to be slick and hot between her legs, and he moved lower to see the evidence of her desire with his own eyes. He needed to taste it on his tongue and feel her tremble against his lips.</p><p>He licked into her navel, eliciting a shiver that racked her slender frame. She was ticklish, which he loved. He could make her laugh at will, and he was delighted. The sound was warm and throaty. Seductive. A bit rusty from lack of use, but he intended to rectify that. Her laughter came from the sensual woman inside her and not the chilly Lady Tarley who was the epitome of aristocratic hauteur.</p><p>Her belly quivered as he neared the patch of dark blond curls that shielded her sex.</p><p>Looking up, he met her gaze. \u201cYou like watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you like being watched. We have already established you are an exhibitionist.\u201d</p><p>Her prim and proper voice, tempered by panting, made him smile. \u201cOnly when you are the observer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will my memory linger with you, if I leave no imprint?\u201d</p><p>Alistair responded by sliding one thigh between hers, parting her legs. If she thought they would have only this one indiscretion, she was sorely mistaken. But he thought it best not to put it in quite those terms yet. \u201cYou may have your way with me another day.\u201d</p><p>Before she could reply, he lifted and draped one sleek thigh over his shoulder. Her sudden intake of breath increased his anticipation. Her eyes were half-lidded, her kiss-swollen lips parted, her chest heaving with rapid breaths. She lifted her hips to his mouth in bold provocation. The act was not new to her. Alistair both envied Tarley and admired him. The viscount had possessed everything a man could want\u2014he\u2019d retained respectability and popularity, embraced an unfashionably happy marriage, and enjoyed a satisfying sexual life with a socially esteemed wife many believed was above such base needs.</p><p>Alistair could offer her so little of what Tarley had had. Aside from coin and a head for business, there was nothing to recommend him beyond his passion for her and his skill in bed. And perhaps his lack of shame and willingness to treat her as an equal.</p><p>Jessica lifted her other leg and rested it on his shoulder. She arched one brow in silent challenge.</p><p>\u201cTemptress.\u201d He parted the plump folds of her sex and ground his hips into the bed, attempting to relieve the nearly unbearable throbbing of his neglected cock. \u201cYou are even perfect here.\u201d</p><p>Pointing his tongue, he traced the delicate folds and crevices before circling the distended tip of her clitoris. She was as wet as he\u2019d hoped, the silken skeins of her lust clinging to the petal-soft skin, her body\u2019s primitive plea for a hard cock to fill her.</p> <p>\u201cYes ...\u201d she breathed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Alistair fluttered his tongue over the clenching opening, groaning as her response became more frantic. Tilting his head, he licked into the tender, spasming tissues. Her thready moan enflamed him, urged him to a faster pace, until he was fucking her fiercely with his tongue. Ravenous, he ate at her, drinking in her taste and the sounds she made. She began to plea for him to finish her, then to threaten him with reprisal. He pushed farther, to the point where she began to promise him anything if only he would ease her torment.</p><p>There was a great deal he could do with such a promise.</p><p>He licked along her drenched slit, then pushed her over the edge with a lush, open-mouthed kiss to her clitoris. With parted lips and gentle suckling, he stroked over the bundle of nerves with the flat of his tongue. The first flutters of climax rippled through her, and at the height of her extremity he slid two fingers deep into the tightness of her too-long neglected body.</p><p>The headboard creaked as Jessica fought against her restraints, her delicate inner muscles tugging at his pumping fingers in time with the workings of his mouth. He tongued her mercilessly, giving no quarter, spurring her to another orgasm before the first had fully eased its grip. She screamed when she came again, her mouth pressed to her biceps to muffle the sound.</p><p>He growled as she shuddered, as hungry for her pleasure as he\u2019d ever been for his own. Pushing a third finger in with the others, he worked the tight flesh. The thought of how snugly she\u2019d hold his cock increased his frenzy. Raking the edge of his teeth lightly over the hard knot of nerves, he pushed her into another climax on the heels of the second. He kept at her until she came again, driving her hard and fast. Relentless in his need to own her desire completely.</p><p>\u201cNo more ...\u201d she pled hoarsely, shrinking away from his avid mouth. \u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>Alistair lifted his head with reluctance, his drenched fingers pulling free of her quivering flesh. Wiping his mouth on the inside of her thigh, he slid his shoulders out from under her lax legs and then his body straight off the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are\u2014\u201d she began as he stood.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay.\u201d He reached to free her wrists and retrieve his cravat. As the knots loosened and she pulled her arms down to her sides, he saw her wince and understood the cause. She\u2019d pulled tight against the bonds with every wrenching orgasm, stretching muscles unused to such abuse. He reached for her shoulders and massaged them, pressing gently but firmly into the sore muscles to alleviate their discomfort.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want ...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs was my intention.\u201d Dear God, it would kill him to walk out of the room with her begging for sex. But it would be far more torturous to face regret from her on the morrow. Cupping her nape, Alistair kissed her hard and quick. \u201cYou were magnificent.\u201d</p><p>She caught his wrist before he straightened. \u201cWhy must you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you unimpaired. I want no self-recrimination or faulty memory between us.\u201d He began to wind his cravat around his neck. \u201cAsk me again when you are temperate, and it will be my great pleasure to oblige you.\u201d</p><p>Jessica pushed up onto one elbow. \u201cIf you stay, I will pay you whatever you desire.\u201d</p><p>Alistair froze. A dousing with icy water could not have cooled his ardor faster. Worse, a sharp pain pierced his chest like a blade, twisting mercilessly until he staggered back from the bed to distance himself from his tormentor.</p><p>He spun away and tied his cravat with a hasty, sloppy knot. \u201cGood evening, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>It was only by the grace of God that no one was in the hallway as he fled the cabin.</p><p>It was after midnight when Michael vaulted down from his carriage in front of the impressive three-story, columned entrance to Remington\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club. He ascended the wide steps to the watered-glass double doors, which were held open by footmen liveried in black and silver. As he handed his hat and gloves to the waiting attendant, he noted the curricle-sized floral arrangement gracing a massive round table in the circular, domed foyer. Lucien Remington had long been acknowledged as a man of impeccable taste, and his establishment remained the most exclusive in England in part due to his willingness to continuously update the d\u00e9cor. Remington did not follow prevailing inclinations in design; he set the standard for them.</p><p>Directly ahead was the gaming area, which was the center of all business. From there, one could access the stairs to the fencing studio, as well as the many lovely courtesans and their private rooms. The lower floor accommodated boxing training and lessons. To the left was the bar and kitchen. To the right was Lucien Remington\u2019s office.</p><p>Michael crossed the black-and-white marble floor to the gaming area, then moved beyond that to the great room. The smell of leather and fragrant tobacco helped to settle nerves kept on edge since his visit with Hester the day before.</p><p>At least that was true until the Earl of Regmont caught his eye.</p><p>Seated in one of a half dozen wingbacks surrounding a low table, Regmont laughed at something said by Lord Westfield. Also in his circle were Lord Trenton, Lord Hammond, and Lord Spencer Faulkner. Since Michael was well acquainted with all but Regmont, he felt no qualms about taking the remaining open seat.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Tarley,\u201d Ridgely drawled while signaling for a footman. \u201cSeeking escape from all the debutantes eager for your new title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an increased appreciation for the toll the Season can take on an unwed peer.\u201d Michael ordered cognac from the waiting server, as did Regmont. The rest of the men at the table had half-full libations.</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d Westfield concurred, lifting his glass in toast.</p><p>\u201cBetter you than me,\u201d Lord Spencer said. As a second son, he enjoyed a less hunted existence; the other men at the table had wives.</p><p>Studying Regmont, Michael wondered why the man was out carousing with friends when he should be home making amends to Hester. It was difficult for Michael to restrain his tongue after witnessing her unhappiness. If she had been his, he would ensure nothing marred her existence.</p><p>The footman returned with two glasses of cognac. Regmont took an immediate drink, which brought Michael\u2019s attention to the hand the earl wrapped around the bulbous glass. The knuckles were swollen and bruised.</p><p>\u201cEngaged in fisticuffs lately, Regmont?\u201d he asked, before taking a drink himself.</p><p>To his knowledge, the earl was a genial fellow who was well liked by one and all. Lauded by women for his golden good looks, easy smile, and ready charm, Regmont made it very difficult for Michael to like him. The man seemed too blithesome, to the point of lacking any real substance. But perhaps that was what made him suit Hester, who\u2019d once been the merriest and most enchanting woman anywhere. She was still the latter and would always be to Michael\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cPugilism,\u201d Regmont replied. \u201cAn excellent sport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I enjoy it myself. Do you practice here at Remington\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften. If you\u2019re ever of a mind to practice together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Michael interjected, relishing the possibility of championing Hester, even if he was the only one who knew his motivation. From the sight of Regmont\u2019s knuckles, the man preferred training sans mufflers, which suited Michael perfectly in this instance. \u201cName the time and date, and I will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall require the betting book,\u201d Lord Spencer called out, deliberately drawing attention.</p><p>Regmont grinned. \u201cSpoiling for a fight, are you, Tarley? I\u2019ve had such days. I would be happy to oblige you now.\u201d</p><p>Michael sized the earl up. Regmont was shorter than he and lean, with sinewy musculature that lent well to the prevalent fashion of snug tailoring in breeches and coats. Michael had the advantage in height and arm reach. Settling more comfortably into the butter-soft leather, he said, \u201cI would prefer an early-afternoon bout. We\u2019ll enjoy ourselves more if we are both rested and free of drink.\u201d</p><p>The betting book was brought to the table, which lured an audience.</p><p>An unusual appearance of somberness possessed Regmont\u2019s features. \u201cExcellent point. This day next week, then? Three o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d An anticipatory smile curved Michael\u2019s lips. He reached for the betting book and placed a wager on Alistair\u2019s behalf with odds on himself.</p><p>It was just the sort of bet his friend would appreciate.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>Jessica awoke the next morning with what she likened to a megrim. The hard, insistent throbbing in her head and the horrid taste in her mouth made her ill. She fought nausea valiantly but lost. She was also highly aware of the tenderness between her legs. Memories from the day before made her blush, then cringe. How could she have been so undisciplined? And inflamed enough by Alistair\u2019s skillful hands and mouth to make a crude suggestion that led him to leave her bed in anger? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew the answer\u2014Alistair Caulfield had always had a unique effect on her. She was not herself with him; she was a woman she did not recognize. And it was difficult to determine whether or not the woman she became with him was one she wanted to be. How could it be appropriate when she felt so conflicted, embarrassed, and guilty?</p><p>Beth, as always, was a godsend. The abigail arranged for a pitcher of warmed water for washing and secured a plate of hard biscuits, which eased Jess\u2019s stomach malaise considerably. By evening, she felt well enough to eat more substantial fare and to face Alistair. Too familiar with a man\u2019s anger to seek him out alone, she chose to take the evening meal in the great cabin along with the other gentlemen. As the meal progressed and Alistair studiously avoided looking at or speaking to her whenever it was possible to do so, she felt she\u2019d made the best decision. However, the rift between them pained her.</p><p>But, perhaps, it was for the best. If she\u2019d soured his interest, she would be spared the turmoil that had plagued her since their reacquaintance. What he had asked of her\u2014to be her lover\u2014was so far outside the scope of her own acceptance of herself that she could hardly credit it. Yet clearly he was more than capable of piercing her defenses. The restraint she desired would have to originate with him. And although she regretted achieving the aim by wounding him, abstaining from further interaction was better for them both.</p><p>Jess excused herself as soon as was seemly. As the men rose to their feet, Alistair said, \u201cWould you grant me the honor of a walk around the deck, Lady Tarley? Perhaps the fresh air will revive you further?\u201d</p> <p>Nervous, she managed a small smile with her acceptance. They left the cabin along with the first mate, who vacated the passageway quickly, leaving them alone.</p><p>She paused beside her cabin door. \u201cLet me fetch a shawl.\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d He unfastened the row of buttons securing his tailcoat.</p><p>She protested, averting her gaze from a direct view of his chest. \u201cA gentleman is never seen in his shirtsleeves!\u201d</p><p>His answer was delivered in a biting tone. \u201cYou are the only individual on board who will take offense, Jessica, and after what transpired yesterday, I find any attempt at modesty tiresome.\u201d</p><p>Her heart tripped over the austerity of his features. He had the glint of the devil in his blue eyes and a determined set to his square jaw that warned her he would not be easily deterred. How intimate she was with that look of barely restrained temper! It never portended well. \u201cPerhaps we had best speak some other time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are issues that need airing. The sooner, the better.\u201d</p><p>Despite her misgivings, Jess obliged him and set off toward the companionway. A warm weight settled on her shoulders as he dropped his jacket neatly over her. Immediately the smell of him teased her senses, stronger now, with an underlying unique masculine scent. Alistair was a virile male, and her body stirred with vivid memories of the evening before.</p><p>They took the stairs up to the deck. Caulfield paused in a space unshadowed by the masts and rigging. With an impatient and imperious gesture, he waved away the two sailors who worked nearby.</p><p>He loomed over her in a manner that made her both aroused and wary. He was flagrantly handsome. His classical bone structure took well to the moonlight that bathed him in silver. He could have been an ancient heroic statue come to life except for the vitality charging the air around him. Alistair Caulfield was alive in a way Jessica had never been.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this,\u201d he growled, raking a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDance around the truth, pretend things are not what they are, and use formality as a shield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormality is indeed like dancing,\u201d she agreed softly. \u201cIt creates a known pattern of steps to follow that allow two disparate people to spend a length of time together with some purpose. It creates an avenue upon which strangers can travel together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not interested in dancing at the moment, or being strangers. Why did you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy. Why did you linger in the woods that night?\u201d</p><p>She clung to the lapels of his coat from the inside, holding the two halves tightly together. Not because it was cold, but because she felt too exposed. \u201cYou asked me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His mouth took on a cruel curve. \u201cWill you obey all my commands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you obey that one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she rejoined with lifted chin.</p><p>Alistair stalked closer. \u201cYou were innocent. You should have been horrified. You should have run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the elbows and lifted her up onto her tiptoes. \u201cHave you thought about that night since then? Did you ever think of it when lying with Tarley? Has the memory haunted you?\u201d</p><p>Jess was dismayed by how close to home he struck with his questions. \u201cWhy is it important?\u201d</p><p>One of his hands lifted and cupped her nape, angling her lips to a position suiting him. His words puffed hot and damp over her mouth. \u201cI remember every second you stood there. The rise and fall of your breasts as you panted. The feverish brightness of your eyes. The sight of your hand at your throat as if you forcibly held back begging little whimpers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are witnesses around us,\u201d she whispered furiously, trembling with fear and excitement. She was astonished to be responding amorously to his rough handling. She, of all people, should not find such attentions thrilling. It horrified her to think some part of her mind might have been trained to seek such treatment.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Torn by her confusion, she spoke harshly. \u201cYour brutish lack of charm may be sufficient for some women, but I assure you, I am not amused.\u201d</p><p>His hands fell away so quickly she stumbled. \u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s more than sufficient for you. You look as hungry for me now as you did then.\u201d</p><p>She winced. Something dark and tormented passed over his features; then he turned away with a smothered curse.</p><p>He spoke over his shoulder. \u201cI have attempted to forget that night, but it\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>Jess looked away from his rigid back, allowing the crisp misty breeze to blow over her face. \u201cWhy does the memory trouble you so? You have had my discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor which I have long been grateful.\u201d In the periphery of her vision, she saw him shove his hands into the pockets of his satin breeches. \u201cYou have avoided me in the years since. Why, if what transpired was of no importance to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know something of you I should not know. It made me uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made you uncomfortable,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI still do.\u201d</p><p>Whether consciously or no, a part of Jess recognized the feeling of being hunted. She sensed the turbulence of his desire and was frightened by it. Perhaps not so much because of his appetite, but because of her own.</p><p>Alistair rounded her, so that he stood before her and took up the whole of her vision. \u201cThe more you hold yourself aloof, the more determined I become to draw you out. Yes, you know something of me that exists only between us. We should be more accessible to one another because of that, not more distant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs accessible as I am now, engaging is such candid conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs accessible as you were last night, without the excessive drinking. Although it was not our intention to cross the threshold we did seven years ago, it has been crossed and there is no turning back. I asked you to stay and you did not run. We shared a moment uniquely separate from our lives before or since. You clutch social mores, propriety, and rules of conduct around you as you do the shawls you wear, but we are beyond such barriers. Fate has conspired to bring us together at this time, and I, for one, am weary of fighting against it.\u201d</p><p>The possibility that they were fated to be lovers was somehow comforting, as if taking the decision from her hands freed her from responsibility for the inevitable consequences. It was cowardly to view it that way, yet the thought also gave her courage.</p><p>She inhaled and spoke in a rush. \u201cI am sorry for what I said to you last night before you left. I-I wanted you to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI whored for money,\u201d he interrupted harshly. \u201cI need you to know why.\u201d</p><p>Once the words were out, Alistair felt a profound relief, swiftly followed by a high tension. Baring himself was something he avoided at all costs.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s head tilted to the side, causing one thick pale curl to glide over her shoulder. She fisted the lapels of his coat, and fine lines bracketed her lush lips. She\u2019d recently lost a husband she\u2019d cared for deeply, yet Alistair had pushed her to ignore that for his own selfish need of her. Even now, her pale gray gown spoke of lingering mourning. He deeply resented the reminder of a man whose pristine conduct and fine morals were aspects of character he could never compete with.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she coaxed. \u201cExplain so I may understand.\u201d</p><p>He spoke before he dissuaded himself from doing so. \u201cAt the urgings of my mother, Masterson granted me a parcel of land in Jamaica. The property was notable only for its insubstantial size and dearth of viable crop. It came with no slaves, no buildings, and no machinery. My mother also saw to it that his lordship provided a ship, and he was able to find the least seaworthy vessel I have ever had the misfortune of laying eyes on. I was faced with the possibility of being a man of means, but with no funds with which to purchase any of what was required to make a success of it.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled audibly. \u201cI cannot imagine facing such a daunting endeavor while knowing your livelihood rested on the outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never face it, thank God. But perhaps you can see how I was motivated to sell what skills I had at my disposal to earn the coin necessary to prosper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is how you came to be known as one who would accept any wager.\u201d</p><p>Alistair nodded. \u201cAny race, any odds. Anything pitting my talents against another\u2019s for gain. I am also fortunate enough to be attractive to women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossibly handsome,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut you were so young then ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet old enough to know I couldn\u2019t afford to have ideals,\u201d he finished tightly. It was not a decision he lingered over. If ruthlessness was required to survive, he had no qualms about doing whatever was necessary. \u201cAnd in some respects, my youth was an advantage. I was randy, energetic, and far from discerning.\u201d</p><p>The last was said with more defiance than he would have chosen to share, but he was on edge, his stomach knotted with the concern that she might find his past insurmountable. \u201cI enjoyed it in the beginning. All the sex I could manage, which was considerable, with women who were worldly and confident in their pleasures. The first time I was offered an expensive gift, it was a surprise. I realize now that for some it was a way to assuage their guilt over fucking a man less than half their age, but at the time I saw it as a game; what could I wheedle out of them in return for doing something I was enjoying immensely? I was also learning astonishing secrets about women\u2019s bodies\u2014how to read them and listen to them, how to drive them wild. There is an art to bestowing pleasure, and I realized I could master it, similar to any other skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were clearly an adept pupil,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWomen talk a lot,\u201d he pressed on grimly, unable to determine how she was responding to his brutally frank revelations. \u201cEspecially about things they enjoy. As with anything, the more demand there is for an object, the higher the price that can be set for it. I realized how I could profit and recognized that I\u2019d be foolish to turn away any avenue of income, considering what my circumstances were. And after a while, it ceases to matter how you feel about the business. You learn to master your body regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d It took Jessica an interminably long time to say more. Finally, she said, \u201cI\u2019m an idiot. It never occurred to me that you might not ... appreciate the act. After all, Lady Trent is quite lovely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them were; some weren\u2019t. Some were lovely only on the outside. Regardless, when you sell something, it no longer belongs to you. You lose any right to refuse or deny anything, and if you want referrals and repeat business you dare not be too difficult or unaccommodating. Once I understood that I\u2019d become a commodity to be used as required, whatever enjoyment I\u2019d found previously was lost to me. It became a chore like any other, albeit a lucrative one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your family? Couldn\u2019t they have\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took the blasted ship and land given to me. My pride was not enough to impede my acceptance of those. Believe me, if I could have turned to anyone for assistance, I would have.\u201d</p><p>Alistair waited for her to ask why he was unable to turn to Masterson, and wondered how he could reply when she did. Already she knew more of his sordid past than he would ever wish to share with anyone. To share it with Jessica\u2014the one person who appealed to him in a manner that was more than skin deep\u2014was torturous. He wanted to be the man she desired above all others, yet he was so far below the heights to which she should aspire.</p><p>\u201cThen, you did what had to be done,\u201d Jessica said with a conviction that surprised him. \u201cI can appreciate the need to become whatever is required to survive untenable circumstances.\u201d</p><p>How easily she dismissed his disclosure. He could hardly credit it.</p><p>He stepped closer, unable to bear the slight distance between them. \u201cWould you have me still? Can you look beyond it? As much as I wish it were otherwise, my touch will sully you. But it will also pleasure you. Worship you. I want nothing so much as I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept you, Alistair. I do.\u201d Jessica inhaled a shaky breath. \u201cBut the rest ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he ordered gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI am no better than the others who\u2019ve used you for their own pleasure.\u201d Her eyes were big and dark, her lovely features betraying an inner torment. \u201cI wanted the right to command you, as Lady Trent did, not for reasons of safety but because it excites me to think of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The blood rushed to his cock so swiftly, it altered the way he stood. Her honesty aroused him, as did the image of her seizing her own gratification through use of his body. \u201cJessica.\u201d</p><p>She moved suddenly, skirting him and moving to the gunwale where one hand curled around the polished wood with white-knuckled force.</p><p>Alistair followed, crowding behind her and setting one hand on either side of her. Her spine was painfully straight, her body gripped by high tension. He lowered his head and pressed his lips to her right temple. Somehow, he had to make her see how her upset revealed deeper feelings for him. \u201cIs my subjugation what you want? Does the thought of coercing me to service you stir your blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He felt her swallow hard. \u201cI want you willing, but you overwhelm me. I need control\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think I have any? What there is between you and me has never been safe, nor will it ever be. You have to accept our attraction for what it is, with all its faults and detriments, trusting that it will be worth whatever the costs may be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>Turning in his arms, she looked up at him. \u201cForgive me for my thoughtlessness. I just wanted you to stay. So much so that I spoke without consideration.\u201d</p><p>He caught one glossy golden curl and rubbed it between his fingers. \u201cNever apologize for your desire for me. But let me be clear\u2014I come to you without affectation. You cannot have Lucius, not ever. That man no longer exists, and he never existed for you.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, he\u2019d told himself he used his second name to protect his identity. In truth, it was self-preservation and a way to distance himself from the degradation of accepting money to fuck women who wanted things from him they couldn\u2019t get elsewhere without risk of scandal and scorn. Though some had wanted him for his face and body, a great many had wanted something else entirely. They\u2019d wanted a lover known to take any bet ... any risk ... a man willing to do anything for coin. They felt less depraved knowing they\u2019d bought the right to be as debauched as they pleased.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Alistair pressed his forehead to hers, miserable at the thought of her wanting a side of him he couldn\u2019t bear to share with her. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had him, you know. That night, the moment I saw you, it was just you and me. Lucius serviced Lady Trent. I was with you.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled in a rush. \u201cGood. I don\u2019t want him. I realize now that in offering to pay you, I was asking for him. After you had been the one to ... touch me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Jessica\u2019s eyes were clear and open, filled with sadness and regret. Perhaps a tinge of pity, which was the last damned thing he wanted her to feel for him.</p><p>\u201cI will give you whatever you want. Freely. You have only to ask.\u201d Slipping his hand beneath the lapels of his coat, he cupped her hip. \u201cTell me the details of your imaginings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d The horror in her prim voice made him smile. \u201cIt\u2019s indecent.\u201d</p><p>He bent farther and licked the shell of her ear. \u201cTrust,\u201d he reminded as she shivered. \u201cI trusted you with a truth that could only reflect negatively upon me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fault you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means a great deal to me. Let me repay you. Tell me what you desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so familiar.\u201d She glanced around him at someone visible on the deck. \u201cThere is no privacy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come to you tonight?\u201d</p><p>Alistair waited forever for her reply, which didn\u2019t come. Instead she grew more and more restless, fidgeting with his coat and shifting on her slippered feet. Afraid to push her too far too soon yet again, he backed away from her.</p><p>\u201cMy cabin is two doors down from yours on the opposite side of the passageway,\u201d he offered instead. \u201cYou can come to me.\u201d</p> <p>She faced him with widened eyes. \u201cI could never.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. Perhaps not, but the anticipation would be its own reward.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>As she had every morning for the past fortnight, Hester awoke with the overwhelming need to cast up her accounts.</p><p>Rolling from her bed, she stumbled to the chamber pot and proceeded to do precisely that. The next hour until dawn was marred by more of the same.</p><p>\u201cMilady,\u201d her abigail murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve set out some weak tea and toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you tell his lordship you\u2019re with child,\u201d Sarah ventured softly, \u201che\u2019ll mend his ways.\u201d</p><p>Hester looked at the maid with tear-blurred eyes, her chest heaving from her exertions. \u201cTell no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you give me leave, milady, I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>Pressing a damp cloth to her forehead, Hester allowed her tears to flow unchecked. During the early years of her marriage, there was nothing she\u2019d desired more than a child to complete the joy she\u2019d found with Edward. But God was kinder than she knew by withholding His blessings. When the darker aspects of Edward\u2019s character became apparent, she\u2019d begun to use sponges soaked in brandy to prevent conception. She couldn\u2019t bring an innocent into her household the way it was now. After all that she and Jessica had endured as children, how could she possibly subject her own child to such a life?</p><p>But Regmont was not one to postpone his lusts until expected evening hours, and fate had its own designs.</p><p>\u201cIf only you were here, Jess,\u201d she whispered, selfishly longing for a sympathetic and knowing ear to listen to and advise her. She\u2019d suspected she was enceinte before her sister departed, but could find no way to share the news. Jessica was deeply pained by her barrenness. It was impossible for Hester to lament a pregnancy that would have brought her sister endless joy.</p><p>When Hester struggled to her feet, Sarah assisted her back to bed. Regmont slept on in his room, blessedly oblivious.</p><p>\u201cI pray you tell his lordship soon,\u201d the abigail whispered, arranging the pillows for Hester\u2019s comfort.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Hester heaved a sigh. \u201cI believe part of his affliction is me, and I don\u2019t know how to address that. Why else would the men in my life battle such demons?\u201d</p><p>But when she saw Edward at the dining table a few hours later, her husband looked far from afflicted. Indeed, he looked extremely fit. His smile was bright and his spirits high. He kissed her cheek when she moved to pass him en route to her chair.</p><p>\u201cKippers and eggs?\u201d he queried before walking over to the row of covered platters on the buffet.</p><p>Her stomach roiled. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t eat enough, darling,\u201d he admonished.</p><p>\u201cI took toast in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you join me for breakfast anyway.\u201d His smile was glorious. \u201cYou are too wonderful. How was your evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnexceptional, but enjoyable all the same.\u201d</p><p>She almost dreaded these moments of normalcy. The pretense that all was right in their world, that no malevolence lurked in the darkness, that he was a wonderful husband and she a contented wife. It was like staring at a box one knew would burst open at some point and not knowing if the surprise would be terrifying or not. There was agony in the waiting.</p><p>Her gaze strayed and moved around the room. Their home was lauded by friends for its bright cheery colors, such as the soft cream and bright blue vertical stripes she\u2019d used on the walls of the dining room. They\u2019d purchased the town house just before their wedding; it was to have been a fresh beginning for both of them, a place free of any taint of the past. But now she knew how futile that hope had been. The taint was on them ... in them, and they carried it with them wherever they went.</p><p>\u201cI shared a drink with Tarley last night,\u201d Regmont said between bites. \u201cHe was seeking refuge from the debutantes. The strain of being hunted is beginning to take its toll, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>Hester looked at him. The tempo of her heartbeat changed, increasing inexplicably. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember those days well. You saved me in more ways than you know, my love. I\u2019m providing assistance to Tarley via a release of tension. He learned of my interest in pugilism, and we\u2019ve agreed to a match.\u201d</p><p>Dear God. She knew well how swiftly Regmont could move and how relentless he could become. He couldn\u2019t tolerate losing; it exacerbated his already overwhelming feelings of insecurity. Her stomach knotted further. \u201cA match? Between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you happen to know how skilled he is in the sport?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe sparred with Alistair Caulfield in our youth. That\u2019s all I know of his interest. He and I were close once, but I\u2019ve seen little of him since you and I wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wager easily won, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you might suggest he consider a less learned opponent?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou fear for him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica thinks very highly of him,\u201d she prevaricated.</p><p>\u201cEveryone does, so I gather. No need for concern, love. It\u2019s all in good fun, I assure you.\u201d Glancing at one of the two footmen standing at the ready, he said, \u201cLady Regmont will take buttered toast and jam.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, resigning herself to eating whether she wanted to or not.</p><p>\u201cYou look pale this morn,\u201d he noted. \u201cDid you not sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d Hester reached for one of the day\u2019s papers that lay on the table by her elbow. She was thrown unaccountably out of sorts by the thought of Michael fighting Regmont, especially when his motivation might be aggravation over choosing a proper wife. In that respect, she could be of more assistance than her husband. There was very little she didn\u2019t know about the women of the ton, from the most established matrons to the newest debutantes. Perhaps he would accept her help.</p><p>It would do her heart much good to see him content with his lot. He certainly deserved happiness.</p><p>Regmont set his silverware atop his empty plate. \u201cI should very much enjoy squiring you about the Park this afternoon. Tell me you don\u2019t have other plans.\u201d</p><p>If she had, she knew to cancel them. When Edward wanted her time, he expected to have it. She was his wife, after all. His. Irrevocably owned until death parted them.</p><p>Looking up from her paper, she managed a smile. \u201cA lovely thought, my lord. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>There might come a moment this day when she could share the news that she was breeding. Outside in the sunshine, surrounded by the peers he so wished to impress, might be the perfect time and place to present the opportunity of a new beginning for them both.</p><p>She hoped so. Maybe there was a miracle in that as well\u2014sometimes, she still had hope. She couldn\u2019t afford not to have it. There was no other way out.</p><p>Miller knocked on Jess\u2019s cabin door shortly after one o\u2019clock with a request for her to join Alistair on the deck.</p><p>Trying to pay no mind to the nervousness brought on by uncertainty, she followed Miller up the companionway stairs and into the open air. Her last discussion with Alistair under moonlight had been fraught with tension. His invitation to visit his cabin had lingered in her mind for hours after they parted. It was not an offer she could act upon, and she believed he knew that, but it hung between them now like a gauntlet thrown at her feet. There was a part of her\u2014the part he incited into mischief\u2014urging her to indulge, but her greater nature overrode such abandon.</p><p>What did he wish to say to her? In a relatively short acquaintance, a multitude of searing intimacies had passed between them. She was now completely preoccupied by thoughts of him, in a way she\u2019d never been with anything or anyone else. Jess had difficulty understanding how he could so thoroughly engage her physically and then capture her mental faculties as well, but he had. Alistair had left it to her to decide what to do about it, while making it clear he would not desist. She doubted there was anything Alistair Caulfield wanted that he didn\u2019t eventually attain.</p><p>As they turned toward the stern, the salt air hit her back in a rush, awakening all her senses. Invigorated and anticipatory, she slowed at the sight of a large blanket spread across the deck, anchored at each corner by crates of cannonballs. It was covered with several pillows and a shallow basket brimming with food.</p><p>A picnic. At sea.</p><p>Alistair stood on the other side of the counterpane, waiting. He was perfectly dressed in buff slacks tucked into polished Hessians, tan-striped waistcoat, and brown tailcoat. His hair had been styled by the wind in a fashion resembling the way he looked after she ran her fingers through it.</p><p>As many women did, Jess thought him the handsomest man she\u2019d ever seen. Exotically so. Blatantly seductive. More than slightly dangerous.</p><p>Delicious. She wanted to strip him to the skin, to appreciate the full impact of his powerful form without the impediment of clothing. She couldn\u2019t resist such thoughts now, with their desire for one another bared so openly between them.</p><p>It was impressive to see him on the deck of such a fine ship, surrounded by men who worked for him. She could scarcely recall the scapegrace who\u2019d accepted every wager and lived on the fine edge of a hazardous margin. But she knew he was there beneath the flawless surface. Tempting her with wicked promises she knew he\u2019d keep.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d he greeted her, bowing.</p><p>\u201cMr. Caulfield.\u201d She looked around the deck, noting how the dozen or more men about them kept their gazes carefully averted.</p><p>He gestured for her to sit, and she sank to her knees. He joined her, then dug into the basket, withdrawing a loaf of bread he tore in half. That was followed by a hunk of dry cheese and a quartered pear. He collected her portion in a large napkin and passed it over.</p><p>She accepted with a smile. \u201cAn impressive offering for ship\u2019s fare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon enough, you will pine for variety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome might consider a picnic on a ship\u2019s deck to be a form of courtship,\u201d she pointed out, deliberately using a teasing tone. \u201cIt could certainly be considered romantic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy aim is to please.\u201d He flashed his infamous smile, and a tingle moved through her. How easily he charmed women when he wanted to, while keeping his tone so light as to take any intensity from his words. She couldn\u2019t decide if the practiced, noncommittal discourse was meant to soothe her nerves, or make her long for his usual fervency.</p><p>He ripped off a bite of bread with his perfect white teeth and somehow made the act of chewing arousing, too. And he seemed not to do it on purpose, which was in keeping with her belief that sensuality was simply innate to him.</p><p>Taking a small bite of the cheese, she looked out at the endless expanse of ocean. The sun sparkled off the water, and although the day was a cool one, she thought it quite lovely. All the anxiousness she\u2019d previously felt around Alistair had altered into a different sort of awareness, one she savored for how alive it made her feel.</p><p>She\u2019d been raised to maintain a certain distance between herself and others. That space had been easily established through her speech and deportment, and most men were swiftly discouraged by lack of progress. Alistair, however, was challenged by her demeanor. He would not allow her to withdraw, which forced her to acknowledge that she didn\u2019t really wish to. She wanted to be right where she was\u2014on an adventure with an infamously wicked man.</p> <p>And then there were the memories of what he\u2019d done to her body. She\u2019d shared similar intimacies with Tarley, and had had no difficulty facing him over a breakfast table in the morning. With Alistair, she found herself flushing often and without warning, her body heating and softening in welcome just from his proximity. Somehow, his touch seemed more intimate to her than even her own husband\u2019s. How was that possible?</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep well last night?\u201d he asked, drawing her attention back to him.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d He stretched out along his side with his head propped in the palm of his hand. He watched her with those brilliant blue eyes that saw too much. Those windows to the soul aged him, revealing a darkness that shouldn\u2019t be there in one still young. \u201cTell me what happened the other day when you fled from the helm. What were you running from? Me?\u201d</p><p>Jess shrugged awkwardly. \u201cThere was so much noise and activity. I felt ... off balance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes the lack of hearing in your left ear contribute to that sensation?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with raised brows. In hindsight, she realized he always whispered in her right ear. \u201cYou noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael told me.\u201d His eyes were kind.</p><p>It was a topic she would never discuss. She was so violently opposed to even the notion of such a discussion that she resorted to speaking about other topics she wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. \u201cI was not running from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarley has been gone only a year.\u201d</p> <p>The arch of his brow mocked her. \u201cAnd you honor his memory with chastity? For how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly twelve months, apparently,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou are ashamed of your desire for me. That won\u2019t sway me.\u201d</p><p>Ashamed. Was that the right word? It wasn\u2019t shame she felt. Confusion was more apt. She had been raised to live in a particular world under particular rules. An affair with Alistair moved her into an entirely new realm. Remembering his dance analogy, she would say she didn\u2019t know the proper steps and so was stumbling around. She\u2019d been rigorously trained against stumbles and missteps, and found it extraordinarily difficult to forsake those hard-taught lessons.</p><p>\u201cAn affair isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d she began, \u201cto enjoy sex. It\u2019s certainly possible and respectable\u2014albeit unfashionable\u2014to find pleasure in the marital bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting we marry?\u201d His tone was dangerously low and sharply edged.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She winced at the rushed manner with which she\u2019d replied. \u201cI shan\u2019t be marrying again. To anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You enjoyed your first marriage.\u201d Alistair reached for a pear.</p> <p>\u201cTarley and I had a rare affinity. He knew what I needed, and I knew what he expected. We were able to blend the two into a harmonious arrangement. It\u2019s highly doubtful I\u2019d be as fortunate again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting expectations is important to you.\u201d</p><p>Jess met his gaze. As always, there was something in the way he looked at her that challenged her to be more than who she knew herself to be. Challenged her to speak aloud the thoughts she rarely contemplated even in private. \u201cWhen expectations are met, there is harmony.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s head tilted, considering. \u201cTo value harmony, one has to know disharmony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we speak of something else?\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, then, \u201cWhatever you like.\u201d She nibbled at her bread for a few moments, gathering her thoughts. Why did it always seem as if he could see into her? It was unfair when he was a mystery. \u201cWas it your choice to pursue the path of enterprise you follow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said your father acquired the plantation and ship for you. I wondered if you requested those things, or if you simply made do with the avenue Masterson provided.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his hand. \u201cI wanted nothing from Masterson, but accepting his largesse meant a great deal to my mother. I suggested sugarcane because I knew it would be profitable and that the distance inherent in the cultivation would be appealing to Masterson. I\u2019ve been a source of displeasure for many years.\u201d</p><p>Jess remembered saying something similar to Hester long ago, and felt remorse for the cruel thought. She\u2019d prejudged him by assuming he had no ambition or mind for business. She had dismissed him because of the order of his birth. Also, because she\u2019d bristled at Hester\u2019s admiration. She could admit that now. Although Hester\u2019s praise had been offhand and merely conversational, it had roused envy in Jess and territorial feelings.</p><p>\u201cSome fathers mean well when they express affection in harsh ways,\u201d she offered. \u201cTheir methods may leave much to be desired, but the intent is laudable.\u201d She didn\u2019t credit such lofty ambitions to her own pater, but that did not signify.</p><p>\u201cBy what basis would you know?\u201d he challenged softly. \u201cYou have always been perfect. I have always been far from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfection, if that\u2019s what you choose to call it, isn\u2019t effortless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it seem so.\u201d He held up a hand when she would have demurred. \u201cMasterson\u2019s affection is for my mother. She is the sole reason he showed any generosity. I am grateful for that and even for the least of what he did for me on her behalf. For all the ill will between us, his love for her earns my appreciation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is there ill will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you share your secrets, I will share mine.\u201d Alistair\u2019s smile was devastating and soothed the sting of his refusal. \u201cYou are a very mysterious woman, Jessica. I would be best served by keeping you equally intrigued with me.\u201d</p><p>Jess chewed thoughtfully. His belief in her extraordinariness made her wish she was as remarkable as he saw her to be. Her tutelage had been so strict, and any deviation so strenuously punished, that she\u2019d been certain anything noteworthy about herself had withered and died.</p><p>But Alistair made her wonder if she was wrong. He made her wonder what it would be like to be the sort of woman who was equal to a man as fascinating as he was to her. A man who was so darkly sensual and flamboyantly handsome that women paid for the privilege of possessing him, if only briefly.</p><p>Her imagination ran away with the idea, inventing a past interesting enough to make her notable.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could tell you about my time in captivity with the maharaja ...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d A very wicked gleam brightened his gaze. \u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Alistair\u2019s fascination with Jessica deepened with every day that passed, and he feared this afternoon\u2019s picnic might seal his fate. What would her fictional tale reveal about her? The mere fact that she\u2019d conceived of the idea to begin with told him a great deal\u2014she could be imaginative, adventurous, playful ...</p><p>But he\u2019d known she had hidden facets. He had seen a glimpse of this other side. More than anything else, it was that affinity\u2014that recognition of another soul who retreated behind an affected guise to survive\u2014which drew him to her. He could hardly wait for the day when she knew herself better. What a formidable woman she would become when she accepted and exploited her many hidden charms.</p><p>Her head turned, shielding her face from his gaze. \u201cI was traveling with a Bedouin tribe. We were transporting salt slabs on camelback when our party was raided by a rival tribe.\u201d</p><p>Such an exotic setting for a woman best known for being a proper English lady. And a damsel in distress? He loved the story already. \u201cWhat were you doing in the Sahara to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaping the winter chill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you frightened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first. I had no notion of what they would do with a female in such a hostile place. I was taken to an oasis and the tent of the sheik.\u201d</p><p>A captive. The tale grew spicier by the moment. \u201cWere you bound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was a betraying hitch in her voice. \u201cMy wrists were.\u201d</p><p>He relished an inner smile. As much as she professed a desire to command him in sexual matters, it appeared she might also carry a desire to be commanded. It was a highly provocative thought. \u201cWhat was the sheik like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was younger than I expected. Attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d</p><p>Jessica glanced at him with a mysterious smile. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d he murmured, pleased to know he\u2019d been included in her whimsical tale. It might also be telling that Tarley was not, but he would have to hear more to be certain. Perhaps her impeccable husband would be the hero, rescuing her from the clutches of the lascivious sheik. \u201cWhat did he say when he saw you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the one who abducted me. Tossed me over his horse and took me away from everything I knew.\u201d</p><p>The parallels to reality seemed quite prominent to him\u2014stretches of sand or endless ocean. Alistair rolled to his back. He tucked a pillow behind his head and stared up at the clear blue sky.</p><p>\u201cThere was food and flasks of wine,\u201d she went on. \u201cThe ground was covered by rugs that were littered with pillows. He asked me to join him in sprawling there. Much like what you and I are doing now. He removed the bindings on my hands, but I was still very wary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? He sounds like an agreeable fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stole me!\u201d she protested with amusement in her voice.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t blame him for running off with you. It isn\u2019t every day a man finds such treasure in a barren landscape.\u201d He could draw parallels as well.</p><p>\u201cSo a man should just take what he wants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf no one is hurt by it, why not?\u201d</p><p>Jessica laughed, and he loved the sound. \u201cYou, sir, are incorrigible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs often as possible,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cThe sheik was, too, I\u2019m afraid. I found him quite charming, but obstinate. Despite the number of times I warned him that I occupied a more rigid world than he knew and it would eventually intrude, he remained unconcerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like him already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you would.\u201d Jessica took a moment to eat.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a horrible person to tell stories to,\u201d she complained. \u201cYou won\u2019t allow me to reveal the details in my own time. Fortunately for me, the sheik was better behaved than you in that regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat details were you telling him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou persist after I point out the error of your ways?\u201d</p><p>Alistair looked at her and found her studying him. Not his face, but the rest of him, which he quite enjoyed. \u201cPersistence is a virtue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s \u2018patience.\u2019 Regardless, I wasn\u2019t telling him details. I told him stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo distract him from his amorous interests? Like Scheherazade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fashion.\u201d She looked down at her fingers, which were presently picking at her bread. \u201cWhat else would we discuss? Drawing room etiquette or the stratagems of chess? Such things would swiftly bore a man of adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain anything you said would have been of interest to him,\u201d he rejoined. \u201cWhether or not you said anything at all, he still would have had a splendid time just looking at you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. \u201cFlattery comes easily to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel free to practice your flattery skills on me at any time. Although I can\u2019t vouch for my ability to remain decorous if you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sorts of things do you prefer to be admired for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, so long as the admiration is sincere.\u201d He took another bite of the pear and knew there was no place else he\u2019d rather be, which brought him an unusual sort of calm. For as long as he could remember, Alistair had felt pulled in many directions simultaneously. Ever on the lookout for possibilities and new avenues of income. Failure to be successful had never been an option.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s lips pursed in thought. \u201cI would like to be admired for something I\u2019m actually responsible for. It has yet to happen, but I hope to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I take credit for my appearance? My parents are responsible for that. How can I take credit for my deportment, when I could not carry myself differently if I wanted to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no choice as a child, and now it is so ingrained I cannot imagine acting otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choice,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWe always have a choice\u2014to do what others want us to do or to do what we want to do.\u201d</p><p>Her gray eyes were somber when she looked at him. \u201cThat depends on the consequences.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alistair weighed her change in mood, knowing the waters of this particular topic were far from shallow. He also knew she wasn\u2019t yet willing to let him swim in them. Still, he couldn\u2019t resist an attempt.</p><p>\u201cI had a friend at Eaton,\u201d he began, \u201cwho was probably the most intelligent fellow I\u2019ve ever come across. Not so much with his studies, but he was observant and quick to think. However, whenever I complimented him on his rare ability to scan for advantages and make swift use of them, he hurried to dissuade me. He lacked confidence, yet I couldn\u2019t collect why. Later, when I met certain members of his family, it became clear that his sort of mental acuity wasn\u2019t appreciated, which undermined Barton\u2019s personal esteem. His parents wanted to see high marks for his school work; everything else was useless in their opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sympathize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can, as there are similarities between you. Like Barton, you also make great effort to dissuade me from my high opinion of you. But you do not lack confidence, as he did. You aren\u2019t undermined by your peers, as he was. In your case, you don\u2019t value the traits in yourself that inspire admiration in others. Now you suggest it\u2019s because you acquired those traits under some type of duress. From what quarter? Your mother? Competition with your sibling?\u201d</p> <p>The look Jessica shot him was full of exasperation. \u201cAre you always so curious? If so, is this level of interest applicable to everyone? Or only to women you wish to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are as prickly as a porcupine, and equally hard to grasp. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love a challenge,\u201d she corrected. \u201cIf I were pursuing you, you would feel different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me,\u201d he said, meeting her gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s put it to the test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother challenge. Or a wager. Irresistible to you.\u201d She popped the last remaining bit of bread into her mouth, then set to work arranging pillows to her liking. When she leaned slightly against them, using her elbow as a prop, he found the view quite charming. Relaxed elegance and artless beauty.</p> <p>Choosing not to argue about the root of his interest, Alistair returned to an earlier point in the conversation. \u201cSo how will you distinguish yourself in the future? What plan do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I will manage Calypso well.\u201d She bit carefully into a pear slice. \u201cI hope to prove myself worthy of the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing for you to do. Tarley has an excellent foreman and a competent steward, as well as a superior agreement for the transport of goods, if I say so myself. The wheels are well greased and they turn without need for you to exert any effort.\u201d</p><p>When a shadow passed over Jessica\u2019s features, he realized his error. The truth of it was, he was alarmed by the prospect of her having no need for him, which might be the case if she wasn\u2019t hunting for a buyer. But that wasn\u2019t reason to dash her hopes. She wanted to tackle and conquer a task of heretofore untried scale. Regardless of how that impacted his access to her, he should support such a brave endeavor. Lord knew he admired it.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t to say adjustments cannot be made,\u201d he corrected quickly. \u201cThere is always room for improvement.\u201d</p><p>The look she gave him was both grateful and knowing. Though new to the game of seduction and sexual conquest, she was yet aware that he was making concessions to woo her. \u201cI hope so. At the very least, I should like to keep it running smoothly.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cNothing intriguing about you, you say.\u201d</p><p>Jessica looked down at her hand and the large sapphire gracing it. \u201cMaybe a little something,\u201d she conceded. \u201cAt least in your view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other view matters.\u201d He would have selected a ruby for her. Red would suit the inner fire she kept carefully banked.</p><p>\u201cCan you ... will you, help me?\u201d She looked up, her eyes veiled beneath thick lashes. \u201cYou started with nothing. I would expect you know everything there is to know about growing and selling sugarcane.\u201d</p><p>The surge of relieved triumph he felt was accompanied by a softer, warmer emotion. \u201cAbsolutely. Once you gain your bearings and feel settled enough, I can expand your knowledge. I wouldn\u2019t want to intrude too soon, but if you ever have any questions or difficulties, I would be honored to assist you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They ate in companionable silence for a time. While Alistair was content just to share a meal and a lovely day with Jessica, he noted that the set of her shoulders relaxed the longer he held his tongue. Which led him to wonder just how deeply she allowed people to know her. She evaded more questions than she answered. Altogether, it was clear that her upbringing had known moments of harshness, with \u201cconsequences\u201d grave enough to mold her into a skin she did not wear comfortably.</p><p>He looked again at the sapphire wedding ring on her slender hand and wondered how well Tarley had known her. Most peerage marriages were shallow associations based on the mutual understanding that disruptive discussions would not take place. It was not unusual for spouses to touch upon only brief highlights of their separate daily schedules and delve not at all beneath the surface to discover how each other felt about any particular event or acquaintance.</p> <p>Was there anyone in Jessica\u2019s life who shared her confidence?</p><p>\u201cYou had a dog,\u201d he remembered. \u201cIt was always with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTemperance,\u201d she said with a note of wistfulness. \u201cShe passed away a few years ago. I miss her terribly. There are times when my skirts will brush my ankles in a certain way, and for a moment I forget and think it might be her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had an animal you were attached to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother Aaron had a beagle I liked well enough. Albert had a mastiff that drooled a lake every hour. And Andrew had a terrier named Lawrence who was indeed a terror, which made us fast friends. Alas, by the time Lawrence was done ruining the furniture and rugs, Masterson had decreed there would be no more animals in our household. My poor luck to be the youngest and last in line.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was soft. \u201cI suspect you\u2019d spoil a pet.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to spoil her, lavish her with gifts, drape her nude body in jewels ...</p><p>Clearing his throat, he said, \u201cDoes Lady Regmont also have a fondness for animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHester has always been too busy to dedicate time to a pet. It is the rare day when she does not have a full schedule.\u201d</p><p>Alistair recalled how vivacious Hester had been during his long-ago acquaintance with her. \u201cMichael was quite enamored of that quality in her. He, too, enjoys the companionship of many people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone loves Hester.\u201d A breeze pushed a thick blond curl across her cheek, and she brushed it back. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael had eyes for no one else when she was in the same room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can be the brightest light in any company.\u201d</p><p>He caught the wistfulness in her words. \u201cYou miss her.\u201d</p><p>Jessica sighed. \u201cIn many ways. She\u2019s altered a great deal in the last year. I am ashamed to say I don\u2019t know if the change was gradual or sudden. After Tarley became ill, I had little time to visit with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAltered in what way?\u201d</p><p>She lifted one shoulder in a helpless shrug. \u201cI fear she might be ill. She has become quite thin and is often pale. There are times when there is a pinching around her eyes and mouth, as if she might be in pain. But when I\u2019ve begged her to call for the doctor, she insists nothing is amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anything is wrong, I am certain Michael will see to it in your absence. You can rest easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith everything demanding his attention, I doubt he has time to see to himself. Dear man. He needs a wife to ease some of his burdens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister still has the ability to garner the whole of his attention, which is why, I believe, he hasn\u2019t wed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAre you saying Michael has a tendre for Hester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas for years,\u201d Alistair said dryly. He knew well how consuming such an obsession could be.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI can\u2019t credit it. He\u2019s never shown any signs of affection greater than friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have paid strict attention to be certain?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, then smiled sheepishly. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither does Lady Regmont, which was the bulk of his problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did mention him once, when listing desirable qualities to be found in her future spouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? What did she say? Perhaps it might offer him comfort to know she finds him appealing in some regard. Then again, perhaps it would be torturous since there\u2019s nothing to be done about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe appreciated his congeniality, I believe.\u201d Jessica\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cHowever, you possess the appearance she most admired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlattering. Did you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose.</p><p>\u201cIn a fashion,\u201d she qualified. \u201cI told her you were too young for me to assess in that manner.\u201d</p><p>Alistair clapped a hand over his heart. \u201cHo! The fair lady cuts me to the quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYouth does have its advantages. Vigor, stamina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpetuousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich can be delicious,\u201d he retorted, \u201cwhen done properly. Since you admit to lying, you are confessing that you found me physically appealing even then. Why didn\u2019t you say as much to your sister?\u201d Did she share nothing personal with anyone?</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t encourage her interest! I don\u2019t believe you two would suit. You would quickly overshadow her, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not have been receptive in any case. It would be very unwise for a man to court one sister while secretly pining for the other.\u201d</p><p>Jessica flushed. \u201cYou have never pined for anything. It\u2019s not in your nature. Besides, like Mr. Sinclair, you never once gave any indication of knowing I even existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same can be said of you in regard to me. Both of us appear to have been aware of each other, but you were promised to Tarley and I was too young. I had no notion of what I wanted to do with you beyond unrestrained fornication, and I was confounded by how to achieve that end. You are such a perfect, pristinely glorious creature. Rutting atop you in a frenzy of adolescent lust seemed obscene and impossible.\u201d</p><p>It was a testament to her growing ease in his company that she wasn\u2019t completely scandalized by his bluntness, as she certainly would have been mere days ago. \u201cYou appeared to have more skill and control in such matters when I bore witness to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been different with you.\u201d</p><p>Her blush deepened. She looked down at the food between them. \u201cPerhaps if Michael had been more obvious or forthcoming about his feelings for Hester\u2014not that she isn\u2019t remarkably happy with Regmont ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI avoid speculating on past possibilities. Life is what it is. Making the best of it takes energy enough. Pointless to waste any effort regretting what cannot be changed.\u201d</p><p>Jessica nodded as if she agreed, but her gaze was slightly unfocused, betraying the inward turn of her thoughts. \u201cYou act with the intention of not regretting your decision to do so,\u201d she murmured, almost to herself. \u201cWhile I have always chosen not to act, so there would be no possibility of regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is to say which approach is better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to try your way. At least for a little while.\u201d Alistair looked up at the sky to mitigate any pressure his next words might exert. \u201cIt would seem to be the perfect time. You can reinvent yourself while away from home, and no one will be the wiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d</p><p>She wagged a finger at him, a gesture he found enchanting for its playfulness. \u201cYou are influencing me. Whether that is for my betterment or detriment remains to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know precisely what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom without censure.\u201d He sat up. \u201cIt does exist, and I can show it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom and consequences go hand in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But is censure a consequence or simply a nuisance? Does it really matter what others think of you, if you have the means to ignore them?\u201d</p><p>Jessica exhaled audibly. \u201cI am beginning to care about what you think of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad for you.\u201d Alistair reached for the bottle of wine protruding from the basket. \u201cAnd I have liked all the sides I have seen of you so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us cannot flaunt convention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to be the voice of reason. I designate you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall reverse roles. I will proceed without concern for consequences, and you will act with an eye toward propriety. You certainly will need the practice, since you intend to rejoin Society when you return to England.\u201d</p><p>Alistair was beyond intrigued with her bold suggestion.</p><p>\u201cCome now,\u201d she prompted. \u201cWe both know you are well versed in how to break rules. The question is: can you follow them? Can you withdraw from an endeavor, goal, or desire simply because it would be scandalous to continue? Can you pass opportunities in order to avoid censure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you break rules?\u201d he rejoined. \u201cCan you continue, even if doing so is scandalous? Can you risk censure to seize opportunities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can certainly give it my best effort.\u201d Her smile was brighter than he\u2019d ever seen it. \u201cShall we wager to make my proposal more appealing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s appealing enough.\u201d The reversal of their roles introduced a host of wickedly wonderful possibilities. \u201cBut, as you know, I never walk away from a challenge.

Because Lady Bencott was widely lauded for her fashionable attire, Hester had to assume it was the former.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a bonnet in the window,\u201d Hester offered. \u201cI think it would be exquisite on you, Em.\u201d</p><p>Moving toward the front of the shop, Hester was acutely aware of how much she missed Jessica. Her sister\u2019s presence always enhanced shopping excursions, such as the one Hester had arranged today. Jessica had a way of keeping women such as Lady Bencott in line with a carefully worded chastisement that made its point in the most genteel of ways while leaving no room for reproach. That thread of steel in Jessica was a source of envy for Hester. She did not possess the same strength as her sibling. She was the conciliatory sort, quick to ease tensions and avoid conflicts, no matter the cost to herself.</p><p>Hester reached for the aforementioned hat perched so prettily on a stand, but paused when her gaze was caught by a figure outside. Bond Street was congested with pedestrians, as usual, and yet one form caught her attention and held it.</p><p>The man was tall and fit, elegant, with a horseman\u2019s thighs and shoulders requiring no padding. His dark green coat and doeskin breeches were modestly adorned but clearly expensive. He had such a confident way of moving that others instinctively made way for him. The women watched him with feminine awareness; the men moved out of his path.</p><p>As if he felt the intensity of her regard, the man turned his head toward her. Beneath the brim of his hat, Hester saw a square jaw she would know anywhere.</p> <p>Michael. Warmth spread through her veins, a feeling she hadn\u2019t experienced since the first time Regmont had struck her. Something inside her had numbed that day, but it stirred now, awakening.</p><p>Dear God. When had he become such a fine specimen of a man?</p><p>When had her childhood companion left boyhood behind? When he became Lord Tarley? Or prior to that? She so rarely saw him anymore that she couldn\u2019t pinpoint when he might have become so formidable.</p><p>He paused as she did, a lone stationary figure in the midst of a flurry of activity. He carried himself so beautifully, so easily. Comfortable with his height in a way her husband, who was a few inches shorter, had never been.</p><p>Hester\u2019s hand fell to her side. Before she quite knew what she was about, she found herself outside, waiting for Michael, who weaved through traffic en route to her with graceful impatience.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Lord Tarley,\u201d she said when he reached her. She was surprised her voice was so clear and steady, when she felt fuzzy headed and shaky.</p> <p>He removed his hat, revealing rich chocolate-brown hair. With a bow, he greeted her. \u201cLady Regmont. I am feeling most fortunate to have crossed paths with you this morning.\u201d</p><p>She was ridiculously pleased by the smoothly voiced platitude. \u201cThe feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked over her shoulder into the milliner\u2019s shop. \u201cAn afternoon with friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Which meant she couldn\u2019t speak to him about the matter weighing heavily on her mind. \u201cI must see you as soon as you can possibly spare the time. I have something I wish to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>He tensed. \u201cWhat is it? Is something amiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about your wager with Regmont.\u201d</p><p>With brows raised, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t hurt him. Too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t Regmont I worry about.\u201d Michael had no notion of what sleeping beast he might awaken.</p> <p>His lips twitched, then he lost the battle and smiled in truth. The gesture took her breath away, making her realize how rarely he ever smiled around her. His reserve had always been notable. He\u2019d never been soothed by her charm as so many others were.</p><p>\u201cI cannot decide,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether to be flattered by your concern or insulted by your lack of faith in my pugilistic abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot bear to think of you injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will endeavor to protect my person on your behalf. In all fairness, however, you should know that my doing so could result in injury to your husband.\u201d</p><p>Had he always looked at her with such warmth in his dark eyes? \u201cRegmont is physically capable of defending himself.\u201d</p><p>When Michael frowned at her tone, she realized she might have revealed more than she should. She deflected his concern with distraction. \u201cI very much enjoyed your visit the other day. I do wish you would call on me more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, Hester.\u201d His voice was low and intimate, his gaze shadowed. \u201cI will try.\u201d</p><p>They parted ways. It was with great force of will that Hester refrained from looking back over her shoulder when she returned to the shop. It was one thing to take a moment to speak to her sister\u2019s brother-in-law. It would be quite another to be seen ogling after him.</p><p>When she returned to her companions, Lady Bencott said, \u201cThe title suits Tarley.\u201d</p><p>Hester nodded, knowing the grief and other burdens that came with his new station.</p><p>\u201cWith any luck, Emily,\u201d Lady Bencott went on, \u201ca new bonnet will catch his attention and secure you a fine match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that I should be so fortunate.\u201d Em removed yet another unflattering hat from atop her lovely raven curls. \u201cI have admired him for some time.\u201d</p><p>Hester felt a sharp pang in her chest at her friend\u2019s dreamy tone. She told herself it was a symptom of increasing, not something far more complicated and impossible ... like jealousy.</p><p>\u201cYou wished to see me?\u201d</p><p>Michael looked up from his desk as his mother entered his study. Despite the not-inconsiderable size of the room, the Countess of Pennington\u2019s slender frame seemed to dominate the space. It was the force of Elspeth Sinclair\u2019s will and the command of her bearing that made her so formidable. Her strength of character was complemented by her physical beauty and elegance.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He set his quill aside and stood. Rounding the mahogany desk, he gestured to one of the settees and waited for her to be seated. Then he settled across from her with a slight smile. \u201cI have a favor to ask of you.\u201d</p><p>His mother studied him with a keen gaze. The recent loss of a beloved son was reflected in the depths of her dark eyes, and sadness clung to her like a shroud. \u201cYou know you have only to ask. If it is within my power to see it done, it will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He collected his thoughts, pondering the best way to phrase his request.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Elspeth linked her fingers in her lap and lifted her chin. Strands of silver hair lined her temples, but her face showed few signs of aging. She remained beautiful and faultlessly composed. \u201cI have tried to give you as much privacy as I am able, but I confess, I worry over you. You have not been yourself since Benedict passed on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us have been.\u201d He deflated into the seatback with a harsh exhalation.</p><p>This conversation had been a long time coming. His mother had shown remarkable restraint in waiting so long, considering her usual need to be kept apprised of every minute detail affecting the members of her immediate family. While Pennington grieved in the country, Elspeth had arrived weeks ago, hovering on the fringes of Michael\u2019s new life in the most unobtrusive way possible. She appeared to occupy herself with friends and social activities, but he knew the true reason why she had come\u2014to be there as support for her remaining son as he tried, and failed, to fill the void left by his brother\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cIn the most well-meaning and innocent of ways,\u201d Michael said wearily, \u201cwe took Benedict for granted. It never occurred to any of us that he might one day leave us floundering without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not floundering,\u201d Elspeth argued. \u201cYou are more than capable of carrying your new responsibilities in your own fashion. It isn\u2019t required that you should proceed in the same manner Benedict did. You can forge your own path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re expending great effort to squeeze yourself into the mold shaped by your brother. I pray you do not believe your father and I want you to do so.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cThere is no finer man to emulate.\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted and gestured at him, flowing gracefully and encompassing his form from his boots to his cravat. \u201cI hardly recognized you when I first arrived. The somber hues of your new wardrobe and the sparseness of embellishment ... It isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not simply a Sinclair any longer,\u201d he retorted, somewhat defensively. \u201cI am Tarley and one day\u2014God willing, a faraway day\u2014I will be Pennington. A certain restraint and decorum is required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff and nonsense. What is required is your sanity and happiness. Your unique abilities and viewpoints are more valuable to the title than slavish adoption of your brother\u2019s sensibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanity is a luxury I must earn. Presently, I am barely keeping pace. I have no notion how Benedict met all his obligations, but by God, the amount of work to be done seems overwhelming at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should rely on the estate stewards more. You don\u2019t have to do everything yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do, until I know enough to allow someone else to manage. I cannot place the responsibility for our family\u2019s financial stability in the hands of hired employees simply because it simplifies my life and saves me the trouble of rectifying my ignorance.\u201d Michael looked around the room, feeling like a fraud in the space that was imbued with the very essence of his brother. The somber reds and browns were not what he would have chosen for himself, but he\u2019d changed nothing since taking over the space. He felt as if he lacked the right to do so, as well as the will. \u201cAnd unlike Benedict, I don\u2019t even have Calypso to worry over, yet I still feel as if I am hanging on by the tips of my fingers.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth shook her head. \u201cI remain ambivalent about your brother\u2019s bequeathment of such a large obligation to Jessica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will want for nothing for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer per annum stipend alone is sufficient to make her a very wealthy widow. That plantation was the bulk of your brother\u2019s personal income for good reason\u2014it consumed a great deal of his time and attention. The burden of maintaining the property will likely be too great for her to bear. The mere thought of facing such a challenge is daunting to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe discussed it with me prior to finalizing his will, and I understood his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved her,\u201d he said simply. \u201cHe claimed there was something about the island that affected her; an alteration to her countenance and personality he wished to foster. He wanted her to feel the power of self-sufficient affluence, if she should ever have to go on without him. Something about her being restrained and needing absolute freedom, or some such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe meant well, I suppose, but she should be here with us. It pains me to think of her alone.\u201d</p><p>Michael seized the opportunity to segue into the reason he\u2019d summoned her. \u201cHer sister, Lady Regmont, feels similarly. And speaking of Hester, I am led to the point where I ask a favor of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like you to deepen your association with her. Draw her into your social circle. Spend more time with her, if you would.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s brows rose. \u201cShe is charming, of course, but there are a notable number of years between us. I am not certain our interests are aligned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he set his forearms on his knees. \u201cI fear something is not right with her. I need your opinion. If I am correct, you would note it straightaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant, why the interest in Lady Regmont in particular? Because of Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly easing Jessica\u2019s mind would please me,\u201d he prevaricated. \u201cThe sisters care a great deal about one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is expected and laudable. Yet I still fail to see why the welfare of Regmont\u2019s wife is your concern.\u201d Her tone was more warily curious than argumentative. \u201cIf there is anything requiring attention, Regmont will see to it. You, on the other hand, need a spouse of your own to occupy you.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Michael\u2019s head fell back and his eyes closed. \u201cIs marrying me off all anyone can think about these days? The gossip rags are rife with speculation over my intentions, and now I cannot even enjoy a respite in my own home!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there any woman who appeals to you?\u201d</p><p>Absolutely. As you\u2019ve so astutely surmised, I am mad for another man\u2019s wife. He straightened. \u201cEnough of this. I am well. Our affairs are well. There is no need for concern in any respect. I am tired and feeling ill equipped, but I\u2019m learning quickly, and soon all will be as second nature to me. Settle your mind, if you would, please.\u201d</p><p>His mother stood and moved over to the bell pull, her peach-hued satin skirts rustling as she moved. \u201cI feel the need for a strong cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>Michael felt the need for something much stronger.</p><p>\u201cSo.\u201d Elspeth\u2019s tone was resigned. \u201cTell me what rouses your concern over Lady Regmont.\u201d</p><p>He felt precious little satisfaction over gaining his mother\u2019s capitulation. What cause would Hester have to dread an amateur bout of pugilism between two civilized gentlemen? The recollection of the imploring, almost-fearful look on her face when they\u2019d spoken earlier was still fresh. And troubling.</p><p>\u201cShe is gaunt and far too pale. She seems overly delicate, both physically and otherwise. It isn\u2019t like her. She was always vivacious ... full of energy and life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen rarely take note of such things about their own wives, let alone another man\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holding up his hand, he warded off further speculative admonishments. \u201cI know my place and hers. Note that I am placing this matter in your hands. My mind will be eased by your assistance, allowing me to return my focus to affairs falling within my purview.\u201d</p><p>A white-capped maid appeared in the open doorway, and Elspeth ordered a tea service. Then she returned to her former seat, straightening her skirts as she sat. \u201cYour widely gazetted boxing match against Regmont suddenly takes on new meaning. I thought it wasn\u2019t at all like the new man you\u2019ve become to risk censure from the magistrates. I was actually hopeful it was a sign of the old Michael returning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are seeing motives that aren\u2019t there. And it isn\u2019t a match, which\u2014as you pointed out\u2014would be frowned upon by the magistrates. We\u2019ve simply agreed to practice the sport together.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a mother\u2019s exasperated look. \u201cYou cannot tell me I don\u2019t see how you fidget with the fob of your pocket watch, or tap your right foot against the floor. Those are long-standing habits of yours, which you have managed to suppress in the last year. Yet thinking of and talking about Lady Regmont reawakens those dormant tendencies. She has a profound effect on you.\u201d</p> <p>Michael scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cWhy do women insist on ascribing deep meaning to random events?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we take note of life\u2019s details, which men fail to do. That is why women are cleverer than men.\u201d She bared her pristinely white teeth in an overly sweet smile.</p><p>He grew wary due to familiarity with that particular smile and the mischief it portended.</p><p>\u201cI will see to Hester for you,\u201d she said in a honeyed tone. \u201cFor a price.\u201d</p><p>Right. He knew it. \u201cWhat will it cost me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou must allow me to introduce you to some suitable young ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he snapped. \u201cCan you not simply act out of the kindness of your heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKindness for you. You are overworked, overtired, and underappreciated. Not surprisingly, you find yourself drawn to someone who is familiar and comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Realizing that arguing against her points would only work against him, Michael kept his mouth shut and pushed to his feet. Tea was most definitely not going to be sufficient for him. Benedict\u2019s cognac in the bookcase behind the desk was far more appealing. He approached the wall of books and bent to open one of the carved wooden cabinet doors lining the bottom row.</p><p>\u201cGood that you aren\u2019t speaking,\u201d she went on, \u201cbecause you should be listening. I married a Sinclair male and raised two more; I know precisely how you are built.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stopped pouring at the halfway point, but decided to continue to the rim. \u201cWe are built differently from other men?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome men choose their mates with their reason, weighing the benefits and detriments in a purely analytical manner. Others\u2014like your friend Alistair Caulfield\u2014respond to physical attractions. But Sinclair men choose from here\u201d\u2014she tapped her chest above her heart\u2014\u201cand once the choice is made, they are hard to dissuade.\u201d</p><p>Michael tossed back the contents of his glass in two gulps.</p><p>Elspeth made a chastising clucking noise with her tongue. \u201cIt was years before your grandmother truly accepted me. She thought I was too hardheaded and intractable for a woman, but your father would not be denied his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why she thought that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Jessica ... I love her as if she was my own child, but I had reservations about her in the beginning. She is the type of individual one can never truly know well, but Benedict would not be gainsaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was very content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he? Why then was he still making such grand efforts, like the bequeathment, to reveal a deeper side of her? It is the nature of love to wish to possess the other person completely\u2014body and soul. I think it likely that he would have eventually grown resentful of her inability to share herself. Regardless, their match is no longer a concern. You are the one who is attached to an inappropriate love interest. You are the one who requires a new object of affection. It is the best way to recover from unrequited love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have larger issues to address.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you could have remained a bachelor previously, but no longer.\u201d</p><p>Michael stared down at the tumbler in his hand, tilting it to and fro to catch the light from the large window to his left. Of all the duties he\u2019d acquired along with the Tarley title, it was the need to wed and bed a suitable spouse that most pained him. He would be tying himself into a fraud he would have to perpetuate for the rest of his life. Just the thought of it was disheartening and exhausting.</p><p>\u201cSee to Lady Regmont,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cGive her whatever counsel or sympathetic ear she may need, for as long as she may need it. In return, I will make myself available to your matchmaking.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Jess strolled along the deck with her arm linked with Beth\u2019s. The ocean breeze was strong, filling the sails and hurtling the ship toward its destination. Still, the pace was not swift enough for the abigail.</p><p>\u201cI grow weary of the ocean and this vessel,\u201d Beth grumbled. \u201cAnd we \u2019ave weeks yet to endure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not so odious as that.\u201d</p><p>The brunette looked at her with a mischievous smile. \u201cYou \u2019ave a \u2019andsom distraction to \u2019asten the journey.\u201d</p><p>Jess attempted to look innocent. \u201cNot that I would ever admit to such.\u201d</p><p>Through her interactions with Alistair, she\u2019d come to a new understanding of the pervasive infatuation most young women experienced in adolescence. Jess had never experienced it herself until now. She thought about Alistair with alarming regularity, both awake and while dreaming.</p><p>\u201cRemind me of your fellow in Jamaica,\u201d Jess said, hoping for a respite from her fascination.</p><p>\u201cAh ... my \u2019arry. A sweet and randy man. The best kind, I say.\u201d</p><p>Jess laughed. \u201cHow naughty you are!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times,\u201d Beth agreed, unabashed.</p><p>\u201cSweet and randy, you say? No one told me to esteem such qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were told well enough to catch yerself the comeliest gentlemen I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the abigail shot back. \u201cO\u2019course the prettier they are, the \u2019arder it is for their women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are treated differently. More is expected of them, yet less is expected of them. They are excused from some things and \u2019eld to a \u2019igher standard for others.\u201d Beth looked at her. \u201cNo disrespect intended, milady, but you should know.\u201d</p><p>Jess nodded. She did know.</p><p>\u201cSo what you \u2019ave,\u201d Beth explained, \u201care men who know greater freedom with fewer consequences. They are forgiven more often than not. And we women cannot seem to stop caring for them anyway, which \u2019urts. If I\u2019ve a choice between men\u2014one \u2019andsome and charming, one sweet and randy\u2014I\u2019d choose the sweet one. I know I\u2019d be much \u2019appier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a wise woman, Beth.\u201d</p><p>Beth shrugged. \u201cLessons \u2019ard won. But I\u2019m grateful for them all the same. Although, to tell the truth, I\u2019d likely break that rule o\u2019 mine for Mr. Caulfield. There\u2019s \u2019andsome and then there\u2019s men who make yer toes curl. Something to be said for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does do that, does he not?\u201d Which made it so deucedly hard to resist him and the consequences that would assuredly follow a liaison with him. She had yet to find suitable justification for such risk. A few hours of pleasure seemed too flimsy.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t frown so, milady. Yer safe enough.\u201d</p><p>Feeling far from safe, Jess looked at the abigail curiously. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon for you. Yer still grieving. When the \u2019eart is still \u2019ealing, we find someone who \u2019elps us forget it hurts. But one day we don\u2019t want to forget any longer and we let \u2019em go. When that time comes for you, you\u2019ll say farewell to Mr. Caulfield with gratitude and no regrets. It\u2019s the way we women survive the passing of our men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Jess was taken with the notion of being immune to deep attachment to Alistair. The prospect was both astonishing ... and a relief.</p><p>\u201cWell ... there\u2019s no pain for the one \u2019ealing, because in the process, the \u2019eart forms a shell like a clam. Until it\u2019s strong enough to love again.\u201d Squeezing Jess\u2019s arm, Beth said, \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t worry too much on Mr. Caulfield\u2019s account, milady. There\u2019s a particular way about \u2019im. In my experience, men who \u2019ave that way \u2019ave been building their own shell for a long time. They like it in there, and they \u2019ave no intention o\u2019 coming out.\u201d</p><p>A child ran across the aftcastle. The unexpected sight so startled Jess, she lost track of what she\u2019d been about to say. The lad looked to be no more than ten and one, with a mop of blond curls and cheeks that were still chubby. He was racing toward the helmsman when a booted foot was thrust into his way. The boy tripped, crashing into the deck with a pained cry.</p><p>Horrified by the cruelty of the act, Jess was further infuriated when the responsible seaman yanked the boy upright and cuffed his ears, then proceeded to scold the child with words coarse enough to burn her ears. As the child cowered in the face of such vitriolic rage, his small chin lifted with white-faced courage.</p><p>In that moment, Jess remembered vividly what it felt like to be standing in his place. She was taken back to that place where fear and rising panic assailed her along with the dreadful waiting for the next blow. Because there was always a next blow. The sick fury that gripped men such as her father and this man fed on itself, escalating until only sheer physical exhaustion prevented them from inflicting further abuse.</p><p>Unable to turn a blind eye, Jess unlinked her arm from Beth\u2019s and strode forward. \u201cYou, sir!\u201d</p><p>The sailor was so involved in his tirade, he failed to hear her. She called out again, louder, attracting the notice of a crewmember next to him who shoved at his shoulder to gain his attention.</p><p>She drew to a halt in front of them. \u201cSir, I cannot abide such treatment of children. There are more effective ways to discipline.\u201d</p><p>The man eyed her with cold, dark eyes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t any business of yers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind yer manners with \u2019er ladyship,\u201d Beth scolded, which earned her a dark glower.</p><p>Jess knew that look well. His blood was hot with spite and the need to vent it. It was a sad fact that there were many men like her father, men who lacked the sense or willpower to purge what ailed them in noninjurious ways. They only knew how to spew their hatred on others and were so morally afflicted, they drew pleasure from doing so.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know \u2019ow to run a ship, yer ladyship,\u201d he said with a derisive curl to his mouth. \u201cAnd until you do, you\u2019d best leave the learnin\u2019 of how to survive on one to me.\u201d</p><p>Other men slowly closed in around them, exacerbating her growing anxiety.</p><p>\u201cTeaching,\u201d she corrected, struggling against nervous tension so fierce her shoulders and neck ached with it, \u201c\u2014if that is what you presume to call it, is equally applicable to all trades. You are going about it poorly in any case.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels, smiling through a reddish bushy beard in a chilling manner. \u201cWhen a sailor is told to fetch something, \u2019e best not forget what it was \u2019e was sent to fetch or that \u2019e was sent to fetch it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a c-child!\u201d she argued. The cracking of her voice struck her like a whiplash. She took a step backward without volition.</p><p>Something within her broke at the realization that her prized and hard-won equanimity was so easily assailable. She\u2019d convinced herself if she were ever faced with another abusive individual in her adulthood, she would be capable of controlling the interaction in a way she hadn\u2019t as a child. She had believed she would be stronger and could say all the cutting words she\u2019d imagined in her youth. Yet here she stood with her stomach knotted and spine rigid, her entire frame riddled with vibrating tension.</p><p>\u201cThe boy is a seaman first.\u201d He reached out and caught the little one by the hair, yanking hard. The child stumbled into him with a low cry. \u201cAnd \u2019e \u2019as to earn \u2019is keep and not get in the way.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed past her fear. \u201cFrom what I witnessed, it was your foot that was misplaced in his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Tarley.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of Alistair\u2019s voice, Jess turned.</p><p>The loitering sailors parted for him as he drew near, and silence spread in his wake. The mere manner of his bearing commanded attention and respect. Her clenched fists relaxed, then tightened again when frustration rose anew. She should not need another individual to feel settled, but it seemed she did and that made her feel very weak and helpless. \u201cYes, Mr. Caulfield?\u201d</p><p>His gaze was intent on her face. \u201cIs my assistance desired?\u201d</p><p>Jess debated her answer for a moment, then said, \u201cCould we speak privately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He raked their audience with a sweeping glance. \u201cCarry on.\u201d</p><p>The sailors quickly dispersed.</p><p>Alistair pointed at the man who\u2019d so angered Jess. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>The man pulled off his worn cap. \u201cAye, Mr. Caulfield?\u201d</p><p>The change that swept over Alistair was astonishing. The blue of his irises took on a marked chill, causing Jess to shiver. She remembered that cool detachment from their youth, the icy ruthlessness that had lured women and reckless gamblers alike.</p><p>\u201cConsider your treatment of that young sailor carefully,\u201d he warned in a biting tone. \u201cI do not tolerate the maltreatment of children on my ship.\u201d</p><p>A potent rush of admiration and pleasure flowed through Jess. Alistair must have seen enough during his approach to discern a problem, and his position on the subject meant a great deal to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She extended her hand toward the child. \u201cPerhaps he could make his egress with us?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened with more terror than he\u2019d shown while suffering abuse. He shook his head violently and stepped closer to the other men.</p><p>She was briefly confused, having expected relief and gratitude. Then comprehension set in. One of the harder lessons she\u2019d learned in her youth was that delaying the inevitable only led to greater penalty in the end.</p><p>Unshed tears stung her eyes. Pity for both the child in front of her and the child she herself had once been. In all likelihood, she\u2019d only made things worse for the boy.</p> <p>Without waiting for Alistair, Jess pivoted and hurried toward the companionway. When she felt his hand at the small of her back, her vision blurred. She allowed him to lead her, grateful when he ushered her below deck and behind the privacy of a closed door.</p><p>His cabin. Despite her distraction and tear-clouded eyes, she knew it immediately by scent. His unique virile fragrance permeated the air and raised her temperature.</p><p>The space was of similar size to her own cabin and furnished much the same, but she felt different in his domain, aware of a heightened awareness and an altogether sensual sense of anticipation.</p><p>She exhaled a shaky breath, her hands knotting together in a physical manifestation of her inner turmoil. She was not free of her father, as she\u2019d previously supposed. And now she knew she would never be free.</p><p>\u201cJessica?\u201d Alistair rounded her. His breath hissed out. \u201cDamnation ... Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p> <p>She attempted to move away. He caught her to him, crushing her into the hard length of his body. Her cheek was pressed into the superfine of his coat. Beneath her ear, his heart beat in a strong and steady rhythm.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cTh-that man is offensive to me in every way. He is vile and unrepentant about it. I know his kind. He is an animal. You would be wise to be rid of him.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause when she finished, during which Alistair\u2019s breathing was too sharply regulated to be completely natural. She knew him well enough to know he was weighing the import and implications of her concern, and speculating on the root of it.</p><p>His hands stroked the curve of her spine. \u201cI intend to speak to Captain Smith. The man will be dismissed at port.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, she put distance between them. He made her want to lean on him in ways beyond the physical. Dangerous ways.</p> <p>\u201cJess ...\u201d The familiarity of his address roused even more conflicted feelings. \u201cIt might benefit you to talk about the reason you are so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d she scoffed, redirecting her frustration at him in self-defense. She was too susceptible to him, too exposed. \u201cI should bare myself to a stranger?\u201d</p><p>He accepted her crossness with grace enough to shame her. \u201cPerhaps I am the best choice,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cI\u2019m an impartial party, over whom you hold the knowledge of a tainted past. And even if I were inclined to divulge information indiscriminately\u2014which you know I am not\u2014I\u2019m far removed from anyone who might wield it against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot conceive of anything I would rather discuss less.\u201d She moved toward the door.</p><p>Alistair blocked her way and crossed his arms.</p><p>The entrapment aggravated her already volatile mood. \u201cYou intend to detain me?\u201d</p><p>The curve of his beautiful mouth was a silent challenge. But unlike the seaman\u2019s mocking derisiveness, Alistair\u2019s regard empowered her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re vulnerable now,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will stay with me as long as you are.\u201d</p> <p>The parallels to what Beth had said on the deck mere moments ago didn\u2019t escape her. His intended meaning was different, but the phrasing was applicable regardless. Thanks to Beth\u2019s greater experience, she now knew why she was so drawn to the temptation Alistair presented. But an understanding of what he would gain in return still eluded her. \u201cWhat concern am I of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my lover, Jess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex is merely a formality at this point.\u201d His tone was low and intimate. \u201cYou and I have always been inevitable. And I am not a man to take pieces of a whole. I must have everything. The good as well as the bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust spew it all over you?\u201d Her words were sharply clipped, a reaction to a sudden violent rush of longing. \u201cWould that not make me of similar ilk to that sailor? Forcing another individual to bear the brunt of my personal disquiet?\u201d</p><p>Alistair took a step closer. \u201cUnlike the boy, I can take it. Better yet, I want it. There is no part of you I don\u2019t want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my hunger for you is unrestrained, so you must be also. In all ways.\u201d</p><p>Jess felt the urge to pace, but resisted due to long training. Ladies did not pace. They did not reveal anything other than serenity. They existed to ease a man\u2019s burdens, not add to them.</p><p>Yet Alistair\u2014the most thoroughly masculine creature of her acquaintance\u2014was the only individual with whom she felt comfortable sharing the shadowy aspects of her soul. She knew, with unaccountable near certainty, that he would not think less of her as others might. He would not alter his treatment of her. Darkness was known to him. He\u2019d lived within it, embraced it, and seemed all the stronger for the experience. It still amazed her to think of how driven he was, how ruthlessly focused he could be, how far he was willing to fall from grace to avoid failure and be self-sufficient.</p><p>At too young an age, his innate sensuality and stunning countenance had exposed him to the lascivious interest of those who were jaded and immoral. Knowing it was his responsibility to see to his own future, he\u2019d taken what advantage he could from an untenable circumstance. But at what cost to him?</p><p>\u201cJessica. What are you thinking about when you look at me in that manner?\u201d</p><p>She was staring at him, enthralled by his dark beauty and the undeniable edge to him. She hadn\u2019t the knowledge to understand the \u201cway about him\u201d that Beth had referenced, but she was a woman nevertheless, with all the primitive instincts of her gender. He exuded a raw sensuality that was nothing less than addictive. When she wasn\u2019t with him, she wished to be. That depth of craving had frightened her for the last sennight, knowing as she did that nothing permanent could ever exist between them.</p><p>Her world was not his; his was not hers. They were traveling the same road for a brief time, but their paths would diverge. She could not stay in the West Indies forever, and he would not long tolerate London Society, whatever he might say to the contrary. His hunger for her was not the only thing unrestrained about him. He was a bold and brazen man, vibrant and powerful. The ton\u2014whose mores she\u2019d been well trained to epitomize\u2014would stifle and bore him.</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t have the knowledge Beth possessed ... but Alistair did. He, too, had spoken of their liaison as fitting within a brief span of time. Quickly come and as swiftly gone. Room enough only for fondness and gratitude. She had to trust their greater counsel in this.</p><p>\u201cI admire you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Although he appeared unmoved, she sensed the stillness that gripped him. \u201cAfter all you know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>There was a weighted pause. \u201cYou are almost certainly the only person aware of my past transgressions who would say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you did not hesitate to be honest with me. You must have had some faith in my ability to be open minded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not without apprehension,\u201d he confessed, his jaw taut. \u201cBut yes, I believed you would be more likely to overlook my sins than hold them against me.\u201d</p><p>The recent emptiness in her chest now filled with something warm and tender. \u201cI would not have believed it of myself.\u201d</p><p>She lacked the words to explain what she was feeling. It was something akin to victorious, and it was so much the opposite of the defeat she\u2019d felt when leaving the deck, it seemed impossible that one emotion could so swiftly follow the other.</p><p>Her mind was her own.</p><p>There was no denying that her body had been damaged and her emotions could so easily be overrun by fear. But her mind remained uncorrupted. She was capable of judging Alistair with criteria outside the narrow scope to which she had been taught to conform. For all his strenuous efforts, her father had failed, because she did not think as he did. There were pieces of her he hadn\u2019t been capable of reaching. The freedom inherent in that revelation was profound and deeply moving. And Alistair had made the discovery possible. Without him, she might never have faced a choice capable of enlightening her. She had never before been presented with the option of accepting something that was unacceptable. Her world did not have such decisions in it.</p><p>Alistair remained still as a statue as her world tilted on its axis, his handsome features hard set.</p><p>She saw through his exterior and understood; he hadn\u2019t yet accepted his choices. Not the way he so readily accepted her.</p><p>With great care, Jess untied the ribbons of her bonnet and removed it, setting it carefully atop the seat of a chair. En route to the door, she skirted Alistair, but though he turned to watch her, he didn\u2019t stop her. She knew he\u2019d follow her if she left and thought herself lucky for that.</p><p>She engaged the oval-shaped brass latch and heard his sharp inhalation behind her.</p><p>Jess walked to the bed and sat carefully on the edge of the mattress.</p><p>The feral look that swept over his handsome face made her quiver with heated expectation. But it was quickly masked, leaving behind an unusually austere countenance.</p><p>\u201cAs per our wager,\u201d he said, clasping his hands at the small of his back, \u201cI must remind you of the impropriety of your presence in my locked cabin.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile curved her mouth. Until now, there had not been an opportunity to play the reversed roles they\u2019d agreed to adopt. \u201cDo I look as if I care about propriety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you considered the consequences?\u201d</p><p>His hands on her. His mouth. All that raw expertise concentrated on ensuring her pleasure. She needed that heightened intimacy with him. She felt such a surfeit of affection for him and gratitude for the changes he was effecting in her life. \u201cOh, yes. I have considered them all.\u201d</p><p>His gaze heated at her breathy reply. \u201cI should enumerate them, just to be certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jess set her hands on her bent knees. \u201cNo games or wagers, please. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019ve suddenly conceded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now? I extended an invitation to visit my cabin and you\u2019ve ignored it for days. Only a moment ago, you attempted to leave. What brought about this swift change? Do you wish to forget? Will bedding me work as well as the claret? I must warn you, I am not nearly as fine a vintage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no wish to forget anything. In truth, I hope to remember every moment of this day.\u201d</p><p>Alistair showed no emotion, yet the air around him seemed strangely turbulent.</p><p>\u201cI feel very close to you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not nearly close enough. Undressing would help considerably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you overwrought or impaired in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Not any longer.\u201d His caution said so much about his intentions. If he wanted only sex, he would not be so concerned about her reasons for offering it. \u201cIsn\u2019t it enough that I want you? Must there be more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not prepared to stop as I did before. It\u2019s midday. Hours will pass and you will be missed. At the very least your abigail and my valet will know what occupied you. Perhaps others, if we forget ourselves and are overheard.\u201d</p><p>Jess considered him carefully. \u201cYou are attempting to dissuade me. Perhaps it is you who has had a change of heart?\u201d</p><p>She knew that was not the case, not with the indecent way he was looking at her, but his reasoning was a mystery.</p><p>\u201cI have wanted you for so long now,\u201d he said roughly, \u201cI\u2019ve no memory of how it feels to be devoid of the craving. But you must know what you do. I need you to think of who you are and where you are and who I am. Think of how things will be once we\u2019ve crossed this threshold. Think of how you will leave this cabin\u2014disheveled and well fucked. Think of how you will sit across the table from me at supper, surrounded by men who will know the minute they look at you that I\u2019ve had you long and hard this day.\u201d</p><p>His crudity jolted her physically, surprising her with a surge of arousal she could never have expected. Her face heated. This was no tender lover who stood before her. This was the man once known for his acidic wit, whose tongue could charm and shred with equal effectiveness. A man who would do anything to have what he wanted.</p><p>And he wanted her. Her shaken confidence drew strength from that.</p><p>Alistair crossed the distance between them. \u201cKnow what you do here, Jessica,\u201d he said again, his voice harsh and unyielding. \u201cI can wait until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait any longer.\u201d She stood in a rush and pointed at the nearest chair. \u201cSit, Mr. Caulfield. It\u2019s time I had you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Alistair\u2019s chest expanded with a sharply drawn breath, then deflated in a rush. He pivoted on his heel and moved to the chair, pausing to remove his coat and drape it over the back before sitting. \u201cAccording to our agreement, I am supposed to be the voice of reason. A model of propriety.\u201d</p><p>Jess watched him, admiring the sleek sensuality inherent in his movements. She also admired his taut backside, eager to see it bared. \u201cBe my guest, but I won\u2019t be swayed. I do understand, however, that you have a strong dislike for losing wagers.\u201d</p><p>Setting his hands on his knees, he waited. His tense expectancy was reflected in his heavy-lidded gaze. Between his legs, the outline of his thick arousal quickened her breathing. \u201cNot in this instance. I would give up my fortune to bed you; losing our bet is a ridiculously small price to pay for the privilege.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her chest tightened at his fervency, her corset becoming an unbearable restraint. Needing to be free of it, she went to him and presented her back. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>The touch of his fingers was light, too light to quench her thirst for him. As the halves of her gown parted, Jess began to feel warm and slightly intoxicated. The scent of his skin, the exotic blend that was uniquely his, filled her nostrils with every inhalation. She knew he had to be as heated as she was, and she longed to touch his bare flesh, to press her nose and lips against it.</p><p>Alistair pushed her sleeves off her shoulders, and she wriggled out of her dress, allowing the garment to pool on the floor. He caught her stays next, loosening them with a dexterity born of experience. She\u2019d enjoyed that skill firsthand, remembered it vividly, dreamed of it.</p><p>He helped her push the corset down past her hips, and she stepped out of the boning, feeling a novel sense of freedom and lack of inhibition.</p> <p>\u201cJess,\u201d he breathed, a moment before his arms came around her and he nuzzled against her back. His large hands cupped her breasts, kneading the aching flesh with a firm yet tender grip.</p><p>Her head fell back and her eyes closed, a sigh escaping her. The desire to give herself over to him was nearly irresistible, but she restrained herself. If she allowed him to, he would take over, and she didn\u2019t want that. He\u2019d had more than his share of women who wanted him to work in bed. She did not want to resemble those women, especially after her rash words the other evening. She wanted to give pleasure, and she wanted him to take it.</p><p>Turning carefully in his embrace, Jess filled the space between his spread thighs. She caught his face in her hands and pressed her lips to his, wanting the kisses that made her feel seductive and desirable. His hands encircled her waist, pulling her closer.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to enjoy you,\u201d she breathed into his mouth. \u201cYou refused me last time ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter seven years, you cannot be asking me for patience.\u201d</p> <p>She pushed her splayed fingers into the thick silk of his hair. \u201cAfter seven years, what are a few moments more?\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s head fell back on a low groan, his eyes staring up at her with a bold, heated passion. It amazed her that she could incite such a response in a voluptuary as beautiful and sensual as he was. She, a peeress known for her chilly deportment, while Alistair radiated a sexual heat that made her melt and soften.</p><p>Her fingertips stroked over his dark, winged brows. Their shape lent wickedness to his countenance, while framing his stunning eyes and thick lashes. Her thumbs caressed the sculpted line of his cheekbones, holding him still as she pressed her lips to the tip of his aristocratic nose.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Jess,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cIf your aim is to kill me, be mercifully quick about it. Don\u2019t torment me.\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, she began to work on the knot of his cravat. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou drive me to madness.\u201d He tugged on her hips, drawing her close enough to capture a hard, peaked nipple in the heat of his mouth. He made a rough sound of desire, and Jess sagged into his grip.</p> <p>Even through the thin lawn of her chemise, the contact was scorching. She arched and gasped, her womb clenching in greedy hunger. Catching his shoulders, she steadied herself as her knees weakened. His tongue flicked over her with ruthless skill, reminding her of the last time his mouth had been on her. When her breast grew heavy with need, her nipple swollen and red, he moved to lavish similar attention on the other side. Jess felt the hot trickle of her own arousal, the flesh between her legs growing moist in welcome.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cI want you naked. I want to feel you inside me.\u201d</p><p>He released her with a low growl. \u201cOh, you will, love. You\u2019ll feel every inch. I have never been so hard. I am going to cram you full, and you\u2019ll come over and over and over again.\u201d</p><p>Tackling the ivory buttons of his waistcoat, Alistair quickly divested himself of the garment. When he pushed to his feet in a powerfully graceful movement, she stepped back on shaky legs, her entire body feeling alien to her. She was a mass of sensation and wanting, her emotions so riotous she might\u2019ve run in fear if her limbs hadn\u2019t been weighted by longing.</p><p>Seven years. It felt as if her attraction to him had been simmering the whole of that time, waiting for his touch to free it. Now it spilled over her in heated waves, flushing her skin and making the ephemeral weight of her chemise and pantalettes a burden. But she dared not remove them. As it was, she was too vulnerable. Too bare. None of the shields she was used to erecting\u2014her rigid deportment, biting rejoinders, and faultless manners\u2014were available to her now. She didn\u2019t know who she was beneath all that protection, which left her feeling so open and unprotected.</p><p>Blissfully unaware of Jess\u2019s turmoil, Alistair finished unwinding his cravat and tossed it aside. The next moment his shirtsleeves were yanked over his head. He was reaching for the placket of his breeches when she stayed him.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said, swallowing hard at the sight of him. As elegant as he was while dressed, he was pure unadulterated male beneath his clothes. The evenness of his sun-kissed skin color betrayed how often he went about without a shirt, while the thickness of his biceps and the taut roping of abdominal muscles told her how often he worked alongside the men he employed.</p><p>Her hand lifted to touch him, her feet moving her forward without volition. She pressed her palm to his warm skin, and a shiver moved through her. She felt his heart racing. There was so much power and strength in him. His anticipation was tangible and visible; his muscles were hard and delicious. She was searingly aroused by his virility, quivering with eagerness at the thought of that pure masculine energy focused on pleasuring her body.</p> <p>Alistair caught her wrist. \u201cI am aching with lust for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not alone,\u201d she whispered, tugging free of his easy grip to touch his shoulders. Both of her hands stroked over the broad curves, then slid down his biceps, her fingers squeezing and finding no give to her applied pressure. He was like warm marble. She wanted to touch him all over, take her time, nuzzle her nose against him and breathe him deep into her lungs. She wanted him. In that moment, she wanted him more than anything else in the world. She felt as if her repressed hunger had overtaken her completely. Her need and longing for him was all that was left of her after he\u2019d stripped the entirety of her defenses away.</p><p>His fists clenched at his sides as her hands drifted over the rock-hardness of his rippled abdomen. \u201cAre you wet for me? Do you feel empty without my cock in you?\u201d</p><p>Jess nodded, feeling her sex clench tight with greed.</p><p>\u201cLet me fill you,\u201d he purred, temptation incarnate. \u201cLet me push inside you and make you come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Wrapping her arms around him, she drew closer still, delaying her surrender because she desired his first. With the flat of her tongue, she licked across the hard disk of his nipple.</p><p>He hissed and gripped her hips with bruising strength. \u201cIn a moment, I will pin you to the bulkhead and take the choice from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the laudable restraint you displayed the other night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were intoxicated; I knew before we began that I wouldn\u2019t be having you. Now ... There is no turning back. I know I am only moments away from having you as I\u2019ve needed you for far too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamnation, I am trying to be civilized.\u201d He pressed his lips to her forehead in a quick, hard kiss. \u201cI am trying to keep from pushing you to the deck and rutting atop you like a maddened beast. But I am only a man\u2014a vastly flawed one\u2014and I know damn well how good it will be between us. I\u2019ll never want to stop; therefore I cannot wait to begin.\u201d</p><p>Jess stilled, her breath panting across his skin, her chest constricted by the weight of his expectation. Disappointing him would crush her. She couldn\u2019t allow it. He expected great pleasure, and she was determined that he should have it. She reached for the fastenings of his breeches, slipping the buttons from their holes.</p><p>Alistair reached for her coiffure, withdrawing the pins that secured her tresses. \u201cI want to feel your hair brush all over my body. I want to fist it in my hands and hold you still while I ride you deep and long.\u201d</p><p>Her hands shook as she reached into his smalls and wrapped her hands around him. He groaned and jerked in her grip.</p><p>\u201cYou are so hot,\u201d she said, scorched by the heat of him. She shoved his clothing out of the way, releasing him. He made a low, animal sound as he fell heavily into her palms.</p><p>Jess sucked in a sharp breath, staring down at the magnificent penis thrusting so hungrily toward her. Perhaps she should have expected his body to be uniformly awe inspiring, but in this matter she was at a disadvantage. She had accustomed herself to one man and had never expected to become intimately familiar with any other.</p><p>Her fingers explored carefully, following her gaze. She traced the sinuous curving of the thick veins that coursed the rigid length. He was fully, ragingly aroused. His bollocks were drawn up tight, but they were no less impressive for their readiness. He was large there, too, giving proof of the virility promised by his confidence and arrogance. She wondered if her body could accommodate him. He was so thick and long, wide from the tip to the root.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cTell me you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall show you instead.\u201d Licking her lips, she dropped to her knees.</p><p>\u201cJessica.\u201d</p><p>The serrated edge to his voice thrilled her, made her disregard the discomfort of the hardwood beneath her. Alistair stood still, his hands tangling in her hair. His chest heaved with labored breaths, and a slight sheen of perspiration glistened across his abdomen.</p><p>At least in this, she was assured of giving him pleasure. Her lips parted. Mouth watering, she engulfed the thick crest.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he groaned, shuddering violently.</p><p>A slow, heated spurt of pre-ejaculate flowed over her tongue. She moaned at the taste of him, her cheeks hollowing on a drawing pull, seeking more of the rich flavor.</p><p>\u201cYes ... Jess. Yes.\u201d Alistair held her face in his hands, his thumbs stroking over her cheeks. \u201cI have dreamed of this. Wanted you like this so fiercely I was certain I\u2019d lose my mind.\u201d</p><p>His hips moved, stroking his cock in and out of her working mouth. His beautiful features were harsh with lust, the skin stretched taut over his sculpted cheekbones, his sensual mouth twisted in a grimace of pained pleasure. The ferocity of his need might have frightened her if not for the fierce tenderness in his eyes and touch.</p><p>Sweat bloomed across her flushed skin, her mind reliving his ministrations to her the other night, remembering the feel of his tongue and fingers on her. In her. Remembering the unbearable ecstasy. She wanted to give him that ecstasy in kind, wanted to leave a similarly indelible memory with him.</p><p>Gripping his lean hip in one hand, Jess cupped his scrotum with the other. His curse was bitten out, his body jerking as she tested the heavy weight, her fingertips massaging the tightened sac with luring caresses. Her tongue was equally adventurous, swirling around the plush head of his cock, flickering along the tender underside.</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d he gasped, the muscles of his stomach clenching and quivering. \u201cSuck me, Jess ... take me deeper ... yes, like that ...\u201d</p><p>She gripped the thick base of his penis, fisting him just to feel him quake and hear him curse. He was riveting, so darkly erotic in his unrestrained abandonment. Her thighs clenched tightly together, her body\u2019s attempt to ease the unbearable aching and swelling of her needy flesh. She was searingly aware of the slickness of her sex, the way she trembled in longing. But she wanted this more, wanted no distractions from witnessing his release, wanted to absorb every nuance of his expression when he succumbed to the climax she knew he was swiftly approaching. She felt like a different woman, a fiercely feminine creature who knew no boundaries or restraint, no rules or law, a force of nature wild and untamed.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s callused thumbs rubbed along the edges of her straining lips. Her jaw stretched wide to accommodate him, the slight discomfort anchoring her to the moment. The act had never been this way with Benedict. Her husband had always been sweet and solicitous, their sexual relationship marked by tenderness and care. Alistair was raw and unguarded in his pleasure, creating a rich intimacy. She\u2019d never felt as close to another person, never felt such a brilliant and binding sense of connection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cAh, Christ ... your mouth is divine ...\u201d</p><p>Alistair held her head still and took what he needed, the thrust of his hips accelerating until she could only grip his thighs and tighten her suction, her tongue stroking his cock-head with fevered desperation. The sounds he made, the mindless groans and gruffly voiced praise, brought her to the brink of orgasm.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d he growled, swelling farther a moment before the first hard burst of semen poured over her tongue.</p><p>He climaxed with the same unmitigated intensity with which he did everything. The cords of his neck stood out in harsh relief as he threw his head back and flooded her mouth with a guttural cry. She worked him with her hands, milking his release, wanting the entirety of his lust and hunger, claiming it as her due with savage exultation.</p><p>His rigid tension had just barely begun to ease when he caught her beneath the arms and hauled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cJessica.\u201d He caught her up and carried her to the bed.</p><p>In the aftermath of an orgasm so powerful it weakened his knees, Alistair held Jessica tightly to his chest, consumed by the need to reduce her to the same base state she\u2019d stripped him to. His skin felt too small and stretched too thin. Sweat soaked the roots of his hair and slid down his nape. His mouth was dry from hoarse mutterings.</p><p>He\u2019d never imagined anything could feel so good. She\u2019d sucked his aching cock as if starved for the taste of him, moaning and clutching him as if she would die if he denied her. As if he could. He doubted even the sinking of the ship could have pulled him away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jess\u2019s hands dug into his hair, her lush body writhing against his torso. Alistair seated her on the edge of the mattress and pulled her chemise up and over her head. He tossed it aside, his attention focused on the full breasts that heaved with her every ragged breath. He cupped their lush weight in his hands, his thumbs stroking over the hard, peaked nipples. She leaned back, her weight propped on her canted arms. Her lovely face was flushed, her gray eyes so dark they were nearly black. Her rich golden hair fell around her shoulders in total disarray. She looked glassy eyed and ravished, certainly the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured, pressing her backward to take a nipple into his mouth. Her selflessness meant more to him than he could express with words. He\u2019d needed so much from her for so long, and she had given generously and with heartening enthusiasm.</p><p>His tongue stroked over the taut point of her breast, his lips pulling with deliberately soft suction. Teasing. Making her want more.</p><p>\u201cAlistair ...\u201d Her breathy tone was ripe with surrender. There was no resistance left in her, no caution or wariness. He was uncertain of what had transpired to make her so free in his arms, but he would have time enough to discern the cause later. For now, all he wanted was to make her come apart in his arms, to hear her say his name as she climaxed.</p> <p>Reaching between her legs, his questing fingers slid into the slit of her pantalettes and found her sex gratifyingly slick. He parted her, sliding through the silken skeins of her desire, then pushed two fingers into her. She was ready for him. More than ready. Wet and hot, ripe for the taking. He thrust gently in and out, his teeth gritting as he felt her clenching hungrily around him. He tugged on her breast with a hard suck, then released her.</p><p>Jess\u2019s arms gave out, and she sprawled across his dark brown counterpane, looking like a debauched angel. Straightening, he gripped her knees with both hands and spread her wide.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he praised, coveting the exposed glistening pink flesh between her thighs. He briefly debated removing the rest of their garments, then discarded the notion. They\u2019d undress next time, after she was soaked with his seed and limp with satiation.</p><p>He gripped his cock with one hand, angling downward to glide the sensitive head through her petal-soft lips. The feeling was exquisite, engorging his penis as if he hadn\u2019t had a galvanizing orgasm only moments before.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still hard,\u201d she breathed, pushing up onto her elbows.</p> <p>\u201cFor you, always. I intend to ride you all day,\u201d he promised darkly. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI await the proof of such stamina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA challenge, my lady?\u201d He bared his teeth in a semblance of a smile. \u201cYou are aware of how I respond to those.\u201d</p><p>Notching the thick crest into her tiny slit, he pushed through the token resistance of tightness caused by her year of abstinence. She gasped as the crown breached the stretched opening. He bit back an animal sound of pleasure and fought the urge to fall upon her with a hard, deep thrust that pierced her to the womb. That would be too quickly done, robbing her of the full awareness of his possession. He wanted her to feel the stretch of every wide inch, wanted her to writhe as he sank deeper, wanted her to remember the sensation of that last leisurely stroke that seated him to the bollocks.</p><p>So he kept her spread and worked his way into her, his eyes riveted to the point where they were joined. His lungs burned as he gulped in air, every nerve in his body attuned to the feel of her satiny tissues quivering and clasping around him. A surfeit of sensation burned through him. Sweat coursed down his back and chest, a physical manifestation of the rigid control he exerted.</p><p>\u201cSo tight,\u201d he gritted out, his jaw clenched with strain. \u201cLike a fist ... so hot and tight ...\u201d</p> <p>She moved restlessly beneath him, biting her lower lip as he slid in and out, pushing deeper and deeper with every leisurely thrust. \u201cPlease. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>Hunching over her, Alistair sank his teeth into her shoulder. Hard enough to leave a mark, but not enough to break the skin. She moaned and arched into his mouth. It was a primitive act, one goaded by the feel of her greedy cunt pulling and sucking at the head of his cock, luring him to sink home. Bare. Nothing between his most sensitive flesh and hers. In all his life, he\u2019d never taken a woman without the protective sheath of a French letter. Only with her would he do so. Jessica\u2014a woman he\u2019d known was meant to be his from the moment he first saw her.</p><p>His hands moved from her thighs to the bed, supporting his weight as he pumped his hips in a timed, unhurried rhythm. She took advantage of her sudden freedom, wrapping her legs around him and tugging him deeper. Her breath left her in a gasped cry of his name as he slid in to the root, buried completely.</p><p>Alistair held still, struggling for control. He fought to make allowances for her straining body to grow accustomed to him throbbing hard and thick inside her. She stared up at him, her eyes wide and luminous, windows to her soul. There was no evidence of the chilly hauteur she was renowned for. She was burning hot beneath him, around him; all artifice and distance melting away. The look on her face was one he\u2019d never seen on anyone, yet it mirrored how he felt\u2014profoundly affected, split wide open, with nowhere to hide.</p><p>When she pushed upward and kissed his clenched jaw, something shifted inside him, shaking him to the core. His blood was raging for her, spurred by seven years of waiting to be right where he was, but she stayed his violent need with a single soft, sweet kiss. He was devastated by her tenderness in the face of his ferocious desire. Pressing his damp cheek to hers, he nuzzled against her, breathing in the smell of sex and lust and beloved woman. She fit him perfectly, if tightly, as he\u2019d known she would. His beautiful, irreproachable Jess. A woman capable of reining in an entire roomful of exuberant people with a single quelling glance. Yet her body had been designed to hold him, a man built for pleasuring women in the most exuberant way possible.</p><p>Without conceit, he knew how generously he was endowed. His size had been a tool he\u2019d used to his advantage once he had become aware of how pleasing it was to women.</p><p>But he had not been meant for those women. He had been fashioned for Jessica, just as she had been crafted for him. If it killed him, he would make her see it.</p><p>He traced the shell of her ear with his tongue, feeling her slick sex clasp him in response. \u201cPerfection,\u201d he whispered, following her down as she sank back into the bed. \u201cTwo halves of a whole.\u201d</p> <p>Jess gripped his upper arms and licked her lower lip, her hips moving in tight little circles, loosening the way for him. \u201cPlease,\u201d she pled again in that throaty murmur that undid him.</p><p>Bracing himself with palms flat to the bed, he withdrew slowly, relishing the feel of her clinging to his cock. He returned with effort, pushing through the tight resistance. Her head thrashed and her eyes closed, which he could not allow. He needed her to stay with him, to see him through the storm he knew was coming. The pressure of his impending orgasm was fisted around his bollocks and pulsing through his cock, warning him that he would soon be wasted by the woman beneath him. Even knowing how she could destroy him, he couldn\u2019t pull away. She\u2019d snared him completely that long-ago night, bewitched him beyond redemption. There was no other choice for him. Somehow, he had to make himself the only choice for her.</p><p>Pushing his arms beneath her shoulders, he cupped her head in his hands, pinning her completely. His mouth came down over hers, his head tilting to deepen the contact. She caught his waist, arching into him. Their perspiration sealed their torsos together, adding another raw layer to their heated coupling. He moved. She moved. They found a rhythm. She clawed at his back; he kissed her as if he\u2019d die if their lips were parted. His tongue plunged and retreated along with his cock, both seeking to drive her wild. He needed her wild, as crazed and desperate as he felt.</p><p>Alistair rolled his hips, probing with the iron-hard length of his penis, absorbing every nuance of her fevered response. He found a spot that made her shiver beneath him and exploited it, stroking over it again and again. He growled when she climaxed, the delicate muscles inside her rippling and gripping his plunging cock. He hung on to his control by the thinnest of threads, needing to see her through first before he took any more than she\u2019d already given him.</p><p>He slowed, gliding in and out, lifting his head to watch the pleasure take her. The way was easier now, her body accepting his possession with rich creamy moisture. Her eyes were dazed, her lips swollen. She breathed his name ... Alistair. He thickened.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014You still ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll day,\u201d he reminded, lunging heavily, accelerating his tempo. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips flexed into his back. Her legs tightened around his hips. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Jess awoke to the feel of firm fingertips gliding back and forth across her forearm. She lay on her stomach with one arm tossed over Alistair\u2019s torso. Her body felt achy and heavy, well used. For a long moment, she lay there, absorbing the odd reality of waking up to a man beside her. It was surprisingly pleasant, reaffirming the intimacy established through lovemaking.</p><p>It was growing dark outside. The sunlight that had shone through the porthole earlier was dimmed now. Hours had passed, as had several shattering orgasms. She hadn\u2019t known her body was capable of repeating a climax so soon, or that a man\u2019s body was capable of such sexual stamina. Although Benedict had sometimes taken her more than once in a night, it was always with hours between one encounter and the next. Alistair had required little time for recovery ... mere moments. He said that was because of her, because of his desire for her. Of course, he was younger than Benedict. Younger than she ... but she refused to think about that.</p><p>The bigger revelation was that his fervency no longer frightened her. How could it when she felt equally fervent toward him? The gratitude Beth had told her she\u2019d feel was only one of a dozen emotions swirling through her. Her affection for the man beside her was powerful enough to constrict her chest.</p><p>Shifting, she slid one leg over his and pressed her lips to his biceps. He made a low sound of approval. \u201cIf I\u2019d known,\u201d he said with glittering eyes, \u201cthat sex would make you so agreeable, I would have taken you to bed sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sennight wasn\u2019t soon enough?\u201d she asked, startled at the vocalization of how quickly he\u2019d slipped under her guard.</p><p>\u201cSeveral years preceded that sennight.\u201d He caught the hand she had splayed across his chest and kissed her knuckles. \u201cWhat softened your resistance and sweetened your temper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand the many facets involved in our association. I could only see an entanglement between us as an unnecessary complication. I had no notion that a love affair was a natural progression for a widow, part of a process of healing that allows a woman to resume her life without her spouse.\u201d</p><p>His grip on her hand tightened marginally. \u201cYou discovered this today?\u201d</p><p>Jess nodded and slid closer, draping half of her body over the side of his. She felt comfortable with him. Safe. Free. \u201cI am now prepared to enjoy you fully, knowing that when the time comes to part we\u2019ll do so with fondness. And I will be stronger and more resilient for the experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I am to be an experience for you.\u201d He sounded mildly contemplative. \u201cWhen do you anticipate this time for amicable farewell will arrive?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea. And, frankly, the end no longer concerns me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already changed profoundly because of him, in so many ways. He would not be merely an experience for her but an adventure, as fraught with possibilities as her voyage to the West Indies.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it concerns me?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The casualness of his tone took the weight from his words. That pained her, but she endeavored not to show it. It was not his fault that she didn\u2019t know how to conduct a casual affair, and she did not want to give him cause to regret becoming involved with her. \u201cFustian. We both know you will tire of me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be clear, you\u2019ll keep me as your lover until one of us no longer desires the other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the etiquette of such things better than I.\u201d</p><p>Alistair flipped her to her back in an economic, agile movement. He rose above her, kneeing her legs open and settling between them. The scent of his skin, now mingled with her fragrance, was as stimulating as always. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019ve challenged me again,\u201d he purred. \u201cThis time, to keep you enthralled with me indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, adoring the way his dark hair hung around his face, making him look wicked and sinful. Her fingers traced the arch of one of his brows. \u201cYou would swiftly grow bored with a fawning paramour, I\u2019m certain.\u201d</p><p>With a practiced swivel of his hips, he positioned his cockhead at the entrance of her sex and pushed a scant inch inside her. She was slick with his seed, filled with him. Yet she wanted more; it frightened her how much. He reached between them, finding her clitoris and stroking over it with a feather-light touch. Her breath left her in a sighing moan. She was sore and swollen, but that was no deterrent. She needed to lose herself to his skill and his focused pursuit of her pleasure. She needed to forget this talk of endings while she was still so enamored with the beginning.</p><p>His mouth hovered above hers, his sensual lips curved in a smile that didn\u2019t soften his determined gaze. \u201cI challenge you to prove it.\u201d</p><p>Bearing down, he drove into her, making her cry out at the suddenness of his invasion. Alistair had been so careful before, giving her time to process every sensation before moving on to the next. This time felt like a claiming, a bold and undeniable possession. She writhed beneath him, trying to accommodate the thick, deep impalement.</p><p>\u201cFawn over me,\u201d he coaxed darkly. \u201cLavish me with your attention. See what comes of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jess would have told him she had no desire to hasten his leavetaking, but he began to thrust. As fluid as his movements were, they were rougher than they\u2019d been previously. Harder. Every downstroke hit the end of her, the thick club of his magnificent penis stroking over nerve endings in a contact that curled her toes. She clawed at his back, pulling him closer.</p><p>He brushed his lips across her temple, then rubbed his cheek against hers, sharing the perspiration misting his skin. \u201cThis time,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, Jess. The way I\u2019ve needed to fuck you all these years.\u201d</p><p>The coarseness of his hoarsely voiced threat was opposed to his tender kiss. Her hunger sharpened. He caught the back of her knee and pulled her leg upward, opening her wider. His next hard lunge wrung a cry from her, the sensation of his endless penetration bringing a fierce pleasure bordering on pain. She bit her lip to stifle further sound.</p><p>\u201cLet me hear you.\u201d With his palms on the mattress, he supported his torso easily. His hips were held aloft by his knees, affording him impressive fluidity of movement. With her leg hooked around his biceps and her pelvis canted upward, she had no defense against him. His cock plunged and retreated with blurring speed, his hips lifting and falling, his heavy sac smacking against her in a swift erotic rhythm. \u201cTell me how much you like it,\u201d he purred. \u201c... how good it feels ...\u201d</p> <p>Soft sobs of pleasure escaped her, spilling from her mindlessly. His large body mantled hers, dominated her, left her with no awareness beyond him. Everything she clung to faded away, leaving her with only base desire and heated yearning, every cell in her body attuned to the man who rode her with marked possessiveness.</p><p>\u201cJess ...\u201d He groaned. Sweat dripped from his hair as his hips pistoned against hers. \u201cI will never tire of this. Of you. My God ... I don\u2019t think I can stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d Jess slung her free leg over his hips and possessed him in kind, flexing into his pounding tempo. \u201cDon\u2019t. Stop.\u201d</p><p>Her womb clenched desperately, the rush of orgasm licking across her skin like fire, whiplashes of pleasure cutting through the outer shell she\u2019d lived in her entire life. The violence of his lovemaking rocked her to the core, leaving her defenseless against his relentless siege on her emotions. She felt herself unraveling, her eyes burning with a sudden wash of tears.</p><p>Alistair watched her as she fell apart beneath him, his azure eyes feverishly bright in the semidarkness. She shook with the violence of her climax, moaning when he thrust deep and rolled his hips, applying the perfect pressure to her clitoris to keep her coming and coming and coming.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around his nape and lifted to him, taking the connection she needed in a lush, fervent kiss. The swollen tissues of her sex rippled along the length of his throbbing penis, luring him to begin thrusting again.</p><p>Releasing her leg, he caught her up, his arms sliding beneath her shoulders and embracing her tightly. His lips moved across her cheek, his breath gusting hot and fast across her ear.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d he growled, gripping her shoulders and lunging powerfully. \u201cHold me.\u201d</p><p>Jess pressed her face into his sweat-slick chest and held on, absorbing the feel of his body flexing and working against her. The sweet friction of his plunging strokes threatened to push her over the edge again, but she resisted, wanting to experience Alistair\u2019s race to orgasm. He\u2019d spent the afternoon focused on her, restraining the sexual animal she knew was in him. Now, finally, he seemed to be losing his grip on his steely control, the ferocity of his passion betraying a depth of emotion that might rival hers.</p><p>She felt the tension grip him, heard his teeth grind as he fought it. \u201cCome in me,\u201d she urged, accepting the pounding of his hips and cock. All her reserve was burned away by the heat of his lust, leaving behind a woman brave enough and wanton enough to say the libidinous words that would incite him to madness. \u201cYou feel so good ... so good ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d he hissed, swelling inside her. The first hard, thick spurt made her gasp in delight. He jerked against her, shuddering with every wrenching pulse, his hands fisting in the bedclothes on either side of her head.</p> <p>He came hard and long, groaning her name, rubbing his face and torso against her as if to mark her with his scent. Jess took it all, cradling him as he shattered like she had mere moments earlier, anchoring him in the midst of the storm.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s fingers rubbed restlessly across the wood grain of the table in the great cabin, his gaze on Jessica as she spoke to the captain over supper.</p><p>She wore a high-necked gown to hide the evidence of Alistair\u2019s bite, the soft grayish-purple hue of the silk a reminder of her widowhood. As he\u2019d known she would, she looked well fucked, her color high and her lips swollen from his kisses. Her eyes were bright and her voice throaty, while the expressive movements of her hands and arms were marked by a more pronounced sensual grace. He\u2019d never seen her appear so relaxed or look more beautiful, yet his pleasure in that accomplishment was marred by agitation.</p><p>He was mad for her, enamored as he\u2019d never been of another woman. Yet she seemed far more composed than he was. His future had altered drastically this day; everything he\u2019d considered inviolate\u2014his bachelorhood, his freedom to come and go as he pleased, his ability to avoid Society whenever and however he wished\u2014was gone. Jessica would now dictate the paths his life would traverse from this point forward, because he couldn\u2019t proceed without her. It was a revelation that shook him. He had long known he was meant to have her; he hadn\u2019t realized until this afternoon that he was meant to keep her.</p><p>Alistair heaved out his breath and ran a rough hand through his hair. Jess glanced at him over the rim of her wine-filled glass and frowned. He waved her concern away with an impatient flick of his wrist.</p><p>He had gotten more than he\u2019d bargained for with her. Her generosity in bed extended far beyond the gift of her body. She held nothing back. Tears, smiles, provocative whispers ... His back bore the marks of her nails, but it was the interior cuts that stung now. She\u2019d allowed him to see every emotion filtering through her as he made love to her, and that knowledge flayed him open. Every time she\u2019d held him tightly at the extremity of his climax, as if to hold him together, she sliced a little deeper.</p><p>How in hell could she sit there so serenely after what they\u2019d gone through that afternoon? It seemed almost as if the ramifications of what had transpired escaped her, yet he knew that couldn\u2019t be true. Jessica wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who engaged in indiscriminate sex. The connection for her had to be twofold\u2014one of mind and body. She had to be engaged more than she appeared, but her damned inviolate perfection of deportment shielded her too well. Meanwhile, he was coming apart at the seams and couldn\u2019t hide it.</p><p>The walls of the great cabin closed in on him. His breath shortened and he grew overwarm. He slipped a finger between his cravat and his neck, attempting to alleviate the feeling of constriction.</p> <p>Supper seemed to last an eternity. He refused the customary glass of port and excused himself as soon as he could politely do so. He offered a brief smile to Jessica, then fled. Reaching the main deck, Alistair sucked in a deep breath of crisp sea air and gripped the gunwale, waiting for the restoration of his equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cMr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed at the sound of Jess\u2019s voice. As vivid images from the afternoon raced through his mind, he realized his mistake. She was there in his head; there was no escape. \u201cYes, Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you\u2014Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>He looked out across the sea and nodded.</p><p>She drew abreast of him. Together, they stared at the moon\u2019s elongated reflection on the water. \u201cYou were so quiet over supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said automatically and absently.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to know what has you so thoroughly occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThoughts of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She canted her body toward him. \u201cNot quite so flattering when you look so grim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContemplative,\u201d he corrected, although he conceded to himself that he felt grim. Which was extremely out of character. His livelihood\u2014past and present\u2014was often benefited by his ability to keep his face carefully schooled. \u201cWe did not finish our conversation about your altercation on the deck this morning.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted, and she sucked in a deep breath. \u201cI am not refusing to answer,\u201d she began, \u201cbut I have to ask: Do you truly want to delve into the unsavory aspects of my past? I confess, I would rather you think of me as a romantic figure than one who is flawed and damaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you want of me in return?\u201d he asked tightly, inwardly raging against any distance between them. \u201cTo see only the surface and nothing of depth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her hand came to rest gently on his forearm.</p><p>Alistair swiftly caught her by covering her hand with his own.</p><p>She met his gaze. \u201cThere is a great deal I would like to know about you. Everything, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A slight frown marred the space between her brows. She was lovely in moonlight, her gilded hair made silver, her skin as luminous as a pearl. There was a new softness to her he\u2019d failed to notice before. He wondered if it had been there throughout supper or if it was making itself apparent only now because they were alone. The anxious part of him seized on the latter possibility, which soured his mood further. Damned if he would be needy.</p><p>\u201cBecause you fascinate me,\u201d she said softly. \u201cJust when I assume I might know you, you show me another side of yourself that is completely unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as ... ?\u201d</p><p>Her lids lowered. Her thick lashes shadowed her eyes. \u201cSuch as when you took the helm. And when you arranged the picnic on the deck. And when you left my cabin that night.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She caught her lower lip between her teeth, then swiftly released it, as if she\u2019d noted her nervous gesture and rejected it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand your mood. Have I displeased you in some way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was any more pleased with you, I would lose what little remains of my sanity.\u201d He linked their fingers together.</p><p>Jessica inhaled a long, slow, deep breath before speaking. \u201cMy pater believed sparing the rod spoiled the child.\u201d</p><p>Alistair tensed. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuffice it to say I was not spared nor spoiled.\u201d Her grip on his hand tightened. \u201cThat is why I\u2019m disturbed by bullies, especially those who grant no immunity to childhood.\u201d</p><p>Rage heated his blood. \u201cThat\u2019s the consequence you spoke of the other day? You were beaten if you were not well behaved? By Hadley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn retrospect, I was an unruly child, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cause for patience, not abuse! You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done,\u201d she dismissed, although her voice was unsteady.</p><p>\u201cBut not forgotten.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cYou were distraught today. The unpleasantness festers in your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fashion.\u201d Jessica offered him a sweet, tentative smile that served as another nail in his coffin. \u201cBut I realized today that I\u2019m stronger than I gave myself credit for. For all of Hadley\u2019s strenuous efforts, I am still capable of admiring your novel approach to life and the problems presented to you. I\u2019m still capable of enjoying you without reserve.\u201d</p><p>A tightening afflicted Alistair\u2019s chest. \u201cYou gave yourself to me in rebellion because Hadley would not have approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo; I took you in celebration, because Hadley\u2019s thoughts on the matter are of no concern to me. Not any longer. I don\u2019t think you collect how profound the realization was, to learn that the control he exerted over me is not absolute after all. I managed to retain some of my individuality, and as an individual, I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this tie into your discovery that taking me as your lover will act as a balm for your grief over Tarley\u2019s passing?\u201d He hated the bitterness that seeped into his tone, but the painful knotting of his gut wouldn\u2019t allow him to be nonchalant. Not about this. He seemed to suit her every purpose except the one most important to him\u2014to be entrusted with her heart. He wished he could be content with being the means through which she overcame her sorrows, but helping her past Tarley and Hadley wasn\u2019t enough. Not when he was so fundamentally altered that the life he\u2019d once known was forever lost to him.</p><p>\u201cAlistair ...\u201d Jess turned away abruptly, her free hand gripping the gunwale. Her back was ramrod straight, her head held high. There was defiance inherent in her posture; it won his regard and roused his body. \u201cI feel as if you want me to say something\u2014anything\u2014that will lower your esteem for me or give you cause to retreat.\u201d</p><p>Retreat? The very notion was absurd. He was addicted to the pure, innocent feeling of connection he\u2019d found in bed with her. He could no more give that up than he could change the order of his birth. Reliance on anything was a circumstance he\u2019d fought against his entire life, and now there was no escaping it. Leastwise, not for him. \u201cWhat do you think you can reveal that will mitigate my captivation with you? Enlighten me, so I\u2019ll know what I must hide from you to prevent a loss of interest on your part. Of course, if my whoring didn\u2019t accomplish that, perhaps only proper behavior will make me unsuitable. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m unsavory that I am useful to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she hissed, shooting him a narrow-eyed glare. \u201cI don\u2019t care for your tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies. Did I venture too far toward unacceptability for your tastes? Do you want only moderately aberrant behavior from a lover?\u201d</p><p>Yanking her hand free of his grip, she turned away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the morrow, Alistair, and will pray that after a good night\u2019s rest you\u2019ll be in better spirits.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t dismiss me,\u201d he snapped, fighting the urge to forcibly stay her. He would never use physical force against her, especially not after learning what she\u2019d suffered through in her youth.</p><p>Jessica rounded on him. \u201cYou are being impossible. Ugly. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed I could have anything I wanted, if I worked hard enough. If I just sacrificed as necessary, made devil\u2019s bargains and concessions, paid outrageous sums ... I thought everything was possible and within my grasp.\u201d He silenced the voice in his head that pressed for caution and self-preservation. \u201cNow, I\u2019m faced with one thing I want more than anything else on earth, and I know I can\u2019t buy you or cajole you or force you to accept me. The feeling of powerlessness is one I cannot abide. It shortens my temper and leaves me extremely frustrated.\u201d</p><p>Fine lines bracketed her lush mouth. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to start thinking of our arrangement as limitless, rather than finite. I want you try envisioning endless days like today. Mornings waking up in my arms. Nights passing with me inside you. Rides together in Hyde Park and waltzes in front of the ton.\u201d</p><p>Her slender hand lifted to her throat. \u201cYou would be miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you, yes.\u201d He crossed his arms. A stiff ocean breeze whipped through his hair. Now it was he who felt rebellious and defiant. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t present these terms to you in the beginning. I know I spoke of our affair as fitting within a short duration of time. But my intentions\u2014my needs\u2014have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain I fully collect what your intentions are,\u201d she said carefully. \u201cWhat are you asking of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019re no longer concerned with the end, but you still think of it as inevitable. I would prefer you to think of it as avoidable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought we agreed that we would remain lovers until one of us lost interest in the other. What more can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can work at this\u201d\u2014he gestured impatiently between them\u2014\u201cthing between us, instead of allowing it to fade and wither. When problems arise, we can address them. If the attraction begins to wane, we can devise ways to reignite it.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lower lip. \u201cWhat would you call such an arrangement?\u201d</p><p>Alistair pushed aside the anxiety that threatened to steal his voice. \u201cI believe,\u201d he said neutrally, \u201cit\u2019s called a courtship.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Hester drank her tea slowly, making a valiant attempt to keep something in her stomach. Though she was ravenous in the evenings, the afternoons found her still suffering from nausea. \u201cI suggest swapping the ribbons, Your Grace,\u201d she said to the Countess of Pennington. \u201cTry the brown with the blue, and the green with the peach.\u201d</p> <p>Elspeth looked over her shoulder to where Hester sat on a settee in the countess\u2019s boudoir. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>The countess returned her attention to the material and ribbons laid out across her bed. She gestured for the modiste to do as advised, then nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Hester smiled. While she\u2019d been slightly confused when Elspeth first began making persistent, yet friendly, overtures, she\u2019d come to realize that the countess looked upon her in the capacity of a daughter. It was a role Jessica had filled, and Hester found herself enjoying the maternal companionship. She understood that Elspeth\u2019s need was temporary, part of her re-acclimation to Society after years spent in the country. Hester envied her that idyllic life on the stunning Pennington estate.</p><p>\u201cYou should try the lemon scones,\u201d Elspeth urged. \u201cI vow you\u2019ve never tasted the like. They melt in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I should like to. Another time, perhaps.\u201d</p><p>The countess shook her head and came to her, settling on the settee opposite the one Hester occupied. \u201cHave you tried ginger tea or broth, or both? Either will help to settle your stomach. And be moderate with greasy foods in the evening. Salted water crackers also help.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, and then Hester said softly, \u201cIs it so obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to an observant woman who has spent nearly every day of this last week with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, I must beg for your discretion.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth\u2019s dark eyes brightened at the hint of a secret. \u201cYou and Regmont are keeping the news to yourselves? Delightful.\u201d</p><p>Hester hesitated, reluctant to share a confidence she\u2019d held so close to her breast. \u201cRegmont doesn\u2019t yet know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... ? Whyever not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel very unwell. I cannot help fearing that something is wrong. Regmont wouldn\u2019t\u2014He isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Hester set her cup and saucer down on the low table between them. \u201cIt would be better to wait and be certain that all is progressing as it should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear.\u201d The countess reached for the tongs and moved a scone from the serving tray to a small plate. \u201cYou are squandering one of the few opportunities in a woman\u2019s life when she can ask anything of her husband and receive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegmont gives me too much as it is.\u201d But not the one thing she most wished for\u2014his peace of mind. \u201cI also wanted to spare Jessica for a while longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would be overjoyed on your behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hester smoothed her skirts. \u201cBut she might grieve for herself, and she has enough to feel sorrowful about at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will hurt more if you don\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wrote her shortly after she left. I think this is best. She won\u2019t feel the need to put a brave face on if I\u2019m not there when she learns the news. She can react in whatever manner is most comfortable for her, and when we see each other again, it will be with pure joy in her heart.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth washed down a bite with a sip of tea. \u201cYou two are very close.\u201d</p><p>Hester rubbed at the ache in her breast. \u201cYes. She is a sister and mother to me, as well as my dearest friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica said your mother passed away when you were young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was ten, but in many ways my mother was lost to me before then. Her melancholia was debilitating. I most often saw her only in passing. She was a ghost to me\u2014frail and wan and lacking any vibrancy whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Elspeth offered a gentle, commiserating smile. \u201cMotherhood is a gift. It is truly a shame Lady Hadley was unable to see it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess would have made a wonderful mother. And Tarley, a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same can be said about you and Regmont, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Hester looked away from the countess, managing a shaky smile at the modiste\u2019s assistants as they exited to the gallery with Elspeth\u2019s selections.</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d Elspeth said, quietly commanding Hester\u2019s attention. \u201cIs it possible that you might be suffering from melancholia as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Truly, it\u2019s just that I feel so wretched most of the day. And I confess, I worry about the match between Regmont and Michael tomorrow. I wish there was some way to dissuade them. Regmont takes such things so seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou care about Michael.\u201d</p><p>Hester felt a blush sweep over her cheeks. Over the past week, she\u2019d found herself paying undue attention to Michael. She\u2019d looked for him at events and around the city, hoping for a mere glimpse. The sharp prick of excitement she felt when she found him both exhilarated and saddened her. It was undeniable proof that her love for her husband had lost its ability to consume her. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Elspeth set her cup down with a sigh. \u201cI must be honest with you. I have more than one reason for cultivating our friendship. Though I\u2019m deeply grateful for assistance with my attire, I have a need for another of your skills more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can help in any way, I would be honored to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like your expert opinion on the debutantes who might best suit Michael. Since you care for him as I do, I know you want to see him content in his marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Hester met the countess\u2019s examining gaze directly, drawing upon years of Jessica\u2019s coaching to hide her dismay. It was unreasonable for her to wish for him to remain as he\u2019d always been.</p><p>Elspeth smiled beautifully. \u201cThank you. I hope to see him settled before the year is out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d Hester agreed softly. \u201cIf we cannot manage sooner.\u201d</p><p>A knock came at the door.</p><p>Jess smiled, knowing who it was just by the cadence. The door opened without any encouragement from her. Alistair swept into the limited confines of her cabin with absolute confidence of his welcome.</p><p>He was so comely, he took her breath away. He had changed since they\u2019d been at sea, most especially over the past week in which they had been lovers. His beautiful blue eyes were brighter now, prone to amusement and warmth. There was a new softness to his features that, impossibly, made him even more handsome. And the way he moved ... there was an underlying leisure to the sensuality that marked him. As if she soothed the beast within him. It was a fanciful thought, but one that pleased her immensely.</p><p>He came to where she sat at the table and bent to press his lips to her temple. She lifted her mouth to his with an admonishing hum, securing a real kiss from him.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d she breathed, feeling her usual inordinate pleasure at the intimacy between them. It was similar to the ease with which she\u2019d lived with Tarley, yet it was not the same. Her response to Alistair was far richer and deeper in tone. It pained her to realize her relationship with Benedict hadn\u2019t been all that it, perhaps, could have been. Yet she\u2019d come to suspect that whatever was lacking in her marriage had been due to Alistair. Unbeknown to her, he\u2019d been there in the shadows, occupying a space in her mind that he\u2019d allowed no one to usurp.</p><p>\u201cIt is now.\u201d He straightened, revealing a leather-bound ledger tucked under his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork.\u201d He set it down on the table.</p><p>She smiled and set aside the quill with which she\u2019d been writing a letter to Hester. \u201cI\u2019m happy you came to me even though you have more pressing matters to attend to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to make love to you instead, but I suspect you\u2019ll soon be indisposed to such exertions.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. Her courses had begun just that morning. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged out of his coat and draped it over the chair opposite her. \u201cHow could I not know? I touch your body more than I touch my own. Your breasts are swollen and tender, and your desire for sex has been at a fever pitch the last two days. Among other signs.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s mouth curved with wry amusement. \u201cObservant man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be helped,\u201d he said, smiling back at her. \u201cI cannot take my eyes off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer,\u201d she teased. \u201cAnd, sadly, I am indisposed. I could accommodate you in other ways, though ...\u201d</p><p>He sat. \u201cA delicious thought, but I am content to simply be with you.\u201d</p><p>Jess inhaled a deep breath, an involuntary response to the sudden racing of her heart. He said the words so casually, but she was deeply affected by his openness and the vulnerability inherent in his lack of guile. Lord knew, she was vulnerable, too. \u201cI feel the same,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Alistair reached across the table for her hand. \u201cI cannot tell you what it means to me that whether or not we have sex doesn\u2019t affect your desire to spend time with me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say why it surprised her to learn that a handsome man wanted to be appreciated for more than his exterior and desired for more than his sexual prowess. \u201cAlistair ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pity me,\u201d he said sharply in response to her softened tone of voice. \u201cI will take any emotion from you but that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore you.\u201d</p><p>The harsh line of his mouth smoothed. \u201cThat one will do nicely.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t have you feeling ashamed of yourself because of me. I have not\u2014nor will I ever\u2014judge you harshly for your past choices, but if you cannot abide yourself when we\u2019re together, we are better off apart.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cNow, see here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you must see. You have to decide, right this very moment, that you are as worthy of my affections as any other man. If you cannot, I would like for you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Alistair cursed under his breath. \u201cYou cannot say such things to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I can\u2019t,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYou may delude yourself into thinking I\u2019m perfect, but I am only a woman and only partly a woman at that, since I\u2019m barren. I must say, it\u2019s vastly unfair that I cannot have children; yet I bleed as if it was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you are menstruating?\u201d he asked in a tone that was too light.</p><p>\u201cIf you were worried I wouldn\u2019t, you should not have been.\u201d</p><p>He held her gaze. \u201cAre you certain? Perhaps the fault was Tarley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He had a child with a mistress before we wed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the child wasn\u2019t his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you saw the boy, you would have no doubt. Like your brothers, he is the very image of his father.\u201d</p><p>Alistair nodded and directed his attention to his ledger.</p><p>A chill moved through Jess. The end of their relationship was inevitable if he wanted children, which most men did. And he deserved that sort of happiness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you with the boy,\u201d she said, referring to the child she\u2019d tried to rescue from abuse a week before. Alistair had taken an interest in the young sailor, working with him on knots and other useful skills, and she had enjoyed watching them together. \u201cYou will make a wonderful father someday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He glanced up at her, then leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. His hair had grown slightly longer, and she loved how the black strands framed his face. Her hand lifted to her throat and massaged the tightness there.</p><p>\u201cJessica.\u201d He exhaled harshly. \u201cI\u2019ve never given much thought to having children. Now, I won\u2019t give the matter any thought at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You cannot deny yourself the joy arbitrarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProcreation requires a partner, as you know. You are the first link in that chain. If you are also the last link, so be it. I cannot even begin to contemplate making the effort with anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>Her vision blurred. Blinking through an embarrassing sting of tears, she pushed back from the table in a rush and hurried over to the crate of claret waiting in the corner.</p><p>\u201cJess ...\u201d</p><p>She heard the scrape of chair legs atop the sole behind her; then firm hands gripped her shoulders the second before she bent down to grab the neck of a bottle.</p><p>\u201cHearing how I feel about you drives you to drink?\u201d he asked with his lips to her ear.</p><p>\u201cNo. Being selfish enough to feel glad about it does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want you to feel selfish about me.\u201d</p><p>Jess shook her head violently. \u201cLove is selfless. Or it is supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor some, perhaps. You and I have had so much taken from us. It is as it should be for us to take from each other.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, she leaned her head back against his shoulder. His arms came around her, and she placed her hands over his. \u201cYou have many siblings. You must want a large family of your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we are going to discuss my family, we\u2019ll need that claret.\u201d</p><p>He walked away. Jess grabbed a bottle and straightened. When she turned around he was pulling two goblets out of the small chest by the cabin door.</p> <p>She put the wine on the table and sat. Alistair set the glasses down, then pulled the cork from the bottle. He left the claret to breathe and settled back in his chair, eyeing her in a manner that was both examining and contemplative.</p><p>She waited patiently.</p><p>\u201cHave you never wondered why Masterson\u2019s paternal traits exerted themselves so strongly in my brothers, yet I am the mirror of my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne doesn\u2019t question such blessings.\u201d</p><p>The compliment earned a small smile from him.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cI surmise Masterson isn\u2019t your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do not care,\u201d he noted softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJess ...\u201d He gave a perfunctory laugh. \u201cI feared telling you, you know. You are so renowned for your adherence to propriety; I thought you might think less of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. But did your brothers think less of you? Do you not still feel close to Albert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never an issue with my brothers, no. But Masterson ... I cannot please him.\u201d The lack of inflection in his voice betrayed deeper emotions. \u201cPersonally, I no longer care, but my mother frets over the distance between us. If I could ease her mind, I would, but it isn\u2019t something I can change apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate for him.\u201d Finally, she understood why Masterson had been so reluctant to assist Alistair in making his own way in the world. \u201cHe is denying himself a fine son.\u201d</p><p>Alistair gave her a bemused shake of his head. \u201cI\u2019m still astonished at your nonchalance. I should warn you\u2014every time you accept a dirty secret I share with you, I grow more and more determined to keep you. It seems nothing I say can turn you away from me.\u201d</p><p>Warmth unfurled in her chest. \u201cSomeone has to keep you out of mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you are up to the task.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so, for your sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, my lady, I could swear that was a warning of some sort.\u201d</p><p>Jess adopted a stern expression. \u201cI value steadfastness and loyalty, Mr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I.\u201d His fingertips drummed atop the table. \u201cI once believed Masterson truly loved my mother deeply, and that she felt similarly toward him. He allowed her to keep me and claimed me as one of his own, despite the way it eats at him, because he knew she would never forgive him if he forced her to give me up. But now ...\u201d</p><p>When he faltered, she prompted, \u201cNow ... ?\u201d</p><p>Exhaling harshly, he said, \u201cI appreciate the not-inconsiderable difference in their ages. I understand how that impacts Masterson\u2019s physical ability to maintain marital intimacy. But, by God, I could not turn a blind eye to your seeking the relief of your sexual needs elsewhere and call my disregard \u2018love.\u2019 I would see to you in other ways\u2014my mouth, my hands, implements of pleasure ... whatever was at my disposal. I keep what\u2019s mine, and I do not share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps neither of them know how to broach the subject. I wouldn\u2019t judge them too harshly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me that you will feel free to discuss any topic with me.\u201d</p><p>It was a remarkably painless promise to commit to. He made it so easy for her to unveil herself just by the way he looked at her. Benedict had regarded her in the same manner, but he had asked no questions. His affection had been quietly given, with no liens or expectations. Alistair\u2019s demands were greater and far more comprehensive. But so, then, were the boundaries of his acceptance.</p><p>She nodded her acquiescence to his request.</p><p>He gestured at the parchment in front of her. \u201cA letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my sister. Telling her about my travels thus far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you mentioned me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>Pleasure brightened his eyes. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not done yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have so much to relay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and I must exercise care in how I relay it. After all, I did warn her away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish girl.\u201d</p><p>Jess stood and rounded the table. His gaze followed her as she approached, watching her with open, heated appreciation. Setting one hand on his shoulder, she brushed his dark hair back from his forehead and pressed a kiss there.</p><p>\u201cIt pleases me to lay claim to you,\u201d she murmured, thinking of Masterson and how foolishly prideful the man was.</p><p>Alistair caught her by the waist. \u201cI wonder if you\u2019ll feel that way in London,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhen surrounded by those who may judge you harshly for your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m so malleable? So easily influenced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He looked up and into her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know either.\u201d</p><p>He was correct, in a fashion. She\u2019d always done exactly what was proper and expected. \u201cMy father would disagree with you. He would tell you that it takes a great deal of effort to convince me to conform.\u201d</p><p>She was pulled and arranged gently on Alistair\u2019s lap. His arms tightened around her. \u201cThinking of him and how he treated you incites me to violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t worth the effort. Besides, in some ways, I am grateful to him. What was once difficult for me became second nature and made life easier for me.\u201d She pushed her fingers through his hair. \u201cAnd look at how you\u2019ve unraveled so much of that training in just a fortnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to unravel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are succeeding.\u201d With every hour that passed, she felt a little freer. Much as she did when shedding her corset at the end of a long day. She was beginning to doubt her ability to accept her former constraints if faced with them again. \u201cDoes that frighten you? Or cool your interest? As I fall so easily into your arms, does the lack of a worthy challenge bore you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou challenge me every moment, Jess. You frighten me just as often.\u201d He rested his head against her breast. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be dependent upon someone else for anything, yet I find myself dependent upon you.\u201d</p><p>Jess wrapped her arms around his broad shoulders and set her chin atop his crown. She might have guessed that a man like Alistair, who never did anything in half-measure, would give his affection with similar abandon. But she hadn\u2019t expected that he would want to commit himself to one woman when his choices were so vast. \u201cI confess, I\u2019m terrified. Everything has changed so swiftly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so terrible? Were you so happy before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not unhappy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recognize myself. Who is this woman who sits on rakes\u2019 laps and offers sexual favors with the ease of offering a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine, and I like her quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would, naughty man.\u201d She nuzzled her cheek against his hair. \u201cDid your mother love you well, Alistair? Is that why you are so adept at caring for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did, despite all the grief my conception and birth caused her. I would do anything to ensure her happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t she love to have grandchildren?\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, he looked at her. \u201cThat is Baybury\u2019s responsibility as the heir. He will see to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is your responsibility?\u201d she queried, stroking her thumb tenderly across his cheek.</p><p>\u201cTo be the scapegrace of the family, corrupting fine young widows and luring them to sin.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. With her lips against his, she said, \u201cWhile I endeavor to see that you remain upon the straight and narrow path you\u2019ve set for yourself these last years.\u201d</p><p>His strong hands slid up either side of her spine. \u201cWhat a pair we shall make. The wicked widow and the reformed rake.\u201d</p><p>Jess quelled the quiver of unease in her stomach, telling herself there was time enough to address the brutal realities of their association. So much had happened in such a short time, and there was still a long road to travel before it could be said with certainty that they were meant to go on together. In the interim, she would follow his lead. If it was meant for their happiness to be temporary, so be it. It was too late for her to retreat now.</p><p>She pressed her lips to the tip of his nose. \u201cLet\u2019s have that glass of claret now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>\u201cBeg your pardon, Lord Tarley.\u201d</p><p>Michael paused with his foot on the first step of Remington\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club and turned his head to find a coachman standing off to the side with his hat in his hands. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lady begs a moment of your time, if you would be so kind.\u201d</p><p>Looking past the coachman\u2019s shoulder, Michael noted the hackney waiting nearby with curtains drawn over the windows. His pulse quickened with hope and expectation. The occupant could be any overly bold debutante, he supposed, but he wanted it to be Hester.</p><p>With a nod, he acknowledged the summons and approached the equipage. He paused directly outside the door. \u201cCan I be of service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael. Get in, please.\u201d</p><p>He almost smiled, but refrained. Opening the door, he climbed in and took the squab across from Hester. Her perfume filled the enclosed space. While the sunlight was strong enough to filter through the curtains and offer enough illumination to see, the sense of illicit intimacy was overpowering.</p><p>And surely contained entirely within his own mind.</p><p>At least he thought so, until he saw the handkerchief she smoothed over her lap. She had given him a kerchief once before, as a sign of her maidenly esteem when he\u2019d played at being a knight in shining armor. Ages ago. Another lifetime.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to give me a token to carry into battle?\u201d he asked, forcing levity into his tone.</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment, looking fragile and beautiful in a pelisse of soft green trimmed in a darker color he couldn\u2019t quite determine in the semidarkness. She sighed. \u201cI cannot alter your mind about this, can I?\u201d</p><p>Her sorrowful tone prompted him to lean forward. He was struck by the change in her; the weight of unhappiness suppressed the vibrant spirit she was best known for. \u201cWhy does a simple boxing match worry you so?\u201d</p><p>Her gloved hands clenched and unclenched in her lap. \u201cRegardless of who wins or loses, it will not end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHester\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegmont will likely begin the match playfully,\u201d she said without inflection, \u201cbut as your skill becomes apparent, he will become more focused. If he cannot best you, he may succumb to his temper. Be careful should that happen. His technique will slip and he will fight to win, perhaps not cleanly.\u201d</p><p>A pistol\u2019s report could not have jolted him more violently.</p><p>\u201cI would say none of this to anyone else.\u201d Her chin lifted, reinforcing her quiet dignity. \u201cBut I suspect you\u2019ll be more deliberate in the ring. Levelheaded. You will follow the rules of the sport, and that, I fear, will preclude you from anticipating the most injurious blows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuccumb to his temper with whom?\u201d He had no right to ask, but he couldn\u2019t withhold the question any longer. \u201cAre you mistreated, Hester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry about you,\u201d she admonished, managing a smile that did little to alleviate his suspicions. \u201cYou\u2019re the one about to engage in fisticuffs.\u201d</p><p>And he was ferociously eager for that engagement to begin, more so now than just a few moments ago when he\u2019d simply been looking forward to it.</p><p>She held out the kerchief to him, but yanked it back when he moved to accept. \u201cYou have to promise to call on me, if you want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtortion,\u201d he said hoarsely, seeing the answer to his question in her evasion. His blood was boiling. She thought he would be deliberate and levelheaded? He was far from it.</p><p>\u201cCoercion,\u201d she corrected. \u201cJust so that I may see for myself that you are not unduly damaged.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s jaw clenched against undeniable helplessness. There was no way for him to intercede. What a man did with his wife was his own affair. The only recourse available to him was the one he\u2019d set in motion a week ago\u2014a few far-too-brief moments in a boxing ring, during which he could pummel Regmont to his heart\u2019s content. \u201cI promise to visit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBefore a week is out,\u201d she persisted, her green eyes narrowed in silent admonishment.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He accepted the kerchief with fierce possessiveness. A beautifully rendered \u201cH\u201d in the corner made the token even more personal. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful. Please.\u201d</p><p>With a curt nod, he exited the hackney. It pulled away before he\u2019d set foot on the bottom step of Remington\u2019s wide entrance staircase.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by his size.\u201d</p><p>Hopping from foot to foot to limber himself, Michael glanced in the direction of the voice speaking at him. He found the Earl of Westfield, an unmarried peer who suffered the same sort of matrimonial attentions he did. Lauded for his good looks and charm, the earl was liked by both men and women. \u201cNothing about the man fools me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Westfield said thoughtfully. He stepped into the eight-foot-square boxing area, which was delineated by painted lines on the hardwood floor. \u201cMakes me very glad I bet on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Michael\u2019s gaze drifted around the massive room, which was damn near packed with spectators.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am one of the few.\u201d The earl flashed the grin that stole many women\u2019s hearts. \u201cRegmont\u2019s shorter stature makes him quick and nimble. And he has stamina such as I\u2019ve never seen, which is how he wins so often\u2014he can outlast damn near everyone. That\u2019s what the others are wagering on: that you will tire before he does.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI should think that would be dependent upon how hard he is hit, and how often.\u201d</p><p>Westfield shook his dark head. \u201cFor some men, such as myself, losing is an inconvenience we\u2019d rather avoid. For others, like Regmont, it unmans them. His pride will fuel him long after you\u2019ve satisfied whatever grievance you may have against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is simple sport, Westfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with the way you\u2019re looking at him. Clearly you nurse a personal score to settle. I don\u2019t care. I just want to win my wager.\u201d</p><p>Michael might have smiled at another time, but he was too furious now. Regardless, he knew when to take the advice given to him. He also knew from the broad grin with which Regmont started the fight that the other man believed he would win. Although physical pain was the least of what the earl deserved, Michael decided humiliation would be the longer lasting punishment. He feinted around a few exploratory punches from Regmont, then channeled all his fruitless love for Hester and his hatred for her unworthy husband into a single solid blow.</p><p>Regmont crashed, unconscious, onto the hardwood less than a minute into the match.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to concentrate when you are staring at me.\u201d Jess looked across the deck to where Alistair sat with his back to a crate. He\u2019d removed his coat and now rested with one leg stretched out before him and the other pulled up to support the papers he worked with. It was a pose she\u2019d seen him adopt in bed while reading or working, and it never failed to rouse her admiration.</p><p>\u201cPay me no mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>An impossible request. Not with him looking so handsome and rakish in his shirtsleeves. Not with his long, powerful legs showcased so beautifully in expertly tailored breeches and polished Hessians. Not with the wind playing in his hair the way her fingers wished to.</p><p>It was a lovely day, slightly overcast. Cool enough that she needed a shawl, but warm enough to still be pleasurable. She\u2019d come above deck for the fresh air and was joined an hour later by Alistair and one of his portfolios. He\u2019d chosen to sit a few feet away from her, but he looked up at her often and with unexplained intensity.</p><p>Jess snorted, then returned her attention to her needlepoint.</p><p>\u201cDid the exemplary Lady Tarley just snort at me?\u201d he asked, glancing at her with a raised brow.</p><p>\u201cLadies do not snort.\u201d She thought it was sweet how often he went out of his way to be near her, even while occupied with affairs far removed from her.</p><p>He\u2019d become a friend. Someone she shared most everything with. It was a miracle that she\u2019d found two men who wanted her just the way she was. Not because of the exterior crafted by her rigid upbringing, but for the woman hidden inside, the one they made it safe for her to reveal.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps not other ladies,\u201d he said in a voice pitched low enough to reach only her ears. \u201cYou, however, make all sorts of delightful noises.\u201d</p><p>Jess became aroused by the simple provocative statement. She\u2019d gone a week without sex with him, and the craving she felt now that her courses had passed was nigh intolerable.</p><p>\u201cNow, you are the one staring,\u201d he teased without glancing at her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you are too far away for me to do anything else.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up.</p><p>Smiling, she stood. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your afternoon, Mr. Caulfield. I think I\u2019ll retreat to the comforts of my bed for a spell before supper.\u201d</p><p>She returned to her cabin, where Beth was working industriously on freshening her gowns.</p><p>\u201cLord \u2019ave mercy on Mr. Caulfield,\u201d Beth said, pausing. \u201cYou \u2019ave a wicked look in yer eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you do.\u201d Beth smiled. \u201cI \u2019aven\u2019t seen you this \u2019appy in years. I\u2019m beginning to pity the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he was well insulated from heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am occasionally wrong, milady. Rarely, but it does \u2019appen at times.\u201d</p><p>The thought widened Jess\u2019s smile. It was a relief to hear Beth\u2019s opinion. The only thing tempering Jess\u2019s contentment was the fear that such happiness couldn\u2019t last and that she was incapable of holding a man like Alistair Caulfield\u2019s attention for long. Not because she was unworthy of him, but because there were women who were worthier. Women who could give him things she couldn\u2019t\u2014experience, an adventure-some spirit to match his own, children ...</p><p>As she removed her shawl, her smile faded. They were both young. For all that he\u2019d accomplished so far in his life, Alistair still had years yet before he would feel the urge to wed and breed. He couldn\u2019t know now that such instinctual longings would assail him, but she knew. It was up to her to do the correct and responsible thing in regard to their relationship.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s easily identifiable brisk knock came at the door. Beth laughed softly and draped the gown she\u2019d been working with over a trunk. She opened the door with a broad grin. \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>Jess kept her back to the door, her eyes closing with anticipation and pleasure at the sound of his smooth, cultured reply.</p><p>\u201cWill you be needing me for anything else, milady?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Enjoy your afternoon.\u201d</p><p>The door had barely shut when she heard the thud of something hitting the sole. A heartbeat later she found herself pinned to the bulkhead by over six feet of wildly aroused male. Delighted by his unexpected fervency, she threw her arms around his lean waist and returned the passion of his kiss.</p><p>\u201cVixen,\u201d he accused, his mouth moving across her jaw. \u201cYou are deliberately trying to incite me to madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her ear with his teeth, and she arched away, laughing. Her gaze fell to the portfolio he\u2019d dropped on the floor, and she stilled.</p><p>\u201cWhen you are no longer indisposed,\u201d he growled softly, seething with sexual intent, \u201cI intend to make you pay for teasing a man who\u2019s gone without you for a sennight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not indisposed,\u201d she said absently, riveted by the drawings she saw peeking out from the edges of his carelessly discarded portfolio. \u201cI haven\u2019t been for two days now.\u201d</p><p>Alistair pulled back. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are these?\u201d She slid out of his arms and bent down beside the scattered parchment.</p><p>\u201cTwo days,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Lifting the black leather front cover, Jess\u2019s breath caught. \u201cMy God, Alistair ... These are astonishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s astonishing is your lack of desire for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd. A woman would have to be dead to escape desire for you.\u201d She stared at her image rendered in fine, precise pencil lines. The uppermost picture was of her on the deck mere moments ago, explaining his preoccupation with watching her. \u201cIs this how you see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how you are. Bloody hell, Jess. I\u2019ve been dying for you this last week. You had to have known this. You could not have missed the cockstand I\u2019ve been sporting for the last several days.\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips floated gently over the rendering. He\u2019d made her beautiful, with softened features and warm eyes. She had never seen herself look lovelier. \u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, distracted. \u201cIt would be impossible to ignore an appendage of that size when it\u2019s prodding you in the back as your cock is wont to do when you lie with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jest,\u201d he snapped. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I truly look like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do when you\u2019re looking at me. If you don\u2019t answer me, Jess, I cannot be held responsible for my actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff and nonsense. I wanted you to know, with proof, that I desire your company for more than the multitude of orgasms you are so adept at eliciting.\u201d Standing with the portfolio in hand, her breath left her in an audible rush. She flipped through the other portraits he\u2019d drawn of her, awed by his talent and skill. \u201cThere is no mystery to me at all, is there? I do not wear my heart on my sleeve; I wear it on my face for all to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t sound so put out about it,\u201d he muttered, coming to her. \u201cI\u2019m certain to regard you the same way.\u201d</p><p>Jess looked at him then. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You look at me like a feline about to pounce on its prey. While I yield and melt, you become sharp as a blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a sexual man,\u201d he said brashly. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not soft on you. I should hope you see how I feel in other ways, if not on my features.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d She shuffled his drawings, stilling when she found a picture of herself from a distant time. She was clearly younger and the parchment was yellowed with age, but what truly arrested her was the pure lust radiating from the rendering. Her eyes were wide and dark, her pupils dilated, her lips parted as if panting. The picture was a raw, intimate glimpse into the very heart of her craving for the man who stood beside her. \u201cAlistair ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night in the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possess an image of me like this, yet doubt my desire for you?\u201d</p><p>He pulled the items from her hands and tossed them on the table. \u201cI swear you will drive me insane. You deny me the means through which I feel the most connected to you in order to prove the depth of your affection?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved wryly. \u201cYou are hot blooded. Sex is like eating and sleeping to you.\u201d</p><p>His insatiability had been established early in their affair, and it helped to explain how he\u2019d been physically able to prostitute himself. Sex for her was an intimate act, always. For Alistair, it was as necessary to his health as polishing his teeth and was equally inconsequential to his emotional state. That wasn\u2019t to say she didn\u2019t feel cherished when she shared his bed, but she knew he used the sexual act to achieve ends she didn\u2019t fully understand.</p><p>He claimed the sale of his body had been born of necessity, and she believed him, but not for the reasons he presented. As young and randy as he\u2019d been, as needful of funds as he had felt, those truths didn\u2019t explain how he\u2019d come to monetize himself as a commodity. That, she suspected, came from something within him. Not without. Whether it was due to Masterson or his absent father or something else entirely, Alistair had come to find value in himself through the prices others paid to be with him. She\u2019d wanted to counter that experience by showing how she valued him in other, nonphysical ways, but it seemed he wasn\u2019t yet ready for such demonstrations. Though he relentlessly and ruthlessly forced them both to reveal their most private and painful memories to each other, in the end, he still needed her touch and her lust to feel wanted.</p><p>He backed her into the bulkhead once again, thrusting his muscled thigh between her legs to pin her in place. With one hand pressed to the wood on either side of her head, he glared down at her. \u201cYou are severely trying my patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t my intent,\u201d she said honestly, her body heating in response to the aggressive proximity of his. \u201cPersonally, I am so touched by your drawings and amazed by the purity of your talent that my heart aches.\u201d</p><p>His firm lips brushed across her temple. \u201cDo you ache elsewhere?\u201d he asked gruffly, his stance altering so that his knee pressed against her sex.</p><p>For a moment, Jess closed her eyes and absorbed the feel of his hot, hard body and the beloved scent of his skin. His desire permeated through her pores, sinking into the very marrow of her bones, forging her into an uninhibited wanton capable of reaching between his legs and cupping the rigid, pulsing length of his penis.</p><p>Alistair jerked violently, his breath hissing between his teeth. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted you from the moment I first saw you,\u201d she confessed, licking her dry lips. \u201cEvery hour I want you more.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes were dark with need. \u201cHave me every hour.\u201d She stroked him through his breeches and smalls, her body softening and moistening in heated expectation. \u201cSex is innate to you; you exude it like a heady and addicting fragrance. But how can I distinguish myself from the other women who\u2019ve desired you, unless I show you that I want more than your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other women?\u201d</p><p>That made her smile, but the severity of his features didn\u2019t change. \u201cTouch me,\u201d she begged, feeling as if she\u2019d inadvertently created a gulf between them.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Alistair\u2019s refusal to put his hands on her was an unexpected enticement. She was so accustomed to his command of their bedsport that his lack of participation made her want him even more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should burn as I have, as I do, every minute I\u2019m not inside you.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head back, she kissed his tense jaw. Prickles of heat swept across her skin. \u201cYou want to punish me.\u201d</p><p>He caught her face in his hands. \u201cNo. You\u2019ve wedged sex between us. We have to put it back into its proper place.\u201d</p> <p>Jess tugged his shirttails free of his breeches and touched the scorching skin of his back. \u201cYou are forgetting I deliberately lured you here to ravish you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you seem to think I\u2019m exceptionally obtuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d she protested. \u201cIn fact, I think you have an exceptionally fine mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The pad of his thumb stroked along the curve of her lower lip, the chaste touch igniting a raging hunger to feel his hands everywhere. \u201cYou\u2019ve been teaching me how to make love for weeks, yet you do not believe I\u2019ve learned the lesson.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers clenched into the rigid muscles bracketing his spine.</p> <p>\u201cThe very first time I had you,\u201d Alistair whispered, leaning his forehead against hers, \u201cI understood the difference between what I thought I knew about sex and what I had yet to grasp. Now, I cannot remember how I ever managed the act before you or how I could ever possibly attempt it without you.\u201d</p><p>Pushing onto her tiptoes, Jess surged into him, hugging him tightly in an effort to expend the surfeit of emotion rushing through her.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d Her face pressed into his throat. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I ever thought of an orgasm as anything other than deeply personal.\u201d Alistair withdrew his thigh from between her legs.</p><p>She made a small sound of protest, the aching of her sex unrelieved without the pressure he\u2019d exerted. \u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>He caught up fistfuls of her skirts until he bared her pantalettes. He gripped her buttocks firmly, squeezing hard enough to be almost painful. While there were times when he was playful or tender in bed, she was most violently aroused when he was ferociously lustful.</p> <p>Her fingers fumbled with the hidden buttons securing the placket of his breeches. She eventually released his straining erection, her breath catching as he fell heavily into her palms. She stroked the thickly veined length with eager hands, her desire stoked to a fevered pitch by his words and his drawings and the haste with which he\u2019d followed her from the deck. He had the ability to make her feel special and emminently desirable, as well as safe and secure. He enabled the freedom she needed to be whoever she wanted to be. As wild and unrestrained and overly bold as she chose.</p><p>Alistair watched her from beneath his lush, inky lashes. His hips rocked, thrusting his cock in and out of her greedy grip. Her sex grew slick and swollen, jealous of her hands.</p><p>As if he knew, he reached between her legs from behind, piercing the slit of her pantalettes to part her. \u201cYou\u2019re wet for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I want you to.\u201d Without warning, he clutched the backs of her thighs and lifted her. He was pulled from her hands, eliciting a soft cry of protest.</p><p>She felt the silky heat of his erection brush across her opened sex, and she whimpered in longing. Her arms encircled his broad shoulders, her mouth seeking the sensitive spot behind his ear to goad his passion.</p><p>\u201cPay attention,\u201d he ordered grimly as he began to push inside her.</p><p>Jess\u2019s head fell back against the bulkhead with a helpless moan. He lowered her onto his rigid penis with excruciating slowness, making certain she felt the stretch of every incredible inch.</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d she gasped, writhing in his unyielding grip. She could barely accommodate him in this position. And still he impaled her relentlessly, stuffing her full until she fought for every breath. When he was finally in her to the root, she was sobbing with the need to pump and grind and take her pleasure. The fact that they were both fully dressed except for the place where they were joined was searingly erotic. Her fa\u00e7ade was no impediment to Alistair. It never had been.</p><p>He kept her immobile and pinned to the bulkhead with his weight. Encircling her wrist, he pulled her hand up and pressed it over his heart. It thundered beneath her palm. His chest lifted and fell in a markedly elevated rhythm. \u201cI have exerted myself not at all. You weigh little more than a feather. Tell me, Jess, why does my heart race? For the strenuous sex we\u2019ve yet to begin? Or because it beats for you?\u201d</p><p>The fingers of her free hand threaded into his hair; her hot cheek nuzzled against his. She wanted to say something, anything, but her throat was too tight.</p><p>\u201cIf I could,\u201d he went on, \u201cI would remain like this indefinitely\u2014clasped by you, held inside you, a part of you\u2014without moving at all. When we make love, I fight climax with everything I have. I don\u2019t want to come; I do not want it to end. No matter how long I make it last, it isn\u2019t nearly long enough. I am furious when I cannot hold back any longer. Why, Jess? If all I seek is the physical relief of natural lust, just as I would seek sleep or food, why would I deny myself?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and caught his mouth with hers, kissing him desperately.</p><p>\u201cTell me you understand,\u201d he demanded, his lips moving beneath hers. \u201cTell me you feel it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel you,\u201d she breathed, as intoxicated by his ardency as she was by the finest claret. \u201cYou have become everything to me.\u201d</p><p>Clasping her tightly, he pivoted toward the bed.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Jess sank into the mattress with Alistair directly following on top of her. The descent jolted them both, his cock piercing deep as he pinned her to the bed. She moaned, perspiration blooming across her skin. He growled, fisting the counterpane on either side of her head and lunging again. The thrust was powerful, pushing her across the slippery velvet only to be stopped by his steely forearms at her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped, on the verge of climax. If she let him, he\u2019d hurtle her into her first of many orgasms within moments. He would ride her relentlessly, delaying his own release until she was witless with pleasure and trembling. He would undress her and himself while she was too satiated to move; then he would continue for hours, stripping her defenses with merciless determination.</p><p>He paused, staring down at her with a gaze so hot it flushed her skin. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>She pushed up onto her elbows. \u201cLet me have you.\u201d</p><p>Alistair straightened. He made swift work of removing his waistcoat, cravat, and shirtsleeves, all without leaving her body. He was forced to withdraw to remove his lower garments, his breath leaving him in a harsh rush as her tender tissues clung greedily to his length as he stepped back.</p><p>She took a long moment to admire the perfection of his naked body. It was a sight she would never tire of. He was long and lean, so fit that every sinewy length of tight, hard muscle was rendered in stark relief beneath his smooth skin. Her gaze traveled from his shoulders to his feet and back up again, lovingly caressing him\u2014every virile inch. He moved not at all, unabashedly affording her the pleasure of looking at him. By the time their eyes aligned, she was breathless with infatuation and potent desire.</p><p>\u201cYou are exquisite,\u201d she whispered, sliding her feet to the hardwood sole. She approached him and wrapped her arms around his trim hips, her lips pressing a kiss over his heart. \u201cAnd priceless.\u201d</p><p>His returning embrace was so fierce it nearly crushed the air from her. \u201cAnd yours, Jess. Never doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad, because I am madly besotted with you.\u201d She laid her cheek against his chest, breathing in the purely masculine scent that cloaked him. His heartbeat quickened at her words, proving what she\u2019d begun to suspect\u2014her fears were affecting him, making him anxious to cling to her as if she might drift away at any moment. An impossible notion to anyone who knew how anchored to him she was. But he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI wish you would say such things to me more often,\u201d he said gruffly, as ever so brutally, vulnerably honest that he shamed her for being so reticent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how.\u201d She leaned her head to the side as he began to unfasten the buttons securing the back of her gown.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot do it wrong.\u201d Alistair kissed the top of her shoulder, then bit her, his teeth sinking deep enough to border on painful. The feral act startled and aroused her. \u201cDid you never discuss your affection for Tarley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe subject wasn\u2019t one that came up in conversation. It was just there, between us, understood and comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He turned her away from him to loosen her stays. \u201cThat isn\u2019t enough for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am falling so far, so fast,\u201d she confessed in a low, shaken tone. \u201cI cannot stop it or moderate it. I\u2019m dizzy with it. My feelings for you frighten me, and so I expect their intensity will frighten you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive voice to your fears, as I do.\u201d</p><p>Jess closed her eyes, knowing there was still so much to learn about him. It was her fault she knew so little about the events that had shaped him; she didn\u2019t question him as he questioned her. She\u2019d been trained not to pry, but she would have to break that training if she hoped to make Alistair truly happy.</p><p>\u201cI will try. You vocalize your affection without hesitation.\u201d Her gown puddled around her feet. \u201cI envy you that ease.\u201d</p><p>He divested her of her corset, chemise, and pantalettes with now-familiar expertise.</p><p>\u201cHave you\u2014\u201d Jess cleared her throat. \u201cThere must have been someone you cared for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust there have been?\u201d He stepped back.</p><p>She looked at him over her shoulder. He waited, and she finally collected that he waited for her, anticipating the vocalization of why she\u2019d stayed him earlier. \u201cLie on the bed.\u201d</p><p>He moved to do her bidding with sleek and graceful fluidity. He arranged himself in a half-reclined position against the pillows, his long legs stretched out before him, supremely comfortable in his nakedness. She reached the side of the bed and debated where to begin. His erection was an irresistible lure\u2014thick and hard, curving up toward his navel\u2014but she adored all of him.</p><p>\u201cWho was she?\u201d she asked, suddenly jealous of the phantom woman\u2014or few\u2014from his past who\u2019d seen him thusly.</p><p>\u201cYou are so certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not begin your sexual experience as Lucien, so I cannot be the only woman you\u2019ve known carnally as Alistair.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his penis in his hand and stroked slowly, his heavy-lidded eyes unable to hide the look that said he was deliberately testing her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shameless,\u201d she said in a husky voice, climbing onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naked. My cock aches for you.\u201d</p><p>And she was hot and wet for him, no longer on the sharp precipice of orgasm, but it would take him only a moment to arouse her back to that edge.</p><p>When he reached for her, she shook her head. \u201cI want you to lie still and take what I give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie still? Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall tie you up, if I must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess ... Damnation.\u201d He glowered. \u201cIt has been seven days. Play your games later, when I\u2019ll be more receptive.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her hand around him, her breath leaving her at the heat and hardness of him. The tendons of his neck stood out in harsh relief, his teeth grinding as she caressed him far more gently than he did himself. She licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019m too close to coming to enjoy your mouth properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She mounted him, tossing one leg over his hips to position her sex above his erection. She hummed a chastising sound when he grabbed her waist. \u201cNo touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. How can I see to your pleasure if I can\u2019t touch you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to protest, but the words were strangled when she sank onto the broad, flared head of his cock. An unbidden whimper escaped her. The muscles of her thighs weakened, and she lowered, her slick sex sliding down his full, throbbing length. The entry was slow and inexorable, a fine tremor spreading across her limbs. Alistair bowed upward, grabbing her and burying his damp face between her breasts.</p><p>His hips were already moving, circling, his arms holding her still as he screwed deep into her, seeking and finding the tender spot inside her that drove her insane.</p><p>\u201cLie back,\u201d she gasped, fighting her selfish desire to succumb to his skill.</p><p>\u201cLet me make you come,\u201d he whispered starkly. \u201cLet me ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She shivered as he rocked her pelvis against his, applying pressure to her clitoris. \u201cStop. You promised!\u201d</p><p>He cursed and went still, his large body so hot it burned her skin. \u201cChrist, Jess. What are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make you come,\u201d she said, unwrapping his arms from around her. \u201cI want to watch you when you do.\u201d</p><p>Alistair sank back into the pillows with a groan. With his eyes closed, he shoved his hands through his hair. He had beautiful arms. The bunching and flexing of his biceps made her sex flutter with appreciation around his rigid penis. He cursed, his abdominal muscles lacing tight with strain.</p><p>Jess bent over him and pressed her parted lips to his. As personal as he claimed his orgasms with her were, he didn\u2019t share them. Not truly. He ensured she was exhausted from pleasure and barely lucid first, then he climaxed with his face pressed into her neck and hair, clutching her tightly even as he hid from her. Even when she brought him pleasure with her mouth, he tilted his face up and back, hindering her view.</p><p>He caught her head in his hands and angled it, taking her mouth the way he needed to, breathing in her quick exhalations as he stroked his tongue across hers. Her toes curled. Her nipples tightened in a silent plea for similar attention. His kisses were indescribable, the emotion behind them enough to break her heart. He kissed her with such passion, his lips clinging to hers, his tongue licking erotically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deep inside her, she felt him lengthen and thicken. It made her stomach flutter to think he could climax just from kissing her. He broke away, panting, fighting the inevitable.</p><p>Catching his wrists, she pulled his hands away and straightened. She laced their fingers together and lifted, sliding her sex along his cock in a satiny-slick caress. She lowered her body slowly, using his upraised arms as leverage, keeping them occupied so that he couldn\u2019t shield his face behind them.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s breath hissed through his clenched teeth, his blue eyes so dark they looked like sapphires. He was flushed, his lips swollen from her kiss, his black hair tousled by her grasping fingers. She\u2019d never seen anything as extravagantly beautiful in her life.</p><p>Her heart swelled and caused her chest to ache. Rolling her hips, she lifted again. Lowered. Listened to the soft liquid sounds that betrayed her own raging desire. She watched him from beneath her lashes, searching for clues to his pleasure. How fast to stroke over him, how deep to take him, which angle made sweat bead along his hairline.</p> <p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he gasped when she thrust down hard, his body quaking at the jolting impact. He was deep, the broad crown of his penis touching the end of her. The tension, strung wire-tight through his powerful frame, was tangible.</p><p>Jess tightened her grip on his hands and began to ride him in earnest, pumping hard and swift, tightening on the upstrokes, releasing on the downstrokes. Taking him to that deep place inside her that made his head thrash and his legs kick restlessly beneath her.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d He struggled to sit up. \u201cDamnation ... Slow down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d she coaxed breathlessly, reaching behind her and between his legs to tease the taut heavy sac of his testicles. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess.\u201d Alistair yanked his hand free of her grip and grabbed her hips. Holding her immobile, he pounded upward, his hips pistoning with such speed she could only grip his forearms and let him have his way.</p> <p>He gave a feral growl at the first wrenching spurt of semen and released her abruptly, his arms dropping to the bed so his hands could fist the counterpane. His back bowed up from the bed, his neck arching. The ferocity of his orgasm was magnificent, the way he bit out her name even more so.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she urged, riding out his climax, holding off her own so that she could absorb every nuance of his release. She was riveted by his pleasure, awestruck that she could make him feel so strongly about an act he\u2019d once disregarded completely. \u201cGod ... you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>And totally vulnerable. Undone. Emotions raced across his face\u2014pained ecstasy, need, love ... even anger.</p><p>Alistair rolled them both, taking her to the edge of the bed. He was thrusting before she could catch her bearings, grinding against her, the friction of his thick cock forcing the orgasm from her overstimulated body. She cried out as the spasms flowed through her, her fingers gripping his sides, her legs opened wide to accept everything he had to give her.</p><p>His mouth covered hers, muting the sounds they made as they climaxed violently.</p><p>I love you, she exhaled into his near-frantic kiss, no longer able or willing to contain the words or the sentiment behind them.</p> <p>In answer, he caught her close and crushed the air from her lungs.</p><p>The dipping and swaying of the ship felt apropos to Alistair, whose existence was similarly rocked. His fingers tangled in and out of Jessica\u2019s luxurious hair, his thoughts focused on the three little words he was almost certain she\u2019d said to him.</p><p>He knew from experience that women said such things in the throes of powerful orgasms and paid them no mind later. He knew she\u2019d been flush with her own feminine power, finally understanding how easily she could unravel him and strip him bare. He couldn\u2019t fight it when he was with her; he had no idea how to.</p><p>And now she was so quiet curled up against him, their skin cooling and breaths slowing. For the moment, he was well and truly spent; the dearth of arousal left him with no distraction from his turmoil.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she saying anything? Why didn\u2019t she repeat the words aloud?</p><p>He began speaking only to save his sanity. \u201cI began my sexual experiences as most randy adolescent boys do: with anyone who was pretty enough and willing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d Jessica laughed softly. \u201cI expect girls were throwing themselves at you shamelessly.\u201d</p><p>Though it was true, Alistair said nothing to that, having no desire to rouse any misplaced jealousy. \u201cMy eldest brother, Aaron, took me carousing with him one evening. I was nearly fifteen, and I wanted so much to be as worldly as he seemed to me. We eventually found ourselves at a small gathering in the home of a demimondaine.\u201d</p> <p>Her head lifted. She looked at him. \u201cAt fourteen years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly fifteen,\u201d he reminded. \u201cAnd not very innocent, if I ever was. Remember, my mother was forced to explain early on why Masterson couldn\u2019t bear to even look at me.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms across his abdomen and rested her chin upon them. \u201cHe is the only one who could ever feel that way.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips drifted along her delicate jaw. \u201cThere was a courtesan at the party. I caught her eye, and she caught mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was slender. A blonde. Delicate looking, with pale blue eyes. Depending on her mood, they occasionally appeared almost gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ...\u201d Jess\u2019s eyes became stormy. \u201cFortunate for me that I fit into your preferences.\u201d</p><p>He held back the smile certain to get him into trouble. \u201cActually, it was you who\u2019d recently set my preferences, a fortnight before, when I met you. She just happened to fit them.\u201d</p><p>Confusion marred her brow, then a dawning awareness moved across her expressive features.</p><p>\u201cShe was a poor substitute, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he went on, his gaze lifting to the wall beyond her shoulder. \u201cNowhere near as refined as you. She\u2019d long ago lost the ability to care for anyone more than she cared about herself, which suited me fine. I didn\u2019t have to like her to want to fuck her.\u201d</p><p>Jess jolted softly at his crudity, but held her tongue.</p><p>\u201cFor a short time, our affair was ideal. She found relief from her boredom in instructing me how to bed a woman properly, and I was an eager pupil. She taught me how to focus on the mechanics of the act, most likely in an attempt to prevent me from becoming emotional over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a fashion.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps not enough, because one day I arrived and found she had an acquaintance with her. Another courtesan. She wanted me to service them both, which I did.\u201d</p><p>Her arms came around him, slipping through the small gap where his reclined back curved away from the affixed headboard.</p><p>\u201cSoon one friend became two,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes she didn\u2019t participate at all. She merely watched. There were other men as well, when she felt like having two or more cocks in her at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Jessica whispered, her eyes big and dark in her pale face. \u201cWhy did you go? Why didn\u2019t you leave her to her own debauchery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo where? Home? My presence caused tremendous strain between Masterson and my mother. She was made miserable when I was around. Regardless, I never acted against my will. It wasn\u2019t odious, Jessica. At that age, I had a cockstand damn near all the time, and her bedsport provided plenty of opportunities to alleviate it.\u201d</p><p>His voice was carefully light, but she must have recognized the underlying emotion. Her cheek rubbed back and forth across his stomach, her nose nuzzling through the thin strip of hair bisecting his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI should not have pushed you so hard today,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Alistair snorted. \u201cI cannot accept an apology for giving me the best orgasm of my life.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her arms out from beneath him and wriggled her way up his torso. \u201cThe best orgasm so far,\u201d she corrected, straddling his hips and embracing his shoulders. \u201cHenceforth I will endeavor to bring you greater and greater pleasure every time we make love.\u201d</p><p>His cock twitched in its initial effort to rally. She\u2019d wrung him dry in every respect.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, with her lips to his ear. \u201cLet me hold you; I promised you I would. You don\u2019t always have to use sex to show me how you feel.\u201d</p><p>The rush of longing that assailed him was nearly too great. It stung his eyes and burned in his throat. He set his hands on the bed to hide their unsteadiness.</p><p>\u201cWas she the only woman you cared for?\u201d she asked, leaning fully against him.</p><p>\u201cIf that is what you want to call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you call it? Lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no notion. I know it was never like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are women who\u2019ve loved you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cThose who have, came to lament it. The detriments outweigh the benefits.\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips curled around the back of his neck, kneading the tense muscles. \u201cThere is no shame in what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you. I love you, and I will not regret it.\u201d</p><p>Alistair was horrified by the violent shudder that moved through him. She was deep under his skin now, able to see everything he was so adept at disguising on the surface.</p><p>God, he didn\u2019t want her to see ...</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, either,\u201d he said sharply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to trust me, Alistair, and take my word for it.\u201d Her embrace lightened, her body withdrawing as if giving him room and permission to flee.</p><p>In truth, he was tempted to. He\u2019d done things in his life that made him unacceptable ... the very nature of his birth made him unsuitable for her. She\u2019d suffered so much to become the polished, elegant, irreproachable woman she was. And with his courtship, he would destroy the social esteem she had worked so hard to attain. If he could, he would keep her captive in his bed, the one place he knew he could make her forget everything but the pleasure he could give her.</p><p>Alistair caught her close, fighting for the strength to be gentle when he felt so violently. She needed tenderness and sheltering, and he was like a battering ram against her, constantly trying to crash his way through the defenses she\u2019d been forced to build as an abused child. \u201cI do trust you,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019t I tell you everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me all the disreputable things about yourself.\u201d Jessica pulled back to look at him. \u201cAnd you say them with such defiance, as if you\u2019re daring me to turn away from you.\u201d</p><p>Better now than later. With every day that passed, she became more and more indispensable to him. Soon, he wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe without her. He already felt that way at times.</p><p>She kissed one corner of his mouth, then the other. \u201cRemain constant, and I will remain with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my every desire.\u201d He groaned as she moved sinuously against him.</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>As always, he accepted the challenge. He knew his strengths\u2014he could disregard his conscience, he was adept at making money, he was attractive, and he was good at sex. It was precious little to offer to a woman such as Jessica, but he would offer it in spades and pray it would be enough to keep her.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Hester paused on the threshold of her bedroom and stared at her sleeping husband. He\u2019d come to her often over the past sennight, seeking surcease from his torment in her bed. She tried to comfort him, tried to tell him that no one remembered a boxing match a week old, that he wasn\u2019t humiliated or diminished, but nothing she said or did soothed his inner turmoil. She was exhausted from the effort, disheartened, and sickened by his weakness and her own weakness for him. Despite everything dark and twisted that had passed between them, she still couldn\u2019t wish him ill.</p><p>It was her greatest failure that she couldn\u2019t save the man she\u2019d once loved from himself. She could not even save their love, which had withered and was surely dying. As much as it pained her, she could no longer afford to waste her energies and affections on a man who couldn\u2019t accept and value her efforts. She had a child to consider now, a tiny being who would need all her time, attention, and adoration. The strength she hadn\u2019t been capable of finding for herself, she\u2019d found for the babe growing within her.</p><p>Her shoulders went back and she moved toward the bed.</p><p>Regmont had the potential to be such a wonderful man. He was handsome and emminently charming. He had a fine wit and was brilliantly adept at everything he set his hand to. Women coveted him and men respected him. Yet he saw none of those admirable qualities in himself. Sadly, his father\u2019s demeaning and belittling words were all he heard in his head; they drowned out the praise directed his way. He felt unworthy of love, and he reacted to those feelings in the manner his father had taught him by example\u2014through violence.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t make excuses for him any longer. His most prominent traits were the need for absolute control over her\u2014from the clothes she wore to what she ate\u2014and manipulation. He laid the blame for his rages on the spirits he drank to excess and, sometimes, on her. If he couldn\u2019t accept his own culpability, there was little possibility he would change. She had to take steps to protect her child.</p><p>As she neared, he stirred, one sleekly muscled arm reaching toward her side of the bed. His head lifted from the pillow when he felt her gone. When he found her, he gifted her with a slow and sleepy smile. A soft tremor flowed through her. Tousled and naked, his golden masculine beauty was undeniable. An angel\u2019s face hiding the demons that ruled him.</p><p>He rolled to his back and pushed up to recline against the carved wooden headboard. The sheet pooled around his hips, leaving the breathtaking expanse of his chest and stomach bared. \u201cI can hear you thinking from here,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhat thoughts have you so occupied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slid his legs off the side of the bed and stood, shamelessly and gloriously naked. \u201cYou shall have my undivided attention ... in just a moment.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek on his way to the chamber pot and screen in the corner.</p><p>When he appeared again, she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m increasing.\u201d</p><p>He came to a halt so abruptly, he stumbled. Wide eyed, he paled. \u201cHester. My God ...\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t say what reaction she had been expecting, but his terrible stillness wasn\u2019t it. \u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased.\u201d</p><p>He breathed roughly. \u201cOf course I am. Forgive me, I\u2019m a bit startled. I had come to think you might be barren, like your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that partly why you become so angry with me?\u201d How much angrier would he become if he learned how she\u2019d worked to prevent conception these past few years ... ? The thought alone terrified her.</p><p>\u201cAngry\u2014?\u201d He flushed. \u201cDo not start a row. Not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never start rows,\u201d she said neutrally. \u201cI abhor discord, as you know. I had quite enough of it in my childhood to last me a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>His blue eyes glittered dangerously. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know your gentle nature so well, I would wonder if you were deliberately attempting to provoke me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy speaking the truth?\u201d Fear made her heart race, but she refused to give in to it. \u201cWe are simply having a discussion, Edward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem happy to be breeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be, once I know the baby is safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He jerked into motion then, striding to the chaise where he\u2019d discarded his robe the night before. \u201cHave you called for the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have morning sickness, which is quite normal. I\u2019m told that everything is progressing nicely so far.\u201d She fought against the urge to lift her chin, knowing the silent challenge would only aggravate Regmont further. \u201cHowever, I must take care of myself and a-avoid injury.\u201d</p> <p>A warning muscle in his jaw ticked. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need to eat more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you so all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s difficult to eat when one is in pain.\u201d His lips whitened, a warning sign she forced herself to ignore. \u201cWith that in mind, I should like to retire to the country early. You can join me when the Season ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife,\u201d he bit out, yanking the belt of his robe into a knot. \u201cYour place is by my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. But we have to think of the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike your tone, and your intimation that I am somehow a danger to my own child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you.\u201d A necessary lie. \u201cThe spirits you drink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t be drinking.\u201d His arms crossed. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t taken note of it, I have not had a drink in nearly three weeks.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d abstained for longer stretches, but something always tipped him into his cups again. \u201cCan any precaution be excessive when it concerns our child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay here,\u201d he bit out, heading toward the connecting door to his rooms. \u201cAnd I will not listen to any further nonsense about you leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward. Please\u2014\u201d</p><p>The slam of the door ended the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHow dashing you look!\u201d Elspeth praised as she descended the stairs to the visitor\u2019s foyer. \u201cWhich fortunate debutante will be enjoying your call today?\u201d</p><p>Michael ceased fiddling with his immaculate cravat and met his mother\u2019s gaze in the mirror\u2019s reflection before him. \u201cGood afternoon, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Her brow arched when he collected his hat from the console and said nothing further. The afternoon sunlight slanted onto the marble floor through the arched window above the double front doors. The indirect illumination flattered his mother, whose floral gown made her appear far younger than she was.</p><p>Her mouth curved. \u201cLady Regmont helped me put the list of debutantes together. She\u2019s very perceptive, well connected, and most eager to see you wed.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. The perfectly tailored fit of his blue coat was suddenly overly tight. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear you two are rubbing along well. I thought you might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we suit better than I expected. The poor dear has been without a mother for many years, and with Jessica gone, I can dote on Hester as I would a daughter.\u201d</p><p>He wished they could have been mother and daughter in truth, through marriage. But fate had other designs.</p><p>\u201cAnd now that she\u2019s increasing,\u201d Elspeth went on in a breezy tone, \u201cI can experience that joy as well. Preparation for your wife, whoever she may be.\u201d</p><p>Breath hissing between his teeth, Michael gripped the edge of the console and fought to collect himself. A poker through the chest could not have hurt worse.</p><p>He rounded on Elspeth. \u201cSheath your claws, Mother. You\u2019re drawing blood.\u201d</p><p>She recoiled, then paled. \u201cMichael ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked bitterly. \u201cWe both know she\u2019s beyond my grasp. You\u2019ve no need to wound me with it further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her shoulders fell, her lovely features aging before his eyes. \u201cI ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am afraid your love for her will hold you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my responsibilities. I\u2019ll see to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d She stepped toward him. \u201cI want that so badly. I thought if you knew ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I would simply shrug off my troublesome affection and move forward unencumbered?\u201d He laughed without humor. \u201cIf only it was that simple.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI want to help you. I wish I knew how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you how.\u201d He set his hat on his head. \u201cSee to Hester. Give her whatever support she may need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing to be done for the girl, Michael. Leastwise, nothing you and I can do.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cRegmont,\u201d he bit out, acid sliding through his veins.</p><p>\u201cThe way she reacts to his name ... I have seen that look before, and it never bodes well. But what can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can extend our friendship.\u201d He moved toward the door, which was hastily opened by the butler. \u201cAnd pray.\u201d</p><p>Hester\u2019s breathing quickened as she entered her parlor. Michael stood when she swept in, his dark eyes heating with masculine appreciation. She basked in that warmth, allowing it to thaw the frozen recesses of her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou waited the entirety of the sennight before keeping your promise to call on me,\u201d she accused.</p><p>A faint tinge of sadness marred the smile he gave her. \u201cMy mother suggested I wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She sat on the settee across from him. \u201cShe is a wise woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe affection is mutual.\u201d Hester smoothed her skirts, feeling unaccountably nervous. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been half-mad with the need to ask that question of you. You spoke of some things when I last saw you. I feared I might have aggravated ... that I caused you unnecessary ...\u201d He scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d His hand fell to his lap, and his gaze sharpened. \u201cI should have let him win. I was too arrogant\u2014too angry\u2014to do so. I should have been thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>Hester\u2019s heartbeat thudded in a strong, steady rhythm as if revived. In truth she felt more alive in Michael\u2019s presence than she had in many years. \u201cYou were thinking of me, were you not?\u201d</p><p>He tensed, then flushed.</p><p>\u201cWhatever promise you made to my sister to look after me,\u201d she went on, \u201cI doubt she expected you to take the responsibility to such lengths. But I\u2019m touched that you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need a champion?\u201d he asked softly, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cThere is a princess out there waiting for you, gallant knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God.\u201d He pushed to his feet with graceful violence. Controlled, despite his frustration. \u201cI hate talking in riddles.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at the maid who set a tea service on the low table in front of her. When the servant departed, Hester said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question about how you\u2019re faring.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly and resumed his seat. \u201cAs well as can be expected, under the circumstances. I never realized how many tasks Benedict faced. He bore them all with quiet efficiency. I have yet to figure out how he managed. He must have found more hours in the day than have been allotted to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a wife to support his efforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, if one more individual posits that a spouse will alleviate all my burdens, I cannot be held responsible for my reply.\u201d</p><p>Hester laughed softly, secretly and horribly pleased to hear that finding a wife was not high on Michael\u2019s list of priorities. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe you would find a wife helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am barely keeping my own head above water. I haven\u2019t the faintest idea of how I would care for a spouse at this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to find a wife who will care about you. It shan\u2019t be hard. You are very easy to adore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only you spoke from experience,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI do, of course.\u201d</p><p>His beautiful mouth twisted wryly. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than I realized,\u201d she confessed. \u201cMore fool I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHester ...\u201d Surprise swept over his features, followed swiftly by stark despair.</p><p>How had she missed the signs that Michael carried a tendre for her? She had been blinded by Regmont\u2019s rakish charm and the sensual spell he wove so well. By the time they wed, she\u2019d been desperate for the consummation of their union, aroused to a fever pitch by clandestine touches, ravenous kisses, and hotly whispered promises of boundless pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe shall find you someone who loves you madly,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cSomeone whose primary concern is your happiness and pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would resent me after a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hester set about preparing the tea, spooning tea leaves into the steaming pot. \u201cYou will reciprocate her affections soon enough. You won\u2019t be able to help yourself. And then you shall live in contentment ever after, as you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of you?\u201d</p><p>Leaving the tea to steep, Hester straightened and set her hand over her stomach. \u201cI have my own joy on the way.\u201d</p><p>His smile was genuine, if melancholy. \u201cI could not be happier for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. So let\u2019s narrow the list I assisted your mother with.\u201d She stood, and he stood with her. Moving to the escritoire by the window, she opened it and withdrew a sheet of foolscap. She settled onto the wooden seat and opened her inkwell. \u201cYou can list desirable attributes, and I will record them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should rather go to the tooth drawer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She assumed her most formidable expression.</p><p>\u201cBlast. Not that look, Hester, please. I thought you liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHair color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot blond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEye color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot green.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael ...\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms and arched a brow. \u201cHave to give the gel a fighting chance. Wouldn\u2019t be sporting otherwise.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. Beside her, on the other side of the window, whips cracked against horseflesh and whinnies rent the afternoon. On most days, Hester sat by the window and watched the world go about its business. The thought of happier homes and lives just beyond the one she was trapped in offered her comfort. At the moment, however, she was content to focus her attention on her own life and the vibrant man who so briefly occupied it. \u201cTall or short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a preference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlender or voluptuous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProportional is all I ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular talents?\u201d she queried, glancing at him as he approached. He moved with such economical grace and confidence that she couldn\u2019t stop herself from watching.</p><p>Michael drew to a halt beside her, resting his arm along the top of the escritoire. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSinging? The pianoforte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI truly don\u2019t care about such things. I will follow your discretion.\u201d</p><p>Hester looked at him, her gaze taking in his smartly dressed form. \u201cBlue flatters you, my lord. I can say in all honesty that no other gentleman wears the hue better.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled. \u201cWhy, thank you, my lady.\u201d</p><p>The warm pleasure on his face arrested her, freezing her in a moment weighted with impossible possibilities. She struggled to find the will to break the sudden tension and ended up with irrelevant discourse spoken in a throaty voice. \u201cI am a terrible hostess. The tea is getting cold.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t move. He was close enough that she could smell the verbena from his toiletries. It mixed wonderfully with his personal scent, creating an invigorating and enticing fragrance.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI will enjoy the company regardless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI danced my first waltz with you,\u201d she said, remembering.</p><p>\u201cMy feet are still recovering, I fear.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open in exaggerated affront. \u201cI followed your lead flawlessly!\u201d</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d she pressed. She\u2019d wanted him to be her first public partner because she trusted him and felt safe with him. She had known he might tease her, but only good-naturedly, and he would make the whole torturous first experience fun. He\u2019d led her so well and kept her too engaged to fret, so that she left the dance floor with a feeling of triumph. She hadn\u2019t felt so good about herself in years.</p><p>\u201cAs if I could ever forget any moment when you\u2019d been in my arms,\u201d he said softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clinging to those phantom feelings, she pushed to her feet so quickly, she upended the chair. She caught him by the lapels and pressed her lips to his. The kiss was swift and chaste, a show of gratitude for reminding her of the bold and vivacious girl she used to be.</p><p>She pulled away, blushing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Michael stood rooted, his dark eyes hot and avid. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Smoothing her hair back with shaking fingers, Hester moved to the tea service. She focused on breathing deep and evenly, attempting to regulate her racing heart. She heard him right the chair behind her just as she caught sight of Regmont filling the doorway.</p> <p>Her heart stopped beating altogether.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Hester breathed.</p><p>Michael froze, hearing the fear in her voice as if she\u2019d screamed in terror. Pivoting, he faced whatever threatened her and found himself staring into the face of a man who festered with fury and ill will. Michael sized up his opponent, noting the earl\u2019s fisted hands and clenched jaw. Though he\u2019d never known Regmont well, he was certain the man had changed over the past few years. Michael remembered a cocky fellow, whose saving grace had been the warmth and affection in his eyes when he looked upon his wife. There was none of that tenderness now. Only cold calculation and sharp suspicion.</p><p>\u201cRegmont.\u201d Michael was amazed his tone was so nonchalant when he felt like lunging across the room and pummeling the man responsible for Hester\u2019s unhappiness.</p><p>\u201cTarley. What are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Michael gave a deliberately casual shrug, uncertain of what Regmont had seen and knowing he would have to tread carefully if he was to spare Hester any further undue suffering. \u201cMy mother sent me. It was either come here and assist with her matchmaking efforts or find myself paired with a spouse I can\u2019t tolerate.\u201d</p><p>Regmont looked to his wife. \u201cOh? I\u2019ve been told Lady Pennington has begun visiting often.\u201d</p><p>Hester looked pale, her eyes haunted. She swallowed and said, \u201cShe would turn to Jessica, if my sister were here. Since she is not, I\u2019ve been helping the countess become acquainted with the debutantes this Season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Michael said, returning to his former seat. \u201cPlease don\u2019t encourage them.\u201d</p><p>The earl joined them, taking the seat beside Hester. She took a deep breath and began serving tea.</p> <p>Regmont received his cup and saucer first, then took a sip. He set the china down on the table. \u201cThis is barely warm.\u201d</p><p>Hester winced.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies,\u201d Michael said. \u201cI burned the tip of my tongue with coffee this morning and it still stings. Lady Regmont was kind enough to oblige me.\u201d</p><p>Regmont pivoted on the seat, angling his knees toward his wife. \u201cAnd what occupied you while you waited for the tea to cool?\u201d</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, Hester looked at her husband with a smile as cool as the beverage he complained about. \u201cI was transcribing Tarley\u2019s spousal wish list.\u201d</p><p>The earl\u2019s gaze shot over to the escritoire. He stood in a fluid rush and crossed the room with short, swift strides. He lifted the length of foolscap, his icy gaze raking over the few notations. Then he glanced up at Michael with a smoothed brow. \u201cBrunettes and redheads only?\u201d</p><p>In answer, Michael waved one hand carelessly.</p><p>Regmont laughed, his tension broken and agitation eased. \u201cRedheads are handfuls, you know, Tarley. Ask Grayson, or Merrick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like spirited women.\u201d The way your wife used to be before you bullied her ...</p><p>\u201cLady Regmont will steer you in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>Michael turned his back to the earl, hiding the hatred, disgust, and sick helplessness he was certain he couldn\u2019t disguise on his face. If Benedict had still been with them, Michael could have stolen Hester away from this misery. They could have fled to the West Indies or the Continent or America. Anywhere in the world she wanted to go. But he was chained to England now.</p><p>They were both trapped in lives they did not want.</p><p>And there was no way out for either of them.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cLady Tarley!\u201d</p><p>Jessica altered the angle of her parasol and caught sight of the short, portly gentleman waving madly at her from the end of the gangplank.</p><p>\u201cYour steward,\u201d Alistair explained as he steadied her with a hand at her elbow. \u201cMr. Reginald Smythe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your impression of him?\u201d She lifted one gloved hand in a slight wave that acknowledged the man\u2019s vigorous efforts to attract her attention amid the noise and activity of the quayside. The smells of tar and coffee blended, teasing her nostrils, and raucous cries of seagulls competed with the calls and shouts of able-bodied sailors loading crates and barrels onto fat-bellied ships.</p><p>\u201cA decent fellow. Certainly competent. Calypso has nearly two hundred slaves and they are content enough to be highly productive. However, he could stand to be less antiquated in his views of women in trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are more progressive than most gentlemen, I suspect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my experience, women can be shrewd and ruthless in financial matters. It pays to do business with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I would wager they make concessions to you that they would for few other men.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his blue eyes brilliant even when shadowed by the brim of his hat. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Alistair\u2019s presence only added to her swelling happiness at returning to the lush, verdant island she remembered so fondly. Her memories had painted the landscape in jeweled tones, and she was delighted to see she hadn\u2019t embroidered her recollections. Behind her, the ocean was the pale blue of an aquamarine. In front of her, the emerald hills and mountains rolled across the landscape. Benedict had once told her that at no point on the island was the ocean more than a score of miles away.</p><p>Paradise, she\u2019d called it. A lucrative one, he\u2019d agreed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Caulfield.\u201d Mr. Smythe touched the brim of his brown hat in greeting.</p><p>\u201cMr. Smythe.\u201d</p><p>The steward looked at Jess. \u201cI trust you had a safe and enjoyable journey, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could not have been more pleasurable,\u201d she said, thinking of Alistair and how different she felt now from when she\u2019d boarded his ship. She\u2019d started the journey as a widow, certain she would be alone for the rest of her life. She ended with a lover, a man to whom she\u2019d bared her body and soul, revealing memories of a past she had previously shared only with Hester.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s fingers stoked the bend of her elbow.</p><p>Mr. Smythe nodded, then turned to gesture at the landau waiting nearby. \u201cWe\u2019ll have your trunks brought along after you, Lady Tarley. Good day, Mr. Caulfield. I shall be making an appointment to meet with you later this week.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Alistair. After six weeks at sea, during which their relationship had sprouted and blossomed, they were finally faced with separation. This was the point where they parted ways, she to her residence and he to his.</p><p>He met her gaze; his own sharply focused as he waited.</p><p>Jess could see the question in his eyes\u2014how would she react now that they were once again faced with the rules of Society?</p><p>Her reaction was fiercer than she could reasonably share. She wanted him beside her, always. In public and in private. Across their personal dining table for the morning meal and next to one another in a box at the theater. She wanted that, and she would have it if he agreed.</p><p>She spoke with feeling. \u201cI know you must have a great deal to attend to, Mr. Caulfield, but would you be able to join us for supper? It would save you from making an appointment, Mr. Smythe, and having to report to me after the fact.\u201d</p><p>Smythe blinked, clearly startled.</p><p>Alistair grinned at her first salvo in the battle for control of the plantation. He tilted his head in a regal acknowledgment. \u201cIt would be my pleasure, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Raising her skirts, Jess climbed up the side of the hill. Her boots slipped occasionally in the rain-soaked soil, but Alistair was behind her and she knew he would grab hold of her if she fell. He was always catching her, always urging her to take great leaps with the security of knowing he waited with arms outstretched.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, drawing her attention to a gazebo set in a clearing to the left of where they ascended. The structure was immediately recognizable\u2014it was a miniature replica of the one on the Pennington estate, with the addition of netting around the back and sides. In the center, a low dais supported a wealth of blankets and pillows.</p><p>She turned, facing Alistair as he joined her. From this vantage, they had impressive views of the sugarcane fields below and the ocean in the distance.</p><p>He drew abreast of her. \u201cHave you seen the cane fields burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll remedy that when the time comes. I will take you to a vantage downwind of the smoke and stench. For all the danger and destruction, it is a sight not to be missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it with you.\u201d She looked at him, admiring his proud profile. \u201cI want to see everything with you.\u201d</p><p>His returning look was fierce and heated.</p><p>She moved toward the gazebo. \u201cThis is what has been occupying you during the day?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d started coming to her at night with small cuts on his hands and the occasional darkening of a faint bruise on his forearms. No matter how she tried to wheedle the cause out of him, he resisted\u2014although he did encourage her to use every means at her disposal to convince him to be forthcoming ...</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, studying her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered to have such effort expended to seduce me.\u201d Her mouth curved on one side. \u201cI also see that whenever my courses run, you burn with restless energy. I do believe you require sex more than food and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with you.\u201d He moved under the roof and set down the basket he\u2019d carried up with them. \u201cAnd you know why. When I\u2019m inside you I know you won\u2019t be getting away. I know you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to the view and faced him, the most wonderful view of all. \u201cWhat if you could claim the outside of me as well? With your name as my own and your ring on my finger. Would that calm you?\u201d</p><p>Alistair grew painfully still. He did not even blink. \u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you frightened now?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAfraid I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d He broke his stillness to move toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already told you I love you. Many, many times. Every day, actually.\u201d She exhaled in a rush, fighting for courage. She couldn\u2019t restrain her affection; it was too big to contain, swelling her chest and making it hard to catch her breath. \u201cI love you enough to walk away if there is any possibility you might desire to be a father someday.\u201d</p><p>His throat worked on a hard swallow. \u201cThere are a great many foundlings, if we want children to spoil.\u201d</p><p>Her heartbeat quickened with hope.</p><p>He held out his hand. She placed hers within his and allowed him to lead her to the dais. He urged her to sit and she did. Then, he sank to one knee in front of her.</p><p>Understanding dawned. \u201cAlistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to beat me to it, Jess,\u201d he said with tender gruffness, reaching into the tiny pocket of his waistcoat. He wore no coat, no cravat. Scandalous and completely unacceptable, but who would see them up here? That had been the most difficult part of the past week\u2014acting as if they were no more than acquaintances in public when they were searingly intimate in private.</p><p>It was the worst sort of torture watching the local debutantes, widows, and even some of the married women paying him elaborate, fawning attention. She\u2019d had to suffer through watching those who claimed him as a dance partner or an escort into dining rooms. She had watched pretty young girls flirt with him, girls capable of giving him the family he\u2019d never truly had and that she could never give him.</p><p>Alistair encouraged none of them, his gaze finding her in quiet moments and revealing his ferocious hunger. She tried not to seek him out, knowing her face would betray how smitten and besotted she was. How desperately in love she\u2019d fallen. How bleak and lifeless her existence would be without him.</p><p>The truth of it was that he managed the public side of their relationship much better than she did. As proprietary as he felt about her private self, he wasn\u2019t possessive of her public face. Instead, he seemed to relish watching her swim the social waters, admiring the ease with which she managed the necessary interactions\u2014the discourse, the dancing, and all the rest. He was proud of her, content to watch her shine in her element, which made all the pain and sorrow she\u2019d experienced to become so consummate seem worthwhile.</p><p>He withdrew a ring. A thick gold circlet topped with an ostentatious ruby as big as her knuckle. The brilliant blood-red stone was a pillowed square surrounded by diamonds, boldly proclaiming the worth of the man who\u2019d purchased it. The gem was almost vulgar in its size and purity of clarity, which made her smile. If her marriage to Alistair wasn\u2019t enough to show the world she\u2019d changed, the ring would certainly manage the task.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured, sliding the ruby onto her finger. \u201cI will marry you. As soon as possible. By the end of the week if we can manage it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She cupped his face in her hands, her fingers brushing his inky hair back from his forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this properly. In England. With the banns read and endless celebrations and our families in attendance. I want the world\u2014and most especially you\u2014to know that I do this after a great deal of thought and careful consideration. I know what I do, Alistair. I know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to be wed before we return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you,\u201d she vowed, knowing his concern.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d He caught her wrists with a gentle, yet unyielding grip. \u201cBut there will be women who ... at routs and luncheons ... they\u2019ll know\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2014Lucius,\u201d she interjected. \u201cThey do not know you, not as I do. And they never will.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, she pressed a kiss to his furrowed brow. \u201cMy darling. You haven\u2019t faith that anyone can love you unconditionally, because no one ever has. But I do. How could I help myself? And over time, you\u2019ll see that the changes you wrought in me are not reversible. I am who I am at this moment because of you, and without you I would cease to exist. I have no notion how I\u2019ll survive the next few months until you can join me in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin you?\u201d he asked sharply. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter from Hester arrived this afternoon. She must have sent it directly after we left, perhaps even the same day, which tells me she knew she was increasing before I departed and didn\u2019t want the news to stay me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour sister is with child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe she could ever think I wouldn\u2019t return to her posthaste. As I told you, she hasn\u2019t been well for some time. She will need looking after. I must be with her now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll return with you, of course. With luck, I can arrange for us to sail within a fortnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot ask that of you. You came to the island for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You. The same reason I returned to England. I traveled with you because there was no reason to stay there while you were here, and the same is true in reverse.\u201d</p> <p>Jess\u2019s thoughts froze with surprise, remembering the night they\u2019d spoken on the deck of the Acheron and she had wondered if he was going home for a woman. To learn she was that woman was slightly overwhelming. And deeply moving.</p><p>He must have seen the realization on her face. His jaw tensed. \u201cMy lust was fierce, you know that. I won\u2019t say it was love, but it was deeper than flesh. My desire for you gave me hope that I could find joy in sex again, that I could approach the act with something beyond detachment and a need for base physical release. I had to have you, Jess, whatever the cost or effort.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, wondering why he wouldn\u2019t say he loved her. Perhaps he didn\u2019t. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t. Perhaps what they had was all she would ever claim from him.</p><p>After a moment\u2019s contemplation, she decided that whatever he could give of himself was enough. She loved him enough for the two of them.</p><p>Releasing him, she pulled away and reclined. She stretched out on the pillows, reaching her arms above her head and arching her back in blatant invitation. If his need was the only part of himself he had to give her, she would take it all.</p><p>Alistair crawled onto the dais. He straddled her, his hands pressing into the pillows on either side of her shoulders. Lowering his head, he took her mouth, his lips sealing to hers.</p> <p>A warm, humid breeze blew over them. In the distance, she heard the shouts of men and the distant screeching of gulls. They were outside, where anyone could see, and that increased her excitement. She wrapped her arms around his neck and hummed her pleasure into his kiss.</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d he murmured against her parted lips, \u201cthat I might have to convince you to wed me. That it might take some time. Weeks. Months. Maybe years. I built this place to make it hard for you to run while I presented my arguments.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cA captive audience. How would you have stopped me from leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps hiding your clothes and keeping you pinned with my cock. I also brought a few bottles of your favorite claret with me. I remember your being much more agreeable after a glass or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked man.\u201d Her gaze lowered to his throat and the strong pulse beating there. \u201cDo your worst. I rescind my acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you didn\u2019t accept. You asked; I accepted.\u201d He nuzzled the tip of his nose against hers. \u201cAnd I cannot tell you what it means to me that you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can show me.\u201d Her fingers stroked his nape in just the way he loved.</p><p>Alistair slid to the side of her. \u201cRoll over.\u201d</p> <p>She did as he bade, her spine tingling as she faced away from him. He released the tie at the small of her back, then deftly unfastened the buttons that secured her pale lavender gown. As the pressure of his fingers worked downward, her anticipation grew. For all her teasing about his sexual appetite, hers for him was equally fierce. After a week without him while her courses ran, her hunger for his touch and attention was ravenous.</p><p>\u201cI want you to buy a trousseau,\u201d he said. \u201cSpare no expense. I do not begrudge your mourning for Tarley\u2014I know he was good to you\u2014but I don\u2019t want to see you dressed in tribute to your grief whilst wed to me.\u201d</p><p>Looking over her shoulder, she nodded, loving him all the more.</p><p>He stroked his tongue between her shoulder blades. \u201cI should like to see you in red. And gold. Also a vivid blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo match your eyes. I would like that. Perhaps you should come with me to the modiste\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His strong hands reached into the parted halves of her gown and gripped her waist. \u201cYou\u2019ll be half-dressed while they measure you. I would enjoy the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, I would enjoy being undressed.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her gently, then rolled to his back. \u201cAs you desire.\u201d</p><p>Jess slid off the end of the dais and stood.</p><p>Tucking a pillow behind his head, Alistair settled more comfortably. He bent one knee and set one wrist atop it, presenting a relaxed and somewhat insolent pose. The multitude of colorful pillows and the netting between the posts reminded Jess of the story she\u2019d told about a desert adventure and a lusty sheik.</p><p>She lowered her head deliberately, affecting a meek and submissive posture. Lifting her hand, she caught the neckline of her gown and tugged it over her shoulder. First one side, then the other. The bodice caught on her breasts and she stilled.</p><p>\u201cYou could ransom me, Your Highness,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe price you could fetch for me, in addition to the spoils from the caravan, would certainly outweigh whatever pleasure you might have from me in your bed.\u201d</p><p>The surprise Alistair felt was tangible. For a moment, he held his silence, his chest lifting and falling with studiously steady breaths. Then, \u201cBut you are the reason I raided that caravan, my lady. Why expend the effort if I only intended to give you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the fortune you will gain upon my return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only treasure that interests me is between your thighs.\u201d</p><p>A rush of heat swept over her skin.</p><p>He jerked his chin imperiously. \u201cTake it off. Let me see you.\u201d</p><p>Jess licked her dry lips and took a heartbeat longer to obey. Catching her skirts in her hands, she tugged downward gently, as if she was shy about revealing the body he knew better than she did. The dress slipped from her arms and torso, and pooled on the planked floor.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cthe rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be frightened. In a few moments, I will give you pleasure such as you\u2019ve never known.\u201d His gaze narrowed slightly. \u201cNor will you again after me.\u201d</p><p>Jess shifted from foot to foot, glancing at him furtively. He reached between his legs, brazenly stroking the thick length of his erection. A voluptuary to his bones. Skilled ... far more experienced than she would ever be. Unless he remedied that lack of knowledge, which she doubted he would unless she pushed him. She suspected he feared corrupting her any more than he believed he already had, while she feared his boredom in her bed.</p><p>\u201cI cannot say the same,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Alistair rose gracefully to his feet, moving with a sleek and predatory fluidity. \u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>He rounded her, as if examining her charms. Then he drew to a halt at her back, sliding his arms under hers and embracing her from behind. In a swift possessive grasp, he filled his hands with her breasts, startling a gasp from her.</p><p>Her head fell back onto his shoulder. \u201cBut you\u2019ve had so many concubines who are more adventurous than I know how to be. What will become of me once the novelty wears thin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou underestimate my desire for you.\u201d His lips moved against the shell of her ear. He pulled her against him, making her feel the undeniable evidence of his arousal. \u201cFeel how hard I am for you? I\u2019ve wanted you too badly, for too long. I\u2019ll never have enough of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore the raid, did you imagine having me? Did you dream of how you would have me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night,\u201d he growled, his fingers clasping around her taut nipples.</p><p>Turning her head, she pressed her cheek to his. \u201cShow me how you dreamed of me. Teach me all the ways I can please you. I want to learn.\u201d</p><p>One hand slid down her stomach, then between her legs. \u201cYou no longer wish to be ransomed?\u201d</p><p>Jess gasped as his fingers slipped into the slit of her pantalettes and parted her. With fingertips roughened by the woodworking required to build her this place of seduction, he stroked over her clitoris, knowing just how to touch her to make her writhe. \u201cIf you do, who will quench this fire in my blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else.\u201d Alistair\u2019s teeth nipped at her earlobe. \u201cI\u2019d castrate any man who tried.\u201d</p><p>Maddened by the rolling of her nipple and the sudden slide of a long finger into her grasping sex, Jess rolled her hips and whimpered. A second finger joined the first, thrusting slow and easy. She sucked in a deep breath, intoxicated by his sun-warmed scent. \u201cPlease ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBend over.\u201d He punctuated the order by pushing her down.</p><p>Jess tumbled forward, stemming her fall by extending her arms. Alistair straightened, allowing the breeze to blow over her back. He pushed down the stockinette of her pantalettes. Perspiration misted her skin.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he praised, running his hands over her derriere. Cupping her sex, he massaged her with his palm. \u201cSo swollen and slick. Do you need a cock to fill you, my lovely captive? Do you ache with emptiness?\u201d</p><p>She was so vulnerable like this, unable to watch his face or movements. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>There was a faint rustle of displaced clothing, then the wide head of his cock notched against her. It was the only warning she had. Gripping her hips, he yanked her back as he thrust, piercing deep with a single lunge of his hips.</p><p>Crying out, she fought to keep her arms steady and extended.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d He rolled his hips, nudging against the end of her. \u201cI\u2019m so deep in you, Jess. Do you feel how deep I am?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed on a shaky exhalation. She felt the doeskin of his breeches against the backs of her thighs and the cuffs of his shirtsleeves against her hips. When she looked down, she saw his muddy boots. He was fully dressed, shielded from exposure, whereas she was mostly nude and mounted. The lascivious image in her mind of how they would look to a bystander spurred her desire. Aroused beyond bearing, she rippled along his length. Alistair\u2019s answering groan carried on the breeze, but she didn\u2019t care if anyone heard them. Her focus had narrowed to the point where they joined and the tender flesh that quivered around his thick penetration.</p><p>He began to move. Not with the rough, pounding tempo she\u2019d expected in such a primitive position, but at a leisurely pace. Deliberate. Taking her with long, sinuous glides of his thick penis into her clenching depths. He devastated her when he took her like this. He was unhurried. Rhythmic and graceful. Wickedly practiced. He worked her hips in time to his thrusting, circling, rubbing, and stroking over every tender spot.</p><p>Her legs gave out. She fell to her knees on the dais, and he slipped out to the tip, then rammed deep as he followed her down. She cried out ... conquered. He kneed her legs wider, quickening his rhythm. His heavy sac smacked against her wet flesh again and again, the cadenced erotic slapping against her clitoris adding an entirely new level of sensation. Her arms lost their strength and her shoulders sank into the pillows, angling her hips even higher. Nothing impeded Alistair\u2019s possession of her now, but still he kept that controlled and steady pace that had her clawing at the silk around her.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re tight like this,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cAnd so wet. I want to come in you now ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m going to fuck you until I can no longer stand.\u201d</p><p>His crudity surged through her in a violent shiver. She climaxed in a heated rush, her body vibrating with the force of it. He cursed as she milked him with ecstatic pulses. He held still and ground against her, staving off his own pleasure. His fingers dug into her thighs with bruising force. And she loved it. Loved that she could break his steely control just by taking whatever he needed her to take.</p><p>Jess surrendered, letting the orgasm flow through her unchallenged. Alistair\u2019s grip lightened as she relaxed, his hands soothing her with gentle caresses and soft murmurs. She was so lost in the languid afterglow of her climax, it took her long moments before she realized he was too still. Opening her eyes, she turned her head and found him looking down at her with a clenched jaw having nothing to do with desire.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Her pleasured haze receded in the face of the darkness sweeping over his features.</p><p>His voice came clipped and furious. \u201cWhat are these marks on your skin?\u201d</p><p>Jess winced, hating that he\u2019d seen the thin silvery scars marring her derriere and upper thighs. If they hadn\u2019t been outside in the unforgiving sunlight, he might never have seen them. Although she detested the truth, she gave it to him. \u201cSurely you recognize the marks of a switch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d He curled over her, mantling her body with his own, his grip around her torso like iron bands. Fiercely protective and obstinately comforting. \u201cDo you bear other scars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on the outside. But, regardless, they no longer signify.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell they don\u2019t. Where else?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, wanting nothing more than to leave their painful pasts behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhere, Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot hear in my left ear,\u201d she said softly, \u201cas you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHadley is responsible for that?\u201d He pressed his hot face into her back. \u201cJesus ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about it now,\u201d she complained. \u201cNot here. Not while you\u2019re inside me.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s open mouth rubbed against her spine, his breathing rough. \u201cI\u2019ll make you forget.\u201d</p><p>She moaned her relief as he cupped her breasts, her thoughts scattering with the ocean breeze.</p> <p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Alistair assisted Jessica down from his town carriage and took comfort in the sight of the lump beneath her white glove that betrayed the presence of his ring on her finger. Behind him, the Regmont town house waited. The redbrick home was innocuous to passersby, but it contained something undeniably hazardous to him.</p><p>He had no notion of what Jessica would do if her sister protested their nuptials. He had no notion of what he would do, since letting her go would kill him.</p><p>\u201cShe only wants my happiness,\u201d Jessica murmured, offering him a reassuring smile from beneath the brim of her straw bonnet. \u201cIt may surprise her to learn how wicked my inclinations are, but she won\u2019t object.\u201d</p> <p>He snorted. Clearly he\u2019d lost all ability to keep his emotions hidden when they related to Jessica.</p><p>Offering his arm, he escorted her up the short steps. He offered his card to the butler when the door opened and swiftly found himself in a cheery yellow parlor. He remained standing while Jessica sat. He was too restless to settle in any one spot and had no intention of lingering once Lady Regmont presented herself. They\u2019d been in port only a few hours, and he had much to attend to. His London staff had been given no warning of his return, and so his home was not yet prepared for his residency. He had a note to pen to his mother, requesting a visit so he could tell her about Jessica. And another to send to Baybury.</p><p>Impatience spurred him. There was too much to be done between now and when he and Jessica could officially announce their engagement.</p><p>\u201cJess!\u201d</p><p>He looked toward the door as Hester rushed in and found himself speechless. It had been years since he\u2019d seen her, and even then she\u2019d inevitably been with Jessica, who always stole his attention. Still, he was certain Lady Regmont had never been so delicate. He calculated the weeks. She should be five months along by now, or thereabouts, yet her condition wasn\u2019t apparent. She was far too thin and pale, making the rouge staining her cheeks seem unnaturally bright.</p><p>A chill moved through him. Had she lost the baby?</p> <p>The sisters embraced. The differences between the two were made more apparent by their similarities. Jessica glowed with vitality\u2014her eyes were bright, her lips plumped and reddened by his kisses, her skin flushed a healthy pink by the frequency and vigorousness of his ardor. Hester looked almost ghostly in comparison.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Hester said breathlessly. \u201cYou look so well! I\u2019ve never seen you so fit and happy.\u201d</p><p>Jessica smiled. \u201cI have Mr. Caulfield to thank for that.\u201d</p><p>Hester\u2019s verdant gaze moved to Alistair and remained warm. She approached with her hands outstretched. He caught them and lifted the backs to his lips, noting the prominence of blue veins beneath her parchment-like skin. The visible capillaries around her eyes and temples were also concerning.</p><p>\u201cI owe you a huge debt of gratitude,\u201d she said. \u201cAs busy as you must be, it was exceedingly generous of you to look after my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d he murmured, managing a smile. What the devil was wrong with Regmont that he allowed his wife to waste away in such a manner? Especially while carrying his child? If Jessica ever looked so thin and ill, he\u2019d keep her abed and hand-feed her relentlessly, never leaving her side until he was certain she would recover.</p><p>\u201cHow are you faring?\u201d Jessica asked, her gaze meeting Alistair\u2019s over her sister\u2019s shoulder. She looked as worried as he felt.</p><p>\u201cFamously.\u201d Hester pivoted carefully and moved to the settee. \u201cYou must have turned about directly after you arrived.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to do after I received your letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish me happy and enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jessica began to tug off her gloves. \u201cI\u2019ve done both, and now I am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am absolutely fine,\u201d Hester said. \u201cThe dratted morning sickness has passed, thank God. I am exhausted much of the time, but the doctor says that is to be expected. Come have a seat, Mr. Caulfield. It\u2019s been ages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but I cannot stay. I\u2019ve been out of the country for some time and there is much to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cShame on me for detaining you. I\u2019m grateful you brought my sister to me. Will you be seeing Lord Tarley soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Please send him my best wishes, and know that you already have them.\u201d</p><p>Jessica set her gloves on the floral-covered seat beside her. \u201cI should like to stay with you a while. I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about me,\u201d Hester argued. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reasons are entirely selfish,\u201d Jessica said smoothly. \u201cWho will help me plan my wedding if not for you?\u201d</p><p>Hester blinked. \u201cBeg your pardon? Did you say \u2018wedding\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Jessica\u2019s mouth curved and she turned to him.</p><p>Alistair couldn\u2019t look away, not when she regarded him in that manner. Her face was so expressive, her love given so fully and freely. His throat clenched tight.</p><p>\u201cTo Alistair Caulfield!?\u201d Hester cried.</p><p>He winced inwardly at the pervasive shock in her tone. Then she stood in a rush and hugged him.</p><p>I told you, Jessica mouthed from across the room, her eyes glinting with moisture.</p><p>His tension deflated by relief, he hugged Hester back. And felt nothing but bones.</p><p>After departing the Regmont town house, Alistair headed directly to Remington\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club. He needed a drink, maybe a few.</p><p>Leaving Jessica behind was damned difficult. Everything would work against them here in London, with multiple forces attempting to drive a wedge between them. When they were together, he felt as if they could manage anything. When they were apart, his driving need made him fear the worst.</p><p>Striding through the double-door entrance, he crossed the gaming area and entered the great room beyond it, his gaze skimming over faces before spotting an empty seating area in a distant corner. His brother Albert was, unfortunately, not in attendance. The sooner Alistair apprised his family of his betrothal, the sooner he could take the steps required to shut the rest of the world out of his romantic concerns. Once Jessica was his wife, Society and its meddlesome mores and opinions could go to hell. Some institutions were still sacred; what a man did with his wife was no one\u2019s business but his own.</p><p>As he crossed the room, he became aware of the numerous gazes following him. He gave curt nods to those he did business with and ignored the rest. When he reached the bar, he ordered scotch and asked for quill, ink, and parchment. His membership credentials were verified first, reminding him how long it had been since he last socialized in London. He moved to the quiet seat he\u2019d found earlier and settled into the leather wingback.</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d he muttered, lifting the tumbler to his lips. He felt the multitude of eyes on him, but couldn\u2019t fathom the interest. He even checked his attire, looking for anything out of place that might attract undue attention.</p><p>Finding no discernible reason for the curiosity he\u2019d roused, Alistair raked the room with a challenging glance, daring someone to approach him instead of furtively assessing him. To his surprise, some of the gentlemen smiled and waved, as if they were old friends. His sharp-edged wariness fled, replaced by mounting confusion. When a familiar tall, dark figure entered the room, Alistair stood with relief.</p><p>Michael\u2019s gaze found him. With eyes widened by surprise, he crossed the distance between them with long strides and caught Alistair in a fierce embrace.</p><p>\u201cHas the world gone mad?\u201d Alistair barked, holding his arm out to prevent spilling scotch down his friend\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Michael searched Alistair\u2019s face, then shot a telling glance at the fellow tending the bar.</p><p>\u201cAlive and kicking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, there is something to be said for that, is there not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>They sat. A moment later a tumbler was set before Michael. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you for another few months, at the earliest,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat would have been ideal. However, once Lady Tarley learned her sister was in the family way, she desired to come home at once.\u201d</p><p>Michael inhaled sharply, but said nothing.</p><p>Alistair took another drink, knowing how it felt to covet another man\u2019s wife. \u201cLady Regmont sends her regards. In fact, she seemed most concerned that I find you in order to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely she was thinking that you and I have a great deal in common at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we both love Sheffield women? What are we to do, exchange notes?\u201d</p><p>Michael stilled. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now. I\u2019ve known how you feel about Jessica\u2019s sibling for many years. Like Jess, your face reveals everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Jess\u2019 you say? What in bloody hell?\u201d Michael\u2019s glass hit the wood tabletop with a decisive thud. \u201cI pray you haven\u2019t been wool headed enough to play your games with my brother\u2019s widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>Michael exhaled his relief.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Alistair went on, \u201cthe games I play with my betrothed are no one\u2019s concern but my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, Alistair ...\u201d Michael stared for a long moment, then tossed back the contents of his glass in one swallow. He signaled for another. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing? Jessica is not the type of woman a man takes lightly. Your station and means, even with marriage, won\u2019t be enough to keep her happy. You will have to be cautious and discreet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr simply steadfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t jest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is no joke to me, Tarley.\u201d Twisting his tumbler back and forth, Alistair surveyed the room again, aware that others would think as Michael did\u2014that Jessica would be better served by another man. \u201cI have loved her since you and I were boys. At the time, I thought she was flawless; the one finely wrought thing in this world that might have a hope of saving my blackened soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me the poetry. Byron, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Alistair smiled, his mood softened by thoughts of Jessica. He was about to marry a diamond of the first water, a woman so heartbreakingly perfect for him that he ached just thinking about her. There wasn\u2019t a man in this room who didn\u2019t know her worth, and she was his. \u201cBut I\u2019ve since learned it is our defects that make us perfect for one another. I expect to live in monogamous marital bliss for the rest of my days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does Masterson say about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if I care what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of your mother, then?\u201d Michael challenged. \u201cShe might view this as an opportunity for you and His Grace to find common ground. Jessica is barren, Alistair. For a certainty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I care not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot be so vindictive. I know you and your father have never gotten along well, but this is a matter far greater than either of you.\u201d</p><p>A fresh beverage was set before Michael. Alistair grabbed it for his own and drained it. \u201cYour brain has been addled by overwork,\u201d he said, wiping his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou must be accountable now for decisions that will impact generations\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell. Let us be clear ... Your objection to my marrying Jessica comes not from unsuitability or incompatibility, but from your belief that I have an obligation to spawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cResponsibility is a nuisance, is it not?\u201d Michael said with surprising bitterness.</p><p>\u201cObviously the stress of your brother\u2019s passing has driven you mad. Damned if I\u2019ll give up the one thing in this world I cannot live without simply to whelp offspring in a pitiful attempt to gain acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether or not you mend the rift with your father is secondary to honoring your duty to the title.\u201d</p><p>Alistair was of the mind that walking away might be wise. Otherwise, he was certain he was only seconds away from strangling his oldest friend. While Michael had no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Alistair\u2019s parentage, he was spouting nonsense nonetheless. \u201cEnsuring the longevity of Masterson\u2019s lineage has never been, nor will it ever be, my duty.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s head tilted, his gaze narrowing. Suddenly, something akin to horror swept over his features. \u201cMy God ... You don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair Caulfield,\u201d Hester repeated, shaking her head. \u201cI would never have guessed. You two were always so cool and reserved toward one another. I always believed you didn\u2019t much care for him.\u201d</p><p>Jessica lifted one shoulder in an offhand, slightly sheepish shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s changed, but more than that, there are depths to him one cannot see unless he reveals them. And I confess, I always found him physically attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat woman doesn\u2019t?\u201d Hester leaned forward, as if imparting a great secret. \u201cThere is something deliciously wicked about him. Something sinful and decadent. And dear God, he is a man now, so large and strong. More handsome than ever, and he was stunning in his youth! It is difficult not to stare at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m horribly besotted. Truly, I have to wed him or I will embarrass myself by making calf-eyes at him.\u201d</p><p>Her sister straightened and poured more tea. \u201cThe way he looks at you is indecent. Have you shagged him yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHester!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have!\u201d Hester threw her head back and laughed, reminding Jess of the energetic girl of long ago. \u201cWell? I must know if he is as good in bed as he looks.\u201d</p><p>Just thinking about Alistair made her toes curl. \u201cHow can you leap to the conclusion that we\u2019ve been intimate? Perhaps he was a perfect gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair Caulfield? On a ship for endless days?\u201d Hester laughed her sweet, tinkling laugh. \u201cAny other man, perhaps. But not a scoundrel like he. So ... ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo ... He is as delectable as he looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Hester smiled over the rim of her cup. \u201cI am so happy for you, Jess.\u201d</p><p>Jess wanted to feel equally happy for her sister, but the circumstances didn\u2019t warrant it. Hester was far too frail, especially for a woman who was midway through a pregnancy. \u201cHow are things between you and Regmont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s equally consummate in bed,\u201d Hester said with the faintest note of bitterness in her tone. \u201cFar too skilled, actually. No man should be so knowledgeable about a woman\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he unfaithful?\u201d</p> <p>Hester\u2019s cup lowered and she looked contemplative. \u201cI have no notion. If so, his appetite for me hasn\u2019t decreased at all.\u201d</p><p>A long stretch of silence ensued as Jess tried to understand what was causing her sister so much pain. \u201cHester ...\u201d she said finally. \u201cPlease tell me what\u2019s wrong. You\u2019ve lost far too much weight. What of the baby and the nourishment required for it to grow plump and healthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll eat more now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when I\u2019m not?\u201d Jess pushed to her feet. Restless, she paced, a bad habit her father had beaten out of her in her youth.</p><p>\u201cYou have changed,\u201d Hester noted.</p><p>\u201cSo have you.\u201d Pointing to the lemon cream scones sitting untouched on the tea service tray, she said, \u201cYou adore those scones. They are your favorite. You always eat too many of them, with heaping scoops of clotted cream that fall off your fingers when you take a bite. Yet you haven\u2019t touched a one. You won\u2019t even look at them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am certain your child is.\u201d</p><p>Hester winced and Jess felt horrid, but something had to be done.</p><p>Returning to her sister, Jess sank to her knees and caught up Hester\u2019s hands, noting the skeletal thinness with growing despair. \u201cTell me. Are you ill? Have you seen a doctor? Or is it something else? Is it Regmont? Are you afraid to tell me because I suggested the pairing? Tell me, Hester. Please. \u201d</p><p>Hester\u2019s pent-up breath left her in a rush. \u201cMy marriage is no longer a happy one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Hester.\u201d Jess\u2019s heart broke. \u201cWhat happened? Did you fight? Can it be salvaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once hoped so. Maybe it would be possible if I was stronger, like you. My weakness angers him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not weak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I am. When Father turned his wrath to me and you interceded, I let you. I was grateful you were taking the switch and not me.\u201d Her mouth turned down at the corners. \u201cSo damned grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a c-child.\u201d Jess\u2019s voice cracked with unshed tears. \u201cYou were wise to allow me to intercede. It would have been foolish to do otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but courageous, too.\u201d Hester\u2019s eyes were giant verdant pools in her pale face. The rouge she wore to feign a healthy glow was incongruous against her bloodless skin, making her appear like a caricature of a bewigged and powdered peeress from times gone by. \u201cI need that courage now, and I don\u2019t know where to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will help,\u201d Jess vowed, squeezing her sister\u2019s fingers gently. \u201cWe shall find it together. As for Regmont, I\u2019m certain he must be worried sick about you, as I am. Once he sees you regaining your strength, your relationship will improve. It\u2019s natural for a woman to experience moodiness and melancholia while increasing, but that might be difficult for a man to grasp. We will just have to educate him.\u201d</p><p>Hester smiled and cupped Jess\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you cannot have children, Jess. You would be so good with them. Far better than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You will be a doting mother, and I shall be a very proud aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour betrothed loves you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he does,\u201d Jess agreed, laying her cheek against Hester\u2019s knee. \u201cHe cannot seem to bring himself to say it aloud, but I feel it when he touches me. I hear it in his voice when he speaks to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he adores you, and his desire is unquestionable.\u201d Hester\u2019s cool fingers stroked Jess\u2019s brow. \u201cYou will be the envy of every woman in England. Alistair Caulfield is rich, breathtakingly handsome, and mad for you. Toss in the dukedom and there isn\u2019t a woman alive who would not kill to trade places with you.\u201d</p><p>Jess lifted her head, laughing. \u201cYour dreams are too lofty. He\u2019ll never inherit the title.\u201d</p><p>Hester blinked. Then, her eyes widened with something akin to horror. \u201cDear God ... You don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Alistair paced before the grate in the family parlor of the Masterson residence in Town, his sleekly polished Hessians treading silently across the oriental rug. His fingers were laced at the small of his back, his hands tingling from the strain of his white-knuckled clasp. \u201cSmallpox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was soft with anguish. Louisa, the Duchess of Masterson, sat on a carved wooden chair with her back painfully straight. Her hair remained as dark as Alistair\u2019s, the glossy tresses unmarred by any gray, but her lovely face betrayed both her age and the agony of outliving three of her four sons. The portrait of her above the mantel was taller and wider than Alistair\u2019s height, and it served as the focal point of the room. Her younger self smiled down at anyone occupying the expansive space, her blue eyes naively clear of the many tragedies yet to come.</p><p>Alistair had no notion of what to say. All three of his brothers were dead, and grief weighted his heart like a heavy, oppressive stone. Of equal burden was the title he now bore, a distinction he\u2019d never coveted. \u201cI don\u2019t want this,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cTell me how to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no way out.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. Masterson was at home, but she dealt with this impossible situation alone because her beloved husband couldn\u2019t face the bastard who would now bear his exalted title.</p><p>\u201cHe could denounce me,\u201d Alistair suggested, \u201cwhich would open an avenue for a relative to inherit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair ...\u201d She lifted a handkerchief to her mouth and sobbed, the wretched sound tearing through his innards like claws.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot even face me. He must want a way out as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there was an alternative he could live with, yes. But he will not be a cuckold or shame me, and the next in line to inherit is a distant cousin whose worth is questionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want this,\u201d he said again, stomach churning. Alistair wanted a life of travel and adventure with Jessica. He wanted to bring her joy and challenges, and the freedom to erase the oppression of her youth with an adulthood that was boundless.</p><p>\u201cYou will be one of the wealthiest men in England now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy God, I won\u2019t touch a shilling of Masterson\u2019s precious coin,\u201d he bit out, his blood boiling at the mere suggestion. \u201cYou have no notion of the things I\u2019ve done to be solvent. He gave me scant assistance when I most needed it. I damned well won\u2019t take anything from him now!\u201d</p><p>Louisa rose, her hands twisting in her kerchief. Tears coursed unchecked down her hollowed cheeks. \u201cWhat would you have me do? I cannot regret your birth. I would not go back and give you up. To have you in my life I had to risk this, and Masterson took that risk for me. With me. We made the decision together, and we will abide by it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet here you stand, alone.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cMy choice. My consequence.\u201d</p><p>Abandoning the fireplace, he approached her. The ceiling hung thirty feet above them; the nearest wall was a score of feet away. Every Masterson holding boasted similar cavernous spaces containing furnishings and artwork accumulated over centuries.</p><p>The distant walls closed in, squeezing Alistair\u2019s chest like a vise.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt connected to any of it, had never felt a sense of familial pride or a sense of belonging. Bearing the title would be akin to wearing a mask. He\u2019d donned a role once before to survive, but now he was comfortable with who he was. Comfortable being the man Jessica loved unconditionally.</p><p>\u201cYour choice,\u201d he said softly, feeling very much like the impostor he was being told to be. \u201cBut I must pay the price.\u201d</p><p>Staying as a guest in Regmont\u2019s house, Jess slept not a wink all night. Her thoughts sped too swiftly through her mind, her heart breaking at every turn.</p><p>Alistair was now the Marquess of Baybury. Someday in the future, he would become the Duke of Masterson. Immense power and prestige came with those stations, but so, too, did grave responsibilities.</p><p>He could not take a barren woman to wife.</p><p>On both the Acheron and the island, they\u2019d slept until noon. On their second morning in London, however, Alistair came calling at the ungodly hour of eight o\u2019clock. She was dressed and ready for him, knowing he would come to her as soon as it was acceptable to do so. Knowing she had to be strong enough for both of them.</p><p>She descended the stairs with as much decorum as she could manage while feeling as if she was headed toward the gallows. When she rounded the bend in the stairs leading to the foyer, she found Alistair waiting with one hand atop the newel post and one foot propped on the bottom stair. He retained his hat and wore black from head to toe. His features appeared as stark as she felt.</p><p>He opened his arms to her, and she raced to fill them, dashing down the remaining stairs and launching herself against him. He caught her easily, squeezing tight.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry for your loss,\u201d she breathed, her fingers kneading restlessly into his tense nape.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry for my gain.\u201d His voice was flat and cold, but his embrace was not. He pressed his temple to hers and held her as if he would never let go.</p><p>After a long moment, he allowed her to lead him into the parlor. They both remained standing, facing each other. He looked tired and older than his years.</p><p>Running a hand through his hair, he groaned his frustration. \u201cIt seems we are to be trapped.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then stumbled toward the nearest chair. Her heartbeat was too quick and erratic, making her dizzy. We, he said, as she had known he would. She sank into a yellow damask-covered wingback and sucked in a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019ll be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it all. It has already started. The moment Masterson learned I\u2019d returned, he began filling a schedule for me. I haven\u2019t a free quarter hour to myself over the next three days. God knows if I\u2019ll even be allowed to relieve myself.\u201d</p><p>Her heart ached for him. He resented the road set before him, but he was more than competent. He had a brilliant head for business matters and an air of command that earned the respect of great men. \u201cIn no time at all, you will have everything running so smoothly others will stand back in awe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to Masterson, but regardless, you care what your mother thinks and she cares about what he thinks. She loves you and fought for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is enough?\u201d</p><p>The look he shot her was combative. She held his gaze.</p><p>He growled. \u201cGod, I miss you. I detest this game of waiting for certain hours to see you and lying in bed at night without you beside me. I miss having your ear and being the grateful recipient of your counsel.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s eyes stung. He looked so hard faced, discouraged, and alone. He\u2019d retained his hat, and he worried the brim with restless hands, twisting the chapeau around and around. \u201cI will always be available to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you wanted,\u201d he said gruffly, \u201cbut I can\u2019t wait for it. It may take months to work through the morass my life has become, and I cannot focus on that while starving for you. I\u2019ve come to ask you to elope with me.\u201d</p><p>Her hands linked in her lap. The pain in her chest was agonizing, nearly debilitating. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be wise.\u201d</p><p>He stilled, his fevered gaze narrowing. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I would. That is why you\u2019re so agitated and why you came to me with the sun barely in the sky.\u201d She blew out a deep breath. \u201cYou need me to do this so you can move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what, Jess?\u201d he asked with dangerous softness. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfford you the time and space to become accustomed to who you will have to be from this point in your life onward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you wanted,\u201d she corrected, \u201cbut now you have so much more to consider. Where do all the pieces fit? Do some overlap? Are others obsolete? You won\u2019t know until you immerse yourself in this role you\u2019ve assumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he snapped, his voice vibrating with fury. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare sit there so primly and speak about the dissolution of our relationship in that toneless voice as if you are asking me if I want more tea instead of ripping out my heart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair ...\u201d Her lower lip quivered and she bit it, tasting blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid,\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you? It is the worst state of mind in which to make life-altering decisions.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cYou cannot live without me, either, Jess.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t; she knew that. She hoped she wouldn\u2019t have to. But they both had to be certain. \u201cHester needs me now. I can\u2019t leave her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you can leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are much stronger than she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still need you!\u201d he bit out, enunciating every word. \u201cShe has Regmont and Michael and you. I only have you. You are the only one who takes care of me; the only one who thinks of my happiness first and last and always. If you leave me, Jess, you leave me with nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never leave you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I should be with you.\u201d</p> <p>Jess knew he could see on her face how she felt about him, how she breathed for him. But love was supposed to be selfless, despite his protestations to the contrary. Their marriage could irrevocably damage his relationship with his mother, the only person aside from Jess who loved him truly. If he was willing to take that risk, she would take it with him, but he wasn\u2019t acknowledging it now. He was rushing forward without thought, defiant in the face of a future he didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cJess.\u201d His gaze was as hard as gemstone. \u201cI knew you were mine the moment I saw you. Young as I was, I still had no doubt. I never married, never even considered for a moment all the merchant and landowner daughters who were set in my path, bearing sizable dowries and advantageous alliances. I spurned them all, certain you would one day belong to me. It was unfathomable to me that you wouldn\u2019t be. I would have waited two score years for you. Double that. You cannot ask me now to proceed with my life without any possibility of having you. I might as well be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me.\u201d Her voice gained the strength of her conviction. \u201cI am not going anywhere. I won\u2019t be seeking anyone. I will be here with Hester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I cannot. That will hold you back.\u201d She tugged at the ruby on her finger, feeling as if she were cutting out her own heart with a dull blade.</p> <p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Dropping his hat, Alistair lunged for her, staying her before the gold band slipped free of her fingertip. He pushed the ring back on, his forehead touching hers. His breath came quick and shallow, gusting over the tip of her nose. \u201cMake me understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you must know that I understand.\u201d She clutched his hand, willing him to absorb all the strength and love she had. \u201cI thought of how I would feel if I were forced to give you up to spare someone I loved, and how much more unfair it would be if Hadley benefited in any way from that sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not giving you up, Jess. I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh ... I\u2019ve inferred what you have left unsaid about your mother and Masterson. I collect how it must have been\u2014the illusion of acceptance and understanding broken by carefully rendered cuts and barbs. He has never allowed your mother to forget her transgression or how much it\u2019s cost him, has he? And she has been burdened with guilt and remorse for all of your life. She\u2019s allowed him to wound her in countless tiny ways as penance. And you have watched it all transpire, and suffered your own feelings of blame and regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou inferred all that, did you?\u201d He cupped her tense jaw with heartrending tenderness.</p><p>\u201cYou are very protective of her, to your own detriment. One doesn\u2019t seek to protect something that isn\u2019t in danger of being broken.\u201d</p> <p>Alistair brushed his thumb across her cheekbone. \u201cMy mother is so strong willed and assertive, except when it comes to this. To me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned into his touch. \u201cIt isn\u2019t you, my love. You are not at fault. Consider it carefully ... There are ways to prevent conception for both men and women. If she was simply addressing her physical needs, wouldn\u2019t she be prepared? And her lover also?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps your mother had a grand passion. A whirlwind affair. A sexual craving that drowned out all thought and reason. Perhaps that is why she feels such shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves Masterson. God knows why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, with abandon, to a degree I have never felt with anyone else. And yet there were times when I lost my head with Tarley; times when I felt as if I would go mad if he didn\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>He covered her lips with his fingers. \u201cSay no more,\u201d he said gruffly, but his gaze was soft.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, know that fierce sexual pleasure can come without love. If I am correct, it would help to explain your mother\u2019s need to be penitent.\u201d She grasped the wrist of the hand he stroked her with, squeezing gently in a silent offer of support. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that she secretly desired to conceive again. If she\u2019d tried to arouse Masterson for a length of time prior to his decision to ignore her indiscretions, she might have felt less of a woman. Perhaps she wondered if Masterson\u2019s inability to become aroused was in some way her fault. There are many possibilities for the tension you\u2019ve witnessed. None of them have anything to do with you.\u201d</p> <p>He stared into her, seeing how and why she commiserated with his mother. She\u2019d suffered through her own feelings of despair and inadequacy.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t you,\u201d she said again. \u201cBut you feel responsible and you have worked the whole of your life to stay out of sight and be as little a burden as possible. Now, you will be the most prominent face of a family you don\u2019t feel a part of, and you will be expected to carry that family forward. I am useless to you in that regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Alistair pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t ever talk about yourself in that manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy barrenness pained me before. But Tarley and I had Michael and the children he would father. There is no one to carry that burden for you, or you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a damned martyr, Jess. I have sacrificed all I am willing to for this farce. I will never give you up. Not for this. Not for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I won\u2019t lose you to remorse and blame. I would rather lose you now, with love between us, than years down the road with your mother\u2019s unhappiness and your feelings of responsibility for it wedged between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d His gaze darkened to a deep sapphire. \u201cIf I cannot have you, I won\u2019t have anyone. No one gets what they want then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle your affairs, then settle yourself. Live this life you\u2019ve assumed. Accustom yourself to it. Gain your bearings. If you still want me after you\u2019ve done that and your mother can give her blessing without reserve, you know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her sweetly, his lips clinging to hers. When he pulled back, he looked at her with shadowed and sultry eyes, his face a stunning mask of masculine beauty and aching torment. \u201cI will see to this; you see to your sister. Be quick about it. It won\u2019t be long before I come for you, and you\u2019d best be ready, Jess, with my ring still gracing your hand. You won\u2019t stay me then. I\u2019ll drag you to Scotland in irons if I have to.\u201d</p><p>He left her in a rush. As always, taking her heart with him.</p><p>Jess was still in the parlor when Hester joined her, three hours and three glasses of claret later.</p><p>\u201cI was told Baybury called this morning,\u201d her sister murmured.</p><p>Wincing inwardly at the sound of Alistair\u2019s title, she nodded and took another drink.</p><p>Hester paused by the table and frowned down at Jess. \u201cClaret for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Jess shrugged. She\u2019d begun imbibing as a young girl, after the cook took to slipping brandy into her tea when her body ached too much to allow sleep. It swiftly became apparent to her that liquor dulled emotional pain as well. In the early years of her marriage, she\u2019d had no need to drink. But once the consumption had dug its greedy talons into Benedict\u2019s lungs, she\u2019d turned to the comfort found in a bottle and hadn\u2019t yet turned away.</p><p>Hester took a seat on the settee beside her. \u201cI have never seen you look more melancholy, and there is no good reason to drink spirits first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he throw you over, Jess?\u201d Hester asked softly.</p><p>Of course Hester would leap to the obvious and most sensible course of action. She had been raised by the same parents as Jess, after all. Women of the peerage served one vital purpose\u2014to bear heirs, as many as possible.</p><p>Reaching over, Jess squeezed her sister\u2019s thin hand. \u201cNo. And he won\u2019t. He loves me too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you look as you did when Temperance died? Does he wish to delay the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, he hoped I would elope with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused? Why?\u201d Her eyes glistened. \u201cDear God ... Please, don\u2019t say you stayed for me! I couldn\u2019t bear it. You have already given up too much on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for him, because it\u2019s best for him. He needs time, even if he refuses to acknowledge that need. The man I intended to wed no longer exists. The man he will have to be now has different needs, and goals to which I am an impediment. It is the former who clings to me so stubbornly. And so I\u2019ve asked him to spend some time living the life of the latter. If that man wants me and if he can love me wholeheartedly, with no regrets or recrimination, then we can be happy and I will gladly marry him. But he can\u2019t know that yet. He still believes he can be Alistair Caulfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will come back for you, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s heart ached. \u201cFor a certainty. He\u2019s wanted me a long time. Since before I wed Benedict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d Hester brushed at the wetness on her long lashes. \u201cI find that wonderfully romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the world to me. I cannot tell you what he\u2019s done for me ... how he\u2019s changed me. He knows me as well as you do. All my secrets and fears and hopes. There is nothing to hide from him and no reason to try if there was. He accepts my faults and shortcomings as a means to bind us closer together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of the errors of his ways?\u201d</p><p>Jess found her sister\u2019s question very telling. \u201cThere are plenty of those, as everyone knows, and he goes to great pains to tell me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted anything that might later turn me away from him to be disclosed from the outset, before our attachment to one another grew and the possibility of separation became too painful.\u201d All his best intentions, for naught.</p><p>Hester\u2019s face took on a wistful cast. \u201cI would never have guessed Alistair Caulfield would be so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMature?\u201d Jess smiled sadly. \u201cHis circumstances have been more difficult than anyone would expect. His maturity comes from cynicism and a jaded outlook. His is far older than his years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus on seeing you hale and hearty. Rejoin Society in truth.\u201d Restless, she stood. \u201cI need new gowns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mourning is over.\u201d</p><p>Was it? Perhaps she would be in mourning still, but not for her former husband. \u201cYes. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Hester agreed.</p><p>Jess looked at the wine on the table, her fingers clenching against the need to reach for it. That dependency would have to be addressed, as well. She had no right to ask Alistair to conquer his demons while still clinging to her own.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need to eat a hearty breakfast to sustain us through the volume of shopping I intend to accomplish today.\u201d</p><p>Hester rose to her feet like a graceful wraith. \u201cI would love to see you in a berry-hued gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed. Also gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstonishing,\u201d Hester said. \u201cFather would have an apoplectic fit.\u201d</p><p>Jess almost laughed at the image that came to mind, but Hester gasped, then slumped against her. Jess barely caught her unconscious sister before she hit the floor.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>\u201cShe is starving to death,\u201d Dr. Lyons said, his pale blue eyes grim behind his spectacles. \u201cShe\u2019s too thin for any woman, but dangerously so for a woman in her delicate condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been eating more since I arrived, but that was only a couple of days ago.\u201d Jess\u2019s stomach twisted with concern and fear. Where in hell was Regmont? She had yet to see him. Either he kept odd hours, or he\u2019d yet to come home ... for nearly three days.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly long enough.\u201d He set his hands on his lean hips. For all the doctor\u2019s concern over Hester\u2019s weight, he appeared unusually slender, too. \u201cShe should begin her lying-in immediately with bed rest for the duration and many small meals throughout the day, every day. And no excitement in her delicate condition\u2014her heart is weakened by her emaciation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What ails her? She has grown progressively more ill for many months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve rarely been afforded the opportunity to examine Lady Regmont thoroughly. She is very reticent; I\u2019m inclined to say excessively so. Regardless, I can say that she seems prone to melancholia. Mood affects the body more than we fully understand.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s lower lip quivered, but she stemmed the rush of tears that threatened and nodded.</p><p>Life. Too fragile. Too precious. Far too short.</p><p>The doctor collected his fee, then made his egress.</p><p>Moving into her sister\u2019s bedroom, Jess sat on the edge of her sister\u2019s bed and took in the sickly pallor of Hester\u2019s once luminous skin.</p><p>Hester smiled weakly. \u201cYou look so serious. It isn\u2019t that dire. I am just weary and my morning sickness was severe, but it\u2019s over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d Jess\u2019s voice was low and angry. \u201cI have had my fill of bedside death vigils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have had one,\u201d Hester retorted dryly.</p><p>\u201cOne too many. If you think I will do it again, you are sorely mistaken.\u201d Jess caught her sister\u2019s hand to soften the sting of her words. \u201cMy nephew or niece is making a valiant effort to grow within you, and you are going to help, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess ...\u201d Hester\u2019s eyes watered. \u201cI am not as strong as you are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStrong? I\u2019m not strong. I drink too much, because it\u2019s a way to hide. I sent the man I love away because I am terrified that if I don\u2019t he will eventually send me away, and I couldn\u2019t bear it. There was a man on Alistair\u2019s ship abusing a child, and when I confronted him, I thought I might faint or vomit or soil myself. I am weak and flawed and absolutely incapable of watching you waste away. So I will not be listening to any further excuses. You will eat what I bring you to eat and drink what I bring you to drink, and in a few short swift months you will reward us both with a healthy child to love and spoil.\u201d</p><p>There was a flare of irritation in Hester\u2019s green eyes. \u201cAs you command,\u201d she said crossly.</p><p>Jess took the show of temper as a good sign. She also took the lesson of the day to heart: life and happiness are both too dear to throw away. She would give Alistair the time he needed to regain his bearings, but she wouldn\u2019t allow him to slip away from her without a fight. If she had to lock him, his mother, and Masterson in a room to clear the air between them, so be it.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to Hester\u2019s forehead and went to speak to the cook.</p> <p>Michael entered Alistair\u2019s study and found his friend poring over architectural renderings of a prospective new irrigation system. He took a moment to absorb the sight of his friend, taking in the changes the time away from home had wrought in the young man with whom he\u2019d spent so much of his youth.</p><p>\u201cYou look horrendous,\u201d Michael said, noting the day\u2019s worth of stubble shadowing Alistair\u2019s jawline and the crumpled state of his shirtsleeves. \u201cAnd why are you here instead of at Masterson Place?\u201d</p><p>Alistair looked up. \u201cNothing on earth could entice me into residing under the same roof as Masterson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that\u2019s how you would answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why ask?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo aggravate you.\u201d</p><p>With a low groan that sounded suspiciously like a growl, Alistair straightened and ran a hand through his hair. Michael knew all too well how overwhelming the first few months would be for his friend. A year and a half after Benedict\u2019s death, and he was only just beginning to feel as if he wore his own skin. \u201cI have enough aggravation without your assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are friends for?\u201d Michael held up a hand before a retort could be made. \u201cYou will have bigger troubles once you come out of hiding and appear in public. The scandal sheets say you have replaced me as the bachelor most hunted, for which I will be eternally grateful.\u201d</p><p>Alistair sank into the leather chair behind the desk. A nautical feel embellished the space, not overt, but present nevertheless. It was there in the color palette of blue and white, the shape and fluidity of the designs carved into the walnut furnishings, and the touches of brass spread all around the room. The study suited the gentleman who used it, a man best known as an adventurer and wanderer, which made Alistair\u2019s next statement seem even more out of place.</p><p>\u201cI am not a bachelor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unmarried,\u201d Michael pointed out dryly. \u201cThat makes you a bachelor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are still determined to have Jessica?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mine already.\u201d Alistair lifted one shoulder in an insolent shrug. \u201cEverything else is merely a formality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pray you aren\u2019t implying that you\u2019ve taken liberties.\u201d It was a thought that didn\u2019t sit well. Jessica was his brother\u2019s widow. She was a member of his family and a friend. She\u2019d loved his brother and brought him great happiness, and when Benedict had fallen ill with consumption, she had stayed by his side to the very end. She had shunned Society and social events in favor of tending to Benedict and entertaining him on the days he felt up to it. For her care and consideration, Michael would protect her safety and interests for the rest of her days.</p><p>Drumming his fingers on the armrests, Alistair studied him with a narrow-eyed stare. \u201cMy relationship with Jess is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your intentions are honorable, why not announce your engagement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the decision were mine alone, we\u2019d be wed and under one roof now. Jessica is the source of the delay, for reasons I don\u2019t fully comprehend. She acts as if there might be something capable of diminishing my affection for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch as Masterson\u2019s need for an heir combined with a young debutante capable of producing one. Or my mother\u2019s unhappiness over my choice. Or some future urge to procreate that might strike me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll reasonable arguments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been unreasonably in love with her as long as I can remember. That has trumped everything so far, and I don\u2019t foresee it changing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything except more women than I can count,\u201d Michael said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou should hire a tutor for yourself, then, to help you with basic math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to see them. There was rarely an evening when you didn\u2019t smell of sex and a woman\u2019s perfume.\u201d</p><p>To Michael\u2019s surprise, his libertine friend\u2019s cheekbones were flagged with a dull red flush.</p><p>\u201cAnd the ones you did see,\u201d Alistair said gruffly. \u201cWhat do you remember about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, chap. Your ladybirds didn\u2019t interest me as much as they interested you. And I rarely saw one more than once, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm ... It wasn\u2019t notable that all were blondes? Pale-skinned and light-eyed, too. I never found one with gray irises, like a brewing storm, but that was just as well. I have never been one who is satisfied by replicas of priceless things. There is nothing quite like the genuine article,\u201d Alistair murmured, his thoughts clearly elsewhere. \u201cAnd once a man is fortunate enough to acquire a treasure, it is to his pleasure to protect her and coddle her and make her the most prominent feature of his life and home.\u201d</p><p>Michael frowned, thinking back. He exhaled in a rush, understanding how deep and far reaching Alistair\u2019s captivation with Jessica went. Perhaps as deep and far reaching as his affection for Hester. \u201cDamnation.\u201d</p><p>A knock came at the door.</p><p>Alistair\u2019s head turned, and one brow rose in silent query.</p><p>The butler\u2019s voice drifted over Alistair\u2019s shoulder. \u201cForgive me, my lords,\u201d the servant said. \u201cHer Grace, the Duchess of Masterson, has come to call.\u201d</p><p>With a long-suffering sigh, Alistair nodded. \u201cShow her in.\u201d</p><p>Gripping the arms of his chair, Michael moved to stand.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d Alistair said.</p><p>\u201cBeg your pardon?\u201d Both of Michael\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Michael settled back into his seat, only to rise a moment later when Alistair\u2019s mother entered. He smiled, pleased as all men were by the sight of a beautiful woman. Unlike his brothers, Alistair took after his mother to a marked degree. Both had inky black hair and piercing blue eyes. Both were elegant and innately sensual in build and carriage, with a rapier wit that charmed and sliced with equal measure.</p><p>\u201cMy Lord Tarley,\u201d she greeted in a breathless, lilting voice. She held out her hand to him. \u201cYou look well and far too handsome for a woman\u2019s well-being.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of her ungloved hand. \u201cYour Grace, always the most sublime of pleasures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be attending the Treadmore\u2019s masquerade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Would you be so kind as to assist my son in finding his way there?\u201d</p><p>Michael glanced aside at his friend, smiling when he found Alistair scowling with both palms flat on his littered desk.</p><p>\u201cI do not have room in my schedule for such nonsense,\u201d Alistair said.</p><p>\u201cMake room,\u201d she retorted smoothly. \u201cPeople are beginning to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been absent for years. People want to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he drawled, \u201ca masquerade is the last place I should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlistair Lucius Caulfield\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God. When is this damned event?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday, which gives you five days to clear your schedule for one evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first of many,\u201d he muttered, \u201cif you have your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am proud of you. Is it a crime to want to show you off?\u201d</p><p>Michael crossed his arms, grinning. It was a rare pleasure to see Alistair bending his will for another.</p><p>\u201cI will go \u201d\u2014Alistair held up one hand when she smiled triumphantly\u2014\u201conly if my betrothed attends. She will make it bearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour betrothed ...\u201d The duchess sank slowly into the chair beside Michael\u2019s. A look of wonder spread over her lovely features. \u201cOh, Alistair. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica Sinclair, Lady Tarley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarley,\u201d she repeated, glancing at Michael.</p><p>Michael\u2019s hands curled around the end of his armrests. Anger began to simmer. \u201cMy sister-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cIsn\u2019t she ... older than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the barest degree. Two years is hardly worth mentioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was wed to Tarley for some time, was she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral years. A pleasant union by all accounts.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but appeared dazed. And Michael\u2019s fury grew. The duchess could not care less how pleasant or not the marriage had been, and Alistair damn well knew it.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lovely girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most beautiful woman in the world,\u201d Alistair said, watching his mother with the predatory sharpness of a hawk. \u201cI am eager for you two to become better acquainted, but Jessica holds back. She fears you will judge her on criteria having nothing to do with how happy she makes me. I assured her that was a misplaced concern.\u201d</p><p>The duchess swallowed hard. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could send a reassuring note to her? I am certain that would ease her mind considerably.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she stood. \u201cI will endeavor to find something appropriate to say.\u201d</p><p>Michael and Alistair stood. Michael helped himself to a glass of brandy as Alistair showed Her Grace out. That Michael was goaded to drink this early in the day aggravated him further. Alistair had always been dragging him into one crazed adventure after another in their youth, and it appeared his influence was still questionable.</p><p>When his friend returned, Michael rounded on him. \u201cBy God, you\u2019re a heel, Baybury. A complete and total ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be spitting mad. You\u2019re wielding my title like the weapon it is.\u201d Alistair\u2019s stride was leisurely and arrogant. \u201cIf you are surprised by the way I handled the situation, you\u2019ve been blind to my faults for too many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no good reason to ask me to stay for that! It was awkward in the extreme, for both me and Her Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a damned good reason.\u201d Alistair went to the console and poured his own drink. \u201cYour presence forced her to restrain any emotional reaction she might have had. Now, she will have the opportunity to think over the information before she says something we\u2019ll both regret. One can pray that once she absorbs it all, she will indeed put my happiness before other considerations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have always been reckless, but this ... this affects other people.\u201d</p><p>Alistair tossed back his drink and leaned his hip against the console. \u201cAre you telling me there is something you would not do to have Lady Regmont for your own?\u201d</p><p>Michael froze, his hand clenching around his glass. Considering the murderous rage he felt toward Regmont, he couldn\u2019t answer that question.</p><p>Mouth curving, Alistair set his glass down. \u201cRight. I have some errands to see to. Would you like to join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Michael groused, finishing his drink. \u201cWe could end the day in Bedlam or clapped in irons. There is never a dull moment with you, Baybury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ... the title again. You must be ferociously angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you had best become accustomed to that title you so despise. At the masquerade alone you\u2019ll hear it a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>Alistair tossed an arm over Michael\u2019s shoulders and prodded him toward the door. \u201cWhen I hear it paired with Jessica\u2019s name, I shall love it. Until then, I will simply have to keep you in good humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I need another drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shade of red is astonishing,\u201d Hester said from where she sat up in her bed. Surrounded by mountains of pillows she looked small and very youthful, although the d\u00e9cor of her rooms was undeniably adult. In fact, Jess found her sister\u2019s private space far more shocking than the bolt of material Hester was considering. Unlike the relentless cheeriness that distinguished the rest of the house, Hester\u2019s bedroom and boudoir were decorated in shades of grayish blue, charcoal, and off white. The overall effect was dramatic, but also quite somber. Not what Jess would have expected at all.</p><p>\u201cQuite daring,\u201d Lady Pennington agreed over the lip of her teacup.</p><p>Jess returned her attention to the blood-red silk, helplessly drawn to what it would signify to Alistair\u2014that he had changed her, made her bolder, helped her find an inner peace she\u2019d never dreamed was possible. \u201cI have no notion of when I would have an occasion to wear a dress made of this material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear it in private,\u201d Hester suggested.</p><p>Glancing at Elspeth, Jess bit her lower lip and wondered how this conversation was impacting the woman who\u2019d been like a mother to her for the past several years. Would she resent Jess\u2019s efforts to move forward with her life?</p><p>\u201cMy dear girl,\u201d Elspeth said, meeting her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t fret on my account. Benedict loved you. He would have wanted you to be as happy as possible. I want that for you, as well.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s eyes stung and she looked away quickly. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is I who must thank you,\u201d the countess said. \u201cAs short as Benedict\u2019s life was, you filled his last years with tremendous joy. I will forever be indebted to you for that.\u201d</p><p>Movement from the bed caught Jess\u2019s eye. Hester had leaned forward to run her hands over the luxurious material. The modiste extolled its virtues in a hushed but rapturous tone, which perfectly suited the thoughts that would accompany the sight of a woman draped in such decadence.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you can use it just on the bodice?\u201d Hester suggested. \u201cPaired with a cream satin or even a heavier damask? Or just on the sleeves? Or as trim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jess murmured, crossing her arms. \u201cThe whole gown must be made of it, with a draped bodice and a low back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019est magnifique!\u201d the modiste exclaimed, beaming and snapping her fingers at her two assistants to begin taking measurements.</p><p>A white-capped maid entered and curtsied. \u201cLady Tarley. Something has arrived for you. Would you like me to bring it to you here?\u201d</p><p>Jess frowned. \u201cIs there a reason I must see it now? Can you put it in my room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came with instructions to deliver it to you immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntriguing. Yes, bring it here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever could it be?\u201d Hester asked. \u201cHave you any clue, Jess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone at all.\u201d Although she prayed it would be from Alistair, whatever it was. Their separation of only a few days was fraying her equanimity. If not for Hester\u2019s precarious health and need of near-constant prodding to eat, Jess would have gone to him by now.</p><p>A few moments later, the maid reappeared carrying a handled basket. She set it down on the floor, and it rocked to and fro. A soft whine from the interior lured Jess closer.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Lady Pennington asked, setting her cup and saucer aside.</p><p>Jess bent down and lifted the basket\u2019s lid, gasping at the sight of the tiny pug puppy stumbling around the lined interior.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d she breathed, instantly in love. She reached in carefully to pick up the tiny creature and laughed in delight at the feel of its soft, warm, and wriggling body.</p> <p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Hester cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog.\u201d</p><p>That only made Jess laugh harder. Sitting back on her heels, she set the energetic pug in her lap and looked at the metal tag hanging from its red leather collar.</p><p>Acheron, it said on one side, causing a pang in her chest. The other side said simply, All my love, ALC.</p><p>\u201cWho sent that creature?\u201d the countess asked.</p><p>\u201cBaybury, I would guess,\u201d Hester said, sounding wistful.</p><p>Jess retrieved the sealed missive that hung from the basket\u2019s handle by a black ribbon. The crest in the wax was a sharp reminder of who Alistair was now, but she pushed it aside and clung to her determination to fight for him.</p><p>My dearest, obstinate Jess,</p><p>May the enclosed little friend bring you joy. I pray he endlessly reminds you of the one who gifts him to you. I have tasked him with watching over you and protecting you, for I know he will love you to distraction as I do.</p> <p>Her Grace requests that I attend the Treadmore masquerade five days hence. I told her I would go only if my betrothed did. I would brave any and all such hells to see you.</p><p>Please give my best regards to your sister for her speedy return to health. I can well understand her decline in your absence. I, too, am suffering the ill effects of it.</p><p>Yours always,</p><p>Alistair</p><p>There was a drawing with the missive, a rendering of her lying on the dais in the gazebo he\u2019d built on the island. Her eyes were unfocused, dreamy and wistful, her lips plumped by fierce kisses and her hair in tumbling disarray around her bare shoulders. Her head was propped in one hand, her torso draped in the nearly translucent lawn of her chemise. Alistair hadn\u2019t brought his supplies with him that day, which meant this intimate image of her in an unguarded moment had been stored in his mind and savored later.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Jess!\u201d Hester said, alarmed when tears fell from Jess\u2019s lashes.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, dear?\u201d the countess asked, rising gracefully to her feet and approaching. \u201cAre you mourning your Temperance?\u201d</p><p>Jess hugged Acheron and the letter that accompanied him to her heart. \u201cNo. Although thinking of her reminds me again of how quicksilver life is. Benedict was the healthiest and hardiest man I knew. Alistair has lost three siblings. Hester and I lost our mother. We cannot afford to throw away happiness. We have to fight for it and claim it.\u201d</p><p>Elspeth crouched beside Jess and held out her hands for Acheron. \u201cHow adorable you are,\u201d she cooed when Jess passed him over.</p><p>Jess stood and eyed the red silk again. \u201cI now have an occasion to wear the red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help the man,\u201d Hester said, but with a sparkle in her green eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt is too late for that now.\u201d Jess lifted her arms to be measured. \u201cHe is well and truly caught.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>It was an irrefutable fact that wearing a mask freed inhibitions.</p><p>Alistair was reminded of this over and over again as he stood by a Doric column in the Treadmore ballroom and dealt with the pressing crush of guests who greeted him. He was tempted often to place his hand over the letter he\u2019d tucked into his pocket, but he refrained. Jessica\u2019s words contained therein gave him the strength and patience to deal with the overly accommodating and facetious guests eager to make a good impression on the future Duke of Masterson. They apparently weren\u2019t aware of how sharp a memory Alistair possessed. He remembered those who\u2019d thought nothing of him when he was merely a fourth son. He remembered those who\u2019d paid him to fuck them and made him feel unclean in the process. He remembered those who had inflicted pain and wounded his pride.</p><p>My beloved, determined Alistair,</p><p>Your gift and the words accompanying him both broke my heart and filled it with joy. When I see you next, I will show you the depth of my gratitude.</p><p>As for the masquerade, nothing could keep me from you. Then or at any time or event in the future. You have been duly warned.</p><p>Irrevocably yours,</p><p>Jessica</p><p>To his left, Masterson stood, so stoic and austere. To his right, his mother worked her charm on all who approached them. She hadn\u2019t, however, written to Jessica. Not that he had truly expected her to.</p><p>\u201cHaymore\u2019s daughter is lovely,\u201d Louisa murmured now, using her fan to gesture at the young woman walking away from them.</p><p>\u201cI do not recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met her scarcely a moment ago. She deliberately lowered her mask so you would see her.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a careless shrug. \u201cI will take your word for it.\u201d</p><p>The orchestra in the balcony above signaled the onset of dancing with a few opening notes. The crush of guests somehow cleared the dance area by converging on the perimeters of the room.</p><p>\u201cBeginning with a quadrille,\u201d his mother said dryly. \u201cI wish you had asked at least one of the young ladies you met to dance. It would have been polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was exceptionally polite to every one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a beautiful dancer. I enjoy watching you. So would everyone else here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d He faced her as the orchestra began to play. \u201cI will not have every gazette and scandal rag speculating over the significance of my selection of dance partners. I am not on the market, and I refuse to give any impression that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even perused the wares!\u201d she protested in a low whisper that was hidden beneath the enthusiastic surge of music. \u201cYou are infatuated with a beautiful, older, worldly woman. I appreciate the appeal, especially under the circumstances. Certainly her expertise at maneuvering through Society seems exceptionally valuable to you now. But, please, consider the long-term ramifications of your decisions. She is a widow, Alistair. She has far greater license than a debutante and can be useful to you outside the bonds of matrimony.\u201d</p><p>Alistair inhaled a sharp, deep breath. Then another, fighting for control of the fury threatening to make an appearance in such a public place. \u201cFor both our sakes, I am going to forget what you just said.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Masterson, his jaw clenched when the duke appeared unaware of the conversation taking place right beneath his nose. \u201cHow far must this hypocrisy go before you absolve my mother of her sins? Hasn\u2019t she paid penance enough?\u201d</p><p>The duke continued to look straight ahead. Only a muscle tic in his jaw gave any hint that he\u2019d listened at all.</p><p>Alistair looked at his mother and removed his mask. \u201cI\u2019ve damn well paid enough. I have wished for your happiness all of my life, Mother. I have tried to facilitate it in every way I can, but in this matter, I will not be swayed.\u201d</p><p>Louisa\u2019s eyes glistened with unshed tears. They cut him, but there was no help for her distress. Leastwise none that he could give her.</p><p>A swell of murmurs surrounded them at the same moment a ripple of awareness coursed down his spine. Anticipation slid through his veins, potently fierce and delicious. He looked at his mother\u2019s face and saw the wide-eyed astonishment with which she stared over his shoulder. He pushed his mask into her lax fingers and began to turn about. Slowly. Savoring the fine tension he felt only when Jessica was near.</p><p>The sight of her struck him like a blow, purging all the air from his lungs. Red. She was draped in it. Wrapped in silk like a gift. Her shoulders bared, exposing creamy skin and the lush upper swell of her breasts. Her luxurious hair was styled into a mixture of upswept curls and long, glorious strands. There was something slightly disheveled about the whole, reinforcing the overall impression of sin and seduction and sex. The pristine white gloves that stretched midway up her arms did nothing to mitigate the overwhelming carnality of her appearance.</p><p>Although he knew from the dancing in progress that the music continued, Alistair couldn\u2019t hear a single note over the roaring of blood in his ears. Nearly every eye was riveted to Jessica, who walked along the edge of the dance floor unimpeded, her stride slow and sensual. Erotic. Beckoning.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath when his lungs burned. His chest was constricted with yearning, his gaze devouring every detail in a vain effort to appease the hunger that had grown ravenous over the many days without her.</p><p>A simple red satin mask was tied around her eyes and as she approached, she reached up and untied it. Letting it dangle from her fingers by the ribbons. Letting everyone get a good, long look at her while she looked at him. Letting them\u2014the peers whose censure he\u2019d feared she could not bear\u2014see the deeply intimate manner in which she regarded him. Her gray eyes were luminous, lit from within by the surfeit of emotion she made no effort to hide. There wasn\u2019t a person who saw her who could doubt what he meant to her.</p><p>By God, she was brave. She\u2019d been beaten to deafness and disfigured into conforming to the dictates of the people milling around them, yet she came to him without any hesitation or reservation. Without fear.</p><p>There was no one else in the room. Not for him. Not with her looking at him in that way of hers that spoke more clearly than words\u2014she loved him with all that she was. Completely, unequivocally, unconditionally.</p><p>\u201cDo you see, Mother?\u201d he asked softly, riveted. \u201cAmid all of these lies, there is no finer truth than what is bared before you now.\u201d</p><p>He was moving toward Jessica before he realized it, drawn inexorably. When he drew close enough to scent her, he stopped. There were mere inches between them, and the urge to reach for her, to pull her close, was a writhing thing inside him.</p><p>\u201cJess.\u201d His fingers clenched and released against the need to touch her soft, smooth skin.</p><p>Dancers cleared the floor around them, gawking, but he paid them no mind.</p><p>Her dress was a statement, and he would never fully be capable of putting his gratitude for it into words. She was not the same woman who had stepped aboard his ship. She no longer saw him as being \u201ctoo much\u201d for her, or herself as inadequate for him. And he loved her more now than he had then. He would certainly love her more tomorrow than he did today, and the day after that would find him only loving her all the more.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d she breathed, her gaze sweeping over his face as if she had been as starved for the sight of him as he\u2019d been for even a glimpse of her. \u201cThe way you\u2019re looking at me ...\u201d</p><p>He nodded curtly, knowing he was wearing his heart on his face. It had to be obvious to all and sundry that he was mad for her. \u201cI miss you abominably,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cThe greatest torment ever devised is the withholding of you from me.\u201d</p><p>A few opening notes of a waltz played. He seized the moment, catching Jessica by the waist and carrying her onto the dance floor.</p><p>Alistair was the most lavish creature in the packed room.</p><p>Jess was left breathless by the sight of him, awed by his masculine beauty in formal attire. He wore black trousers and coat, the severity of his appearance only emphasizing his perfection of form and feature. His was a glittering, riveting presence with his glossy coal-black hair and brilliant aquamarine eyes. He needed no adornments to enhance him. His piercing gaze and slight smile were enough to lure women closer. Even men drifted near, drawn to the air of confidence and command Alistair carried so well.</p><p>The knowledge that this stunning, undeniably sexual creature was hers made her breathless. And the way he looked at her, with such aching tenderness and heated longing ...</p><p>Dear God. She\u2019d been mad to entertain\u2014for even one instant\u2014the possibility of letting him go.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me to dance?\u201d she purred as he set her down in the middle of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cYou are the only partner I will have; you must indulge me.\u201d</p><p>His hand gripped her waist, the other lifted her arm. He stepped closer. Too close. Scandalously close. She loved it. They\u2019d yet to dance together, but she had imagined it many times. There was a graceful elegance to the way he moved. Paired with the innate sensuality of his nature, it made him mesmerizing to watch in motion, and she knew how he felt when his body was moving against hers. It would be the sweetest form of torture to be held so close to his powerful flexing body while restrained by decorum and too many layers of clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, tilting her head back to look at him. \u201cI won\u2019t let you go. I\u2019m too selfish, and I need you too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to remove that dress from your body with my teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I had hopes you would like it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed wickedly. \u201cIf I liked it any more, it would be hiked around your waist.\u201d</p> <p>Her grip tightened on his. He smelled delicious. Of virile male and sandalwood, with the faintest hint of citrus. She hated the gloves between them and the hundreds of people around them. She could live alone with him for the rest of her days. Working in companionable silence, listening to him coax haunting notes from the violin, talking with him about her thoughts and feelings until nothing separated them ...</p><p>The music began in earnest. His mouth curved in a lazy smile, then he spun her about in a vigorous turn. She laughed breathlessly, awed by how she fit in his arms as if they\u2019d been made to hold her. He danced the way he made love\u2014intimately, powerfully, with exquisite control and aggressive moves. His thighs brushed against hers with every step, his hold tightening until there was scarcely any space between them. He flowed with the music, embraced it, claimed it as his own. Just as he claimed her with his gaze, his look fraught with such intensity and focus, his eyes so soft and warm.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how deeply she\u2019d craved that look of love from him until now. \u201cThey can see how you feel about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, as long as you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>They weaved around the other dancers at a slightly faster pace, her crimson skirts swirling around his trouser-clad legs. She became aroused, flushed. She ached for the feel of his mouth on her skin, whispering heated erotic threats and promises that made her hot and wet and very, very willing.</p><p>\u201cHow is your sister?\u201d he asked, the rasp in his voice betraying his returning desire for her.</p><p>\u201cImproving every day. Confinement and bed rest is just what she needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just what I need, too. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we do not rest when we\u2019re abed, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be well enough to make do without you four weeks from now?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cBy the time the banns have been read, she should be strong enough to need me only occasionally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I need you, too.\u201d</p><p>Jess did not inquire after his mother or Masterson. She\u2019d seen the look on the duchess\u2019s face and watched as Alistair said something to her. Whatever it was, his gaze hadn\u2019t wavered, but Jess had seen the strength of his conviction. It was a mien he was infamous for\u2014recklessly determined and boldly challenging; the countenance of a man who fearlessly accepted any challenge. When he wore it, all knew he would not be swayed. However his mother reacted to his choice, he was committed and his mind would not be altered.</p><p>\u201cI cannot stay much later tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve no notion of what occupies Regmont so completely, but he comes home long after we\u2019ve all retired and leaves before we make an appearance at breakfast. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would think he was avoiding me. Regardless, someone needs to be with Hester at night, and Acheron needs me, too.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered farther, until their lips were too close. \u201cThis was enough for now. I needed to see you, to hold you. If you have no further objections, I will begin courting you publicly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d She felt giddy, intoxicated by his nearness and affection in a way no claret could ever match. She hadn\u2019t had a drink in days, and though the ill effects of her abstinence had been heinous at the onset, she was beginning to feel better. Stronger. \u201cI will be ruined otherwise. Labeled a brazen hussy. You must make me respectable, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I went to such lengths to lure you to sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will always be sinful for you.\u201d</p> <p>He slowed as the music stopped, but her heart still raced. He stepped back and lifted her gloved hand to his lips. \u201cCome. Let me introduce you to my mother and Masterson before you go.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and, as always, followed his lead.</p><p>Alistair collected his hat, great coat, and cane from a footman, then headed toward the door to wait for his carriage. When Jessica had departed a half-hour before, all the light had left the room with her, giving him no reason to linger.</p><p>\u201cLucius.\u201d</p><p>His stride faltered. His back went up, every muscle tightening. He turned around. \u201cLady Trent.\u201d</p><p>She approached, her hips swaying gently, her tongue darting out to lick her bottom lip. \u201cWilhelmina,\u201d she corrected. \u201cWe are much too intimate to stand on formality.</p><p>He knew the lascivious look in her eyes. She remained lovely and lushly curved. Wasted on a man far older than she was.</p><p>His stomach knotted with shame. He no longer possessed the walls he\u2019d once shielded himself behind. Jessica had torn them down, one by one, opening him to a precious understanding of his own worth. The choices he had made ... the things he\u2019d done with women like Lady Trent ... They sickened him now.</p><p>\u201cWe were never intimate,\u201d he said. \u201cGood evening, Lady Trent.\u201d</p><p>Alistair left the Treadmore manse in a rush, striding out the door and feeling relief at the sight of his carriage waiting for him. He vaulted into the softly lamp-lit interior and settled against the leather squab. The whip cracked and the equipage lurched into motion, rounding the circular drive. They slowed when they reached the open wrought-iron gate, their way blocked by the clogged lane. It would be this way the entire route home, he knew, as the streets filled with Society carriages conveying their passengers from one event to another.</p><p>He exhaled and relaxed, his mind returning to the moment he\u2019d introduced Jessica to his mother and Masterson. All three were so consummate and adept in the social graces that he had no notion of what any of them thought of one another. They\u2019d been smoothly polite, exchanging platitudes and worthless observations, and parting ways at precisely the right moment to avoid even an instant of awkward silence. It had all been far too easy.</p><p>The carriage drew to a halt beside one of the brick gateposts bearing a sculpted lion on the top. A dark form emerged from beside it and opened his carriage door. The figure was met with the tip of the rapier hidden within his cane.</p><p>A gloved hand moved aside the shield of a cloak\u2019s hood and revealed Jessica\u2019s wry smile. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d impale me with something more pleasurable.\u201d</p><p>The unsheathed weapon hit the floorboards, and he pulled her inside. The door was shut behind them, earning the footman responsible a raise in pay.</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell are you doing, Jess?\u201d</p><p>She tumbled into him, pushing him back into the squab. \u201cThe dance may have been enough for you, but it wasn\u2019t for me. Not nearly.\u201d</p><p>Pushing off his chest, she stooped and tugged the curtains closed. She hunched over him, yanking up her blood-red skirts with frantic impatience. He caught a glimpse of the lacy hem of her pantalettes, and then she was climbing over him, straddling him.</p><p>\u201cJess.\u201d He breathed her name. His skin felt too hot, his chest too constricted to allow him sufficient air. The feelings he had for her were too volatile to contain. She overwhelmed him. Surprised him. Seduced him with ridiculous ease.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you ... you have to know ... I am s-sorry.\u201d The cracking of her voice broke him as well. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was afraid. I am sorry I caused you even an instant of pain or doubt. I love you. You deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the best in you,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cThere is no one better.\u201d</p><p>Her gloved fingers fumbled with the placket of his trousers. He laughed softly, delighted with her eagerness. Staying her hands by covering them with his own, he said, \u201cSlow down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying for you. The way you dance ...\u201d Her eyes were fever bright in the muted glow of the carriage lamps. \u201cI thought it would ease when I parted from you, but it only worsens by the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worsens?\u201d he asked, wanting to hear her say it.</p><p>\u201cMy hunger for you.\u201d</p><p>His blood thickened along with his cock. \u201cThen I must take you home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave Hester that long, and I can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Jessica planning his ravishment in a carriage almost stole every shred of his reason. Alistair was tempted to shove her beneath him and give her the hard, pounding ride she was desperate for, but the circumstances were not ideal. Just outside the curtains, coachmen shouted to one another. Pedestrians laughed and conversed on the street. He and the passengers in the equipages passing them were close enough that their fingers could touch if they reached out to one another simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he soothed, his hands stroking the length of her spine. \u201cI\u2019ll make you come, but you must be quiet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head violently. \u201cI need you inside me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Alistair\u2019s grip flexed into her waist. \u201cWe are moving at a snail\u2019s pace, Jess. Too slowly to disguise any rocking of the carriage. And we are surrounded on all sides.\u201d</p><p>Jessica arched into him, her graceful arms encircling his shoulders. \u201cYou can think of something. Be inventive.\u201d She brought her mouth to his ear, her tongue tracing the curve. \u201cI am wet and hot and aching for you, my love, and you made me this way. You cannot leave me in this condition.\u201d</p><p>A hard shudder shook his frame. She could not have displayed her trust in him more clearly than this, yet her haste and frenzy told him more was at stake than her physical pleasure. Perhaps this was the ramification of meeting his mother and Masterson, who couldn\u2019t accept him, let alone the woman he loved. His familial situation was far different, he knew, from what she\u2019d had with Tarley. Michael\u2019s protectiveness was ample proof of that.</p><p>Alistair was infuriated by her disquiet and the possible root of it. She was a brilliant social diamond, her facets perfect in every respect aside from the one she couldn\u2019t control. After all she\u2019d suffered to become a faultless wife for any peer, she did not deserve to be diminished by anyone.</p><p>Alistair caught her face in his hands, urging her to lean back and meet his gaze directly. \u201cJess.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, registering the somberness in his tone.</p><p>Angling his head, he pressed his lips lightly to hers and breathed the words \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>Jess didn\u2019t move for a long moment following Alistair\u2019s fervent pronouncement, then the tension left her in a rush, the driving need to connect with him receding to a softer, sweeter craving. \u201cAlistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid, too. So, you see, you and I are even.\u201d Her eyes stung. Her throat clenched too tight to allow speech.</p><p>\u201cSurely you knew,\u201d he murmured, bringing one hand to his mouth. His even white teeth caught the tip of the middle finger of his glove and tugged.</p><p>\u201cYes, I knew,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut it still means a great deal to hear the words aloud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will say them often.\u201d The glove slipped off his hand, and he released it from his teeth. It dropped to his lap between them.</p><p>To her surprise, she found the uncovering of his hand impossibly erotic. He switched his attention to his other glove, tugging on the fingertips one by one until it slid free, his gaze heavy lidded and filled with sensual intent. The sight of his bite gripping the short white glove roused some primitive instinct inside her. There was something primal about disrobing with one\u2019s teeth, which brought to mind the promise he\u2019d made to utilize a similar method on her dress.</p><p>The second glove fell to his lap. The carriage made a slow turn.</p><p>Lifting her hand, she extended it to him. His bared fingers went to the buttons at her wrist, deftly releasing each one. When her skin was bared, he lifted it to his mouth. The flutter of his tongue over her pulse made her gasp. Her sex rippled with appreciation.</p><p>The glove caressed the length of her arm as Alistair drew it off. By the time he\u2019d removed the other one, Jess was breathless with anticipation. He pressed a kiss to her knuckle above his ruby ring, then licked between her fingers. If that stroke of his tongue had been between her legs, it could not have aroused her more.</p><p>Boldly, she reached between his legs and stroked the rigid length of his erection. He made a rumbling sound very much like a purr. She loved the way he lounged without affectation, every inch the voluptuary and perfectly willing to let her have her way with him.</p><p>\u201cIt will take more than a lifetime,\u201d she said, \u201cto have my fill of you.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid under her gown and gripped her thighs. She loved that, too. Alistair always began each touch with a firm, possessive squeeze, as if he needed that brief moment of fierceness to attain the control that followed. He watched her as he reached around to cup her buttocks in his hands, then pushed through the slit in her pantalettes to find her slick and scorching.</p><p>\u201cYou are indeed wet and hot,\u201d he murmured, parting her and stroking a fingertip over her clitoris. \u201cAnd you make me so damned hard.\u201d</p><p>She felt how hard he was. It gave her a wild thrill to be responsible for arousing such a magnificent sexual animal to the highest degree. No longer hindered by her gloves, she freed him with a deftness born of practice. He fell heavily into her waiting palms, so broad and long. His penis was a brutal instrument of pleasure. The wide head stretched her to her limits, while the thick veins coursing the weighty length rubbed every tender nerve inside her.</p><p>Jess fisted him with both hands and pumped, priming him to proceed to the point where he lost all restraint and bared himself to the soul.</p><p>He groaned, his head falling back into the high back of the squab. Two long fingers pushed inside her and began to thrust, preparing her for the deep slide of his cock.</p><p>She was ready. Had been from the moment he\u2019d turned around in the ballroom and looked at her as if she were an oasis in the desert and he\u2019d been lost in the dunes for days. She had been just as parched for the sight of him, withering with every day that passed without his presence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rising onto her knees, she pulled free of his working fingers and angled his cock. The moment the flared crown notched against the clenching entrance of her sex, she began to tremble. He caught her hips in his hands, steadying her, but allowing her to set the pace with which she took him into her.</p><p>Wanting to feel every inch of him, Jess lowered herself slowly, a soft keening cry accompanying the deliberate, relentless impalement.</p><p>She reached up and gripped the narrow lip where the upholstered back gave way to lacquered wood, sinking down on him with a leisurely measured pace. He bruised her with his grip.</p><p>\u201cJess. Wait!\u201d His thighs were rigid between hers. \u201cGive me a moment. You\u2019re squeezing me like a fist. No. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t move ... Ah, Christ!\u201d</p> <p>He climaxed with a primal groan, his teeth grinding audibly, his cock jerking inside her as his semen spurted in thick, creamy pulses. He was only halfway in her, but the sudden flood of lubrication gave her no traction to delay further. She sank onto him to the root.</p><p>Her toes curled; her nails dug into the leather and wood. He came hard and long, trembling beneath her. She watched him, awed by the ferocity of his pleasure and how erotic she found it. He was a man who knew sex in all its extremes, and she\u2019d brought him to a raging orgasm with just her love and enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Alistair wrapped his arms around her, bent her backward, and buried his damp face in her cleavage. His laugh was sharp and humorless, derisive. \u201cYou went to all this trouble ... for this.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her fingers into the silk of his hair, understanding that he\u2019d learned to place literal value on the pleasure he could give; it would be a hard lesson to unlearn. \u201cI would circle the world, barefoot, for this.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his face flushed and eyes gleaming. The carriage swayed as it moved at a crawl over cobblestones, the sounds of the city filtering into the hushed and humid interior. His jaw clenched as he rocked deeper into her.</p> <p>\u201cYour pleasure is mine, Alistair, my love. I would have none without yours. I would be empty without you to fill me.\u201d She kissed the tip of his nose and smiled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re still hard inside me, with stamina to spare. You\u2019ve never left me wanting.\u201d</p><p>He moved in a burst of graceful physical agility, lifting her and carrying her to the opposite squab. Everything shifted as she found herself beneath him, pinned to the seat by the relentlessly hard, thick length of his penis. Her back was cushioned by her lined velvet cape; her front was mantled by his large, powerful body. He braced himself with one palm against the backrest and the other above the armrest near the door. He held her open by planting one knee on the squab and pinning her leg to the back. Her other leg dangled off the edge, her foot flat to the floorboard next to Alistair\u2019s.</p><p>She was completely vulnerable, her shoulders curved in the corner in a manner that gave all the leverage to Alistair, who used it to his advantage. With a practiced roll of his hips, he massaged her with his cock. Heated pleasure spread outward from her sex, making her moan.</p><p>\u201cYou must be quiet,\u201d he whispered, then made that impossible with another devastating stroke.</p><p>Jess gripped his hips, achingly aware that they were both fully clothed except for where they were joined. His pelvis lifted, dragging the furled underside of his cockhead across quivering tissues. He paused with only the tip of him inside her, watching her as she writhed, his gaze darkening as her nails dug into his flesh. Then he sank into her in a long, deep plunge. She bit her lip but couldn\u2019t contain a plaintive whimper.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he admonished, his eyes gleaming wickedly. He knew damned well what he was doing to her by setting this torturously slow pace. His hips lifted, then fell again. Shallower this time, a short fierce dig.</p> <p>\u201cAlistair ...\u201d She clenched tight around him, the tiny muscles rippling greedily.</p><p>\u201cMy God, you feel good,\u201d he breathed. He ground against her, teasing her clitoris with fleeting pressure, his cock so deep in her that she was utterly possessed. \u201cI can feel my semen in you. You\u2019re soaked with it. But I have more to give you.\u201d</p><p>She was panting now, maddened, misted with perspiration. She needed hard, driving strokes, a deep relentless pounding that would give her the friction she craved. What he gave her was painstakingly slow withdrawals and leisurely surges. Like a liberally oiled apparatus, tireless, his hips smoothly pistoned, shafting her tender sex with his iron-hard cock. In and out, the rhythm so fluid and precise it rivaled Maelzel\u2019s metronome.</p><p>Arching, she fought to quicken his pace, her body strung tight as a bow. He covered her mouth with his hand, muffling the sobs of pleasure she couldn\u2019t contain.</p><p>With his lips to her right ear, he murmured, \u201cWe are surrounded by dozens of people, and I\u2019m fucking you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, her passions raging beyond all reason. In a distant part of her mind, she heard the voices of pedestrians just outside the carriage. She heard the rolling of passing carriage wheels and the laughter of the passengers within. The very real threat of discovery was akin to throwing kerosene on an already raging fire. She was insensate with lust, reduced to a primitive state in which only the quest for orgasm mattered.</p><p>\u201cIf only they could see you as I do,\u201d he purred, \u201csprawled across a carriage squab with your skirts around your waist and your sweet, slick cunt drenched in my ejaculate and crammed full of my cock.\u201d</p><p>She met his gaze over the hand covering her lips, seeing a fierce love and aching tenderness in the aqua depths that belied the coarseness of his speech. There were so many sides to the man she loved\u2014some smooth as river rock and others rough as gravel; some innocently vulnerable and others wickedly depraved. She couldn\u2019t imagine living without any of them. Together they made up the whole that completed her.</p> <p>He rocked his hips, touching the end of her. \u201cYour wantonness is a gift to me, Jess. You are a gift, and I know it. I know the breadth of trust and love required for you to give of yourself in this manner.\u201d</p><p>A lush, expert stroke took her to the edge. She hung there, arched and rigid, breathless.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you for it,\u201d he growled, taking advantage of a rut in the road to deliver a hard, ramming thrust that hurled her into orgasm. \u201cI love you too much. More than I can bear.\u201d</p><p>Jess quaked violently beneath him, her sex clutching and sucking at his throbbing erection. He climaxed with a serrated groan that he muffled in the sweat-slick curve of her neck. They clung to each other, grasping and writhing, straining for the closeness they required but couldn\u2019t attain while dressed.</p><p>Lost in each other while surrounded by the teeming city.</p><p>My sympathies to the debutantes hoping to snare the magnificent marquess. The previously icy Lady T, now widowed and ablaze in red, drew the mesmerized Lord B to her like a moth to a flame. Dear Readers, the heat was palpable.</p><p>So scandalous. Now infamous. Decidedly delicious ...</p><p>Michael finished reading aloud and lowered the paper, staring at Alistair with brows raised.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Alistair asked, before enjoying a long drought of ale.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy. I saw Jessica last night. That dress ... What have you done to my sister-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask what she has done to me? That answer is far more profound, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s gaze swept over the great room of Remington\u2019s Gentlemen\u2019s Club. His casual perusal was met with many nods and smiles. He now understood the interest that had baffled him the week before. Everyone had known of his change in circumstance before he did. He was still catching up. Still reeling.</p><p>He\u2019d called on Albert\u2019s widow earlier in the day, attempting to ascertain her circumstances and offering whatever assistance she required. She had been left with a large bequeathment, but she\u2019d loved his brother and she would need more than coin and property to see her through the immediate future. She would need a strong shoulder to lean upon, and he offered his to her, knowing how vital a loved one could be to the simple acts of rising in the morn and breathing. In return, she had given him something that could change so many things. He held her gift close to his heart, debating what to do with it.</p><p>\u201cYour name, paired with Jessica\u2019s, is all I have heard all day,\u201d Michael groused.</p><p>\u201cThe announcement of our engagement will appear in tomorrow\u2019s gazettes, smothering all prurient interest with the blanket of propriety and respectability. The notices would have appeared today, but I was ... detained last night.\u201d Alistair had decided he was going to keep that carriage for the rest of his life. He and Jess would christen others with their passion, but that one would remain in his carriage house forever, waiting for him to ravish Jessica in it long after the equipage lost its usefulness in serving its original purpose.</p><p>\u201cWhat of your parents?\u201d Michael asked. \u201cThey looked less than ecstatic.\u201d</p><p>Alistair shrugged, feeling a sharp pang of regret but no responsibility for it. \u201cThey will manage.\u201d</p><p>The crumpling of the newspaper drew Alistair\u2019s attention to Michael\u2019s clenching fists. He wondered what he\u2019d said to elicit such a response. Then he noted that his friend was looking beyond him. Following the line of Michael\u2019s gaze, Alistair glanced over his shoulder and saw the Earl of Regmont enter the room with a boisterous pack of cronies following swiftly on his heels.</p><p>\u201cShould we invite him over for a drink?\u201d Alistair asked, turning his back to the man.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d Michael\u2019s dark eyes narrowed in a dangerous fashion. \u201cI can barely tolerate knowing the man breathes.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s brows rose. There was really nothing he could say to that. Despite the similarities in their circumstances, he certainly couldn\u2019t concur, not considering that in his situation it had been Michael\u2019s brother who\u2019d laid claim to the woman Alistair coveted.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil is the matter with him?\u201d Michael bit out. \u201cHis wife is home ill and increasing with his child, and he\u2019s carousing as if he was a bachelor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost peers do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost peers aren\u2019t married to Hester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suggest leaving the country as a solution, but you cannot.\u201d</p><p>Michael looked at him. \u201cIs that why you were absent from England for so long? Because Jessica was married to Benedict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea. You concealed it well.\u201d</p><p>Waving one hand carelessly, Alistair said, \u201cI was adept at hiding it from myself as well. I convinced myself that my interest was base and easily resolved by indulgence. In hindsight, that self-deception was probably wise. If I\u2019d known then that she would turn me so completely around and inside out, I might have run in terror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do seem different,\u201d Michael mused, studying him. \u201cLess agitated. Calmer. Tamed perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, lower your voice when you say such things.\u201d</p><p>Raucous laughter drew Michael\u2019s attention back over Alistair\u2019s shoulder. \u201cExcuse me a moment.\u201d</p><p>Alistair sighed and shook his head, taking another drink. In truth, he didn\u2019t understand Regmont, either. The only reason Alistair was sitting in Remington\u2019s was because he didn\u2019t have Jessica to go home to.</p><p>\u201cLord Baybury.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at Lucien Remington and smiled. \u201cRemington. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo well. May I join you a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t monopolize much of your time. If I\u2019m not home within the hour, my wife will come fetch me herself.\u201d The proprietor smiled and took an empty seat next to Michael\u2019s vacated one. \u201cForgive me in advance for my boldness. As you might be aware, I know a great many things about every gentleman granted membership here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Remington\u2019s eyes, renowned for their rare amethyst color, lit with humor. \u201cFor example, I know you and I are alike in ways others wouldn\u2019t suspect, and I can guess from that affinity how difficult your present situation must be for you.\u201d</p><p>Alistair stilled. Remington was the bastard son of a duke. Although he was His Grace\u2019s oldest child, it was his younger legitimate brother who would inherit the title and entailed properties.</p><p>\u201cDamnation,\u201d Alistair muttered, understanding that Remington knew of his bastardy\u2014a secret only his mother, Masterson, and Jessica were privy to. He\u2019d heard the rumors about the depth and breadth of information on file for each member of Remington\u2019s, but he could not have imagined this level of knowledge. Which led him to wondering if Remington knew who his father was ...</p><p>\u201cIf you ever require assistance or just a sympathetic ear,\u201d Remington said smoothly, as if he hadn\u2019t just shaken Alistair to the core, \u201cI would be honored to assist you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe bastards must stick together?\u201d Alistair queried, refraining from asking questions he wasn\u2019t sure he wished to know the answers to.</p><p>\u201cSomething of that nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d There were some men worth keeping in one\u2019s corner; Lucien Remington was one of them.</p><p>Shouts came from the bar. Remington pushed agilely to his feet. \u201cIf you will excuse, my lord. I must see to a problem that has become overly troublesome.\u201d</p><p>Alistair looked over his shoulder at Regmont\u2019s boisterous associates. \u201cA moment, please, Remington. Regarding your problem ... In light of the fact that his wife is soon to be my sister-in-law, should I assume he might be problematic for me as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Remington gave a regal bow of his head and departed.</p><p>Standing, Alistair looked for Michael and found him lounging insouciantly against the bar\u2014near to Regmont\u2019s group, but not a part of it. He went to him. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Michael reached into the inner pocket of his coat for the silver case that held his cheroots. Nearby, Regmont laughed and began to protest Remington\u2019s admonition that he quiet down or quit the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t wise.\u201d Alistair could feel the ill will building in the air around them like a brewing tempest. Regmont was inebriated to the point of bravado and stupidity, and Michael was clearly spoiling for a fight.</p><p>Lord Taylor, one of Regmont\u2019s friends, stumbled backward. He bumped Michael, whose cheroot case and kerchief were dislodged from his hand. They fell to the floor, expensive cheroots rolling free of the opened case.</p><p>\u201cMind yourself!\u201d Michael snapped, bending to retrieve his belongings.</p><p>Regmont made a cutting comment to Taylor, then crouched unsteadily to assist Michael. He picked up a cheroot, then the kerchief. He stilled, sobering as he examined the folded linen.</p> <p>Michael held out his hand for it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The earl\u2019s thumb stroked over the letters embroidered into the corner. \u201cInteresting monogram.\u201d</p><p>Alistair looked closer, cursing silently at the unmistakable \u201cH\u201d stitched in red thread.</p><p>\u201cIf you would, please, Regmont,\u201d Michael demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I will.\u201d Regmont met Michael\u2019s gaze, then Alistair\u2019s, before tucking the kerchief in his own pocket. \u201cI believe this belongs to me.\u201d</p> <p>The tension that gripped Michael was palpable. Alistair set his hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder and squeezed a warning. The liquor on the earl\u2019s breath was strong enough to be pervasive, and Alistair recognized the look of mayhem in his bloodshot eyes\u2014the devil was riding Regmont hard, spurring him into a dangerous place.</p><p>Michael stood. \u201cI want that back, Regmont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome and get it.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s hands fisted. Remington stepped between the two men. The proprietor was tall and fit, perfectly capable of interceding physically, but he was also flanked by three liveried members of his staff. \u201cYou can take this downstairs, gentlemen,\u201d he warned, diverting them to the pugilist rings below, \u201cor you can take it elsewhere, but there will be no violence in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we can take it to the field,\u201d Michael challenged. \u201cName your seconds, Regmont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Alistair muttered.</p> <p>\u201cTaylor and Blackthorne.\u201d</p><p>Michael nodded. \u201cBaybury and Merrick will discuss the particulars with them tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d Regmont said, baring his teeth in a semblance of a smile.</p><p>\u201cNot nearly as much as I.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>My dearest,</p><p>I confess, I have thought of you all day, in ways I am certain you would enjoy. I pray that you are looking after yourself.</p><p>Acheron growled from his pillow by Jess\u2019s feet. She paused with the quill suspended above the parchment, then she leaned over to frown down at the tiny pug.</p> <p>\u201cWhat troubles you?\u201d</p><p>He repeated the small sound of disapproval, then bounded to the door leading to the gallery. There, he jumped and spun in circles. As Jess fetched her shawl to take him outside to relieve himself, his ears lay back against his head and he growled again. Then he whimpered pitifully and piddled on the hardwood before she reached him.</p><p>\u201cAcheron.\u201d Her tone was soft with resignation. The pug whined in response.</p><p>Jess collected a towel from the washstand in the corner and moved to the door. As she neared, she heard a masculine voice raised in anger. She dropped the towel on the tiny puddle and turned the knob. The sound of shouting became clearer without the solid wood barrier, and its source became recognizable\u2014Hester\u2019s rooms.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you\u2019re upset,\u201d she murmured to Acheron, tossing her shawl on a nearby chair. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>She strode swiftly down the hallway. Regmont\u2019s voice grew louder with every step. Her stomach knotted and her palms grew damp. As familiar fear set in, she fought to breathe in an even cadence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve humiliated me! All these weeks ... the match with Tarley ... I will not be cuckolded!\u201d</p><p>Hester\u2019s low replies were indecipherable, but the rapid delivery suggested anger ... or panic. When a crash resounded, Jess lunged for the door and threw it open.</p><p>Dear God ...</p><p>Her sister stood in her night rail, her face blanched and lips white. Her eyes were huge in her face and filled with a terror Jess knew all too well. A new bruise was already darkening her temple.</p><p>Regmont\u2019s back was to the door, his hands fisted at his sides. He was dressed for a night on the town, and he stank of liquor and tobacco. A side table had been overturned, and the decorative urn that graced it lay shattered on the floor. He began to advance. Jess shouted his name.</p><p>He stilled, his back stiffening. \u201cGet out, Lady Tarley. This is none of your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should be the one to depart, my lord,\u201d she retorted, trembling. \u201cYour wife is breeding and has orders from the doctor to abstain from any excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it even mine?\u201d he barked at Hester. \u201cHow many men have there been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Jess,\u201d Hester pleaded. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>Jess shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t always be the one who saves me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegmont.\u201d Jess\u2019s voice cracked like a whip. \u201cPlease leave.\u201d</p><p>He rounded on her then, and her heart stopped. His eyes were bloodshot and filled with the single-minded malevolence Hadley always displayed when determined to use his fists on someone who couldn\u2019t fight back.</p><p>\u201cThis is my house!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cAnd you ... you have come here with your harlot ways and attached scandal to my good name. Now your sister seeks to do the same. I won\u2019t have it!\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s ears filled with the sound of roaring blood, muffling his vitriol, but she understood his threat to teach her proper behavior. The room spun. She\u2019d lived through this moment before. Heard those same words. So many times ...</p><p>The fear receded as swiftly as it had come, leaving an odd calm in its wake. She was not a frightened, lonely girl anymore. Alistair had shown her that she was stronger than she\u2019d given herself credit for. And when he came for her, which he would do as soon as she could send for him, Regmont would pay for his actions this night.</p><p>\u201cHitting me,\u201d she said, \u201cwould be the biggest mistake you will ever make in your life.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and drew his arm back.</p><p>Michael vaulted onto the back of his horse, then watched Alistair do the same. A raging feeling of helplessness goaded his agitation. He wanted his handkerchief back, damn it. He wanted Hester. And he wanted Regmont dead with a fervor that scared him.</p><p>\u201cSay something!\u201d he snapped at Alistair, who hadn\u2019t spoken since he\u2019d challenged Regmont.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you kill him in a duel. Then what?\u201d Alistair spurred his mount away from Remington\u2019s. \u201cYou avoid persecution by fleeing the country. Your family suffers without you. Hester hates you for taking her husband from her. Jessica becomes furious with me for being even remotely attached to this mess. Will you feel better then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no notion of what this is like! How it feels to know she needs looking after and I cannot be the one to do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d Alistair asked softly, glancing aside at him.</p><p>\u201cNo. You do not. Whatever envy you may have harbored for my brother\u2019s good fortune, you at least knew he cared for Jessica and saw to her comfort. He made her happy. You did not have to wonder at every minute of every day if he was raising his hand to her. If she was terrified or hurt or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Alistair yanked so hard on his reins that his horse reared up with a whinny of protest. The clap of hooves to cobblestone was like a thundercrack in the darkness. The gelding pranced in agitation, turning completely around. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe beats her. I know he does. From things I\u2019ve observed, and things my mother has observed as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you.\u201d The fury in Alistair\u2019s tone was unmistakable. \u201cAnd you allowed him to leave? What if he\u2019s at home now?\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s own wrath boiled over. \u201cWhat can I do? She is his wife. I have no recourse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessica is there! And her greatest terror is a man\u2019s rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadley was abusive,\u201d Alistair bit out, pulling his horse around. \u201cHe punished the girls as liberally and as painfully as possible.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s gut twisted. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>Alistair kicked his mount into a gallop, bending low over the horse\u2019s arched neck and weaving recklessly through the busy streets. Michael followed close behind him.</p><p>Jess watched Regmont\u2019s arm draw back and steeled herself for the blow, refusing to cower.</p><p>But before it came, a sickening thud reverberated through the room. She watched, astonished and confused, as Regmont\u2019s eyes rolled back into his head. He crumpled to the floor in a boneless heap.</p><p>Startled, she stumbled back. Blood seeped through his blond hair and glistened in the candlelight. A harsh clattering drew Jess\u2019s gaze to the fireplace poker rattling on the floor ... dropped from Hester\u2019s lax hand.</p><p>\u201cJess ...\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lifted. Her sister doubled over with a sharp cry of pain. There was blood at Hester\u2019s feet, coursing down her legs, rapidly forming a spreading pool. No ...</p><p>Pounding footsteps approached. \u201cJessica!\u201d</p><p>She called out to him as she leaped over Regmont toward Hester.</p><p>Alistair appeared, followed directly by Michael. Both men skid to a halt at Regmont\u2019s body. Jessica caught Hester just as her sister\u2019s knees gave out. Together, they sank to the floor.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d Jess asked as she paced the length of the downstairs parlor. Acheron sprawled beneath the table between the settees, whining softly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alistair came to her, bearing a glass of brandy. \u201cHere. Drink this.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the amber liquid longingly, wanting the soothing oblivion of liquor with a ferocity that was nearly undeniable. Her throat was dry and her hands unsteady, symptoms she knew would be alleviated by one small drink, but she found the will to shake her head. She wasn\u2019t going backward. The past was behind her. After tonight, she was newly determined to leave it there.</p><p>Her gaze roamed the room. The cheery yellow d\u00e9cor seemed absurd considering the state of the couple who laid claim to it.</p><p>\u201cShe brained him with the poker,\u201d she murmured, still trying to grasp the enormity of what had transpired and how blind she\u2019d been to the signs of abuse</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Michael said with vehemence.</p><p>Alistair set the brandy down and came up behind her. He caught her shoulders with his large hands, massaging the painfully tight muscles. \u201cThe doctor is seeing to your sister first, but he says Regmont will need stitches.\u201d</p><p>Jess\u2019s heart broke. \u201cShe was despondent before. Now that she\u2019s lost the baby ...\u201d</p><p>Michael snatched the brandy from the table and tossed it back in one swallow. His hair was a mess from the relentless raking of his fingers, and his dark eyes were haunted.</p><p>Finally, Jess saw the love he harbored for her sister. Guilt ate at her like acid. She had steered Hester toward Regmont all the while a man worthy of her was right beneath their noses.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at Alistair. \u201cAfter we are wed, I would like Hester to stay with us for whatever time she needs. I don\u2019t think she should remain in this house any longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His beautiful eyes were soft and filled with sympathy and love.</p><p>She breathed him in, absorbing the soothing scent of sandalwood and musk with that invigorating hint of verbena. She set her hands over his, grateful for him in so many ways. He anchored her in the midst of chaos, giving her the strength she needed to do the same for Hester.</p><p>\u201cIn the interim,\u201d Michael said, \u201cyou should both reside with me. You have lived in the house longer than I have, Jessica, and the servants are well versed in your needs. It will be familiar to Hester. And my mother is there for now. She can be a great help, too.\u201d</p><p>The report of a pistol broke the silence, followed by a bloodcurdling scream. Jess\u2019s stomach lurched. She was running toward the stairs before she knew what she was about. Michael passed her on the first landing, but Alistair stayed with her, catching her arm just before they reached Hester\u2019s room.</p><p>Dr. Lyon stood in the gallery, grim faced. He pointed at Hester\u2019s door in front of him. \u201cHis lordship went in and threw the latch.\u201d</p><p>On the other side of the door, Hester was still screaming.</p><p>Panic stole the strength from Jess\u2019s knees, but Alistair held her up. Michael gripped the doorknob and rammed into the paneled wood with his shoulder. The frame creaked in protest, but the lock held fast.</p><p>The doctor spoke in a rush, his volume rising with every word. \u201cHe was unconscious in his bedchamber when I began the stitching. Then he woke ... became enraged ... asked after Lady Regmont. I told him to lower his voice, to calm himself. I explained his wife was resting after losing the babe. He went mad ... ran from the room ... I tried to follow, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Michael rammed into the door again. The doorjamb cracked, but did not give way. Alistair joined him. Together they kicked the portal in unison, and it flew open with a thunderous crack. They rushed inside, followed by the doctor. Jess was swift on their heels, but Alistair pivoted agilely and caught her by the waist, carrying her back out to the gallery.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go in there,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cHester!\u201d she shouted, struggling to look over his shoulder.</p><p>He clutched her trembling body close and held tight. \u201cIt was Regmont.\u201d</p><p>As the possibilities sank in, Jess felt all the warmth leave her limbs. \u201cDear God. Hester.\u201d</p><p>Hester curled against Jessica\u2019s side and held on tightly. Cocooned in the counterpane of Jess\u2019s bed in the guest room, she was still so cold.</p><p>Jess\u2019s hand stroked over her head while whispering soft words of comfort. It seemed almost as if they were children again and Jess was providing the sense of safety and love Hester had only ever felt with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ached everywhere. A bone-deep ache that stripped all the strength from her limbs. Her child was gone. Her husband as well. And she couldn\u2019t feel anything but dead inside. It amazed her to sense her breath blowing past her lips. She would have thought such signs of life were beyond her.</p><p>\u201cIt was Edward at the last,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her sister fell silent.</p><p>\u201cHe came into my room as the man I\u2019d come to hate and fear. Wild eyed and brandishing that pistol. I felt such relief to see him. I thought, \u2018Finally, the pain and sorrow will end.\u2019 I thought he would be merciful and free me from it.\u201d</p> <p>Jess\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t think of it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Hester tried to swallow, but her mouth and throat were too dry. \u201cI begged him. \u2018Please. Take my life. The babe is gone from me ... Please. Let me go.\u2019 And then it was Edward standing there. I could see it in his eyes. They were so bleak. He saw what he\u2019d done when he wasn\u2019t himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHester. Shh ... You need your r-rest.\u201d</p><p>The telltale break in her Jess\u2019s voice echoed through her. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t spare me this agony. To the end he was selfish and thought only of himself. And yet I miss him. The man he used to be. The man I married. You do remember him, don\u2019t you, Jess?\u201d Her head tilted back to look up at her sister\u2019s face. \u201cYou do recall the way he was long ago?\u201d</p><p>Jess nodded, her eyes and nose red from tears.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Hester asked, lowering her chin. \u201cThat I am happy he\u2019s gone, yet I am so sad ... equally?\u201d</p><p>A long stretch of silence ensued, then, \u201cI suppose, perhaps, you miss the promise of what could have been, while at the same time you are grateful that what it was instead is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Hester burrowed closer, seeking more of her sister\u2019s warmth. \u201cWhat do I d-do now? How do I g-go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day at a time. You rise, you eat, you bathe, and you talk to the few people you can tolerate while feeling so wretched. Over time, it hurts a little less. Then a little less. And so on.\u201d Jess ran her fingers through Hester\u2019s unbound hair. \u201cUntil one morning, you will awake and realize the pain is only a memory. It will always be with you, but it will eventually lack the power to cripple you.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned Hester\u2019s eyes, then wet the bodice of Jess\u2019s gown. Jess had climbed into bed with Hester fully dressed, offering the connection Hester needed before she even comprehended that she needed it.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should be happy,\u201d Hester whispered, \u201cthat I am no longer increasing with my dead husband\u2019s child, but I can\u2019t be happy about it. It hurts too much.\u201d</p> <p>A sob broke the hush in the room, a raw sound of pain too fresh to manage. It clawed through Hester\u2019s numbness and ripped into her vitals, tearing her apart. \u201cI wanted that baby, Jess. I wanted my baby ...\u201d</p><p>Jess began to rock her back and forth, words spilling out in a frantic attempt to soothe. \u201cThere will be others. Someday, you will have the happiness you deserve. Someday, you will have it all, and everything that transpired to get you to that place of contentment will make sense to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say such things!\u201d She couldn\u2019t even contemplate another pregnancy. It seemed like such a betrayal of the child she\u2019d lost. As if babes were replaceable. Interchangeable.</p><p>\u201cNo matter what happens, I will be with you.\u201d Jess\u2019s lips pressed to her forehead. \u201cWe will make it through together. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Hester closed her eyes, certain Jess was the only one who could say such a thing. Even the Lord Himself had abandoned her.</p><p>Alistair entered his home, weary to his soul. Jessica\u2019s pain was his own, and his heart was heavy with the sadness and horror that presently shadowed her life.</p><p>He handed his hat and gloves to the waiting butler.</p><p>\u201cHer Grace awaits you in your study, my lord,\u201d Clemmons announced.</p> <p>Glancing at the long case clock, Alistair noted the lateness of the hour. It was nearly one in the morning. \u201cHow long has she been waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly four hours now, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Clearly the news she carried was not good. Steeling himself for the worst, Alistair went to the study and found his mother reading on the settee. Her feet were tucked up beside her, and her lap was covered with a thin blanket. A fire roared in the hearth. A candelabrum on the table at her shoulder illuminated the pages in front of her and gilded her dark beauty.</p><p>She looked up. \u201cAlistair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d He rounded his desk and shrugged out of his coat. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze raked over him. \u201cPerhaps I should ask the same of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day has been endless, and the evening even longer.\u201d He sank into his chair with a tired exhalation. \u201cWhat do you require of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust I always want something from you?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, noting the hints of strain around her eyes and mouth, signs he\u2019d most recently cataloged on Lady Regmont\u2014the signs of a woman in a troubled marriage. Signs he would never see on Jessica\u2019s face because he would die before he caused her such sorrow.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, Louisa pushed the blanket aside and swung her legs over the edge of the settee. She clasped her hands in her lap and rolled her shoulders back. \u201cI likely deserve your wariness and suspicion. I was so focused on what I was feeling that I did not pay enough attention to what you were feeling. I am so tremendously sorry for that. I\u2019ve wronged you for many years.\u201d</p><p>Alistair\u2019s heartbeat sped up, confusion warring with disbelief. As a boy, he\u2019d wanted to hear such words from her more than he had wanted anything else.</p><p>\u201cI came to tell you,\u201d she went on, \u201cI wish you happy. It does my heart good to see you well loved and admired. I did see it. I also felt it. She esteems the ground you walk upon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I do for her.\u201d He rubbed the spot over his chest that ached for Jessica. \u201cAnd her regard will never alter or diminish. She knows the worst there is to know about me, yet she loves me in spite of my mistakes. No ... I would say perhaps she loves me because of them; because of how they\u2019ve shaped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wondrous gift to be loved unconditionally. It is my failing that I didn\u2019t do the same, my son.\u201d She stood. \u201cI want you to know that I will support you and your choice to the last. I\u2019ll hold her in my heart as you do.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips stroked over the smooth lacquered top of his desk. By God, he was exhausted. He wanted Jess beside him, close to his heart. He needed to hold her and comfort her and find his own peace with her. \u201cIt means a great deal that you came to me, Mother. That you waited for my return. That you give me your blessing. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Louisa nodded. \u201cI love you, Alistair. I will endeavor to show you how much, and pray that one day there will no longer be any reticence or mistrust between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like that.\u201d</p><p>His mother rounded the desk. She bent and pressed her lips to his cheek.</p><p>He caught her wrist before she straightened, holding her close to gauge her reaction. Had she truly come, repentant and guileless, with warm sentiment? Or had she already been given the news he was about to share with her, freeing her to give her blessing with mitigated risk?</p><p>\u201cYou will be a grandmother,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She froze and her breath caught, then her eyes widened and filled with startled joy. \u201cAlistair\u2014\u201d</p><p>So, she hadn\u2019t known. The warmth of her acceptance and blessing spread through him. \u201cNot mine. As you likely surmised, Jessica is barren. But Emmaline ... Albert saw to his duty after all. Perhaps not a boy I could name as my heir, but regardless of gender, you will at least have the joy of a grandchild.\u201d</p><p>A tremulous smile banished the melancholy reflected in Louisa\u2019s blue eyes\u2014irises that were so like his.</p><p>Alistair smiled back.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cYour sister looks well,\u201d commented Her Grace, the Duchess of Masterson.</p><p>Jess looked across the veranda table at Alistair\u2019s mother. \u201cYes, she is healthy and strong. And every day, she remembers a little more about laughter and finding joy.\u201d</p><p>Just beyond the carved stone balusters that divided the veranda from the immaculate Masterson gardens, many of the dozen guests attending Jess\u2019s house party strolled through the neatly trimmed yew hedges. Even Masterson was out enjoying the beautiful day, holding hands with the infant Master Albert who was toddling along the gravel paths.</p><p>\u201cLord Tarley seems quite taken with her,\u201d Louisa noted.</p><p>Jess\u2019s gaze moved back to Hester and Michael, following as they walked together; Hester with her parasol, and Michael with his hands clasped behind his back. They made a lovely couple, his dark comeliness so beautifully complementing her sister\u2019s golden beauty.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been a dear friend for a long time,\u201d Jess said. \u201cBut these last two years have proven him to be invaluable in so many ways. He\u2019s made her feel safe, and from that position of safety, Hester has found the peace of mind to heal. Much as your son did for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is no less than what you have done for him.\u201d The duchess lifted her teacup to her lips, her porcelain skin shielded beneath the brim of her wide straw hat. \u201cWhere is my son, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s looking into an irrigation problem of some sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he knows that Masterson is impressed with him.\u201d</p><p>There was no way for Alistair to know since the two men rarely spoke, but such unfortunate rifts were topics best left for another day. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything he fails to excel in. Truly, I find it remarkable that such a romantic and creative soul should also be so well versed in numbers, engineering, and countless other analytical pursuits.\u201d</p><p>There was also his physical prowess, but that was for Jess alone to know and enjoy.</p><p>\u201cMilady.\u201d</p><p>Her attention moved to the maid who approached with a missive in hand. Jess smiled and accepted it, immediately recognizing her husband\u2019s penmanship on the exterior. She broke the seal with a smile.</p><p>Find me.</p><p>\u201cIf you will please excuse me, Your Grace,\u201d she said, pushing back from the table and standing.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Always.\u201d Jess moved through the open French doors into the house. The interior was quiet and peaceful, the large sprawling estate somehow retaining a feeling of intimacy and welcome. She and Alistair occupied one wing of the manse during the summer months, while the duke and duchess occupied the other most of the year. This was their second year summering with his family and, so far, it was progressing better than the first. Alistair\u2019s naming of Albert\u2019s son as his heir had been a great relief to all.</p><p>Jess had used the excuse of requiring assistance with a house party to bring Hester closer to rejoining Society with the start of the next Season. The past two years had been difficult, with the scandal surrounding Regmont\u2019s death and all the speculation that sprang from it. Jess\u2019s marriage to Alistair Caulfield, a future duke, had helped to divert attention, but nothing could hasten the healing process for Hester. Still, her sister\u2019s recovery was progressing slowly but surely, with Michael always nearby if she needed him, a solid and unobtrusive friend. Perhaps he would become something more to her one day, when Hester was ready. Alistair believed his friend would wait patiently, just as Alistair had done for Jess.</p><p>Heading to Alistair\u2019s study first, she found the space empty. She moved to the parlor, then the billiards room, but still didn\u2019t find him. It was only when she began ascending the right side of the split staircase that she heard the faint strains of a violin. Her heart swelled with joy. Listening to Alistair play was one of her favorite pastimes. Sometimes, after they\u2019d made love, he would rise from their bed and engage the stringed instrument. She would lie there and listen, hearing in the notes all the emotion he couldn\u2019t convey with words. It was the same with his drawings. The finely wrought pencil lines captured moments and expressions only a lover would grasp and treasure. They told her more eloquently than speech how precious she was to him, how often he thought of her, and how deeply he felt about her.</p><p>Jess followed the haunting strains of a plaintive melody to their rooms. Two of the upstairs maids lingered in the hall, as awed as Jess, until they saw her approach and scrambled away. She opened the sitting room door, then shut and locked it behind her. Contentment swept over her along with the increased volume of music. She located her spouse in their bedroom, standing before the open window, his clothing removed except for his buff-colored trousers. Acheron lay at his feet, staring raptly up at him, as entranced as everyone became when he played.</p><p>As Alistair slid the bow to and fro across the strings, the muscles of his arms and back flexed and clenched with the fluid movements, creating a view she would never tire of. She sat on the bench at the foot of the bed, watching and listening, her blood already beginning to heat and thicken with anticipation.</p><p>It was the middle of the day. Numerous guests surrounded and awaited them. Yet he\u2019d lured her to their bedroom to seduce her with the refinement of his talent and the primitive lust of his virility\u2014appealing to the disparate needs she hadn\u2019t been aware of until he\u2019d shown them to her.</p><p>The music faded into the warm summer breeze, and she applauded softly. He placed the instrument carefully within its case.</p><p>\u201cI love to hear you play,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAnd I love the sight of your bare back and provocative backside, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>He faced her and her breath caught. He was partially aroused and wholly beautiful.</p><p>Jess licked her lower lip. \u201cI feel overdressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d His approach was both predatory and graceful, his rippled abdomen and confident stride engaging all of her feminine instincts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat lascivious agenda do you pursue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been wed just over a year, yet I have not been granted my husbandly right to a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of heated pleasure rippled through her. \u201cOh? My poor darling. Have you been denied any other husbandly rights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t deny yourself.\u201d Alistair caught her by the elbows and tugged her to her feet. There was a roughness and urgency to his touch that belied the softness of the melody with which he\u2019d mesmerized her. Her nipples beaded tight beneath her bodice in response.</p><p>He knew, of course. His hands cupped her swelling breasts and kneaded with slightly more pressure than necessary. The edge to him made her hot and wet, eager. She loved all the ways he made love to her, but the times he sought her out while at the end of his control were special. She no longer had to drive him to the precipice. He stood on the cliff and called for her, deliberately bringing her close at the times when he was capable of being most vulnerable. Then, they would make the fall together, as they did everything together.</p><p>She set her hands on his hips, tugging herself closer. \u201cI\u2019m too self-indulgent when it comes to you,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cIndulge yourself with me on a honeymoon,\u201d he coaxed in that dark voice of sin. \u201cWeeks on a ship. Months in Jamaica. We have unfinished business there, you and I. Hester is strong enough now to bear the loss of you for a time, and Michael will look after her with as much care as he would look after his own heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you go now? Can you afford the time away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Masterson. Now is the time to go, while he is fit and able.\u201d His hands slid up to her face, cupping her cheeks. Tilting his head, he brought his lips to hers, kissing her softly. \u201cI want to swim with you naked. I want to show you the fields burning. I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014fuck in the rain,\u201d she whispered, just to feel the tension grip him. \u201cThere is no need to seduce me to elicit my acquiescence. I would go with you anywhere, for any reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this way is much more enjoyable.\u201d Bending his knees, he matched his thick erection to the juncture of her thighs and rolled his hips against her. \u201cWith the windows open and our guests outside, you will have to be quiet in your pleasures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you do your worst to make me scream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy best.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved against his lips. \u201cPerhaps you will be the noisy one. Perhaps I will make you groan and curse and beg for mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a challenge, Lady Baybury?\u201d he purred. \u201cYou know I cannot resist a challenge.\u201d</p><p>Jess reached behind him and gripped his taut, delicious buttocks. \u201cI know. In fact, I am counting on that.\u201d</p><p>Acheron, well versed in the proclivities of his lord and mistress, padded out of the room and found his mat beside the chaise in the adjoining sitting room. Flopping to his side, he fell into a blissful canine slumber, lulled by the sweet sounds of laughter and love that spilled from the bedroom behind him. </p> </body></html>"]
