Not even one day past forever.</p><p>Because she knew the kind of man he was and she knew he was exactly the kind of man she had sworn she would never allow herself to have.</p><p>Yet it was happening.</p><p>Suspended between complete disbelief and mind-numbing pleasure, Piper Mackay found herself mesmerized by Jedediah Booker\u2019s kiss.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>Her fingers curled around his wrists, though in protest or simply to find something to hold on to, she wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>What she was certain of\u2014she hadn\u2019t expected this.</p><p>His broad fingers splayed into her hair as his palms cupped her cheeks, holding her in place for his kiss. His lips slanted over hers, rubbing sensuously, and sent spikes of heat burrowing through her senses.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be so sexy.</p><p>The feel of his hard, muscular body against her smaller one, pressing her against the wall at her back, had her knees weakening at the eroticism of the position. The feel of the hardened length of his shaft as it pressed against the towel covering him, throbbing against her stomach, was almost too intense to bear.</p><p>She wanted to touch him.</p><p>She wanted to run her hands over his hard, powerful body and feel the flex of muscle beneath the darkly tanned flesh. She wanted to do more than stand, frozen, on the verge of fleeing in fear as his tongue flicked against her lips, teasing her to taste him in turn.</p><p>Just one taste.</p><p>She could take just a moment to experience what she had promised herself she would not tempt.</p><p>The wild, erotic promise of Jed\u2019s possession.</p><p>Her tongue peeked out, touched his, then lingered.</p><p>A moan slipped free; completely against her will and her better judgment as she allowed his lips and tongue free rein in the kiss they were initiating.</p><p>A deep, rough male growl sounded in his throat as his hands slid from her face and moved quickly to her hips. Before she could process the move, before she could make sense of it, Piper found herself lifted, her legs parting, the soft material of her skirt falling back over her thighs, and the broad, fiery heat of Jed\u2019s cock throbbing, hot and naked, free of the towel, against the silk of the panties shielding her sex.</p><p>She could have protested.</p><p>She would have protested.</p> <p>But it was so good.</p><p>Everything was just so good.</p><p>The lush eroticism of the kiss, the heat of his hands against her flesh, the seductive, sensuous pleasure beginning to blaze through her senses. It was so good that resisting was impossible.</p><p>His hands clenched on her rear, kneading the rounded curves as his hips rocked against her, sending shudders of pleasure racing through her.</p><p>He slanted his lips over hers, one hand sliding from the curve of her ass, and she found herself gripping his thighs with her knees as his hand pushed beneath the soft cotton shirt she wore.</p><p>Piper fought to breathe.</p><p>She was lost in a world of sensation and pleasure. He held her to him as his hand slid up her side, calloused palms rasping against her flesh just before his fingers curled around the bare mound of one breast.</p><p>Finding the hardened tip with his thumb and rubbing against it, he found another way to throw her senses into complete chaos. Her nipples were so sensitive, so responsive, that even her own touch had the power to make her gasp.</p><p>Jed\u2019s touch, so much more experienced and knowing, had the power to do much more.</p><p>His touch against the ripened bud had the power to bring her nearly to release. Playing with the little bud, he rolled his thumb over it before gripping the pebble-hard tip between his thumb and forefinger. Sharpened spikes of sensation tore along the nerve endings to her clitoris before slamming into her womb.</p><p>Piper tightened her thighs against his hips, rocking with him, rubbing herself against the broad thickness of the heavy cock throbbing against the heated folds of her sex. Sharp waves of hunger rushed along nerve endings that seemed newly awakened, created only to respond to Jed\u2019s touch. Sensitized and now greedy for sensation they throbbed and ached for more and more.</p><p>It was so good.</p><p>It was too good.</p><p>\u201cPiper, sweetheart . . .\u201d</p><p>His breathing was as rough as her own, ragged; he was fighting to draw in air as he tore his lips from hers and buried them at her neck.</p><p>Tipping her head back, Piper fought to increase the sensation of his lips brushing against the sensitive flesh at the curve of her shoulder. The feel of the tip of his tongue tasting her and awakening a sensual hunger she hadn\u2019t known existed inside her.</p><p>Digging her nails into his bare shoulders, she told herself just a few more seconds. She would allow herself to experience the pleasure, the incredible building heat burning through her body, for just a few more seconds.</p><p>His teeth raked against the side of her neck as she felt his body tighten further. A low groan of male pleasure echoed at her ear.</p><p>\u201cI could lose myself in you, Piper,\u201d he groaned in building lust. \u201cSo fucking easy.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, what had she gotten herself into?</p><p>She had known not to enter his room.</p><p>Some part of her had known he was still there.</p><p>The temptation had been overwhelming.</p><p>Like some damned ninny in a suspense novel, she had crept right in. At the very moment she had closed the door behind her, certain he must be gone, he\u2019d stepped from the bathroom, obviously having just left the shower.</p><p>Had she had the good sense to leave?</p><p>Hell, no.</p><p>\u201cJed.\u201d Whispering his name, she fought to hold on to him, fought to remember why this was a very bad idea.</p><p>\u201cPiper. Sweetheart . . .\u201d</p><p>The room was spinning\u2014no, Jed was moving. Wrapping one arm around her hips, he turned, bearing her to the bed and laying her back against the sheets he\u2019d slept on the night before.</p><p>The subtle scent of male warmth and the dark hint of the cologne he wore lingered on the bedclothes, surrounding her and sinking into her senses. She felt surrounded by him, overwhelmed by him, and unwilling as well as unable to fight against the pleasure clouding her mind.</p><p>Before she could even consider protesting, the soft cotton shirt she wore was pushed over her breasts and the sensitive, tight peak of her nipple was suddenly surrounded by the wet heat of his mouth. It happened so quickly, with such heat that her senses immediately exploded with sensation.</p><p>Piper jerked upward, a moan rasping from her lips as her eyes closed in rising pleasure.</p><p>The lash of his tongue over the sensitive peak sent sensation spiraling from her hardened nipple straight to the clenched, aching depths of her vagina. The tight, swollen bud of her clit pulsed with need. Heat flushed her body, and the slick dew of arousal dampened the swollen folds of her sex and the silk of her panties.</p><p>Pushing her fingers into the overlong strands of his hair to hold him to the tingling, heated bud of her nipple, Piper felt herself giving up\u2014giving in.</p><p>The pleasure was too intense.</p><p>The need that had risen over the past year since her sister had moved out of the inn their mother owned to live with her fianc\u00e9 was only burning with a greater, fiery hunger.</p><p>Had she been insane when she had taken her mother\u2019s offer to move into Eve\u2019s suite just days after Jed had moved into the room beside it?</p><p>Had she known this would happen?</p><p>God, she had.</p><p>She\u2019d known she would end up in his bed, and she knew he\u2019d break her heart.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to help it. He would destroy her.</p><p>That thought, that fear, had a reality check suddenly clicking in her mind.</p><p>\u201cJed. Jed . . . not a good idea,\u201d she cried out, even as she lifted her hips to grind the mound of her sex more firmly against his cock while he palmed both breasts.</p><p>\u201cMy best idea yet,\u201d he muttered, his voice hoarse as one hand slid to the bend of her knee to lift it higher along his hip.</p><p>His hips pressed and rolled, grinding his shaft more firmly against her clit and soaking her panties with her juices as he used both hands to press her breasts together. His lips moved from one hardened nipple to the other, licking and suckling, pulling repeated moans from her lips as her ability to fight against the pleasure dissipated.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed of this.</p><p>She\u2019d fantasized about it for far longer than the past year.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love how you taste,\u201d he muttered, his head lifting, his lips coming back to hers as he gripped her nipples between fingers and thumbs and played with them erotically.</p><p>His tongue pressed against her lips, parted them, met hers, and stroked against it with heated demand.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t asking for anything, definitely not the right to have her.</p><p>He considered her his due.</p><p>That thought sent a wave of trepidation racing through her, only to disintegrate beneath a harder, deeper kiss as one hand left her breasts to stroke her thigh.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Piper.\u201d He tore his lips from hers to blaze a trail of fire down her neck to her breasts once again as strong, knowing fingers pressed beneath the elastic of her panties.</p><p>Lifting her hips, angling them to the fingers pressing closer to her clitoris, Piper could feel the slickened fall of damp warmth spilling from her, preparing the sensitive flesh for his touch.</p><p>She was so ready for him. So ready to have his fingers delve into the feminine folds that ached for his touch that she felt poised on a pinpoint of agonizing arousal.</p><p>He was so close to touching her clit. So close to caressing that heated bud of sensitized nerve endings that she could swear she could feel the warmth of his fingers as they neared her.</p><p>So close . . .</p><p>A heavy knocking at the door had them stilling.</p><p>Piper struggled to open her eyes, meeting his gaze as his head jerked up from where his lips had strayed to her midriff.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jed, we have to run.\u201d Elijah Grant was on the other side, his knuckles rapping against the glass of the patio doors across from the bed once again. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, suddenly desperate that she not be seen here, with him, all but naked and fucked in his bed.</p><p>Oh, God, what was she doing?</p><p>Jed could see the sudden panic flaring in her gaze. The instant withdrawal the second she consciously realized just how close she was to having given in to him wasn\u2019t lost on him. The hunger that kept them bound to each other wasn\u2019t going to go away. No matter how hard he fought it, no matter how desperately she denied it.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes,\u201d he called out to Elijah. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the bikes.\u201d</p><p>She was trembling beneath him.</p><p>The feel of the subtle tremors racing through her delicate body had the power to piss him off as nothing else could. It was like this every time he neared her, every time the hunger flared between them. She would tremble, get that look of wariness in her eyes, and instantly retreat.</p><p>He was damned sick of her retreating.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you scared of me?\u201d Focusing his gaze back on her, careful to keep his voice too low to carry beyond the room, he demanded an answer.</p><p>\u201cI am not scared of you.\u201d Determination and fiery stubbornness filled the deep sea green of her eyes and tightened the kittenish features of her face.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you scared of?\u201d Lowering his voice further, Jed brushed his lips against the swollen curves of Piper\u2019s while fighting the nearly overwhelming need to steal another kiss. To forget his partner was awaiting him and that now was not the time to make slow, easy love to her.</p><p>He would never pull himself from her if he did.</p><p>Elijah could walk in on them and it wouldn\u2019t stop Jed from having her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to go to work or something?\u201d she muttered instead as she pushed at his shoulders. \u201cLet me up, Jed, before Elijah starts picking the lock.\u201d</p><p>Elijah sure as hell wasn\u2019t above it if he thought the situation warranted it.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think he would pick the lock?\u201d He knew Elijah would do it, but what made her think he would?</p><p>Piper rolled her eyes up at him.</p><p>\u201cDo I really look that stupid to you, Jed?\u201d Mockery filled her gaze as he levered himself from her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched silently as she hurriedly pulled the shirt over the swollen mounds of her breasts and pushed the material of her skirt back down her legs before sitting up quickly.</p><p>A second later she was standing and sliding her feet back into the sandals she had somehow managed to lose. Or had pushed from her feet as he picked her up moments ago.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look stupid at all.\u201d Arching a brow, he strode to the chair across the room where he\u2019d laid his clean clothing earlier.</p> <p>Pulling boxer briefs over his legs and then the raging erection that refused to soften, he sat down, never taking his eyes from her, and pulled white socks over his feet.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t saying anything more.</p><p>Her arms were crossed beneath her breasts in a classic defensive posture as he almost gave in to the urge to sigh wearily.</p><p>Standing, Jed picked up an ink pen from the table next to him before moving to her once again.</p><p>She always carried her date book, with a small sketch pad in it, with her. At the moment, it was tucked in the side of the cleaning carryall she\u2019d placed on the floor when she entered the room.</p> <p>Bending, he pulled the five-by-seven leather-bound journal from the side pocket, flipped it open, then quickly scrawled his cell phone number in the back. The sketch pad enclosed with it was filled with colorful sketches of clothing designs and scrawled with notes. He would have loved to flip through the new designs he only glimpsed, but knew from experience she\u2019d become immediately defensive.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d she questioned warily as he finished.</p><p>Tucking the book back in place, Jed straightened and stared down at her with a sense of heavy disappointment.</p><p>\u201cWhen you decide you can give me a chance to prove that I have no intention of tying you down, Piper, then give me a call.\u201d Yeah, he knew at least part of her problem.</p><p>Strong men, men born with the same arrogant determination her Mackay brother and cousins possessed.</p><p>Capping the pen, he tossed it to the bureau close to the bed, then turned and moved back to the clothing he\u2019d abandoned moments before.</p> <p>He was aware of her watching him as he pulled on his jeans, secured the belt he\u2019d already pushed through the belt loops, then pushed his arms into the white, long-sleeved dress shirt he\u2019d chosen to wear.</p><p>White was for meetings; dark colors were for on the job. And all of it was bullshit, despite the sense of fulfillment he was getting from it. Far more fulfillment than the daily lies and undercover crap he was forced to practice.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be afraid you could even come close to tying me down, Jed?\u201d she finally asked, her lips curling into an amused little smile of disbelief. \u201cReally? Do you think I\u2019m attaching more to this\u201d\u2014she waved her arm toward the bed\u2014\u201cthan what you intend?\u201d</p><p>Using the chair once again, he sat down, pulled on his boots, and never took his eyes from her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope you were,\u201d he told her as he finished and rose to his feet once again. \u201cBecause, trust me, Piper, I have more intentions than you could ever imagine.\u201d</p><p>There was the fear.</p><p>It flashed in the bright green of her eyes and tightened her expression as she fought to hold back the response. Hell, she was fighting to hide that fear from him, and he hated it.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d she muttered, suddenly reaching down for her bag. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. Remind me to make damned sure you\u2019ve left before I come in to clean your room again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put chains on you, Piper.\u201d</p><p>She paused, her hand on the doorknob, her face turned from him as her head lowered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The edge of anger in her voice wasn\u2019t nearly as well hidden as he was certain she would have liked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do, Piper.\u201d He rejected the instant denial she gave the moment she turned her back on him. \u201cYou think if you take me as a lover then you\u2019ll be exchanging your brother\u2019s protectiveness for one far more permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s protectiveness? Is that what you call it?\u201d She turned back to him then. \u201cTrust me: They named my brother well when they nicknamed him Dawg. He\u2019s tenacious, and guards his territory like a junkyard dog. And he sees every damned one of his sisters, as well as our mother, as his territory. It wouldn\u2019t matter who we took as lovers, he\u2019d still be hovering over us like a damned pit bull.\u201d</p><p>There was no anger or heat in the words, only a sense of regret and uncertainty. In the past year, her life hadn\u2019t exactly been her own, as her brother did everything in his power to ensure the danger that had threatened her older sister didn\u2019t touch the younger ones.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put ties on you. I wouldn\u2019t treat you as though you didn\u2019t have the good sense to understand whether your life was in danger or not, and the intelligence to know whether you can live life as usual, sit tight, or just plain hide.\u201d</p><p>She watched him warily. \u201cYou\u2019re the same type of male Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches are.\u201d She finally informed him, and it was clear she believed it to the bottom of her soul. \u201cHaving you for a lover would be like sleeping with human handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>God help him, he swore he could see the pain and disillusionment filling her very soul. It was in the weariness of her voice and the soul-deep certainty that filled it.</p><p>\u201cI would defend you with my life,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut I would also defend your right to a life, Piper. When you decide you\u2019re tired of being a frightened little girl rather than the independent woman I know you are, then let me know. Perhaps once you\u2019ve figured out which you are, then we can resume all the pleasure we were interrupted in this morning.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders tightened, defiance and denial immediately flashing in her gaze.</p><p>Jed didn\u2019t hang around to hear her argument or her reasons for her beliefs; they would just piss him the fuck off.</p><p>He knew the past year had been hell on her and her younger sisters. Eve, the eldest, had pranced from the suite she\u2019d lived in for the past five years and moved in with the government agent she was now engaged to, perfectly content to fight her battles of independence and keep her opinions private within the secured houseboat they were currently living in at the lake.</p><p>Eve had left her younger sisters to face the fallout with her brother and cousins. Her sisters, though, had never been given a full explanation of why that overprotectiveness had suddenly increased, or when it would end. Though he knew Piper had her suspicions.</p><p>Jed couldn\u2019t explain what had happened either, not yet, not until he knew Piper understood his intentions where she was concerned.</p><p>But hell, in order to make her understand them, he was going to have to figure them out himself.</p><p>One thing was certain: He intended to have her in his bed. And he sure as hell didn\u2019t intend to let her go anytime soon once he had her there.</p><p>Hell, why couldn\u2019t he imagine ever letting her go, period?</p><p>ONE</p><p>ONE MONTH LATER</p><p>She was going to cave.</p><p>Piper could feel it coming. She could feel that bond of pleasure Jed had created four weeks before tightening between them, pulling them together.</p><p>She\u2019d taken Eve\u2019s suite on the first floor of Mackay\u2019s Bed-and-Breakfast Inn after her sister had moved in with her lover, Brogan Campbell.</p><p>Brogan had been staying in the suite next to Eve\u2019s for the two years he had been there doing whatever it was he was doing. She had a feeling he was a hell of a lot more than a building contractor or supervisor or whatever the hell he claimed to be. She was all but certain he was a covert agent and working directly with her mother\u2019s lover, Timothy Cranston.</p><p>And she highly suspected both Jedediah Booker and the other contractor staying at the inn, Elijah Grant, were Brogan\u2019s partners.</p><p>There had been strange things going on in Somerset\u2014hell, in Pulaski County, period\u2014for the past few years: thefts that didn\u2019t make sense, strangers who knew far too much about the people and the mountains where Piper now made her home. And far too many \u201cdisappearances\u201d of several of the criminal elements in the county.</p><p>It was damned freaky.</p><p>And she knew Jed was involved in it.</p><p>She watched them, she listened to the gossip and rumors that moved through the county, and she had a hell of an ability to tie together things that at first might not appear connected.</p><p>It was a talent she\u2019d often heard Dawg had as well.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what kind of talent she had. She could be as fully trained as any agent who had ever worked with her brother and he\u2019d still treat her like a five-year-old.</p><p>And so would Jed.</p><p>Pulling the older-model Jeep into the driveway of the post office, she set the parking brake before turning off the ignition and moving from the vehicle.</p><p>Sliding the small orange notification card from her purse, she looped the bag\u2019s strap over her shoulder and pushed open the glass door leading into the building.</p><p>\u201cHey there, Piper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiper, how\u2019s it goin\u2019 . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Piper, missed you last weekend. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Piper, Dawg going to let you come out and play this weekend?\u201d</p><p>She heard it every time she ran into the usual crowd of summer weekend partiers. Because Piper, normally the life of the party, had been absent or joined by her brother or cousins every time she tried to slip out to one of the lake parties. A Mackay always arrived within minutes of her showing up, and what was the point of staying if she was being guarded? She returned the greetings, answered where she had to, and waited patiently in line to sign for the certified letter she\u2019d been notified was waiting for her.</p><p>The New York City address hadn\u2019t really meant anything to her; neither had the name of the sender: S. Chaniss.</p><p>Accepting the envelope from the young clerk behind the counter, Piper thanked her quietly before making her way back to the Jeep.</p><p>Closing herself in and restarting the ignition, Piper flipped on the AC and quickly tore open the envelope.</p><p>She scanned the letter first; then, as disbelief set in and her heart began racing furiously, she read it more slowly.</p><p>Her hand began to tremble. Excitement began to build.</p><p>She\u2019d been making her own clothing designs since she was a child, and for nearly as long she had been sewing those designs together. She\u2019d learned early how to use a needle and thread, and she\u2019d torn her fingertips to ribbons as a child to perfect each and every stitch.</p><p>Now . . . now someone had noticed them. Someone of such renown in the fashion world that she had never imagined he would show an interest in her work.</p><p>Eldon Vessante, one of the biggest names in the New York fashion scene, had, for several years, been bringing in hot new designers, up to three a year, and staging exclusive runway shows for them.</p><p>By mentoring new talent he\u2019d made an even bigger name for himself, and each designer he\u2019d mentored was still a hot topic among the fashion world. And their designs were still being worn by models, movie stars, and the rich and famous.</p><p>Piper had sent several of her designs to the Vessante panel more than a year ago.</p><p>No one knew she had submitted the required six designs to the Vessante team. She hadn\u2019t even told her mother. Hell, she\u2019d forgotten about it months ago when no response had been forthcoming.</p><p>His assistant had sent the letter\u2014she quickly checked the date\u2014two days ago?</p><p>Oh, my God\u2014they had chosen her designs!</p><p>She wanted to scream.</p><p>She wanted to jump out of the Jeep and announce it to everyone on the street as they made their way into the post office and various businesses that lined the sidewalk.</p><p>She wanted to call her mother and Dawg. . . .</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Bad idea.</p><p>Very, very bad idea.</p><p>She really wanted to call Jed, and that was an even worse idea, because there was no way, despite his promise, that he wouldn\u2019t let Dawg in on where she was going and what she was doing.</p><p>She read the letter again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The excitement was about to get the best of her.</p><p>This was her dream. It was that one-in-a-million shot to realize every dream she\u2019d ever had of what she could accomplish with the talent she had.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t tell anyone.</p> <p>She lifted her head, moving her gaze from the letter to stare through the Jeep windshield, her excitement suddenly overshadowed by a heavy sadness. If she dared to say anything to anyone, then she would end up with more bodyguards on that trip than the queen of England. And wouldn\u2019t that make a hell of an impression?</p><p>If she thought for a moment that Dawg, Rowdy, or Natches would consider just one of them accompanying her, then it might have swayed her. She knew better, though. For the past summer, they seemed to be everywhere together. Piper had even gone so far as to ask them whether they were married to their wives or to one another.</p><p>She\u2019d even questioned why. Why had her sister been kidnapped the summer before? Who had done it? Why had they done it? All she\u2019d received in answer was a closed expression and change of topic. And the certainty that her brother and cousins, along with Timothy Cranston, were involved in something far more dangerous than they wanted their sisters to be aware of.</p><p>Carefully pushing the letter back into the large envelope it had arrived in, she turned it over and stared at the address once again.</p><p>S. Chaniss, the address read. New York City.</p> <p>There was no way anyone at the post office could really place exactly whom the letter was from or what it contained. Hiding it and the contents from curious eyes wouldn\u2019t be too hard.</p><p>Putting the Jeep in gear and pulling from the post office parking lot, she turned the vehicle toward home.</p><p>This sucked.</p><p>The rebellious resentment that had been brewing inside her for the past year flamed through her senses with a suddenness that made it nearly burst into full-fledged anger.</p><p>It simply wasn\u2019t fair. She should have been able to shout this accomplishment far and wide. At the very least she should have been able to race to the boutique where she sold many of the unique clothing designs she created.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even do that.</p> <p>Her fingers tightened on the steering wheel as she drove out of town and made the turn toward Mackay\u2019s Bed-and-Breakfast Inn.</p><p>As the renovated farmhouse came into view, Piper couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge the fact that had it not been for her brother Dawg, then her mother would have died and she and her sisters would have been worse than homeless.</p><p>They\u2019d been abandoned by Chandler Mackay long before the Department of Homeland Security had found the small house he\u2019d purchased for her mother when he\u2019d brought her from Guatemala. When they\u2019d been thrown from that home, her mother, Mercedes, had been horribly ill with a lung infection the doctors had been unable to treat.</p><p>It was only after Timothy Cranston had brought them to Somerset and introduced them to Dawg that their lives had changed. Dawg had ensured that her mother\u2019s medical care was paid for while Piper and her sisters had found security, and they had all found a family unlike any Piper could have imagined.</p><p>There was another side of that coin, though.</p><p>With the security, acceptance, and love the Mackays had given her and her family there was the heavy-handed overprotectiveness her brother and male cousins exhibited.</p><p>It was so heavy-handed that for the past year she and her sisters\u2014except the eldest, whom Piper actually blamed their present state on\u2014had no hope of actually living outside the stifling watchfulness they were suddenly surrounded with.</p><p>Slip out to a lake party and what happened? Before they could finish their first beer either Dawg, their cousins, or one of their cohorts\u2014Sheriff Mayes, Chief of Police Alex Jansen, or some other tough-assed Mackay male friend\u2014was there with an eagle eye.</p> <p>Forget even considering the unmentioned search she had begun for a lover. She was fated to remain a virgin for the rest of her days, evidently.</p><p>At twenty-four, Piper considered herself far too old to have not taken a lover. And as much as she would have loved\u2014loved\u2014to have taken Jedediah Booker to her bed, the last thing she needed was one of her brother\u2019s watchdogs keeping a leash on her.</p><p>Pulling into the inn\u2019s parking lot, Piper tried to push back the regret and the hunger she couldn\u2019t keep from building inside her body. The sensitive flesh between her thighs felt swollen, aching for a touch. Her clit actually throbbed, and she knew damned good and well that only a man was going to put out that particular fire.</p><p>God help her, she didn\u2019t want a man as restrictive and just as protective as her brother and cousins. She wanted a lover, a friend, and a partner. She didn\u2019t need a keeper.</p><p>It was Saturday night.</p><p>She had a week to make plans to slip from Somerset and make her way to New York. She was going to have to essentially escape. If that was possible. Because if Dawg had even a suspicion she was leaving town for any reason, then he would have one of his buddies and/or employees or agent-type acquaintances on her ass so fast it would leave road rash on her senses.</p><p>That, she didn\u2019t need.</p><p>She knew the world she wanted to move within, and she knew for damned sure that neither her brother and cousins nor their overprotective friends would move well within it.</p><p>So, how to escape a town where the Mackays had eyes and ears everywhere?</p><p>Everywhere.</p><p>No doubt it wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>It would require a small amount of lying through her teeth.</p><p>Piper smiled.</p><p>Hell, she could do it.</p><p>She was, after all, a Mackay.</p><p>TWO</p><p>\u201cYou are up to something.\u201d</p><p>Piper froze at the sound of Jed\u2019s voice as she answered the call on her cell phone.</p><p>Lowering the smart phone, she glared at the number.</p><p>Piedmont\u2019s Pizza.</p><p>\u201cSince when did you begin using the phones at pizza houses?\u201d Mockery filled her voice and she knew it.</p><p>A chuckle rasped across her senses. Even through the phone lines it had the power to weaken her knees.</p><p>\u201cFor some unknown reason my caller ID refuses to behave properly,\u201d he drawled. \u201cPerhaps they had the number before me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Okay. She\u2019d let him get away with it, but she was highly dubious of the explanation.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She tried for a vein of irritation in her voice, but she couldn\u2019t help the fact that she was pleased he\u2019d called.</p><p>And she shouldn\u2019t be. He was bad news and she knew it, especially where her determination to hold on to the secret of her upcoming trip was concerned.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted to tell him so badly\u2014him more than anyone else, she was beginning to think.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re up to, of course.\u201d His voice lowered, the question carrying an interesting sexual connotation.</p><p>Or did she just want to imagine there was something sexual there?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m up to?\u201d she countered, rather than denying the statement.</p><p>He was like her brother: He\u2019d never believe an instant denial. It was their mind-set or something. They knew the sound of a denial in truth and in deception. And Piper wasn\u2019t much of a liar.</p><p>She much preferred simple evasion.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I think you\u2019re up to?\u201d Amusement filled his voice.</p><p>The sound of it had a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what do you think I\u2019m up to?\u201d she repeated. \u201cSurely you have an opinion on what it could be.\u201d</p><p>He was fun to talk to; she\u2019d known that years ago, after he\u2019d first taken up residence at the inn.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, when it comes to a Mackay, it could be anything and everything,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about my sisters, not me,\u201d she surmised playfully, though her tone was completely serious. \u201cI\u2019m the quiet Mackay, remember?\u201d</p><p>She almost gave in to a light laugh at his disbelieving snort. \u201cQuiet one? Nah, you\u2019re just the sneaky one.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at him as she began folding her silk-and-lace panties and bras and placing them in the small suitcase.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in bed asleep?\u201d she asked as she noticed the time was well after midnight. \u201cI thought you worked on Mondays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInspections tomorrow,\u201d he told her. \u201cMy foreman and the job supervisor know what they\u2019re doing. I think I\u2019ll take the day off.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. Just what she needed: Jedediah suspicious and possibly keeping an eye on her.</p><p>\u201cThe job is near completion then?\u201d His company, along with several others, was building the new industrial office park and warehouses outside of town. Jed\u2019s family\u2019s company, Booker and Son\u2019s Construction, had won the bid to build several of the huge industrial buildings.</p><p>\u201cAbout halfway,\u201d he answered her. \u201cYou get to put up with me another couple of years whether you like it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Mom has adopted you,\u201d Piper reflected as she carefully folded one of the frilly skirts and its matching bag that she\u2019d made into the luggage next. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here since the inn opened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and she gave us a hell of a deal for the long term,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her to consider raising the rent,\u201d she threatened, holding back her own laughter as his chuckle echoed across the line.</p><p>\u201cI think she wants to adopt me and Elijah,\u201d Jed teased her. \u201cShe likes us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after Brogan took Eve out of the house,\u201d she informed him. \u201cShe\u2019s still not happy over that one.\u201d</p><p>Neither were Dawg and their cousins, Piper thought. As a matter of fact, \u201cirate\u201d was a mild description of how they felt about it.</p><p>Mercedes Mackay was taking it particularly hard, though. Letting her daughter go hadn\u2019t been easy for Mercedes, despite the fact that she dearly loved the man Eve was currently living with.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not related to the bastard,\u201d he said with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d she questioned him lightly. \u201cYou could have fooled me. You, Elijah, and Brogan play a good game, Jed, but I\u2019m starting to wonder if you\u2019re not brothers or something. The three of you are definitely cut from the same cloth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d Now, wasn\u2019t that tone just slightly arrogant?</p><p>\u201cDominant, domineering, stubborn, intractable, opinionated\u2014shall I go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered, though she caught the slight vein of amusement in his tone. \u201cI was just hoping for a little sex, Piper, not a complete assassination of my character here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone sex? Why, Jed, I\u2019m a good girl,\u201d she exclaimed as though scandalized. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d call me for such a thing.\u201d Her voice dropped. Piper let it become breathy as she allowed herself to remember his kiss, his touch. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business if I\u2019m lying here playing with just the most amazing little toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>His surprised little exclamation had satisfaction curling her lips.</p><p>\u201cShame on you, Jedediah Booker,\u201d she chastised him, barely holding back her laughter. \u201cMy momma would be heartbroken to know what a dirty dog you are. Just simply heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of toy?\u201d The growl in his voice had her stomach tightening. \u201cCome on, Piper; just tell me what it is. What are you doing with it?\u201d</p><p>The wicked, sensual, sexual pitch of his voice made her wish she were playing with a toy.</p><p>\u201cWhy, that\u2019s just none of your business, Mr. Booker,\u201d she informed him with all the sweet Southern-belle charm she could inject into her tone. \u201cI guess you\u2019ll just have to find some other way of satisfying your curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pick the lock on your door,\u201d he told her then. \u201cI\u2019ll steal the damned thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s you I\u2019m thinking of when I use it?\u201d</p><p>She disconnected the call.</p><p>Tightening her thighs as her clit pulsed in time with the throb of need in her vagina, Piper covered her face and fought back the highly unwise action of answering the phone again as it buzzed repeatedly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was dangerous.</p><p>Jed was far too dangerous.</p><p>She might be as bold and just as damned adventurous as any Mackay, but Piper liked to think that unlike her older sister, she also had enough common sense to keep from jumping into the fire.</p> <p>Nope, the frying pan suited her just fine.</p><p>Pulling in a deep breath, she finished packing the suitcase and garment bag she\u2019d chosen to take to New York with her.</p><p>She would catch the train in Louisville, and once she got to New York City she\u2019d rent a car.</p><p>She didn\u2019t much care for driving in Manhattan, but sometimes a girl just had to do what a girl had to do. If she dared to rent a car in Somerset or in Louisville, then the chances were far too great that Dawg would find out. He had too many friends in far too many places. And she knew firsthand that he was on a first-name basis with every reputable car-rental agency in a five-county radius.</p><p>That meant just getting to New York City without her brother or her family learning she\u2019d left would be chancy enough.</p> <p>Luckily, there was one friend she could depend on.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell her mother, her sisters, Tim, her brother or cousins, or her nearby friends or neighbors\u2014she sighed at the thought of it\u2014but she\u2019d managed to make a few friends among the tourists who traveled through Somerset each summer and stopped at the small boutique her designs sold in. Once they sold, it wasn\u2019t unusual for the buyers to contact her, interested in other unique wardrobe items. From those buyers, she had made several friends.</p><p>Those tourists didn\u2019t live in Kentucky, and they had no idea how powerful her brother thought he was. A quick call to one of them, Amy Seavers, had resulted in a fake ID and a train ticket, as well as a ride to the train station.</p><p>She was all set and ready to go. All she had to do was slip out with her bags and be waiting at the designated location when Amy\u2019s sister, Gypsy, arrived.</p><p>Blowing out a hard breath, Piper glanced at the patio doors, her heart beating hard and fast with the thought that Jed didn\u2019t make idle threats. There was no doubt in her mind that he knew exactly how to pick the locks on her doors. There was no doubt he would pick them if he were in the right mood.</p><p>She rather doubted he\u2019d learned that trick in the construction business. Just as she doubted her sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Brogan Campbell, was slipping into the upper story of the inn in the middle of the night because he missed anyone there.</p> <p>Hell, no. Those nights Piper had watched the shadowed figure easily pull himself to the second-floor balcony and slip through the glass doors that led to Tim\u2019s office, she\u2019d known exactly why he was there.</p><p>Timothy liked to tell anyone and everyone who dared to ask that he was retired. Learn the definition of the word, he\u2019d growled at the lawyer who\u2019d shown up several weeks before in regard to the deaths of several suspected homeland terrorists the summer before.</p><p>Piper had heard the words \u201cEve\u201d . . . \u201ckidnapping\u201d . . . \u201cboat,\u201d and \u201cCampbell\u201d just before he dared to say, \u201cSpecial Agent Cranston.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a smile at the thought of how quickly Tim had cut him down and informed him in no uncertain terms that retirement was a glorious thing.</p><p>Retirement, her ass. Timothy, or Tim as she and her sisters often called him, was about as retired as Dawg and her cousins were. Just retired enough to be able to claim they weren\u2019t involved in anything, but involved enough to ensure they all knew exactly what was going on in their little corner of the world.</p><p>Closing the cases quickly, Piper moved to the closet and stored them out of sight, just in case Jed decided to make a midnight visit.</p><p>If he saw her bags and realized they were packed, he would immediately demand to know where she was going. Once he knew . . . hell, she may as well take out an ad.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a doubt in her mind that Jed would tell Dawg just as fast as he could make the call. Then Dawg and her cousins would arrive and insist on accompanying her.</p> <p>If she allowed it to happen.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell she would allow it, she thought wearily. The very thought of it was enough to send a shudder racing through her body.</p><p>She closed the door and moved toward the bed, then came to a hard stop.</p><p>Swinging around, Piper moved to the door that led to the sitting room of the suite and swung it open as her heart began pounding with enough force that she swore she could feel it in her throat.</p><p>And there he stood.</p><p>She crossed her arms beneath her breasts and leaned against the doorframe that connected the sitting room with the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d It was all she could do to fight back her amusement as well as the surge of sexual intensity sweeping through her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt.</p><p>The broad, muscled expanse of his chest was bare. A light covering of dark blond curls feathered over the dark flesh and arrowed into the snug band of his jeans. And he was aroused.</p><p>Standing in the middle of her sitting room, bare chested and barefoot, he stared back at her with pure sensual intent burning in his dark, navy blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dressed,\u201d he accused her, his voice rough as he paced closer to her. \u201cI thought you were naked and playing with toys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d Piper could feel herself trembling from the force of the need racing through her. \u201cThat\u2019s just an excuse, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just an excuse,\u201d he agreed as he stopped before her. \u201cAn excuse for this.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected it to happen so fast\u2014that his lips would be on hers, his fingers curving around the back of her neck, holding her in place as his lips took possession of hers.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected she would weaken so fast. That her nails would dig instantly into his shoulders, that she would lean into him, against him, so eager for him that her body was quivering in excitement.</p><p>What the hell was this? What was he doing to her?</p><p>Then thought became impossible. Any possible chance of a denial evaporated as pleasure began to build with a fiery force.</p><p>Oh, hell, yes.</p><p>Desperate to get closer to him, she wrapped her arms around his neck as he lifted her against him, holding her close in his arms as he lifted her from her feet.</p><p>She was weightless.</p><p>Gravity couldn\u2019t touch her, and neither could the reality of common sense.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Oh, hell, no!\u201d</p><p>Piper found herself suddenly spun around, released, and pushed protectively behind Jed in a move so powerful she knew she\u2019d never figure out how he managed it. But one minute she was in his arms kissing him for everything she was worth, and the next second she was pushing past him to confront her big brother.</p><p>The big lug.</p><p>He was staring at them as though he had never witnessed such a thing.</p><p>\u201cForget what a couple kissing looks like?\u201d she snapped as he suddenly lost that surprised look and turned a glare on Jed instead.</p><p>Moving to Jed\u2019s side rather than behind him, Piper crossed her arms over her breasts and stared back at Dawg furiously. \u201cWhen are you going to learn to knock at the doors to our suites rather than barging in, Dawg Mackay?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI could have been naked or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the living area?\u201d he demanded, outraged. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never knocked, dammit. You have a bedroom for this crap anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my suite,\u201d she informed him. \u201cI could be naked in either room if I want to be. And why should I have to do everything private in my bedroom? I had the door locked. I did not tell you to unlock it. Try knocking.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t even look at her. He was too busy glowering at Jed.</p><p>Neither man blinked.</p><p>\u201cI was going to say good night,\u201d he snarled, finally sparing a short glance her way before turning back to Jed with a killing look.</p><p>\u201cGood night, then.\u201d She waited for him to leave.</p><p>Jed was glaring at Dawg just as fiercely as Dawg was glaring at Jed, and she was getting tired of it.</p><p>Dawg\u2019s disapproval was clear.</p><p>Piper sighed in irritation.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you get the hell out of my room,\u201d she suddenly ordered, anger beginning to flare inside her. \u201cGet out. Go away. Leave me the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>She had a ride to catch, and she had no intention of missing it. Especially not so she could babysit two grown men who were suddenly acting like two dogs over a bone.</p><p>Jed turned his glare on her. \u201cWe weren\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you weren\u2019t,\u201d Dawg answered for her.</p><p>Propping her hands on her hips, she turned a fierce stare on both of them.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my room,\u201d she snapped again. \u201cIf I have to ask one more time I\u2019m calling Mom and Tim and you can deal with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little bastard Timothy doesn\u2019t scare me in the least,\u201d Dawg informed her, his celadon gaze sparking with anger.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mom does scare you,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd trust me, if she knew what was going on right now she\u2019d have both your heads.\u201d</p><p>They both grimaced and began retreating.</p><p>Jed moved for the connecting door as Dawg backed to the door that led to the hall. As each door closed Piper moved to it quickly and locked it securely.</p><p>Good God, how the hell was she supposed to slip out of the house and out of the state with this mess going on?</p><p>One thing was for damned sure: if she\u2019d had second thoughts about how her brother or even Jed would act if one of them were to go with her, then she had her answer now.</p><p>They\u2019d act just as they were: like two Neanderthals with nothing better to do than beat their chests and roar out their aggressions.</p><p>Not what she needed this week.</p><p>Oh, God, she didn\u2019t need it this week.</p><p>The week she was going to find the dreams she\u2019d worked for all her life.</p><p>She was slipping out, making her way across the darkness of the porch, two traveling bags in hand.</p><p>Jedediah lowered his head for a second before lifting his gaze and forcing himself to watch her make her way from the inn. Curling his fingers into fists, he held back the urge to follow her. To stop her.</p><p>If he stopped her, he\u2019d be no better than her brother or her cousins. They were doing all the wrong things for all the right reasons, but that didn\u2019t make it bearable for the impulsive, bright, beautiful little star they were smothering.</p><p>Crossing his arms over his chest, he leaned against the heavily leafed tree he hid beneath and just watched her. There was no need to follow her. She wasn\u2019t headed to a party, a friend\u2019s house for a night out, or even one of the local bars.</p><p>He\u2019d known that when he\u2019d talked to her on the phone as he\u2019d watched her through the closed-circuit wireless camera that had been installed in the bedroom when her sister occupied it. It hadn\u2019t been removed when Eve had moved out.</p><p>As he had watched her pack he had known she was heading out of town.</p><p>With a friend? Most likely a lover, he thought wearily, wondering at the sense of possessiveness tightening his gut.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d waited too long to secure her to him, left it too late. He\u2019d sensed that as he watched her packing earlier.</p><p>He was always careful when checking on her. He never interfered, never looked in on her when there was a chance of embarrassing her if she found out he was watching.</p><p>Sometimes, he just wanted to see her. See her relaxed, sleeping, or amused. Sometimes, he just wanted to make certain she was safe, nothing more. He\u2019d seen her packing, though, and he\u2019d been unable to resist calling her, hoping she\u2019d confide in him. Hoping that talking to him, remembering the pleasure they\u2019d shared, would change her mind if she was heading out to stay with a lover.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She disappeared around the side of the house.</p><p>Lowering his head, he stayed in place. He didn\u2019t dare move, even under the pretense of returning to his own room. Because he knew he wouldn\u2019t make it there.</p><p>Hell, no, he\u2019d end up following her, and he\u2019d make her hate him when he couldn\u2019t help himself and persuaded her to stay. Persuaded her in a way that would ensure her pleasure\u2014and her hatred. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck, it was hard letting her go.</p><p>Rubbing at the ache in his chest, frowning at the tightness there, he wondered at the feeling he\u2019d identified years before as a premonition, a warning of danger.</p><p>Who or what could be in danger?</p> <p>Maybe it was better that Piper was leaving for a few days after all. Her sister had nearly died the year before because she was too close to his partner, Brogan Campbell.</p><p>God help anyone who dared to threaten Piper Mackay. He would kill. Perhaps not for the first time, though it would definitely be the first time he\u2019d killed over a woman.</p><p>She was worth killing for.</p><p>She was worth dying for.</p><p>The brilliance that was Piper Mackay couldn\u2019t be contained.

To take the freedom she fought so valiantly for.</p> <p>He refused to become one of them.</p><p>Jed forced himself to move, to walk slowly and easily across the stretch of lawn that led to the inn and the suite he had taken next to Piper\u2019s.</p><p>She was gone and he had no choice but to let her go.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he liked it.</p><p>It sure as hell didn\u2019t mean it was easy.</p><p>THREE</p> <p>Amy\u2019s sister, Gypsy Seavers, was waiting exactly where Piper had directed her to the day before.</p><p>The small clearing just past the inn was far enough away that if the other woman had turned her lights off before pulling in, then there was no way in hell Tim could possibly see them. Yet it was close enough for her to jog to, even carrying the two bags she had brought with her.</p><p>\u201cTrunk\u2019s open.\u201d Gypsy\u2019s voice came from the other side of the vehicle as Piper moved for the car.</p><p>By the time she reached the trunk, Amy\u2019s sister was standing next to it, lifting it for her as Piper threw her bags in. She took a good look at Gypsy\u2019s face in the trunk\u2019s light. Just to be certain she was who she was supposed to be, Piper told herself, realizing some of Dawg\u2019s lectures on safety might have actually stuck in her mind.</p><p>The second Piper moved back from the trunk, Gypsy had it closed and was moving around her to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cReady to roll?\u201d the other woman asked, glancing back as Piper watched her.</p><p>\u201cReady to roll.\u201d A quick nod and Piper was opening the passenger door and sliding inside quickly before pulling it closed.</p><p>Gypsy\u2019s door didn\u2019t so much as squeak as she closed it and restarted the vehicle.</p> <p>She resembled Amy, Piper decided as the car pulled back out onto the main road and headed toward town.</p><p>The same amber or caramel hair, streaked with much lighter strands by the sun. She was slender, compact, and the jeans and racer-back T-shirt she wore showing off her lightly tanned, well-toned upper body made her appear smaller and more fragile than her diminutive five-foot-four frame already did.</p><p>\u201cAmy and I were betting you wouldn\u2019t make it out after she told me who your brother and cousins were.\u201d Gypsy flashed her a quick, rueful grin. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have followed through after I learned Natches Mackay was your cousin if I hadn\u2019t already promised.\u201d</p><p>Piper stiffened, turning to stare back at Gypsy warily. Great, she knew Natches. Piper wasn\u2019t even going to bother asking how yet. Only one question was uppermost in her mind. \u201cDid you contact him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatches?\u201d Flicking her a questioning look, Gypsy efficiently navigated the curvy mountain road that led to the interstate.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Piper could feel that sense of freedom slowly disintegrating.</p><p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d Gypsy grimaced. \u201cPicking you up might piss him off at me, but calling him and letting him know would only add a shadow of distrust to my name if he ever actually meets me.\u201d</p><p>Neither the resignation in Gypsy\u2019s voice, nor her explanation, made sense.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Piper shook her head. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be the other way? He wouldn\u2019t trust you if he learned you had helped me? Wouldn\u2019t he trust you more if you contacted him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d The other woman rejected the suggestion, her expression still a bit stiff, with an air of secretiveness. \u201cI promised I\u2019d help you before I knew who your cousin was. You don\u2019t appear to be in any trouble, and my own sources verified how protective your brother and cousins are. If I called him without cause, no matter how much he would love to know where you are and who you\u2019re with, then he\u2019d count that as a betrayal of confidence. I\u2019d be deemed untrustworthy, unless you were in trouble.\u201d She threw Piper a quick, amused look. \u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble,\u201d Piper promised her, breathing out a sigh of relief. \u201cI just don\u2019t need company, you know?\u201d</p><p>She hoped Gypsy understood. Just as she hoped the other woman didn\u2019t call Natches later.</p><p>\u201cSometimes a girl just has to do what a girl has to do. And sometimes she just has to do it alone,\u201d Gypsy agreed as the lights from the dash emphasized the unsmiling expression she wore.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Piper stated. \u201cThe New York fashion scene isn\u2019t a place where any of them would get along well. It would be like placing a herd of bulls in a roomful of china. Forget the china shop. They would raze the shop and head for the warehouse.\u201d</p><p>Gypsy gave a small, surprised laugh at the description before her amusement was quickly pulled back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that about Natche.\u201d She gave a light laugh. \u201cHe was a legend in Afghanistan while he was there. One of the best damned snipers the Marines had, and better at covert intelligence than he had any right to be.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that sounded like Natches.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him?\u201d Piper asked. \u201cAre you with Homeland Security, too?\u201d That would be just her luck.</p><p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d Gypsy\u2019s lips tilted into a crooked smile. \u201cI was with the Marines myself. Many of Natches\u2019s missions in Afghanistan and Iran are used as training points now.\u201d</p><p>Piper had heard Tim mention that several times, while Natches seemed rather proud of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when they find out you\u2019re gone, then?\u201d Gypsy asked as Piper stared into the darkness and wondered what the trip would have been like with Jed.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, they won\u2019t find out,\u201d she stated irritably. \u201cBecause, trust me, New York City would never be the same if those three showed up there.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered to even imagine the chaos the Mackay cousins could still manage to create.</p><p>\u201cBest-laid plans and all that,\u201d Gypsy pointed out. \u201cSurely you have a plan, just in case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a Mackay; what do you think?\u201d She grinned back at her friend\u2019s sister.</p><p>\u201cI think you have one,\u201d Gypsy reflected. \u201cBut I think you\u2019re not so sure of it, and I think you\u2019re really afraid it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think that?\u201d Unfortunately, she was right.</p><p>\u201cSix years in the military. The last two in the investigative side of the military police. I can hear it in your voice, and I can see it in your face. You\u2019re a piss-poor liar, aren\u2019t you, Piper Mackay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s far too close to the truth,\u201d Piper agreed.</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise her to learn Gypsy Seavers was some sort of investigator. She had that air of secretiveness and quiet watchfulness. \u201cI left Mom a note. She\u2019ll find it in the morning, and I begged her not to say anything. And for the first time in my life I lied to my mother. I told her I needed to get away from the male portion of the family and I was staying with friends.\u201d She grimaced at the lie. \u201cWhat she\u2019ll actually end up doing is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how long do you think it will take for your brother and cousins to find you?\u201d Rueful amusement reflected in Gypsy\u2019s voice.</p><p>They would find her far too soon if she didn\u2019t get very lucky.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it takes a while,\u201d Piper suggested, terribly afraid that if she wasn\u2019t very, very lucky, then her brother and cousins would find her far too quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, she\u2019s not here?\u201d Dawg rubbed his hand along the back of his neck in irritation as he faced Mercedes the next morning, barely holding back a glare. He needed to talk to Piper about what had happened the night before. Catching her with Jed Booker had reminded him all over again of what had happened with Eve the summer before. He didn\u2019t want another sister in danger because of her association with one of Timothy\u2019s agents. He also didn\u2019t want her endangered because she was trying to hide it from him. And he definitely didn\u2019t want to piss Mercedes off as he tried to find out where the hell she had gone.</p><p>Timothy, the quarrelsome little bastard, got all kinds of out of sorts if he managed to upset Mercedes over her \u201cbabies.\u201d But he\u2019d be damned if those sisters of his weren\u2019t going to drive him to drink.</p><p>Their antics were making him seriously consider a nunnery for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cDawg, give her a break,\u201d Mercedes ordered, though her voice was calm as she moved around the kitchen and cleaned up from that morning\u2019s breakfast preparations. \u201cYou\u2019ve hounded her, Lyrica, and Zoey for almost a year now. Everywhere they go, everything they do, and everyone they talk to is reported back to you so you can fuss at them over their friends, potential dates, and acquaintances. I warned you last year they were going to get sick of it. Piper just got fed up with it first.\u201d</p><p>Her arms crossed over her breasts as she stared up at him, her expression tight with defensiveness as her determination to stand in his way became more than apparent.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know why I\u2019ve done it,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cHell, I remember a time when you were all for it.\u201d</p><p>Now that those stubborn, independent young women were crying on \u201cmommy\u2019s\u201d shoulder, she was backtracking from the protective atmosphere just as quickly as she had agreed to it.</p><p>\u201cA year ago.\u201d One hand propped on her rounded hip as she faced him with fiery dark eyes. \u201cWhen there was a chance she was actually in danger. Even you admit there\u2019s nothing going on now, no one is watching you or the girls, nor is there any apparent backlash from what happened last summer. I believe, Dawg, you can\u2019t let yourself accustom to life without that danger. It\u2019s not fair to make the girls live such a life as well.\u201d</p><p>He was not going to allow her to draw him into this argument, not after having this exact confrontation with Christa after returning home the night before, furious at finding Jed in Piper\u2019s room, and Piper in Jed\u2019s arms. His own wife had been quick to rip a strip of his hide, first for not knocking, and second for daring to butt his nose into his sisters\u2019 sex lives again.</p><p>He did not want to know his sisters had sex.</p><p>He especially didn\u2019t want to know who they were having sex with.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s she at, Mercedes?\u201d He wasn\u2019t going to give her the satisfaction of this argument. They\u2019d already been down that road far too many times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you.\u201d Pure stubbornness pulled at her expression.</p><p>As much as those girls looked like they could belong to him or his cousins, Rowdy and Natches, he had to admit there were times, like this, when he realized they looked just like their mother.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have Alex put out an APB on her,\u201d he warned, trepidation beginning to tighten the back of his neck.</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t expected levelheaded Piper to be the one to test her safety first.</p><p>\u201cNo. You will not. Attempt it. Dare to take this from her, Dawg Mackay, and I promise you neither I, my daughters, nor Timothy will ever allow you to forget it.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her, rubbed at the back of his neck, and grimaced in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel good about this,\u201d he muttered as he turned back to her. \u201cMercedes, I don\u2019t feel good about this at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The anger beginning to brighten her brown eyes dimmed, but he could see the concern in them as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it myself,\u201d she admitted quietly. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me where she was going, Dawg; I found out by accident. All she told me was that she had to get away. She slipped out in the dead of night because she trusted none of us to allow her the freedom she hungers for. Let her have her freedom, before we smother her to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA freedom that has the potential to get her killed?\u201d he asked her wearily. \u201cI understand the need, Mercedes, more than you know. But you know what nearly happened to Eve last summer. If someone targets one of the other girls in retaliation, and there\u2019s no one there to protect them, what do we do then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe pray that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she whispered as the concern in her gaze threatened to turn to pure fear. \u201cBut you also have to understand, Dawg: Piper\u2019s not a liar; nor is she one to make decisions such as this rashly. She was driven to it.\u201d</p><p>He had driven her to it. He could hear the accusation in her tone.</p><p>Christa had warned him more than once that the girls were going to rebel against his protection and begin making decisions that would only endanger them. He hadn\u2019t believed they would do so without first confronting him.</p><p>His sisters were fighters; they weren\u2019t cowards.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be certain she\u2019s safe?\u201d he finally asked her worriedly.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Dawg.\u201d Her smile was gentle, compassionate. \u201cAll I can do is pray that if she\u2019s in trouble she\u2019ll call me. That and trust in the man Timothy has watching her.\u201d She winked at him. \u201cWatching her, Dawg. Allowing her to do what she has to do, what she wants to do, while an impartial third person stands ready to protect her rather than standing between her and what she needs. That\u2019s the difference.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, worry tearing at him as he stared down at her, wishing, just as he had over the past six years, that he\u2019d been able to protect Mercedes and the sisters he\u2019d grown to love so much from his father\u2019s cruelties before he had died.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t known about them. No one had known about them but Chandler Mackay, and Chandler had done nothing to ensure their protection should anything happen to him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll still get hurt.\u201d That was part of what he couldn\u2019t bear. \u201cIf not physically, then otherwise. They\u2019re too trusting, Mercedes, and too innocent. If we don\u2019t watch out for them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they might get their feelings hurt or their hearts broken?\u201d she suggested as she turned and began cleaning the stove. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep them from getting hurt, Dawg. It\u2019s life. You know that as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>No, he damned well didn\u2019t know that.</p> <p>They were innocent, gentle, and deserved far more than he knew they had waiting for them if no one was close enough to protect them.</p><p>\u201cYou do know it, Dawg,\u201d she stated as she turned back to him, watching him as though she could read the silent denial raging through him. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it. You don\u2019t want to admit it, but you know it.\u201d</p><p>He refused to accept it.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let them get hurt, Mercedes. I promised you that when you brought them home to me. I told you I\u2019d look out for them.\u201d</p><p>He had promised them he would look out for them, and he was breaking that promise.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do, Dawg.\u201d The compassion in her expression tightened his chest as he suddenly wished he had brought Christa with him for this confrontation. Maybe she could have talked some sense into Mercedes. On the other hand, she would have probably agreed with her.</p><p>\u201cDawg, give her this time, she needs it,\u201d Mercedes said softly. \u201cMore than you know, she needs it.\u201d</p><p>She needed it.</p> <p>But what happened if it was the chance an enemy needed to strike out at her?</p><p>What was he supposed to do then?</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Piper loved New York City.</p><p>The pace, the energy, the sense of excitement that seemed to permeate every corner of the city sank into her senses. Her heart beat faster. Blood rushed quick and furious through her veins, and the ordered chaos, the shopping throngs and ever-present sea of faces channeled a chaotic pace inside her own body and filled her with elation.</p><p>The first time Dawg and his wife, Christa, had brought her to the city had been to introduce her to the many and varied bolts of fabrics and exquisite costume jewelry and fake gems available in the small, out of the way shops and fabric stores there. Rhinestones, glittering crystals, clear sapphire \u2013 and emerald-colored stones\u2014the choices seemed almost unlimited.</p><p>Now, five years later, she still found the little shops and stores impossible to leave once she began searching for the items she needed for each design\u2014those already sketched and those that built in her imagination as she found hidden bolts of unique or discontinued fabrics, bows, ribbons, and glittering stones.</p><p>It was the first place she\u2019d headed the minute she had rented her car that morning after arriving at the hotel.</p><p>The black four-door sedan was actually much smaller than she preferred for a four-door, but the latest trend in economy and fuel efficiency had also inspired a new generation of car designs that she simply wasn\u2019t as fond of.</p><p>Driving in New York City wasn\u2019t always safe, but it was rarely dull. Piper found her senses tuning in to the traffic, the bystanders, the lights and sounds of the streets as she drove outside the city toward the mountains that Eldon Vessante\u2019s assistant had directed her to. The interview would take place at Vessante\u2019s estate, rather than the hotel, and though she hadn\u2019t anticipated the drive, she found it relaxed her, at least. Her nerves were less than settled at the thought of the upcoming meeting.</p><p>As she drove out of the city and entered the less congested interstate, she could feel her excitement building.</p><p>The change in time and location of the meeting was unexpected, especially considering the fact that his assistant had seemed less pleasant than she had when Piper had spoken to her the first time.</p><p>Following the onboard navigation, she found herself turning from the highway and moving onto a two-lane road that climbed slowly into the surrounding mountains. Another turn and she passed the sign for Vessante Way, the designer\u2019s estate the assistant, S. Chaniss, had told her they were meeting at.</p><p>Piper was feeling more confused than excited as she pulled into the curving driveway in front of the three-story estate and gazed up at the stone steps leading to the massive double front doors.</p><p>There were no attendants present. No one was rushing to park her car, and only a small, bright red little sports car ahead of her was present.</p><p>Stepping from the rental car, she pulled free the wide portfolio she\u2019d brought with her and gazed around the heavily forested area for long seconds before moving slowly to the steps.</p><p>As she reached the top, the doors swung slowly inward to reveal a towering butler.</p><p>Standing at six and a half feet at the very least, his brown gaze icy, his expression implacable, he gave every indication of being ex-military, and as hard as granite.</p><p>\u201cMs. Mackay.\u201d He nodded down at her with a slight inclination of his head. \u201cMr. Vessante is awaiting you in the drawing room.\u201d</p><p>The drawing room? Those actually still existed?</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d It may have been worded as a request, but the tone was a straight-up order.</p><p>Her brother and cousins had ensured that she recognized the difference.</p><p>Before he turned away, his gaze raked over her with a glint of sudden curiosity, or familiarity. She\u2019d met a lot of men over the years whom her male kin knew, and she was certain she had never met this man, yet that look gave her the uneasy feeling that he knew her.</p><p>Turning, he indicated she should follow him.</p><p>Dressed in black, perfectly creased slacks and a pristine white shirt that didn\u2019t have a single wrinkle, he led her through the wide, steel-colored marble foyer that seemed to extend a mile or more. Reaching the end of the room-size entryway, he turned sharply to the right and a set of doors at the end of the short hall.</p><p>A sharp rap of his knuckles was answered in seconds. The butler gripped the doorknobs, pushed the doors open, then stood back for her to enter.</p><p>The heavy Gothic design of the room was a shock. Piper stepped from the more contemporary foyer and tried to control her amazement as she stared around the room. Dark, heavy woods, leather furniture with carved clawed feet, and thick, dark draperies over the windows that blocked the early summer sunlight and sent a rush of trepidation rushing through her.</p><p>She jumped, startled at the heavy snap of the doors closing behind her before swinging forward again. From the corner of the room, a light chuckle drew her startled gaze and she watched as Vessante rose and moved slowly into the center of the room. He approached her slowly, his head tilted to the side, icy blue eyes regarding her mockingly.</p><p>\u201cYou seem nervous.\u201d His tone was less than sincere as he attempted to put on a friendly expression.</p><p>What was going on here?</p><p>\u201cWhere are the other designers?\u201d Piper blurted, then winced. Not exactly the most graceful greeting, but this private meeting wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d been expecting at all. She had to force herself to stay in place as he moved within inches of her, his gaze dropping to her breasts as his right hand reached out.</p><p>Piper accepted the handshake, the sensation of his damp palms giving her a slightly queasy feeling.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right here. As a matter of fact, something felt very wrong.</p><p>\u201cThe others couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d Pitched low, his tone still grated against her senses.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much taller than she was. At five-seven, Eldon Vessante was so skinny he was bony. There was an effeminate air about him that the overly long white-blond hair did nothing to dispel.</p><p>His face had a skeletal appearance, with high, sharp cheekbones and a long blade of a nose. The photographs she had seen of him had definitely given him more of a substantial air.</p><p>God, he reminded her of a rat.</p><p>Where had his reputation as a playboy come from?</p><p>\u201cI see you brought your portfolio.\u201d He glanced to the large, square design folder she carried.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Gripping the folder with both hands now, she wondered at the sick feeling of panic growing inside her. \u201cI assumed your assistant and the other designers with your company would be here.\u201d</p><p>She wished they were.</p><p>She hated the feeling of being trapped, alone with him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need them, my dear,\u201d he drawled, the slight, feminine pout of his lips more apparent as he smiled slightly.</p><p>He might not need them, but she did.</p><p>\u201cCome, shall we sit and discuss our new venture?\u201d With a wave of his hand he indicated the sitting area on the other side of the room. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really considering another designer this year.\u201d He turned as though her acquiescence were a foregone conclusion. \u201cOne must be certain to choose carefully. To ensure the market doesn\u2019t become overly glutted, you understand.\u201d</p><p>Piper followed, but she did so warily, listening to the precise, self-important tone of his voice rather than the words themselves.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not contributing to the conversation, my dear. That\u2019s quite rude of you.\u201d</p><p>Eldon paused in the middle of the sitting area, one hip jutting forward as he lifted his left hand, palm upward, as though giving her the floor.</p><p>\u201cI was listening,\u201d she excused her nonparticipation, still watching him carefully as she moved into the sitting area.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, please.\u201d He gestured to the sofa with an outstretched hand. Piper perched on the edge nervously as he remained standing.</p><p>\u201cWould you like coffee? Or perhaps tea?\u201d he asked, still standing with one hip jutting slightly forward, the position, as well as her own, ensuring her a perfect view of his thighs, should she want to look.</p><p>She didn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Clearing her throat and glancing around the room she wished she could push back the panic attack still threatening to shorten her breathing.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had one for years, not since arriving in Kentucky, actually. Now her insides were shuddering, her throat tightening, the unreasoned fear rising inside her like a fast-moving sickness.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d The hand he had been extending went to his hip in a classically feminine gesture of irritation that did little to ease her apprehension.</p><p>Blinking back at him, she fought to come up with an answer other than the fact that the thought of anything in her stomach made her want to throw up as the panic built inside her.</p> <p>\u201cTea,\u201d Eldon stated, finally shifting his stance and brushing the thin strands of white-blond hair back from his rodentlike face. \u201cYou look like the tea sort.\u201d Shifting his attention from her to the door, he yelled, \u201cBroecun!\u201d</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>His expression as impassive as moments before, the bodyguard, butler, whatever the hell he was, stepped just inside the room.</p><p>\u201cMr. Vessante?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave Leda bring in a pot of tea, please.\u201d</p> <p>Cold, cold brown eyes flickered over her for the briefest moment before he backed out of the doorway, closing the doors behind him.</p><p>Piper tightened her grip on her portfolio.</p><p>Eldon moved closer, taking a seat on the sofa with her. It placed him far too close to her.</p><p>\u201cShall we talk terms then?\u201d he asked, the ice blue of his gaze suddenly hardening.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>She\u2019d just as soon get this done and have it over with. Lifting the portfolio closer, she was suddenly stopped by the touch of Eldon\u2019s hand on her wrist.</p> <p>Her stomach tightened as dread began to wash over her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to see the designs. They\u2019ll be accepted if you play the game properly.\u201d</p><p>Ahh.</p><p>Her stomach pitched alarmingly.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>His smile was oily and far too sinister.</p><p>\u201cI think you heard me perfectly, actually,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWe\u2019ll enjoy a nice cup of tea; then we\u2019ll retire to my suite. Be a nice little fuck until I grow tired of you and we\u2019ll see about that show you want so badly.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening.</p> <p>This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Had she really said that aloud?</p><p>Eldon sat back slowly, his expression tightening further, but thankfully his hand lifted from her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to piss me off, Ms. Mackay,\u201d he warned her, his tone low, echoing with anger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d She really didn\u2019t, but the churning in her stomach assured her she was going to end up doing just that.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that runway show, darling?\u201d He stared back at her with such a chilling lack of emotion that a shudder raced down her spine.</p><p>Did she want that runway show?</p><p>She was shaking her head before she realized it and rising slowly to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou are insane,\u201d she decided, much calmer than she should have been while facing a madman. \u201cBusiness isn\u2019t done like that anymore.\u201d</p><p>A mocking laugh parted his lips as he rose slowly to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool, Piper,\u201d he warned her, his hip jutting once again, as if he hoped she\u2019d glance at his sock-stuffed crotch.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to high school; she knew what it looked like.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m going to be a fool.\u201d Clutching the portfolio tighter in her hands, she backed away from him.</p><p>She\u2019d not just gone to high school; she\u2019d been raised in East Texas, and she damned well knew better than to turn her back on a rattler.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was advancing on her.</p><p>\u201cThe opportunity of a lifetime?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cYou\u2019re letting it ride right on by you.\u201d He gave a little waving motion with his hand. \u201cAre you sure you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>Was she sure?</p><p>Gripping the doorknob, she turned it and pulled the door open quickly.</p><p>\u201cAm I sure I want to tell you to shove your offer up that sock-stuffed ass of yours?\u201d she asked archly as she escaped into the foyer.</p><p>He paused, but only for a second.</p><p>Piper saw the blow coming and only barely managed to evade it as his fist came flying out.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cBitch? Because I know the difference between a sock and a dick?\u201d She sneered back at him, quickening her pace as she walked backward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never get out of that backwoods town where you\u2019re hawking that shit you sew together,\u201d he snarled, his face flushing a brilliant red as his eyes bulged to the point that they threatened to pop out of their sockets.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never be anything but a fake dick,\u201d she threw back at him as Broecun entered the foyer from another room, leaned against the doorframe, and folded his arms over his chest lazily as he watched.</p><p>Asshole\u2014he could have at least appeared surprised rather than plain amused.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>She watched Eldon\u2019s muscles bunch, knew he was going to move, and she knew she would never be able to evade the punch.</p><p>Jed was going to be pissed.</p><p>Dawg would go ballistic.</p><p>They would both travel to New York and start taking off heads if she came home with just the faintest bruise that came from a male hand.</p><p>She tried to evade it.</p><p>She jumped, tried to run, but she was too damned scared to take her eyes off him.</p><p>Just before his fist launched, it stopped.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know who was more surprised, her or Eldon, when he found his fist suddenly captured in the hard, huge hand of Broecun.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, girl.\u201d Hard, emotionless, the order was voiced without heat or any sense of warning.</p><p>Still, Piper turned and ran for the front door.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe this. She couldn\u2019t believe the chance she had dreamed of had come to this.</p><p>To lose it all because of some asshole with a sock for a dick.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Pulling into the back lot of the rental car agency, Piper was still fuming hours later.</p><p>It was too late to be in an area that appeared deserted in New York City, and far too late to do anything but turn the car back in.</p><p>At least the cab she\u2019d called was waiting for her.</p><p>She\u2019d stopped to let the driver know she just had to park the car; then she\u2019d be ready to leave.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t anticipated was that when she\u2019d thrown her portfolio and her purse to the back of the car earlier, she\u2019d also managed to knock the bag containing her morning purchases over on the back floorboard.</p><p>Rhinestones and colored crystals were scattered along the carpet, twinkling merrily beneath the interior lights as she scooped them up and threw them back into her bag without bothering to return them to the small plastic bags they\u2019d been in when she\u2019d bought them.</p><p>That took far too long, as far as she was concerned. The damned cab was charging by the frickin\u2019 half minute, if she remembered her last trip to New York correctly.</p><p>She had only so much cash on her, and her own credit card was barely going to cover her hotel room. The trip was supposed to be all expenses paid, but Piper knew the type of man Eldon Vessante was now. No doubt he had already called the hotel and informed them that he wasn\u2019t paying for anything. That meant she\u2019d better have her own card ready and waiting when she walked through the front doors.</p><p>Tossing the last of the colored crystals and stones into her bag, Piper stepped back, slammed the door, then hurriedly locked the car before rushing back to the front of the rental agency.</p><p>Depositing the keys in the night box, she all but ran to the taxi and gave the driver the address to the hotel.</p><p>Just as the vehicle pulled out, the first raindrops began pelting the yellow-and-black vehicle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s finally raining,\u201d the driver commented as he turned at the corner and headed for the hotel. \u201cYou in town for long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She stared straight ahead, fuming.</p><p>\u201cBusiness or just a visit?\u201d he asked then, obviously in the mood to chat.</p><p>Every cabdriver she\u2019d ever known had spent their time either on their cell phone or talking to the company about waiting fares. This one would have to be the chatty type.</p><p>\u201cA little of both,\u201d she answered, staring out at the rain as she tried not to cry.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>She\u2019d made certain she hadn\u2019t cried on the way back to the rental agency. God forbid she get pulled over for any reason, even this far away from home, because she knew it would take less than an hour for Somerset\u2019s chief of police, Alex Jansen, to learn about it. What Alex knew, his wife, Janey, would be quick to find out.</p><p>And Janey, being Natches\u2019s sister and Dawg\u2019s cousin, would find it impossible not to tattle.</p><p>Piper should have known better. She should have known it couldn\u2019t be this easy. She\u2019d worked far too long and too hard for it to happen as she had imagined once she\u2019d received that letter from S. Chaniss.</p><p>\u201cIf it walks exactly like a duck and quacks exactly like a duck, then watch out for the explosion, because no two ducks walk or quack exactly the same,\u201d she\u2019d once heard Dawg say with a laugh.</p><p>She should have been prepared for the explosion.</p><p>The cabdriver chatted about the rain while Piper answered where she had to. She was aware the trip back to the hotel took much longer than it had going from the hotel to the rental agency, but she always added in for the detours and \u201cscenic routes\u201d the cabbies took to add to the time and mileage they charged, no matter where they were.</p><p>There was only so much of a delay he could make, though. It may have seemed like hours before he was pulling into the front of the well-lit hotel, but it had actually taken no more than fifteen minutes. Which was way too long, considering it was close to midnight and the streets, with the exception of Times Square and a few other tourist-heavy areas, were all but deserted of traffic.</p><p>Pushing his fee and a larger tip than he deserved through the small opening in the divider between the passenger\u2019s and driver\u2019s areas, Piper stepped from the cab and moved quickly into the hotel.</p><p>\u201cAh, Ms. Mackay.\u201d The young, blond receptionist caught her attention. The girl\u2019s expression was apologetic, her pale blue gaze faintly concerned. Just as Piper expected.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She should have kicked Vessante while she had the chance.</p><p>\u201cThe manager would like to speak to you.\u201d The receptionist\u2019s smile was compassionate. \u201cHe\u2019s coming now.\u201d</p><p>As she stepped to the reception desk, the night manager moved from his office and slid behind the desk as Piper waited.</p><p>Stocky, his face weathered with laugh lines at the corner of his eyes, his brown gaze was concerned and compassionate. It was firm, though. He knew what he had to do, and he may hate it, but he would do it.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Ms. Mackay,\u201d the manager, Charles, appeared genuinely apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m aware your stay was to be taken care of by another party, but.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry, ma\u2019am, but I was informed before your arrival that that is no longer the case and the party is now refusing to pay.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let the manager finish demanding the payment. It wasn\u2019t his fault, and she could tell this was one part of his job he definitely didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer to take care of my room myself, Charles.\u201d She smiled back at him as relief gleamed in his gaze.</p><p>He was a nice guy; she liked him. He had checked her in during the wee hours of the morning and ensured she had a cab waiting that morning to take her shopping. He\u2019d arranged her morning coffee and joked with her about the weather when she\u2019d stepped into the lobby to leave for her shopping trip.</p><p>Taking her date book/planner from her purse, Piper opened it and pulled her credit card free before laying it on the gleaming marble counter in front of the young woman standing at his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The young woman\u2014Brittany, her name tag claimed\u2014ran the card before giving her a bright smile as the payment went through. \u201cWill you be staying with us the full length of the reservation?\u201d</p><p>So much for Dawg being unaware where she had stayed.</p><p>Piper shook her head as she slid a tip to the girl. \u201cI\u2019m checking out tonight. Could you please have a car waiting in about an hour to take me to the train station, and send the bellhop up for my luggage?\u201d</p> <p>She should never have gone shopping that morning. There were bags of additional materials in her room that she would now have to try to stuff into the single extra duffel bag she\u2019d packed rather than purchasing another, as she\u2019d planned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make certain of it.\u201d Brittany\u2019s smile was too cheerful.</p><p>Piper quickly turned and headed for the elevators as she tucked her card back into the planner\u2019s clear zippered pocket.</p><p>As she did so, a phone number caught her eye.</p><p>Jed Booker. The number was scrawled under his name in the neat, no-nonsense handwriting he used.</p> <p>She should have invited him to come with her, she sighed wearily to herself. Eldon Vessante would have never tried anything so stupid if Jed had been with her. She had a feeling Mr. Vessante would have been far less likely to stuff that sock in his pants, or to make such an outrageous demand.</p><p>He would have simply told her he had changed his mind the first chance he had, which would have suited her fine.</p><p>Stepping into the elevator, she told herself it didn\u2019t matter. If it was meant to be, it would be; it was that simple.</p><p>That phone number glared back at her, though, until she snapped the planner closed. She didn\u2019t push it back into her purse, however. She held on to it even though she\u2019d already both memorized the number and programmed it into her smart phone.</p><p>Yes, if she had brought Jed, she had no doubt the night would have been far less disappointing and much more interesting.</p><p>One thing was certain: Jed so did not stuff his crotch with anything but what God had given him. And God had been generous.</p> <p>Rudy Genoa stared at the disgusting, bloodied face of the car rental agency manager with bitter fury.</p><p>He was tied, in a rather clich\u00e9d style, to an old-fashioned wooden office chair, because he was too damned cheap to buy the nice, if inexpensive, computer chairs that were so easy to find.</p><p>It had worked to restrain him, though.</p><p>Duct tape secured his wrists to the arms of the chair and his ankles to the legs. His face was swollen and pale beneath the blood that marred it. The top of his balding head was splattered with his blood, calling attention to the fact that perhaps he\u2019d lost more hair since the last time Rudy had seen him several months ago.</p><p>Chester\u2019s head lolled to the side a bit, while small, bloody bubbles filled and deflated at his nostrils with each breath.</p><p>He really was a distressing sight, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. Rudy was furious. The loss of the delivery had the potential to do far more than just embarrass him. The loss of that delivery could bring some very nasty individuals into his town looking for him. The type of men one preferred not to piss off. Even one with Rudy\u2019s power.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe the stupidity.</p><p>This was what you got for trying to trust family to do a job right.</p> <p>\u201cDid you think I would just let this go, Chester?\u201d Rudy asked as he straddled the chair he\u2019d pulled over to the balding, overweight little bastard.</p><p>\u201cRudy, please.\u201d Sloppy, bleeding, one eye swollen shut, his lips split by the heavy fist that had pounded into them, Chester wept pitifully. \u201cI did like you said; I swear. It was that new girl. She rented the car out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now the delivery that came in with that car is missing,\u201d Rudy stated softly. \u201cWe checked it thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Chester choked. \u201cYou owe me, Rudy. You owe me. I\u2019ll get them back. I swear I will.\u201d</p><p>He owed him.</p><p>Rudy agreed with his cousin for a change.</p><p>A six-year stint in prison for a crime he had been nowhere near had earned Chester a hell of a boon. But this . . .</p><p>Rudy shook his head as he propped his arms on the back of the chair he was straddling. Six years in prison for the rape of Rudy\u2019s rival\u2019s mistress came nowhere close to the millions of dollars in diamonds, sapphires, and rubies that were now missing.</p><p>The slightest awareness of another presence behind him had Rudy waiting patiently, the familiar lack of sound in his son\u2019s movements pleasing.</p><p>\u201cI checked the security tapes. She arrived about ten minutes before we did, messed around in the backseat, looks like she knocked over a bag onto the back floorboard. We found a receipt pushed beneath one of the seats for a craft seller for colored crystals and stones. There\u2019s a chance the woman doesn\u2019t know what she has.\u201d There was no opinion either way in the boy\u2019s voice.</p><p>Well, perhaps Andre wasn\u2019t a boy anymore, but as his mother would say, he would always be Rudy\u2019s boy.</p><p>\u201cAnd her name?\u201d Rudy asked.</p><p>At his son\u2019s lack of an answer, Rudy turned to stare back at him with a frown. Rarely had Rudy seen this expression on Andre\u2019s face.</p><p>That look of concern.</p><p>Trepidation began to tingle in Rudy\u2019s gut.</p><p>\u201cPiper Mackay, from Somerset, Kentucky.\u201d The words were a harsh rasp of anger from a man who rarely allowed himself to show any emotion. \u201cThe investigation I did on the family after Marlena\u2019s disappearance says she\u2019s James \u2018Dawg\u2019 Mackay\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>But now, Rudy knew why his son had hesitated to give him the information.</p><p>Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches Mackay had not just been instrumental in foiling Marlena Genoa\u2019s plot to kill John Walker Jr. for breaking their engagement, but had also managed to kill Gerard Andrews, the sponsor backing her acceptance into the Genoa family.</p><p>\u201cCoincidence?\u201d Rudy asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s staying at a hotel no more than two blocks from here,\u201d his son answered. \u201cChester knows the manager there, from what I\u2019ve gathered.\u201d</p><p>Andre didn\u2019t confirm or deny the theory of coincidence, though Rudy knew he didn\u2019t believe in such a thing. Rudy believed, though. He\u2019d seen far stranger occurrences in his lifetime that could be explained no other way.</p><p>\u201cThis is a complication.\u201d Rudy sighed, turning back to glower at Chester. \u201cWhy is she here, in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to our contact at the hotel, she\u2019s a clothing designer. She was here for a meeting with a backer,\u201d his son informed him as Rudy stared at Chester, his eyes narrowed with a fury he found hard to control. \u201cGetting into her room won\u2019t be a problem. Once I get in, I\u2019ll restrain her and reacquire our property. That should be the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake two men with you,\u201d Rudy ordered as he glanced at the brute standing behind Chester. \u201cSend them in. This is a matter you oversee, not one you do yourself.\u201d</p><p>The boy had a tendency to micromanage shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d Andre promised, and Rudy knew he could depend on him. Of all the men he commanded, it was Andre he trusted above all others to ensure the job was taken care of quickly and correctly.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Rudy sighed. \u201cAnd, Andre, don\u2019t let your men kill the girl. Make it look like a random burglary. We don\u2019t need the Mackays and their government sidekicks in our town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Andre nodded shortly before turning and leaving the room once again.</p><p>Rudy turned back to Chester.</p><p>\u201cSee, it wasn\u2019t my fault, Rudy. It was that girl you hired. She let the car out and I told her not to,\u201d Chester whined. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Rudy agreed, ignoring the hope that suddenly filled his third cousin\u2019s abused features. \u201cThis is very true.\u201d</p><p>The girl was Rudy\u2019s illegitimate daughter. She was his favorite child, and this incompetent fool thought to place the blame on her? The poor bastard had just signed his own death warrant.</p><p>His gaze flicked to the heavily muscled ex-boxer, the Brute, as Rudy called him, standing behind the other man. The one whose fists had made hamburger out of Chester\u2019s face earlier.</p><p>The large head nodded as the ex-boxer, Jones Morley, read the silent look in Rudy\u2019s eyes. The weapon he carried with its silencer attached came up as Rudy moved away from the other man.</p><p>A second later, a heavy pop sounded behind him, and Rudy knew he would never have to worry about Chester screwing up again.</p><p>The nerve of him anyway, blaming an innocent child for a mistake that should have never happened.</p><p>\u201cI hardly think my precious little Asta was at fault in the least,\u201d he said as Jones followed him from the room. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsta\u2019s no dummy,\u201d the other man stated, bringing a glow of pride rushing through Rudy. \u201cI kind of doubt she would have rented the vehicle if she was told specifically not to do so.\u201d</p><p>Moving ahead of him, Jones quickly opened the door leading from the office and stood back as Rudy stepped through.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of the body,\u201d Rudy ordered the two men waiting outside. \u201cThen return to the house.\u201d</p><p>Striding from the office, Rudy left the building and walked quickly to the black SUV his driver, Danny, was standing beside.</p><p>The moment the doors to the office had opened, his nephew, Danny, was striding around the vehicle. Tall and imposing, Danny was as much a bodyguard as a chauffeur. Dark Italian heritage was reflected in his features, while strong American stock was reflected in his tall, stout body. Before Rudy could reach it, his door was open, the comfortable leather interior and an even more comfortable silk-skinned mistress awaiting him inside.</p><p>The mistress held no appeal for him tonight, though. The potential for disaster was rising with each minute that Andre hadn\u2019t called him to report he had the gems. Every second those jewels were out of his possession, the closer disaster came in the form of some very nasty members of the Russian Mafia.</p><p>The Mackay woman would end up destroying Rudy\u2019s base of power if he wasn\u2019t extremely careful.</p><p>Or rather, the woman\u2019s family would.</p><p>That damned brother, Dawg, and her cousins, Rowdy and Natches, and the men and women they called friends who were part of the Department of Homeland Security were dangerous. Especially that little misfit Timothy Cranston.</p><p>They were a force no criminal wanted to call the attention of. Rudy\u2019d lost a very influential lawyer and a rather promising family member he was very fond of to the Kentucky natives.</p><p>His niece Marlena Genoa, and her sponsor back into the family, Gerard Andrews, had been taken out with such efficiency it had been shocking.</p><p>They had gone to Kentucky to seek retribution against Marlena\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 when he had broken their engagement five years before. Neither had returned, and Marlena\u2019s body had never been found.</p><p>Poor Marlena. First her father had turned against the Genoa family, effectively ensuring she was no longer part of the base of power and wealth Rudy controlled. Then, she had let the prominent fianc\u00e9 she had managed to snare slip from her fingers. Which wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if she hadn\u2019t promised to secure him, and his father\u2019s prestigious law firm, for the Genoa family. When a promise was made, it must be kept. Or retribution must be established and restitution made. Once John Walker broke their engagement, the Genoa family demanded restitution, a small portion of the promised funds and prestige John Walker would have brought to the family, or Marlena had to seek retribution to prove she was strong enough to be part of the Genoa family in an age of betrayals, double dealing, and technological deceptions.</p><p>The family needed insurance that she would never do as her father had and turn on them\u2014turn evidence over to the authorities and attempt to destroy the family. She was to have killed John Walker and Sierra Lucas before the life insurance policy she had taken out on him, and he had forgotten about, expired. The funds would have been given to the Genoa family, and the blood on her hands would have given at least a small assurance of her loyalty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had done neither. She had instead gotten a highly successful and very beneficial attorney killed and she had ended up, most likely, under Timothy Cranston\u2019s control.</p><p>A very, very bad place to be.</p><p>If Rudy wasn\u2019t very careful, if his son wasn\u2019t even more careful, then they would soon find themselves facing that bastard Cranston and those hick Mackays in the worst possible way. That was something Rudy intended to avoid at all costs.</p> <p>He\u2019d had the family investigated after Marlena\u2019s disappearance and Gerard\u2019s death. What he had learned made him wary. The shadowed vendetta that had played out against his organization for a year afterward still had the power to keep him awake at night.</p><p>The authorities had watched his family much too closely, his sources among the law enforcement agencies began disappearing, but when his son had been jerked out of England after leaving the family and nearly imprisoned, Rudy had known they had made enemies the family could ill afford. Word on the street was that the Genoa crime organization had shaken the wrong tree in Kentucky and they were going to pay for it.</p><p>It was a tree he had no intentions of shaking again in a way that meant he, or anyone in his organization, could be identified.</p><p>The only good thing that had come of it? Homeland Security had pissed Andre off enough to return home and ensure that they could never do so again. He was now learning the ropes and moving in as Rudy\u2019s right hand. And a very effective right hand he was.</p><p>The bodies Andre disposed of were never seen again. There was no evidence to lead back to Rudy, Andre, or the family, and no loose lips spilling family business secrets.</p> <p>It was a good life.</p><p>Unless those gems weren\u2019t in his possession when the owners came looking for them.</p><p>Resignation burned a hole in his gut.</p><p>Fuck. He was going to have to go after a Mackay.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t frightened of the Mackays, but he was definitely on guard against them.</p><p>So much so that he would have gladly let the disappearance of those stones go, unless the Mackay girl tried to sell them. He would have washed his hands of them if the men arriving soon to collect them would have been willing to do the same. Or if perhaps they would have taken the task of collecting them from Kentucky.</p> <p>That wouldn\u2019t happen, though. At least, not until they wiped every last trace of the Genoa family from existence.</p><p>Yes, this definitely had the potential to be very, very dangerous. And that potential was growing by the minute.</p><p>SIX</p><p>Andre Genoa stared at the hotel from the driver\u2019s seat of the dark gray van with a growing sense of fury as he disconnected the call he\u2019d just taken.</p><p>Son of a bitch. He didn\u2019t need this, not right now. Not at this point in the game.</p><p>\u201cMarcel says she\u2019s just called for a bellhop, Dennis,\u201d he told the man he\u2019d chosen to retrieve the jewels. \u201cYou\u2019ll go up. When she answers the door, load her belongings. Maneuver her cart into the elevator first, where Marcel will be waiting for you. He\u2019ll block her while the doors close. Take the cart to the room service elevator and out the back entrance. I\u2019ll be waiting for you there. We\u2019ll just take everything, then go through it later.\u201d</p><p>Dennis was the less violent of the two men, and the one known to be the most protective of his daughter and wife. He was Andre\u2019s best bet in ensuring Piper Mackay wasn\u2019t harmed.</p><p>\u201cGot it, boss.\u201d Nodding his head, Dennis opened the door and slid from the front passenger seat.</p> <p>As the door closed behind Dennis\u2019s bulky form, Nate Ryan, his best friend and partner, moved into the seat, his gray eyes narrowed against the lights of the vehicles moving along the busy street as Andre pulled out of the parking space and headed toward the hotel\u2019s back entrance.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel good, Andre,\u201d Nate murmured as they turned down the small street used for deliveries. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel good at all. Who chose Marcel to head to the hotel ahead of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Andre murmured. \u201cRudy didn\u2019t say anything about sending extra men in.\u201d</p><p>He hoped it was just indigestion, but something warned him this task was a hell of a lot more dangerous than the Mexican food they\u2019d eaten earlier.</p><p>Marcel tended to give him indigestion, though. The man was a self-important moron. His arrogance had only grown in the past year, after Rudy and Boris Cheslav had chosen him as an emissary between the two families. Marcel had saved Boris\u2019s ass a few years back when he\u2019d learned that a relative of the family working an important drug buy was actually a DEA plant. Boris had immediately moved the other man into the upper level of his organization.</p><p>When Boris had approached Rudy with the request to handle the jewels coming into the city, he\u2019d revealed the fact that Marcel, Rudy\u2019s third cousin, was actually one of his men, and would be their contact during the transaction. Which meant Andre couldn\u2019t get rid of him, as much as he would love to.</p><p>Marcel was fucking untouchable until the agreement Rudy had made with the Russian family was completed. If the other man disappeared, then the suspicious, highly paranoid Russian might just slip the leash his own son had on him, and strike out at the Genoa family. They couldn\u2019t risk that.</p><p>Pulling the van into place, Andre glared at the back entrance of the hotel, willing Dennis to hurry, to complete the theft of the girl\u2019s belongings quickly.</p><p>\u201cA fucking Mackay,\u201d Nate sighed beside him then. \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d</p><p>What were the chances. For a man that didn\u2019t believe in coincidence, he was suddenly being given supposed proof that they existed.</p><p>\u201cThe chances are pretty much fucking nil,\u201d he growled. \u201cAfter we get back, find out why she\u2019s here, and start tying up loose ends. I want to know every fucking move she\u2019s made, everyone she\u2019s talked to, and every breath she\u2019s taken since she made the decision to come to the city alone. Dawg Mackay is too fucking paranoid to let one of his sister\u2019s travel here without a baby-sitter. And Timothy Cranston would die and go to hell before he\u2019d let one of them travel anywhere alone without a shadow.\u201d He turned and glared at Nate. \u201cI haven\u2019t found her shadow yet. That means, she doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>Nate\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cSomeone playing with us again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what my gut\u2019s telling me.\u201d Andre made the realization in a flash. \u201cSomeone\u2019s definitely playing with us, and I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>The planner Jed had scrawled his number in lay on the table next to the door, where Piper had thrown it after having to force herself not to call him. Again.</p><p>She wanted to call him.</p><p>She wanted to rail about the decision to travel to New York alone, and she wanted to curse Eldon Vessante to the pits of hell, and she needed someone to listen to her. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t think of anyone she could call whom she could trust to keep the details to themselves.</p><p>Even Amy, the friend whose sister had given her a ride to the train station, couldn\u2019t be totally trusted. If Amy even suspected Piper might be harmed, or had been, then she would call Dawg in a New York minute.</p><p>Amy might not know Dawg. She may not have a very high opinion of him after some of the stories Piper had told her about his protectiveness, but Amy had become a good friend over the past few years. She returned to Somerset each summer just to see Piper\u2019s new designs, and over the course of those visits, they had become close.</p><p>Besides, Amy also trusted her sister, Gypsy, and Gypsy was a female version of the Mackay men. Pure military, tough, and suspicious. She would convince Amy to call the Mackays, if she didn\u2019t just call Natches herself.</p><p>The only bright spot in the night was that she had been able to get a ticket on a train departing in two hours. It would put her in Louisville five hours later, and from there the price for a rental car home wouldn\u2019t give away the fact that she had been in New York City.</p><p>Dawg would have pups if he ever found out she had traveled there alone. He was so damned protective and controlling of his sisters\u2019 lives that he had even fully vetted their roommates at college. She and her sisters had become so disgusted over the choices he had given them that they had opted to just share an apartment together.</p><p>Piper hated it.</p><p>She hated having to look over her shoulder at every party she went to and every event she attended. Even worse was how often her dates and potential lovers looked over their shoulders.</p><p>The few men Piper had actually considered sleeping with had run so damned fast once they\u2019d realized who she was related to that there hadn\u2019t been a chance of finding out whether they were as compatible as she had thought they might be.</p><p>The men who hadn\u2019t run had been far too much like the male Mackays for her to even consider, once she realized the traits they shared with her family members. She was terrified of ending up with a man just like Dawg, or worse yet, a man who reported to him.</p><p>That would be so humiliating.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse than being in a relationship where she couldn\u2019t trust her lover to have more loyalty to her than he had fear of her brother.</p><p>Would Jed really fear Dawg, though?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine that happening, but she could imagine him reporting to Dawg simply because he believed her brother would have the right to know what she was doing, when, and where.</p><p>She glanced to the planner again as she finished packing her duffel bag with the items she\u2019d bought before leaving for the meeting with the bastard who had tricked her into coming to New York. She\u2019d literally upended her purse to get all the little packages of stones and colored glass into the duffel, and stuffed all the fabric and notions in after them.</p><p>It would serve Eldon right if she did tell Dawg exactly what he had done. Dawg and her cousins would be in New York City so fast no one would dare realize they were gone. And they would beat the skinny, rat-faced little pervert to a pulp.</p><p>The thought of it was immensely satisfying, but she knew she could never do it.</p><p>Shaking her head at the pleasurable image and heading across the room to collect her planner, she was brought up short by a knock on the door.</p><p>The bellhop was quick. She had called the front desk and asked them to give her an hour before sending him up, but she didn\u2019t mind leaving a little earlier than she had planned. It would give her a few extra minutes to settle onto the train and feel a little sorrier for herself.</p><p>Mockery curled her lips. If there was one thing she didn\u2019t do well, it was feel sorry for herself.</p><p>Dawg wasn\u2019t really a prison warden, though in the past year, she admitted, there were often times she accused him of being one.</p><p>Checking the peephole quickly, she saw a large form dressed in the familiar hotel jacket and quickly opened the door.</p><p>For the second time that night, her world went to hell.</p><p>She had seen Eldon\u2019s attack coming; she wasn\u2019t expecting this one.</p><p>The second the door parted from the frame it slammed inward with such force Piper found herself thrown back into the room, where she crashed into the room service cart delivered earlier.</p><p>Dishes and food were suddenly flung across the floor as the cart took her weight, and Piper let out a piercing scream.</p><p>Don\u2019t be quiet, Dawg had always advised her and her sisters. There was nothing an attacker hated worse than having attention called to his actions.</p><p>And evidently it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cShut up, bitch.\u201d Enraged, the apelike figure dived for her as Piper fought to scramble away, using every breath she had to scream her lungs out.</p><p>A heavy fist caught her shoulder, causing her face to slam into the side of the dresser.</p><p>For a moment, her senses were rattled, light flashing before her eyes and exploding in vibrant color as she fought back the dizzying darkness gathering beyond the lights.</p><p>A hand attached to her upper arm with bruising force, jerking her from the floor as a hoarse demand was growled in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>Where was what?</p><p>She screamed again, struggling against him as she tried with every blow to bury her fist or a foot into his balls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her knee connected, drawing an agonized grunt a second before she was thrown into the wall hard enough to send her bouncing to the bed.</p><p>Voices were raised, outraged, cursing.</p><p>Piper was struggling to make sense of it as the sudden explosion of a weapon discharging shocked her senses into an abrupt return to reality.</p> <p>Every bone and muscle in her body hurt.</p><p>Dizziness assailed her, washing through her and weakening her as she struggled to lift herself from the bed.</p><p>Was she shot?</p><p>Oh, God, Dawg would kill her if she managed to get shot while escaping to New York. She would hear all kinds of \u201cI told you so\u201ds. Her sisters would of course blame her for the additional security that would follow. . . . Who the hell were those men rushing into her room?</p><p>Oh, God, they were big. . . .</p> <p>There were too many of them. . . .</p><p>Too big, and too many.</p><p>Darkness rushed over her, drawing her into a pit of icy nothingness. The complete lack of sensory information was like being buried alive.</p><p>She was aware, yet she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>There, yet she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>And one question haunted her through it all: Exactly what was it her attacker had been demanding?</p> <p>Where are they, you little cunt?</p><p>Where was what?</p><p>Who?</p><p>\u201cLady? Lady you okay? Someone call an ambulance; she\u2019s hurt. She\u2019s hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s hurt.</p><p>Who was hurt?</p><p>Oh, yeah\u2014it was her.</p><p>She was hurt.</p> <p>Then the darkness deepened; that nowhere place grew, sucked her in, and enfolded her until nothing and no one else could penetrate.</p><p>Jed came awake instantly, before the first, faint vibrating tremor of the phone against the wood nightstand eased away. The second vibration didn\u2019t have the chance to begin before he flipped the cell phone open and brought it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cBooker,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cJed Booker?\u201d the male voice asked, faintly quizzical, highly uncomfortable, and not yet fully mature.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Bret. Bret Jordan. You don\u2019t know me, but I found your name in this lady\u2019s journal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiper.\u201d He was out of the bed instantly and dressing. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, me and my friends were staying at this hotel in New York City when the lady in the room next to us started screaming. When we ran to her room this guy was beating the crap out of her. He got away with her purse, but her day planner was still lying on a table and it had your name in it. If you know her, the doctors really need some info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Jed growled the single word, having dressed as the kid made his explanation.</p><p>He was given the name and address quickly as he jerked his boots on his feet, grabbed his weapon and keys, and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cLook, are you family or something?\u201d he was asked then. \u201cThey really need to treat her, but she\u2019s unconscious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComatose or unconscious?\u201d Jed was in the pickup he kept parked at the inn for those times when he needed something besides the Harley.</p><p>This was one of those times.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s mumbled conversation. \u201cMan, the nurse won\u2019t tell me. She says family\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her brother,\u201d he lied instantly. \u201cHer only family. Now, is she comatose or unconscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the nurse.\u201d</p><p>The nurse was, fortunately, more informative.</p><p>Identifying himself as her brother to the nurse, he waited what seemed like an eternity as she found the doctor. Pulling from the inn\u2019s parking lot, he drove at the legal speed limit until far enough from the inn to avoid drawing Timothy\u2019s attention, then hit the gas and increased his speed.</p><p>Until he hit the highway he wouldn\u2019t be safe from detection, just from being stopped for speeding. Sheriff Mayes\u2019s deputies would immediately report the truck speeding if they saw it, just as any Somerset cop would report directly to Chief of Police Alex Jansen.</p><p>As he got to the city limits, the doctor finally, thankfully, took the phone.</p><p>Piper was stable, thank God. He wouldn\u2019t have to call Dawg after all. She was currently severely bruised, concussed, and unconscious, but in stable condition. The hospital needed permission to treat her, though, the doctor explained.</p><p>Jed lied once again and told them he was her brother, gave the doctor permission to treat Piper, then asked her to put the young man who called him on the phone once again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give the nurse the planner to call\u2014why?\u201d he asked instantly, suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jed could almost see the uncomfortable shrug he imagined the young man made. \u201cWe were the ones who rescued her; I guess we kind of feel responsible for her until someone else gets here. You know? And that dude that attacked her tried to shoot us as he ran out of the room. The police around here are nuts, too. They didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash, so no one\u2019s watching to make sure the guy doesn\u2019t come after her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in approximately three hours,\u201d Jed told him. \u201cCan you wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here until you get to her,\u201d Bret promised. \u201cBut if you could get here faster, it would be good. I heard the nurse say someone else already called the hospital and asked about the lady attacked at the hotel, so whoever attacked her could be planning to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me, my best friend, Matt, and his girlfriend, Olivia,\u201d Bret told him. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait on you. No one\u2019s going to bother her while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Jed wasn\u2019t reassured, but he had to admit he was damned glad to know she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it was my sister, I\u2019d want someone to wait on me,\u201d the boy admitted. \u201cDrive careful. We\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Careful?</p><p>Jed hit the interstate and pushed his foot on the gas as he disconnected the call, then made another.</p><p>\u201cControl,\u201d a well-modulated feminine voice answered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Agent Booker,\u201d he stated before quickly giving his control number. \u201cI\u2019m en route to agency airfield in Louisville, Kentucky. Advise all law enforcement to allow disposition and advise agency pilot to have transport ready. Destination New York City.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have you on satellite, Agent Booker,\u201d Control advised him. \u201cAll law enforcement will be advised and turned away. Proceed with caution to airfield Delta-Bravo-Tahoe, where a pilot will be advised to be waiting in hangar six-four-zero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d he responded. \u201cAgent Booker out.\u201d</p><p>No doubt Timothy would question him once he was given the report of Jed\u2019s midnight race to New York City, but that could be days away, possibly weeks, until Timothy called and requested agent maneuver reports. Though that was something he rarely did.</p><p>The landscape sped by; the roads, luckily, weren\u2019t busy in the hours after midnight until four in the morning or later. It gave him the space needed to travel safely at the speed needed to reach the airport just outside Louisville and to still the sudden, unheard-of terror piercing his heart.</p><p>What the hell was Piper doing in New York City?</p><p>Whoever the hell she\u2019d been sneaking out to meet had obviously abducted her, hadn\u2019t they? Piper surely wouldn\u2019t leave the state without letting her brother, Dawg, know she was leaving.</p><p>Or would she?</p><p>Damn her.</p><p>He\u2019d been driving himself insane in his attempt to figure out where she had gone without resorting to official channels or contacts to learn her secrets. She\u2019d left without telling him with whom or where she was going. It was obvious she didn\u2019t want to share the information or the identity of her lover.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to share it then; she would share it now.</p><p>She would share it or he would be on the phone to Dawg.</p><p>Piper and her sisters didn\u2019t think there was anything worse than having their brother or male cousins pissed. Piper was about to find out there was something far worse.</p><p>There was Jed, and he wasn\u2019t about to let an attack against her go.</p><p>This had nothing to do with protectiveness or control. It had nothing to do with an attempt to dominate her life. What it had to do with was the fact that someone had dared to hurt her, and he would make certain that someone had the favor returned.</p><p>Piper stared at the nurse in disgust.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me stay here,\u201d she informed the middle-aged, kindly looking nurse as the woman stared back at her with concerned hazel eyes.</p><p>Standing at five feet, four inches if she was lucky, her gray-and-brown hair pulled back from her face in a tight braid as the small wrinkles at the corners of her eyes drew in with her frown, the nurse watched her in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a concussion, Ms. Mackay, and I doubt you feel much like walking right now, let alone traveling to the train station. If you\u2019ll just calm down, the doctor will be in soon; he can check you and let you know what damage has been done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know what damage has been done,\u201d she muttered angrily. \u201cTrust me; I can feel every bruise.\u201d</p><p>And she could. Every single bruise, scratch, and jab that had been plowed into her undefended body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you can,\u201d the nurse agreed compassionately. \u201cBut that concussion could be dangerous. Your brother\u2019s due at any time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Piper knew she\u2019d just lost her breath as trepidation began to race through her system.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>No.</p><p>Not Dawg. Surely to God no one had actually called Dawg.</p><p>\u201cYour brother Jed.\u201d The nurse smiled again. \u201cHis name and phone number was in your day planner, thank goodness.\u201d She moved to the bed and, as Piper stared back at her in shock, actually managed to wrap the blood pressure cuff around her arm. \u201cYour purse was stolen. If it hadn\u2019t been for his name and number in your planner, then we\u2019d have had no idea whom to contact.\u201d</p><p>Her brother Jed, not her brother, Dawg? No doubt Jed had called Dawg. Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches were probably just ahead of his arrival and blowing fire and brimstone. And once they stepped into the hospital, hell would have no fury like the Mackay men pissed off.</p><p>\u201cGod, this isn\u2019t good.\u201d Lying back against the hospital bed, Piper closed her eyes wearily. \u201cHow long ago did you talk to him? Forget it.\u201d She gave a quick shake of her head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter; he could be here in two minutes or in two hours.\u201d Opening her eyes, she levered herself up on the bed. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>Nurse Dade widened her eyes in surprise. \u201cMs. Mackay, where your clothes are doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she informed Piper. \u201cYou need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find the damned things myself then.\u201d Piper sighed.</p><p>She really didn\u2019t feel like finding anything, especially her clothes, but sometimes a girl just had to do what a girl just had to do, right?</p><p>\u201cMs. Mackay, you\u2019re in no shape to leave the hospital alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNurse Dade, you really have no idea the forces of nature getting ready to rip through this hospital,\u201d she informed the nurse as dread began to fill her. \u201cThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse have nothing\u2014and I mean absolutely nothing\u2014on my brothers. Famine, pestilence, war, and disease are a kiddie playground in comparison, and I have no intentions of hanging around for the fallout.\u201d</p><p>Nurse Dade\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSweetie, I talked to him myself.\u201d She gave a small, nervous little laugh. \u201cHe was as nice as he could be. I think you may have hit your head harder than the doctor thought.\u201d</p><p>Struggling from the bed, Piper ignored the nurse\u2019s disapproving glare as she shuffled to the small cabinet next to the end of the bed.</p><p>Aha, clothes.</p><p>\u201cMs. Mackay, this isn\u2019t advisable.\u201d The nurse sighed as Piper struggled past the roommate who had been listening in amused interest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not advisable to be here when Dawg Mackay arrives either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Dawg Mackay?\u201d The nurse was all but laughing at her. \u201cHis name is Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to know. Trust me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt my feelings, sis. That just wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d</p><p>Piper came to a slow stop no more than a few feet from the bathroom door when Jed stepped slowly into the room.</p><p>His voice was gentle, amused, and patient. The look in his eyes was damned scary, though.</p><p>Scary, that was, if her attacker ever had the misfortune to stare into them.</p><p>She could see murder in those eyes. As Jed took in the bruised, swollen condition of her face, the hesitancy in her stance as she stood before him, then the livid bruises on her arms, the navy blue of his eyes flickered with a deep, black rage.</p> <p>Shaking his head slowly, he advanced on her, all lean-hipped, predatory male grace and dark intent.</p><p>\u201cHow far behind you is Dawg?\u201d Resignation slumped her shoulders.</p><p>If she had been on a leash before where her brother was concerned, no doubt it would feel like prison even before they left the hospital.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d say about twelve hours or so,\u201d he drawled, then leaned close, staring into her wide eyes as he whispered, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, sweet pea. Want to keep it that way?\u201d</p><p>Piper nodded. Oh, God, she really wanted to keep it that way.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to cooperate, right?\u201d he suggested softly.</p> <p>Piper nodded again.</p><p>To keep Dawg in the dark?</p><p>Oh, hell, yes, she would cooperate.</p><p>At least to a point.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d hate to mar the Mackay reputation for cooperating only when it suited their own interests.</p><p>Right now it suited every single interest she could think of, though.</p><p>\u201cGood then.\u201d He straightened, his hands settling with airy gentleness just above her shoulders. \u201cTurn around, march right back to that bed, and we\u2019ll just wait for the doctor, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She moved for the bed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d he commended her as Nurse Dade smiled with an awestruck girlishness Piper found nauseating.</p><p>Good girl, was she? she thought, sitting back on the bed carefully as she glared up at the smirking, far too self-satisfied Jedediah Booker.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d just show him what a good girl she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>As soon as the doctor released her, that was.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Jed hadn\u2019t prayed in years, but as he drove from the small airfield outside Louisville the next evening, he found himself praying for patience.</p><p>He\u2019d found a chance to question Bret Jordan and his friends Matthew Grace and Olivia Camfield. From their report, they\u2019d heard Piper screaming in the suite next door and had come to investigate. Her door had been opened and a man they described as a \u201cmountain\u201d had been pounding on Piper as though he intended to beat her to death.</p><p>He also had the bastard\u2019s description. The three had been amazingly observant and were able to provide several valuable details in regard to the assailant\u2019s appearance. One of his contacts in the city had made a visit to the hotel and questioned the staff before going to the room and doing the job it seemed the police hadn\u2019t, collecting what evidence of the attack had been left.</p><p>And there was the reason for the prayers. Patience wasn\u2019t his strong suit. The second he had Piper safely at home he\u2019d launch his own investigation. God help the bastard who had dared to touch her.</p><p>Once the assailant was found, Jed prayed he could keep from attempting to kill him with his bare hands. From showing the \u201cmountain\u201d what it meant to really hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell Dawg where I was?\u201d Piper finally deigned to speak to him, something she hadn\u2019t done since they\u2019d left the hospital unless he\u2019d simply left her no other choice.</p><p>\u201cI promised to keep your secrets, Piper; I meant it.\u201d Glancing at her, he drove the truck he\u2019d parked at the airfield the morning before toward Somerset. \u201cI won\u2019t tell Dawg anything I know you\u2019d want me to keep to myself.\u201d</p><p>The flight back had been short, but Jed hadn\u2019t wanted to arrive back in Kentucky until well after midnight. He\u2019d spent the day getting her ready to leave and ensuring someone was investigating her reason for being there and why she had been attacked.</p><p>He hoped\u2014hell, no, he was praying\u2014that Dawg wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the inn when they arrived.</p><p>She shifted against the leather seats, no doubt trying to find a comfortable position.</p><p>His fingers tightened on the steering wheel as he fought back the anger he was determined she wouldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t call Dawg?\u201d She obviously didn\u2019t want to believe him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Dawg would have charged into New York City with Rowdy, Natches, and no doubt Chaya, Natches\u2019s wife; the chief of Somerset\u2019s police force, Alex Jansen, and Pulaski County sheriff Zeke Mayes; as well as Special Agent Timothy Cranston and Piper\u2019s mother, Mercedes Mackay, ready to kill.</p><p>Dawg wouldn\u2019t have left the city until Timothy had buried her attacker. If that attacker hadn\u2019t been found, then Piper would have returned under such heavy guard she would have been smothered before ever reaching Kentucky again.</p><p>Silence descended between them, one that stretched until they had nearly reached the exit to Somerset.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to hide the bruises,\u201d Piper stated, her voice low. \u201cDawg\u2019s going to see them.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he would; there was no way to hide the damage to her face, though thankfully, her left eye was no longer swollen shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to tell him?\u201d Taking the exit to Somerset off the interstate, he knew Piper\u2019s time was definitely running out.</p><p>Dawg had all but haunted Mercedes and Timothy, demanding to know whether Piper had called her mother yet. Elijah, Jed\u2019s partner, had called earlier in the afternoon to report Dawg had contacted several agents at the surrounding airports and had her name run for flights out.</p><p>He\u2019d told her earlier about the conversation he\u2019d overheard between Mercedes and Dawg, as well as the fact that Dawg was questioning everyone he could think to question about her whereabouts.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide this from him, Piper,\u201d he warned her when she didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t,\u201d she answered wearily.</p><p>The tiredness in her tone coincided with that unfamiliar tightness in his chest\u2014something he experienced only with Piper.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been beside himself with worry,\u201d he told her. \u201cChrista\u2019s accused him of running headlong into a stroke as he attempts to protect all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he would just wait until we need protecting.\u201d Frustration immediately tightened her body as she pushed both hands through her shoulder-length black hair before clenching them in the deep waves.</p><p>God, he would kill to feel all that lush, warm silk against his body. Against his thighs as her lips parted and his dick pierced the heated dampness beyond. That particular portion of his body throbbed in painful hunger as the need for her began to grow impossibly.</p><p>Impossibly, because he hadn\u2019t believed he could hunger for her more than he already did.</p><p>Impossibly, because she was hurt, bruised, and no doubt the last thing on her mind was sex. She was definitely exhausted. She\u2019d slept the whole of the flight, waking only as the plane taxied to the private hangar DHS leased.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t he wait until we need him, Jed?\u201d she questioned with hurt anger. \u201cWhy can\u2019t he just let us live a little bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s seen the monsters.\u201d Jed knew exactly why. \u201cHe knows what\u2019s out there, Piper, and the nightmares haunt him now\u2014the fear of not protecting the four of you, of being off guard and missing a threat, gives him nightmares. That\u2019s why he\u2019s driving himself to a stroke. That\u2019s why he has trouble letting you live your life. Because he knows that in that one moment that you relax your guard, that\u2019s when the monsters strike and attempt to steal everything you love in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they steal something you love?\u201d she asked.</p><p>How had she guessed there was more to his life than he\u2019d allowed her to see so far?</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Glancing at her, he saw the need in her eyes\u2014not a sexual need or a physical hunger.</p><p>She needed to see more of him than he\u2019d allowed so far.</p><p>Intimacy. That connection that had the ability to bind two people together or tear them apart.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows I have a sister.\u201d He had to force himself to share with her something that even Timothy Cranston was unaware of.</p><p>\u201cYou hide your family.\u201d She nodded as though it made sense.</p><p>\u201cWell, my mother hid me from them first,\u201d he admitted with a flicker of amused remembrance. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want my father to know about me, didn\u2019t want me to be threatened by his career in covert intelligence or his enemies. Father knew about me, though. When I was old enough, he found me, and drew me in like he does so many others and gave me one task: Protect my sister.\u201d</p><p>He could laugh about it now; at the time, it hadn\u2019t been nearly so funny.</p><p>\u201cYou say that as though it were an impossible task,\u201d she observed curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou would have to know Mary Elizabeth to be amused,\u201d he said with a grunt. \u201cShe taught me a long time ago that you can\u2019t surround those you love in bubble wrap and expect it to work. First they burst the bubbles; then they find an escape route. Once they escape, they don\u2019t tell you where they\u2019re going or why.\u201d</p><p>Piper watched as that crooked little smile she loved touched his hard lips and gleamed in his dark blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to surround her in bubble wrap then?\u201d she asked. \u201cGuess you learned the hard way, huh? I wish you could teach Dawg and my cousins the fact that it simply isn\u2019t possible to lock us away until it\u2019s time to bury us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your job, sweetheart.\u201d He sighed as she watched him, her gaze meeting his for the second he glanced at her, yet feeling the effects of the amused heat in his eyes for that tiny moment in time.</p><p>\u201cHow is that my job?\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine teaching Dawg anything. The man gave stubborn a bad name.</p><p>\u201cMost sisters start when they\u2019re babies,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut you\u2019re on the right track. Live, laugh, have fun, and go head-to-head with him whenever you have to. But don\u2019t disappear on him again, Piper. Do it again, and next time I promise I\u2019ll help him find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think you can find me if Dawg can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Dawg doesn\u2019t want to admit you would actually leave the state without telling him,\u201d he pointed out as guilt flayed her once again. \u201cI don\u2019t have that problem. I saw you leave the inn when you snuck out. I heard the car stopping just down the road. I knew why you were doing it, though. I didn\u2019t follow; I didn\u2019t run a check on the car. I went back into my room and stared up at the ceiling the rest of the night, wondering who was the man you left with.\u201d</p><p>The man?</p><p>Piper almost smiled. She could hear the probing question he was doing nothing to hide.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a man,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt was the sister of a friend giving me a ride to the Louisville train station. I tried to cover my tracks so Dawg wouldn\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded once.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out so well.\u201d She sighed, completing the thought.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m going to assume the circumstances were unusual,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do I know?\u201d She still didn\u2019t understand why, who, or what. \u201cOne minute I\u2019m waiting on a bellhop and a ride to the train station, and the next second I\u2019m being pounded on, then waking in a hospital with a concussion and so many bruises that breathing hurts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was the faintest memory of a demand. A demand for what, she wasn\u2019t certain. It wasn\u2019t even a memory, not really. It was a confusing collage of something, amid a blast of pain, fear, and her own screams.</p><p>\u201cDid you remember the people next door who rushed in to help you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember the rescue at all.</p> <p>\u201cI remember meeting them at the hospital after I woke up.\u201d She answered him, wishing she could hold on to whatever it was her attacker had said in those chaotic moments. She had a feeling if she could just remember . . .</p><p>\u201cThey were good boys,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cA lot of young men would have waited, or been too wary of poking their noses in where they weren\u2019t wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they were wanted.\u201d She breathed out roughly.</p><p>God, what would she have done if they hadn\u2019t poked their noses in?</p><p>Watching the landscape roll by, Piper realized they were only miles from the inn now.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think Dawg will be there?\u201d</p><p>He was going to be so hurt, and she knew it. He wouldn\u2019t understand her need to breathe, to have done this alone, even though it hadn\u2019t been the chance she had believed it was.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you in New York, Piper?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered how long it would take him to get to the one question she knew he wanted to ask.</p><p>Forcing back tears of disappointment and humiliation, she let a bitter smile pull at her lips. \u201cI thought I was going to get an offer for a showing of some of my designs,\u201d she finally admitted.</p><p>\u201cThought you were?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201d Staring down at her hands, she wondered whether he would consider it no more than she had deserved for the childishness she had displayed in the deceptive way she left.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, baby?\u201d</p><p>The gentleness in his voice and the fact that he hadn\u2019t told Dawg when the hospital had called him had her raising her eyes as she shifted in her seat to look at him.</p><p>Thank God it was dark. The last thing she wanted was for him to see the tears she had to blink back.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this famous designer sponsor,\u201d she told him, clearing her throat to hide the hoarseness of the hurt she fought to hide. \u201cHe showcases several designers a year, helps them put on a show, and he\u2019s never had one who didn\u2019t become successful. I received a letter from him last week that he wanted to meet with me after seeing some of my designs that I sent in.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, showing he was listening as they moved ever closer to the inn.</p><p>\u201cI could have had the show and sponsorship if I\u2019d agreed to be his little sex toy until he got tired of me.\u201d</p><p>As though revealing that much opened a floodgate, Piper told him about Eldon Vessante, and the fact that his pants and his opinion of himself were overstuffed.</p> <p>His expression never changed; the tension in his body didn\u2019t visibly increase. None of the signs of vengeful anger that Dawg and her cousins were known to display were present.</p><p>\u201cTwo attacks in one day then.\u201d He breathed out heavily, the concern in his voice easing something inside her she hadn\u2019t known had been knotted with tension.</p><p>Piper nodded. \u201cFortunately, his butler or whoever he was, was there. Some guy named Broken or something. A hell of a name for a person. He kept Eldon from actually hitting me and helped me get away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think this Vessante guy was behind the attack at the hotel?\u201d</p><p>Piper shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what was said, but he wanted something.\u201d She wished she could remember, wished the harshly grated demand would come into focus within her memories. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what he said, Jed, or what he wanted, but it didn\u2019t have anything to do with Eldon Vessante.\u201d</p><p>Broecun.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>The security field was a close-knit one, especially for those agents of John Broecun\u2019s caliber. Jed knew Piper had taken the sound of the name literally, but Jed knew the other man, as well as the spelling of his name. And he knew if Broecun was with this Eldon Vessante, either the man was important to some very influential government types, or he was under investigation by them.</p><p>At least he had a place to start, and a face to shove his fist into. Eldon Vessante may not have been behind Piper\u2019s beating, but the only reason he hadn\u2019t been was because Broecun would have stopped him.</p><p>Broecun wouldn\u2019t stop Jed from teaching the other man how to treat a woman. And blackmailing Piper with her dream of a big-time fashion show and an exclusive sponsorship was something Jed would exact a little atonement for.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re home now.\u201d He pulled into the Mackay Inn\u2019s lot, parked the truck, then shut it off. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I can sneak you into the house and get you settled before Dawg gets his first report that you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>He sure as hell didn\u2019t need Dawg around right now, or Timothy Cranston. He\u2019d talk to them both in the morning instead. Dawg and his cousins were going to have to step back a pace or two, regardless of whether or not they liked it. If they wanted to know the trouble\u2014or potential trouble\u2014his sisters got into or were headed for, then the girls couldn\u2019t be afraid to let him know what they were doing.</p><p>Her fear of being smothered during what she believed was an important event had almost cost Piper her life; he wouldn\u2019t allow it to harm her more in the future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared for him, Jed,\u201d she whispered as he cut the engine, then turned back to her, confused.</p><p>\u201cScared for whom, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Dawg.\u201d He could see the tears in her eyes, the faint tremble of her lips in the dim light of the moon.</p><p>\u201cDawg and his cousins take care of themselves and one another just fine, Piper,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>She shook her head at his statement. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be very alone,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cHe\u2019s becoming out of control, Jed. He makes me frightened of him when he starts standing over us like guard dogs. He can\u2019t keep telling us what to do or how to live. I know Lyrica and Zoey, too. If he doesn\u2019t stop, I swear, we\u2019ll all end up leaving. We talk about it more and more often. He may well be headed for a stroke, but Lyrica, Zoey, and I are headed out of town if it keeps up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe worries, Piper.\u201d His hands clenched on the steering wheel in an instinctive protest at the thought of her leaving.</p><p>\u201cI would have been in your bed a year ago if he hadn\u2019t been watching us all like hawks. I\u2019m terrified to show any interest in a man, and God forbid I should actually consider taking a lover after the grief he gave Eve.\u201d The words were out of her mouth before she could hold them back.</p><p>A wave of heat flushed through her at the sudden, brilliant gleam of lust that lit his gaze.</p><p>He may not have tightened with the information she\u2019d given him about Eldon\u2019s attack, but the moment she mentioned being in his bed, his entire body seemed to jerk in abrupt interest.</p><p>Or perhaps \u201cinterest\u201d was far too tame a word. It was as though every thought, every emotion, every particle of his being was suddenly intently, greedily focused on her.</p><p>\u201cDid Dawg order you to stay away from me, Piper?\u201d he asked her calmly, but what she saw in his gaze was anything but calm.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cNo, but who I sleep with isn\u2019t up for debate, Jed. And I won\u2019t let it become a family point of interest that I\u2019m fighting my brother over the man I want for a lover because he disapproves of him as he did with Eve. It shouldn\u2019t be like that, and I can\u2019t stand the thought that Dawg would turn it into such a battle.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d nearly broken Eve\u2019s heart.</p><p>Her sister had finally told her of the fight she\u2019d had with Dawg when she had taken Brogan as her lover. Dawg had gone so far as to use the worst sort of emotional blackmail to keep her from giving in to the man she\u2019d been fascinated with for years.</p><p>Piper had been terrified he would try the same tactics with her. If he had tried such a guilt trip with her, she would have gone ballistic. Eve had had far more patience than Piper could have ever found in the same situation.</p><p>\u201cI was beginning to wonder if you even wanted to find yourself in my bed.\u201d He reached out, his palm cupping the uninjured side of her face.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you wouldn\u2019t have to seduce me now,\u201d she informed him tartly, despite the heat rushing through her body at his touch. \u201cI simply said I may have ended up there sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call that little tease a month ago being in my bed?\u201d He came closer, his gaze focused on her lips as Piper brushed her tongue over them, wishing her attacker had kept the back of his hand away from them.</p><p>\u201cYou call that a little tease?\u201d she whispered roughly. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to show you a real tease, Jedediah Booker, so you\u2019ll know the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd exactly what would you call a little tease, Piper?\u201d he asked, his lips moving close, oh, so close to hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing right now, maybe?\u201d</p><p>She could barely breathe.</p><p>Okay, she was sore, swollen, but her lips weren\u2019t really that swollen. Most of the blows had actually been against the side of her head, according to the doctor. Not that she remembered a whole lot after she had been slammed into the dresser, due to the concussion.</p><p>\u201cThis is a tease?\u201d His lips were only a whisper against hers.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jed,\u201d she sighed his name roughly. \u201cDon\u2019t tease this time.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t tease this time.</p><p>Jed stared down at her, seeing the shadow of bruises against one side of her face, the faint swelling of her eye and her lower lip.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Piper.\u201d He sighed, drawing back. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want you coming to me out of fear. When the bruises have healed, then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Before he could change his mind, Jed forced himself from the truck and strode to the passenger side of the pickup. Pulling her door open, he did as he had at the hospital: Rather than allowing her to walk to the inn, he simply scooped her from the seat and carried her to the front porch.</p><p>Turning from the front door, he was heading for the side of the house when a shadow detached itself from the corner and the front door opened.</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d Piper buried her head against his shoulder as he recognized the height and breadth of the shadow before he actually glimpsed the hard lines of the savagely hewn male features in the dim light of the moon.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least they\u2019re not trying to run,\u201d Natches drawled as he moved to Dawg\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I think I\u2019d rather he\u2019d run.\u201d Amusement filled Rowdy\u2019s voice as Jed let his gaze lock with Dawg\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s not the time, Dawg,\u201d he warned the other man. \u201cLet her rest first. Morning\u2019s soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Piper grunted against his shoulder. \u201cGood luck with that one,\u201d she muttered, her voice so low it barely reached his ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jed, good luck with that one.\u201d The low, slow cadence of Dawg\u2019s voice had the hairs at the back of Jed\u2019s neck lifting in warning.</p><p>Dawg was pissed, and he was suspicious. His gaze slid to Jed\u2019s hold on her slight body, narrowed and intent, his look taking in the protective hold and Piper\u2019s determination to hide her face.</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Booker,\u201d Dawg ordered, his voice dark and warning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Dawg.\u201d There was no weakness in Piper\u2019s voice as her head lifted quickly, her obvious sense of security with the darkness surrounding them apparent.</p><p>Jed could have told her the mistake she was making, if he had had a chance.</p><p>What he saw instead was Dawg\u2019s face.</p><p>The widening of his eyes, the paling of his flesh, the immediate awareness that one side of his sister\u2019s face wasn\u2019t shadow, but swollen and obviously bruised. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just as quickly, Piper saw the reaction as well, if her sharply indrawn breath and the tension invading her body was any indication.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The harsh order that left her lips as Dawg stepped forward surprisingly had him stopping in his tracks. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy and Natches were quick to move around them, their reactions no less as shocked as Dawg\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cNone of my business?\u201d Dawg all but wheezed, his expression tortured, as his cousins, positioned for a much better view, stared at her in horror as the sensors on the motion lights caught the movement and flipped on overhead.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Piper . . .\u201d Agonized, Dawg\u2019s voice roughed to a harsh, gut-clenching rasp.</p><p>Anguish filled the three men\u2019s gazes and tightened their expressions as they stared down at her, obviously fighting to process the bruised condition of her face.</p><p>As though in one movement, their heads jerked to Jed, their gazes piercing as they stared at him.</p><p>Hell, his face was likely to take the brunt of six fists pounding on it before the night was over, because he was damned if he could give them what he knew they were silently demanding.</p> <p>An explanation.</p><p>Now.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your sister,\u201d he told Dawg, his gaze connecting with the other man\u2019s, knowing he could make an enemy of him in this second. \u201cYou want answers, you\u2019ll have to get them from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me down.\u201d Piper struggled in his arms.</p><p>Put her down?

I\u2019ll be damned if I will.\u201d Tightening his hold on her, he moved forward, more than surprised as the Mackays parted and allowed him to pass.</p> <p>Pulling her keys from where he\u2019d tucked them into his jeans at the hospital, he called back to the three men following them, \u201cHer bags are in the truck, if you want to make yourselves useful and bring them in.\u201d</p><p>At least one set of footsteps paused behind them.</p><p>\u201cLike hell,\u201d Dawg growled. \u201cShe can have them later.\u201d</p><p>Jed shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI should have stayed where I was,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I stay where I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have found out,\u201d he warned her. \u201cWant me to tell you how many contacts Timothy has on the police force there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Dawg snapped behind him. \u201cI thought you were just the fucking chauffeur?\u201d</p><p>Holding her securely as he unlocked her door, Jed glimpsed her expression from the corner of his eye and restrained a sigh. She was shutting down fast. He could feel it, and he hated it. When Piper shut down, her rational and logic went out the fucking window, especially if she was dealing with her brother. She didn\u2019t do confrontations well, though he knew she would never admit to it. She buried her fear instead and faced the world with a brutal ice that sliced her deeper than it did those she was facing, once she had time to think and consider what she said during those moments.</p> <p>Stepping into her bedroom, he strode to the bed in the center of the small suite, laid her on it, then watched in resignation as she jumped from the mattress to face the three men entering the room behind them, the moment he placed her on it.</p><p>\u201cGo home, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>The lights flipped on, and for the first time Dawg had a full, unobstructed view of her face.</p><p>\u201cGod, Piper.\u201d It was Natches who breathed out the protest. \u201cSweetheart, what the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Dawg looked like he had taken a blow to the balls and was having trouble catching enough breath to even fold to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t the three of you have wives and children of your own to torment?\u201d She questioned them harshly as she tugged at the soft cotton material of the blouse she had worn home.</p><p>The light, neutral tone of the gray blouse did nothing to hide the damage done to her fragile face, or where it extended along her shoulder and into the scooped neckline of the garment.</p><p>It was one of her creations, he knew\u2014one she was exceptionally proud of. Unfortunately, the light color only emphasized the darkness of the bruises.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d Dawg grated, his voice harsh.</p><p>Piper drew herself up, the last hint of any emotion leaving her face.</p><p>\u201cI said leave.\u201d The demand in her voice was impossible to miss.</p><p>Just as arrogant, just as condescending as Dawg could be himself, she faced him with icy refusal, her gaze never flickering beneath the fury in his.</p><p>\u201cDawg, let her rest.\u201d Jed placed himself between them. \u201cOrdering her isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s fists clenched at his sides, the need to strike out, to take vengeance, clear in his expression and the tension in his large body.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of her room!\u201d Jed countered, determination hardening his voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to yell at her, and you\u2019re sure as hell not going to attempt to force answers from her. Just go home and see if you can\u2019t ask nicely next time.\u201d</p><p>Who was more surprised, he wondered, when the three Mackays did just as he ordered\u2014turned and left without another word\u2014himself or Piper?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d Piper muttered, suddenly aware that she could have pushed her brother right over an invisible line none of them had known existed. \u201cDawg never just leaves.\u201d</p><p>Jed turned back to her. \u201cI think you should have told him, baby. But we\u2019ll see what hardheadedness gets you first.\u201d</p><p>The smile he gave her was as chilly and polite as her tone was to her brother, but far more mocking.</p><p>She stood there staring back at him, the vulnerability he could see her fighting\u2014and the need and the hurt hiding behind the chilly facade\u2014breaking his heart.</p><p>He turned and left, just as the Mackays had. He had no other choice. Because as pissed as her brother and cousins were, she had no idea he was even more so.</p><p>She had left without him, faced danger without him, and been determined to handle it all on her own\u2014without him. And now, even knowing he would have to face the full force of the Mackay fallout, she wasn\u2019t volunteering enough information to her brother and cousins to even give him hope that Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches wouldn\u2019t try to kick his ass to hell and back.</p><p>And he still couldn\u2019t imagine betraying the trust she had placed in him. Even knowing the enemies he could make, the budding friendships that could be destroyed. The Mackays were strong friends to have, but they could be brutal enemies, too. But, Jed had realized the second he had walked into that fucking hospital room that nothing mattered more to him than being with Piper. Protecting her, touching her, having her.</p><p>Nothing else mattered.</p><p>No matter what.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Dawg stood next to the pickup, his wrists hanging over the edge, his head bowed, and he had no idea how to unknot the burning fist growing in his chest.</p><p>Where was Christa? God, why hadn\u2019t he brought Christa with him? She could have talked to Piper, could have made her understand that he had\u2014he had\u2014to make certain whoever hurt her never\u2014fucking never\u2014hurt her again.</p><p>He felt as though every breath he was trying to take was restricted.</p><p>\u201cFuck, hurts to breathe,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Rowdy was hoarse.</p><p>Natches wasn\u2019t speaking.</p><p>As he wiped his hand over his face, car lights sliced into the parking lot, drawing his gaze as he found himself staring at the little car he\u2019d bought Christa several months before.</p><p>As it pulled to a stop behind the truck, it wasn\u2019t just Christa who stepped from the car. Rowdy\u2019s wife, Kelly, and Natches\u2019s wife, Chaya, moved slowly toward them.</p><p>It was Natches who moved first.</p><p>Two steps and Natches was pulling Chaya into his arms, burying his face against her neck and holding on tight as Christa moved slowly to Dawg.</p><p>\u201cJed called,\u201d she told him. \u201cHe told us everyone was safe, but you might need us?\u201d</p><p>Her hand, so delicate and fragile, settled against his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Dawg?\u201d</p><p>His throat was so fucking tight. Hell, he hadn\u2019t felt like this since the night he learned Christa had lost their child so long ago. Like tears were burning in his gut and refused to be shed.</p><p>\u201cSomeone beat her.\u201d His voice was grating, so rough he barely recognized it as he turned to her and pulled her to his chest. \u201cChrista, someone beat her face and she won\u2019t let me help.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand it.</p><p>It was tearing him apart. His guts were being ripped straight out of him and he couldn\u2019t make it stop.</p><p>\u201cWho? Who, Dawg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Piper,\u201d he snarled, so furious with her, so broken inside he had no idea how to find all the pieces. \u201cPiper, Christa. She just fucking disappears, then comes back, her face swollen and bruised, and she won\u2019t let me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you offer to help, baby?\u201d she asked gently, her expression understanding, knowing. \u201cOr did you demand?\u201d</p><p>He had asked. Hadn\u2019t he?</p><p>\u201cYou demanded, didn\u2019t you, Dawg?\u201d she guessed. \u201cAll ready to charge ahead and exact vengeance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone hurt her.\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense that she wouldn\u2019t want vengeance.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dawg. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head fiercely. \u201cYou have to make her tell me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawg, you can\u2019t make Piper do anything.\u201d She sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s home; you know she\u2019s safe. Give her time to come to you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to piss her off,\u201d Chaya stated as Natches lifted his head from her shoulder and moved away several paces. \u201cShe\u2019s too strong to break down and cry, or let herself be treated like a child. You\u2019ve hassled her for a year; now it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t stay safe.\u201d He shook his head; it didn\u2019t make sense to him.</p><p>\u201cAnd here she\u2019s a Mackay. Go figure,\u201d Christa murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him.\u201d This time it was levelheaded, \u201cthink about it first\u201d Rowdy. \u201cWe\u2019ll find him, Dawg, and when we do, he won\u2019t be able to hit another woman.\u201d</p><p>Natches, Rowdy, Chaya, and Kelly moved to the truck Dawg had driven to the inn as Dawg moved to the car with his wife. For the first time, Christa noticed, she didn\u2019t have to fight over driving.</p><p>Dawg moved to the passenger seat as she slid under the wheel.</p><p>\u201cI need to go home.\u201d He breathed roughly. \u201cI need my girls.\u201d</p><p>Her and his daughter.</p><p>She held back the secret she\u2019d learned earlier. The news that their daughter would have a brother or sister. News that she feared would only make Dawg more protective, even as it made him more loving.</p><p>The drawback?</p><p>His feared inability to protect those he loved was breaking his heart, and that was breaking her heart. Because there was nothing she could do to ease his pain or to make those he loved, besides herself, understand the demons that tormented him.</p><p>Perhaps it was time she, Kelly, and Chaya had a talk with the stubborn and just as determined Mackay sisters.</p><p>ONE WEEK LATER</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Samson; I hope you enjoyed your breakfast?\u201d Piper met Guido Samson in the hall outside his room and gave him a warm smile.</p><p>The new lodger was a bit portly, his black hair thick, with a slight wave in the shortened length that was brushed back from his face to reveal a hint of gray at the temples. Dark, swarthy, just showing the lines of advancing age, he looked to be in his late fifties, though Piper bet he was in his early sixties.</p><p>He\u2019d been at the inn four days and was already making his presence known, mostly by pissing Tim off. It seemed Guido couldn\u2019t help but flirt outrageously with Mercedes Mackay.</p><p>\u201cAh, Miss Mackay.\u201d He stopped, holding his hand out to her.</p><p>As Piper extended hers he took it, raised it to his lips, and pressed a light kiss to it with charming ease before releasing it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd here is your young man.\u201d He looked over her shoulder, a broad smile pulling at his lips as Piper swore she could feel Jed coming up behind her.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mr. Samson.\u201d The deep, controlled drawl\u2014controlled hunger, anger, and determination\u2014sent a shiver racing down her spine.</p><p>That tone had only intensified over the past days, just as the gleam of determination in the navy blue gaze had only hardened and, at certain times, intensified.</p> <p>\u201cAh, Mr. Booker, good morning,\u201d Guido greeted him. \u201cI am out for a day of sightseeing. I believe my son, Rhylan, is arriving this evening and hopes to find the best spots for a few days of fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fishing here is excellent, Mr. Samson; I\u2019m certain your son will find plenty of excellent spots.\u201d Edging around Guido\u2019s portly frame, Jed curled his fingers around Piper\u2019s upper arm. \u201cExcuse us, please. Piper and I need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Guido murmured, amused. \u201cYoung people have many things to discuss privately.\u201d</p><p>His soft chuckle followed them up the hall as Jed led her to her room. Opening the room and stepping in, Piper quickly pulled her arm from his grip.</p><p>\u201cSince when do we have things to discuss?\u201d Piper asked roughly as the door closed behind them, very well aware of the fact that he let her go. She wasn\u2019t free because she wanted to be; she was free because he let her be.</p> <p>Crossing her arms beneath her breasts, she glared at him, wishing she could push back anger, guilt, or any of the other emotions tearing through her, as she could with her family.</p><p>She could stare back at Dawg and freeze any response to the knowledge that he was frightened for her, hurting for her, worried about her, or just plain pissed off at her.</p><p>Her sister Eve had always been so thankful to be accepted and loved by her brother and cousins that she would have done just about anything\u2014anything but deny the man she loved.</p><p>Lyrica, a year younger than Piper, had such a guilt complex that she worried constantly that she would never be good enough, act properly enough, or be strong enough to be part of the Somerset Mackays. God only knew what their youngest sister, Zoey, felt. She rarely talked about it, and if asked would just laugh and say she was where she belonged. But Piper had always felt there was so much more beneath that statement.</p><p>Of the four of them their eldest sister, Eve, had handled Dawg best. They all loved him, but each of them had different ways of dealing with him.</p><p>Him, or any other man.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the defenses Piper had built over the years didn\u2019t work with Jed.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Dawg yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Piper looked away and shrugged. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been around for a while.\u201d</p><p>Guilt was lashing at her now.</p><p>God, she remembered the look on his face when he\u2019d seen the bruises on hers. He looked as though someone had died. Or something inside him had died. She hadn\u2019t seen him since.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to him,\u201d she promised.</p><p>What the hell was it with Jed Booker?</p><p>He was just staring at her. There was no force, no guilt-inducing comments, just those dark, dark blue eyes watching her with that silent, deep curiosity.</p> <p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Jed asked.</p><p>It was a simple question. No mockery, no sarcasm, nothing offensive, but Piper could feel the guilt growing inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s like, Jed,\u201d she burst out, pushing her fingers through her hair in frustration as she turned and stomped to the other side of the room before turning back. \u201cThis is how he gets you. He knows how to work every damned one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he, Piper?\u201d he asked her quietly. \u201cOr is he just struggling with his inability to protect four girls he loves nearly as much as he does his own daughter? Four girls whose abandonment and hardships as children torment him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head fiercely. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFault doesn\u2019t matter, Piper,\u201d he said calmly, moving to her, making her all too aware of the sudden sensitivity of her body whenever he was around.</p><p>His voice was steady, every movement deliberate, but his eyes were like deep pools of sexual heat. His gaze licked over her as his hands curved against her bare shoulders. They slid down along her arms, then back up, the rasp of the calluses against her softer flesh so erotic she was forced to bite back a moan.</p><p>\u201cWhat does matter, Jed?\u201d she asked, unable to break her gaze from his. \u201cShould I give in to him as Eve tried to do, and refuse to end up in your bed? Should I promise not to live or have a life so Dawg can sleep at night?\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes at the thought. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve learned how I have to handle him by now? If I don\u2019t defy him, then I won\u2019t have a chance at having a life myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there are those times you could defy him and lose your life, Piper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he has to learn to talk to us.\u201d Frustrated anger hoarsened her voice as it tore through her emotions. \u201cWhy do we have to automatically give in and bury our heads against life or risk dying? Jed, I can\u2019t do that. If I\u2019m in danger then I have to know, and I have to know why. Just as you would.\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickered and she knew he understood that.</p><p>\u201cIf I go to Dawg, then he\u2019ll see it as a weakness; don\u2019t you understand that? I\u2019ll be giving in and he\u2019ll take full advantage of it. Not out of cruelty.\u201d She held her hand up to delay whatever argument she could see brewing in his expression. \u201cNot out of manipulation. That\u2019s his instinct,\u201d she argued. \u201cJust as it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>It was the way they were, the type of men they were. If Dawg didn\u2019t come to her first, seeking answers, then he wouldn\u2019t be in a frame of mind to discuss what had happened to her while she was away. He would dictate her security instead and try to lock her so far out of sight she would have a hard time finding herself, let alone anyone else finding her.</p><p>\u201cYou forget: I came for you.\u201d His head lowered as he voiced the reminder, his lips brushing against her ear and causing her eyes to close at the pleasure of the touch. \u201cNo questions, no demands. I came for you, Piper, and I\u2019m the one forced to field questions from your friends and family. If I have to take Rowdy or Natches Mackay\u2019s fist for you, because I keep refusing to answer their questions, then you are going to owe me. Big-time.\u201d</p><p>The words were a breath of warning against her neck as Piper felt her knees weaken.</p><p>Lifting her hands from where they hung at her sides, she tentatively gripped his upper arms, feeling the play of his biceps beneath her fingers.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t hit you.\u201d She knew her brother and her cousins. They were hard men, but they weren\u2019t unfair.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should have a taste now.\u201d His lips brushed against her jaw. \u201cShow me what I\u2019m going to take that punch for, Piper.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned; her lips parted.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed of his kiss since that first one six weeks before. Each day, each time he spoke to her, teased her, silently rebuked her, had built the need for it.</p><p>She needed his kiss.</p><p>She needed his touch.</p><p>Her lips accepted his, parted, and Piper found herself dragged into a chaotic storm of pure heat.</p><p>Pleasure raced across her flesh like ribbons of electric sensation. From her lips to the tip of her toes and back to the crown of her head, his lips against hers created a reaction she couldn\u2019t have expected.</p><p>She should have expected. She\u2019d felt it before. But how was she to know that the first time hadn\u2019t been just a fluke? She had never predicted the intensity of the pleasure to repeat itself or\u2014incredibly\u2014to begin building higher, stronger.</p><p>Faster.</p><p>Jed barely controlled the gut-deep groan of instant, overwhelming hunger.</p><p>Son of a bitch, it couldn\u2019t be this good. There was no way this unusual depth of pleasure was real.</p><p>He\u2019d convinced himself it had been a figment of his imagination, but as he lifted Piper against his chest and bore her to the bed, he knew the pleasure was doing just that.</p><p>It was burning brighter, hotter, and deeper than anything he\u2019d ever known.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t doing anything different. It wasn\u2019t that experience filled each tentative lick of her tongue against his or each heated brush of her body against his.</p><p>Piper was anything and everything but experienced, and he knew it. He\u2019d made it his job to know everything about her that a man could dig up.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t known the effect she\u2019d have on him.</p><p>A low moan slipped past his lips. Her knees were hugging his hips, the thin material of her panties beneath the ankle-length silky skirt she wore rubbing against the denim of his jeans as it covered the tormented length of his dick.</p><p>God, he was hard.</p><p>So hard he felt as though his cock were seconds away from becoming pure steel, throbbing furiously, his testicles drawn tight beneath it. He knew he wouldn\u2019t last long. Hell, he\u2019d be lucky if he got inside her before he embarrassed himself and spilled his release into his jeans.</p><p>Laying her back on the bed, Jed couldn\u2019t force himself to break from the kiss that seemed to be feeding the flaming lust burning between them.</p><p>Fuck, it was good.</p><p>She was good.</p><p>She was as sweet as sunrise and as hot as the Texas heat waves he remembered from his childhood.</p><p>Rolling his hips against hers, the hardened length of his cock pressing against the tender mound of her pussy, Jed worried at his lack of self-control.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t experienced. Hell, it would surprise the hell out of him if he learned she wasn\u2019t a virgin. But she had the power to strip him down to the core of who and what he was. A male animal. A sexually hungry, sexually determined, sexually intent male animal, and he couldn\u2019t seem to pull himself back.</p><p>That powerlessness was so alien to his character, to his very nature, that shock resounded to the depths of his senses.</p><p>Yet it wasn\u2019t enough to stop him.</p><p>One hand pushed beneath the loose, sleeveless top she wore. One of her own creations yet again: a soft white silk with a handkerchief hem that perfectly matched the hem of the skirt.</p><p>Tiny, tiny mother-of-pearl buttons held the material over her rapidly rising and falling breasts as his hand slid beneath the top, his palm cupping the underside of one breast perfectly.</p><p>The excuse for a bra was little more than silky lace, easily pushed aside by his fingers as his thumb searched out the hardened little point of her nipple.</p><p>It was swollen tight and hard, and the caress he gave it had Piper arching to him, a muted cry falling from her lips as pleasure arced between them like a live electrical connection.</p><p>With his free hand Jed struggled to undress her. The tiny buttons were instruments of torture as his fingers fumbled and slipped on them. It seemed to take forever, but finally he released the captive tip of her nipple to lift her to him and push the blouse from her shoulders.</p><p>Reaching behind his neck, he gripped her wrists, pulling them free of the hold she had on him and dragging them down to allow him to remove the blouse and lacy bra.</p><p>Hard, sipping kisses kept them connected as he hurried to undress first Piper\u2019s lush, heated body, then his own harder, fiercer one.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t have her, if he didn\u2019t sink his cock inside her soon, then he was going to die of the hunger clawing inside him.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking pretty,\u201d he growled against her lips as he finally had her naked beneath him, had himself naked and ready to take her.</p><p>But the silken peaches-and-cream flesh distracted him.</p><p>He meant to spread her thighs and sink inside her while he still had the control to take her slow and easy.</p><p>He made the mistake of lifting himself from her, releasing her lips to rise above her, his gaze lowering to the full, tempting globes of her breasts.</p><p>Tiny hardened cherry red nipples topped the firm flesh, and the temptation to taste them was too much to resist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he groaned. \u201cGod help us both, Piper; I\u2019m dying for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The need to taste her had his mouth watering, the hunger obliterating everything else. His head lowered, lips parting, and when he captured one tight, swollen peak, he swore he could feel her losing control along with him.</p><p>Piper jerked at the sudden suction of his mouth against the overly sensitive tip of her breast. The sensation was so sharp, so brutally erotic that her hands rose quickly to his shoulders, her nails biting against his flesh.</p><p>She had to hold on.</p><p>Oh, God, it was so good.</p><p>She whipped her head against the comforter beneath her, her hips lifting against him, feeling the brush of the heavy width of his cock against her thighs\u2014there were so many sensations. So much pleasure.</p><p>The tugging of his mouth around the tender bud of her breast was an agonizing pleasure. One hand cupped the curve of her flesh as the other moved slowly down her waist to the rounded curve of her thigh.</p><p>\u201cPart your legs,\u201d he ordered hoarsely as his lips moved to the opposite peak. \u201cAh, God, let me in, baby. Let me have you.\u201d</p><p>She was really going to do this, wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>There was no turning back; she could feel it.</p><p>After years of wondering why she\u2019d been unable to take a lover, the mystery was now solved.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t taken one because she\u2019d needed Jed. She\u2019d waited for him, ached for him\u2014somehow she\u2019d known he was out there; she\u2019d known he\u2019d come for her.</p><p>Her legs parted, urged by the powerful fingers at her thighs as his lips lowered and covered the other hardened tip of her nipple. Suckling it, he lapped at it with his tongue, then rasped it with his teeth.</p><p>Piper felt as though she were being devoured.</p><p>That thought was amended as his lips began a path down her torso. Hungry kisses, tasting licks set fire to her senses. Caresses stroked pure exquisite pleasure to her nerve endings and had her waiting in painful anticipation as he moved ever closer to her trembling thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want, baby.\u201d He groaned as he found her belly button and felt her tremble in response. \u201cI want all those sweet juices gathering at your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught and held in her chest as his lips moved farther, kissed, stroked, licked.</p><p>A breath of air brushed over the bare flesh of her pussy, the dew-slick folds sensitizing further at the thought of the coming caress.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but watch.</p><p>His gaze caught hers for long, erotic moments before his eyes dropped, drawing her eyes to the swollen folds.</p><p>His lips parting, Jed\u2019s head lowered, his tongue reaching out for her, then burying in the slick, swollen flesh of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Jed.\u201d Her hands slid into his hair, gripped and held on tight as her upper body jerked upward in response.</p><p>Spreading her knees farther, Piper dug her feet into the bed and lifted her hips, pressing closer, muted, hoarse cries leaving her throat as his tongue began a sensual, delicious dance in the plump, slick flesh he\u2019d found.</p> <p>He pushed his hands beneath her hips to lift her closer, and Piper lost the strength to hold her shoulders and head from the bed. Falling back, she strained against the pleasure, eyes closed, reaching for the brilliance of the supernova of fiery heat she could feel building in her pussy.</p><p>Wicked and erotic, his tongue lapped at the juices spilling from her vagina before easing up, licking and stroking, pushing her further, deeper into the maelstrom gathering inside her. Rasping, probing, the devilish instrument of torturous ecstasy began licking around her straining clit, testing the swollen tenderness, inciting it to a desperate ache that had her crying out for release.</p><p>When his lips covered the distended little bundle of nerves, Piper felt the shock of it explode through her system. Shuddering, her hips jerking against his hold, against the sucking heat, she felt her senses begin dissolving in a release of such pure ecstasy that she swore she could feel herself flying.</p><p>Drawn tight, arching to him, racked by primal internal shudders of a climax that shocked her to her woman\u2019s core, she fought to cry, to scream out the pleasure, only to find enough air to give a low, ragged moan.</p><p>And still it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>For all the strength and power of the climax gripping her, still, that building ache in her pussy drove her to reach for more. To beg for more.</p><p>Her eyes jerked open as he pulled himself to his knees.</p><p>Eyes wide, Piper\u2019s gaze focused on the thick, engorged crest of his cock. He quickly pulled the condom from the side table, tore it open, then rolled the protective sheath over himself, before he came over her once again.</p><p>\u201cJed . . . ?\u201d She could feel the trepidation building inside her.</p><p>\u201cI have you, Piper.\u201d She was only barely aware of the words whispered at her ear as he buried his lips in her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby; I have you.\u201d</p><p>Everything inside her stilled then.</p><p>The feel of the hard, thickened crest of his penis pressing into the quivering entrance of her vagina held her poised on a rack of desperate need and building fear.</p><p>\u201cJed. Jed, I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d A groan tore through her as the throbbing width of his cock breached the clenched opening of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart.\u201d His head lifted. \u201cLook at me, Piper. Let me see you.\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes open, watching his eyes as he stared down at her, the blue so dark it now appeared black.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me.\u201d He groaned as her hands clenched in the comforter. \u201cHold on to me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Lifting her hands, she gripped his upper arms, stared into his eyes, and felt him advance further before pulling back.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d The protest was instinctive.</p><p>\u201cShhh, I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he promised, his lips lowering to hers. \u201cJust hold on to me. Just for a second.\u201d</p><p>The muscles of his hips bunched, the head of his cock throbbed inside her, and a second later a hard, heavy thrust had the iron-hard length powering through the shield of an innocence she knew she\u2019d saved for him.</p><p>His lips caught her cry at the shock of the entrance.</p><p>Holding the kiss, he pulled back, then pushed inside again, burying deeper as pleasure and pain began to build with equal intensity.</p><p>Lifting her legs to get closer to each heavy thrust, Piper gave herself to him, knowing that from this moment on, she no longer completely belonged to herself.</p><p>Each hard thrust inside the clenched depths of her pussy pushed inside her with increasing strength, faster, to an edge of a fiery abyss she was both terrified of and reaching for.</p><p>Pleasure radiated through her body, stoked by each piercing impalement of his cock inside her, stretching her, burning the sensitive depths with the heavy heat of his possession.</p><p>Moving over her, stroking inside her with quick, deep thrusts of the steel-hard, heated flesh, Jed pushed her harder, faster. Her hands clenched on his arms as the flared crest parted her flesh and drove to the depths of her before quickly retreating, then stroking over flesh so sensitive that the pleasure was agonizing with each stroke.</p><p>Each thrust was harder, faster. Each was hotter, more demanding, until that abyss reached out for her, the flames exploding around her and tearing through her senses with such blinding ecstasy that she knew she would never be the same.</p><p>Harsh, quaking shudders of sensation attacked her body. Unprepared for their strength, for the sheer destruction of her senses, Piper could only do as he\u2019d told her: She held on tight.</p><p>She gasped, crying out his name as her body clenched and shuddered beneath him, her pussy tightening around his shuttling cock until he thrust in hard and deep and gave himself to his own pleasure.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t imagined it could be like this. She\u2019d never conceived of such pleasure, of such deep, overwhelming waves of pure ecstasy streaking through her, possessing her.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t have believed that in one moment of rapture her soul would open and her heart would give itself totally, completely, to a man as fierce, as hard, and yet as gentle as Jedediah Booker.</p><p>NINE</p><p>Eve had told her that once Brogan had touched her, once she had learned what real pleasure, real intimacy were, then she\u2019d been caught.</p><p>Hook, line, and sinker, sister. Eve had grinned unrepentantly the day Piper had berated her for moving from the inn and leaving her, Lyrica, and Zoey\u2014well, mostly her and Lyrica\u2014to face the fallout.</p><p>The fallout being Tim, Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches becoming so damned protective that Piper, Lyrica, and even Zoey\u2014the most spoiled of the sisters\u2014were feeling the bite of the males\u2019 overprotectiveness.</p><p>Lying in Jed\u2019s arms that afternoon, Piper wondered what she was getting herself into this time, and just how it would affect not just her, but also her unattached sisters.</p><p>\u201cStop thinkin\u2019,\u201d Jed drawled, and for just a second there was a hint of the Texas upbringing he\u2019d once told her he\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like a cowboy.\u201d Turning against his chest, she propped herself up and stared at him from where she lay against his shoulder.</p><p>Jed grunted lazily. \u201cYeah, it creeps out now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve actually heard it,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI was starting to wonder if you\u2019d lied to me about being born in Texas.\u201d</p><p>That Texas drawl was unmistakable. And she\u2019d never heard it pass his lips.</p><p>So why now?</p><p>She was almost glowing at the possibility that perhaps sexual satisfaction and male contentment had managed to relax him enough that he\u2019d lost a moment\u2019s control over something it seemed he\u2019d deliberately suppressed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie to you.\u201d The simple statement had her stomach tightening in a feeling akin to, but not exactly, the panic attacks of the past.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t panic. It was terrified anticipation, petrified hope. It was something it shouldn\u2019t be; that was for damned sure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never lied to me?\u201d Forcing the disbelief into her voice wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>It was almost impossible simply because she wanted so desperately to believe him. Wanted to believe him, and she was too scared to allow herself to do so.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lied to you, Piper. And I never will.\u201d</p><p>Was he lying to her? He had to be lying to her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t questions I can\u2019t answer. If I can make the commitment not to deceive you, then I expect you to make one not to ask the questions you know would be off-limits.\u201d</p><p>Could she ask for more than that?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether she could, or whether she should, but she knew she had to.</p><p>Sitting up, she tucked the sheet around her breasts and stared down at him silently for long moments. With one forearm lifted and tucked beneath his head, his dark navy blue eyes so intent and serious, with long strands of dark blond, gold, and tawny hair falling over his forehead, he resembled the men he employed on the construction job that she knew he used as a cover. Rugged and hard, lean and naturally muscled.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to know what questions are off-limits?\u201d Tilting her head to the side, she watched him curiously now, wondering whether this was how Eve and Brogan made their relationship work. Did they have an understanding that there were parts of his life and what he did that she couldn\u2019t question?</p><p>Could she live with that? Really?</p><p>She loved Jed. She\u2019d known that for a while now.</p><p>But did she love him enough to abide by such a rule?</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll know which questions those are.\u201d His gaze dropped to her breasts as they rose over the edge of the sheet.</p><p>\u201cI think that if those are the rules, Jed, then I have to know who and what you are. If that information is off-limits, then you may as well climb that cute ass right out of my bed before one of us gets pissed off.\u201d</p><p>God help him, but he loved her.</p><p>Jed stared up at Piper Mackay and knew she owned parts of his heart and soul that he hadn\u2019t even known existed. There was no denying that they belonged to her, either, because as he watched her, he knew he\u2019d trust her with every secret he had inside his soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d trust her with them, but he\u2019d never tell her some secrets. The secrets that were far too dangerous to her safety should she know them.</p><p>Because he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that to save her, he\u2019d betray each and every one of those secrets, and he knew she\u2019d do the same for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an agent for the United States Federal Protective Service,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe\u2019re tasked with protecting and investigating any threats to the possessions of the United States government and, in some instances, government employees. You knew I was an agent.\u201d She nodded her head slowly. \u201cWhat did Eve tell you happened last summer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat several former members of the Freedom League believed Dawg had something Chandler Mackay had stolen years ago, and they kidnapped her to attempt to make him turn it over.\u201d</p><p>Jed nodded. That was the story they had come up with, not that the majority of it wasn\u2019t true. It was. It just wasn\u2019t the full explanation; neither did it include Eve\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s part in the situation, or Jed\u2019s and Elijah\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThose members were stealing confidential files from military and government offices to locate a cache of gold Chandler hid years ago. They believed Dawg would know where it was stashed.\u201d</p><p>Dawg probably did know where it was stashed, Piper thought. Hell, he probably had it hidden himself once he found it.</p><p>She knew he\u2019d taken to keeping the things Chandler had stashed away as he found them, out of pure spitefulness toward the government, once he\u2019d learned how Piper, her mother, and her sisters were treated after Homeland Security had found them.</p> <p>\u201cI guess telling me the truth means you intend to stick around for a while?\u201d she asked, trying to hold on to the charade she\u2019d played since meeting him.</p><p>That unspoken lie that what he did or where he went wouldn\u2019t matter to her.</p><p>Uncurling his arm from beneath his head, he slid his hand behind her neck and pulled her to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Piper?\u201d he growled against her lips. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a chance in hell that I\u2019ll ever let you go now?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to answer him. The teasing brush of his lips turned serious, burned through any objections she might have, and left her too hungry, her body too heated to deny him.</p><p>Possessiveness rang in his tone, gleamed in the midnight blue of his eyes, and filled the power and dominant strength of his kiss.</p> <p>Did she think he would let her go now?</p><p>Not for a while, perhaps.</p><p>Not until the hunger began to dim. Not until the flame of lust began to cool. And wasn\u2019t that the way of it?</p><p>The questions, the uncertainties and insecurities of the emotions raging through her became suppressed by a pleasure she couldn\u2019t deny.</p><p>A pleasure she didn\u2019t want to deny.</p><p>His lips rubbed against hers, his tongue licking at hers, tasting her and allowing her to taste him in turn.</p><p>The wild, erotic flavor of his kiss was one she was certain she would never be fully prepared for. The heat and wonder, the incredible pleasure and full, chaotic sensory overload were unlike anything she had ever known before his touch.</p><p>She\u2019d waited for this since she\u2019d first realized how sensual a male\u2019s touch could be, or how pleasurable a kiss could be. She\u2019d waited for this kiss.</p> <p>She\u2019d waited for Jed.</p><p>Easing back, Jed slid kisses from her lips to her jaw as his arms wrapped around her, pulling her closer to his aroused body.</p><p>Heat surrounded her. Flames licked over her nerve endings and pierced her pussy with a force that had the tender muscles clenching violently.</p><p>The feel of her juices easing along the sensitive portal, and the fierce ache in her clit as it built rapidly, pulled a low, desperate moan from her lips.</p><p>She needed him. She ached for him.</p><p>Smoothing her hands along his shoulders to the heavy strength of his biceps, Piper held on tight as she felt herself being lowered to her back. Anticipation began to build, along with pleasure and the driving need for more.</p><p>Always for more.</p><p>Surely the day would come when the instantaneous need for his possession would ease. When he would touch her and she would at least have a moment to think, to consider, before her hunger for him overrode any other consideration.</p><p>At the moment, she couldn\u2019t imagine it happening, though.</p><p>His lips slid along her neck, and she felt the rasp of his beard, the feel of his hand stroking against her stomach, moving higher, cupping her breast. Each sensation built in pleasure and in heat until Piper was moaning beneath him, her hips lifting, pressing the mound of her pussy against the hard muscle of his thigh as he came over her.</p><p>\u201cI get drunk on you, Piper,\u201d he muttered against her breast, his lips brushing against the tight, sensitive peak of her breast a second before his tongue rasped over it with erotic hunger.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jed,\u201d she whispered, desperate. \u201cDon\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>She wanted him now. Foreplay could come later.</p><p>He moved closer, his legs parting hers as his head lifted from her breast.</p><p>Piper forced her eyes open.</p><p>She wanted to watch, wanted to see him take her.</p><p>She was on the verge of begging when the world suddenly upended.</p><p>One second she was lying beneath Jed, anticipation tearing through her senses.</p><p>In the next second it felt as though she were flying through the air before she landed against Jed\u2019s hard body, only to be rolled quickly to the floor.</p><p>Everything happened so fast. Too fast.</p><p>Wide-eyed, shocked, she let her gaze follow his hand as he reached beneath her bed, jerked out a lethal black handgun, then leveled it over the top of the bed with steely-eyed intent.</p><p>As she rolled to her stomach to push herself from the floor, she heard the lazy, less-than-amused drawl.</p><p>\u201cJed, do you have a fucking death wish?\u201d</p><p>Dawg didn\u2019t sound pissed, but he didn\u2019t sound approving either. It was a dangerous tone of voice that assured all those listening that his mood could swing either way.</p><p>He was ready to talk, and in true \u201cDawg\u201d style, he was barging right in.</p><p>Lips tightening, Piper jerked the sheet Jed had dragged off the bed as they rolled, and wrapped it quickly around her naked body. Peeking over the side of the bed, she growled back at her brother.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you sneaking into my bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s brow lifted. \u201cLittle sister, I wasn\u2019t sneaking. Your door was unlocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it was.\u201d Struggling with the sheet with one hand to keep it around her, Piper used the other to push her hair back from her face as she glared at Dawg.</p><p>She was all too aware of Jed moving to his feet, completely at ease with his nudity and not the least bit ashamed as he collected his clothes. Dawg\u2019s expression tightened, his mood shifting toward that dangerous mark.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me a liar, Piper,\u201d Dawg warned her then. \u201cI said the door was unlocked. Trust me; it was unlocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked that door earlier, Dawg,\u201d she told him, suddenly aware that something simply wasn\u2019t right where his entrance was concerned. \u201cI remember securing it. And neither Jed nor myself has gone out of it since.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly quiet when I pulled in and called out to Mercedes to tell her I was coming around to your room.\u201d His gaze swung to Jed as he laid his shirt across the table before securing the belt on his jeans. \u201cI guess there\u2019s not a chance in hell you heard anything?\u201d</p><p>Jed cleared his throat. As he glanced at her, Piper felt her face flushing heatedly.</p><p>She knew exactly why they hadn\u2019t heard anything.</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d Dawg grunted, drawing Piper\u2019s attention back to him. \u201cYou\u2019re certain the door was locked?\u201d</p><p>Tipping her head to the side, she stared back at him with mocking disbelief. \u201cReally, Dawg?\u201d</p><p>They both knew she was certain. Piper was the one often found checking all the doors and windows in the middle of the night, to be certain no one could slip into the suite.</p><p>Lifting his hand, he pushed his fingers through his hair in agitation before staring back at her, his celadon gaze filled with concern. \u201cPiper, please God, tell me what\u2019s going on before someone does more than bruise your face.\u201d</p><p>She knew that door had been locked, which meant someone had unlocked it at a time when they would have believed she was otherwise occupied.</p><p>They were there looking for something.</p><p>She just had no idea who or what they were searching for.</p><p>TEN</p><p>Staring into her brother\u2019s face and seeing the fear and worry for her reflected in his gaze, Piper was forced to admit that her suspicions regarding the attack couldn\u2019t be ignored any longer. There wasn\u2019t so much as a sliver of a chance that the attack in New York had been random, and she knew it.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been an accident that her room was the one a burglar had targeted. She hadn\u2019t been randomly picked out of a crowd and then followed to her room. She wasn\u2019t just a faceless nobody someone had decided to torment.</p><p>And the nightmares . . .</p><p>Those vague, shadowy horrorscapes she drifted into once she fell asleep couldn\u2019t be ignored either. Just as the unlocked door couldn\u2019t be overlooked. Someone was desperate enough to get to her that they had picked the lock on her patio doors in broad daylight.</p><p>Breaking contact with Dawg\u2019s fierce look, she glanced at Jed, and knew he had reached the end of his patience as well. If she didn\u2019t tell her brother now, then he would.</p><p>\u201cAs you know, I slipped out of town last week.\u201d She sighed in resignation as she stared back at her brother once again. \u201cA friend drove me to Louisville, where I caught a train to New York City to meet with someone interested in my designs. I was getting ready to leave to come home when I asked the front desk to send up a bellhop to help with my luggage. I had bought lots of materials at the fabric stores.\u201d She waved her hand toward her worktable. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the bellhop who arrived. When I opened the door, I got a faceful of fist, and if it hadn\u2019t been for the kids in the adjoining room, the damage would have been much worse.\u201d</p><p>Dawg sat down slowly in the chair beside him before wiping his hands carefully over his face.</p><p>\u201cI need to get dressed.\u201d She breathed out roughly. \u201cYou can question me when I get back.\u201d</p><p>Gathering her clothes, she strode quickly to the bathroom and snapped the door closed behind her before leaning against it and dragging in a ragged, fear-filled breath.</p><p>She knew she had locked that door.</p><p>She remembered locking it, just as she remembered Jed checking those locks when he\u2019d risen from the bed after they had caught their breath.</p><p>What if she had been alone and Dawg hadn\u2019t shown up?</p><p>What if she had been attacked again? Or one of her sisters, or her mother?</p><p>God, what had she managed to draw back to Somerset and her family?</p><p>Dawg stared at the closed bathroom door before turning his gaze on Jed.</p><p>The other man was playing with one of the little glass gems Piper was so fond of. She\u2019d bought a shitload of stuff, evidently, while she had been in Manhattan. Enough that she\u2019d not wanted to carry it all herself to the cab.</p><p>She had instead opened her door to some bastard pretending to be a bellhop.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know, Jed?\u201d he finally questioned the other man.</p><p>Listening to Jed\u2019s account of the night the kid had called him, and his arrival at the hospital, Dawg had to admit that his gratitude toward the other man was overwhelming.</p><p>There was no doubt in his mind that Piper would not have called him or one of their cousins. She was so wary of their protective tendencies, and so certain, according to Jed, that the attack had been random, that she would have never watched her back.</p><p>Fortunately, Jed had been watching it for her.</p><p>\u201cDid you suspect she would be followed?\u201d Dawg asked when he finished.</p><p>\u201cIf I had suspected it, she would have called you long before now,\u201d Jed informed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jed turned his head as the bathroom door opened and Piper walked slowly from the room.</p><p>It was then that Dawg saw the expression that transformed Jed\u2019s face.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d hoped it hadn\u2019t gone that far.</p> <p>No, he\u2019d known it had gone that far, he amended as he watched Piper\u2019s gaze meet her lover\u2019s and saw the unconscious devotion that filled her face and eyes as well.</p><p>Those two were already so fucking bonded that he doubted even death would separate them. And he was certain neither of them was even fully aware of how deep it went.</p><p>Jed straightened as Piper moved from the bathroom. Intending to reach out for her, he was more than a little surprised when she moved to him instead.</p><p>Snagging his arm around her waist and pulling her to him, Jed ignored Dawg\u2019s dark expression and instead gave Piper the silent security he knew she was reaching out for.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember anything the attacker said? Anything he did? Any odd scents, or an accent?\u201d Dawg asked her as Jed felt the subtle tremor that raced up her spine.</p> <p>\u201cHe said something.\u201d</p><p>Jed tightened at the admission but didn\u2019t berate her. It was the wrong time to do so, with Dawg standing there watching so closely.</p><p>It would hurt her to be embarrassed in such a way in front of her brother. And it would embarrass her, at the very least subconsciously.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Dawg urged as he pulled his cell phone free and, Jed suspected, hit the record feature.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it; I don\u2019t remember what he said.\u201d Frustration filled her voice, thickened it and hinted at her inability to make sense of whatever she remembered. \u201cHe was demanding something, and I didn\u2019t know what the hell he was talking about.\u201d</p><p>Jed rubbed her lower arms gently, forcing himself to hold back the fury burning in his chest.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remember a single word?\u201d Dawg questioned her again, his tone smoother than it had been moments ago, less angry, as though he too sensed the effect their anger had on her.</p><p>\u201cSomething about a car.\u201d She sighed, shaking her head as another tremor raced up her spine. \u201cI just can\u2019t remember, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few contacts in the city,\u201d Dawg murmured. \u201cAnd a few spread out through the police department. I\u2019ll make some calls and see what I can find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dawg.\u201d Guilt was lashing at Piper\u2019s senses now.</p><p>Dawg was doing everything he could not to explode, to hide his anger.</p><p>Those bright celadon eyes seemed darker than normal, his expression almost haggard, and she realized the past week had been just as hard on him, perhaps, as it had been on her.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he asked then.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have reacted as I did when you saw my face. I was terrified you\u2019d try to lock me away somewhere, though. You don\u2019t know how scary you get when you\u2019re in protection mode.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s still a possibility.\u201d He grunted as he leaned back in the chair and crossed his arms over his broad chest.</p><p>The black T-shirt he wore stretched across his powerful biceps created an impression of vast strength. \u201cThe nightmares have been brutal, Piper.\u201d</p><p>And they had been, she knew. The Mackay wives, Christa, Kelly, and Chaya, had arrived the day before and, along with her sisters and mother, berated Piper for refusing to tell any of them what happened.</p><p>Christa had told her that Dawg had been awakening from nightmares ever since, certain that Piper was in grave danger, and he had no idea how to protect her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Dawg.\u201d What more could she say? \u201cYou, Rowdy, and Natches saved us. But you\u2019ve also smothered us this last year. Smothered us to the point that there\u2019s no privacy at all. And I just couldn\u2019t handle it any longer.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, his arms dropping from his chest and resting against his knees as he clasped his hands between them.</p><p>\u201cPiper, if I ever end up having to bury one of you because I faltered or because I didn\u2019t know one of you was in danger, I don\u2019t know if I would survive the guilt. You\u2019re a Mackay. Your sisters are Mackays. Trouble and danger will always follow the four of you because of the covert jobs you hold. Unless . . .\u201d He gave Jed a long, hard look. \u201cUnless there\u2019s someone strong enough, someone dangerous enough, to deflect it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Jed was strong enough. And he was dangerous enough. . . .</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should teach us properly how to protect ourselves, Dawg. I\u2019m certain you and Jed would like to sleep sometime. And I do like going to the ladies\u2019 room without some hulking male standing outside the stall.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a tight, hard smile as irritation flashed in his expression, and Jed\u2019s arms tightened around her.</p><p>Dawg could only shake his head. \u201cGod, and here I thought you were the least stubborn sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the quietest one,\u201d she amended the thought. \u201cTrust me, Dawg: No matter the impression Eve gave you, neither Lyrica, Zoey, nor myself are willing to live like fugitives or witness protection candidates. You\u2019re going to have to come up with a solution other than some strong, forceful caveman to keep us from attracting trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d He grunted, rising to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to get out of here and make a few phone calls, catch up with Natches and Rowdy, and see what we can figure out.\u201d His gaze sliced to Jed\u2019s. \u201cMake sure she\u2019s either not in this room, or that her locks are secured against anyone determined to get in.\u201d</p><p>She felt Jed shift behind her and glanced back.</p><p>He was staring at her worktable again, only this time, as he released her, his fingers went to the dark green glass jewels scattered amid the red and clear cut crystals.</p><p>\u201cThose will be so pretty on the dress I\u2019m designing.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>He rolled several in amid another batch whose color didn\u2019t seem as deep or rich.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get them?\u201d He picked a few up before moving across the room and handing them to Dawg.</p><p>Piper watched them curiously.</p><p>\u201cA craft shop in New York, in the Garment District.\u201d She shrugged, catching Dawg\u2019s eye. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken me there before.\u201d</p><p>Dawg rose slowly to his feet, his gaze on the pieces of colored glass.</p><p>Closing his hand quickly around the stones he held, he flipped the cell phone open again and made a call.</p><p>\u201cI need you down here in Piper\u2019s room, ASAP. And if you have a jeweler\u2019s loupe or a strong magnifying glass, bring it with you,\u201d he ordered\u2014Tim, Piper assumed.</p><p>She rather doubted he was ordering one of her sisters or her mother down here.</p><p>Flipping the phone closed, he moved to the table next to her bed and flipped on the light.</p><p>Holding his hand beneath the brightest area of the lamp\u2019s glow, he turned the stones with a finger, studying them carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Piper whispered as trepidation began to rise inside her.</p><p>The panicked feeling that tightened her stomach shortened her breath and left her with the sensation of being unable to fill her lungs.</p><p>\u201cPiper.\u201d Dawg lifted his gaze as Timothy rushed into the room, magnifying glass in hand. \u201cThese aren\u2019t glass.\u201d Lifting his gaze to Timothy Cranston, he motioned him over. \u201cTell me what these are.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the stones in Timothy\u2019s hand, Dawg stared down at him with a dark glower.</p><p>Holding his hand beneath the light, Timothy moved the magnifying glass over his hand and studied the colored objects with a frown.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get these?\u201d he asked Dawg, never taking his eyes from his palm.</p><p>\u201cPiper brought them home from New York.\u201d The growl in Dawg\u2019s tone was a dangerous rasp. \u201cShe says she picked them up at a craft store.\u201d</p><p>Timothy didn\u2019t bother to lift his head or his gaze from the magnifying glass.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t get these at a craft store,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhere else did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d she questioned him warily.</p><p>\u201cEmeralds, rubies, diamonds, and sapphires, Piper. These aren\u2019t pretty crystals and colored glass, sweetheart. Now, tell me where else you went.\u201d</p><p>Piper shook her head, swallowing tightly.</p><p>Diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and sapphires?</p><p>God, no wonder she\u2019d thought they looked so much more brilliant after she got them home than they had when she first picked them out at the craft store.</p><p>\u201cI rented a car and drove outside the city for a meeting, but I never had that shopping bag out of the car. When I returned the car, everything had fallen out of the bag to the floor, and the stones I bought were scattered on the back driver\u2019s-side floorboard.\u201d</p><p>Timothy jerked his head around to glare at her then.</p><p>\u201cA rental car?\u201d he questioned her, his tone icy.</p><p>Piper nodded slowly. \u201cIt was a rental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the name of the agency?\u201d Tim asked.</p><p>\u201cRiley\u2019s Rentals.\u201d</p><p>Tim nodded slowly before lifting his gaze to Dawg\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s Genoa property.\u201d</p><p>Genoa property.</p><p>Piper had heard of the Genoa family and the Mackays\u2019 run-in with them six years ago, just before Piper and her family were brought to Somerset.</p><p>The crime family had first butted heads with the Mackays when a family member, the niece of head of the family Rudy Genoa, had come for vengeance against John Walker Jr. and his lover, Sierra Lucas, for a broken engagement.</p><p>Marlena and her associate, Gerard Andrews, had been responsible for the half million dollars Rudy Genoa had advanced them to ensure Marlena caught John Walker\u2019s attention and kept it.</p><p>Expensive clothes, salons, and an apartment on Park Avenue. She\u2019d been plucked, polished, and perfected\u2014until the night John had learned she was also fucking his friend and fellow attorney, Gerard Andrews. The same man who had assured the Genoa family that if John married Marlena and had a child with her, then the attorney would willingly put his name behind the defense of Genoa family members in court.</p><p>\u201cHow did they get in my car?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe Genoa family\u2019s rumored to be bringing jewels, gold, and cash into the States for another family\u2014a Russian crime family they\u2019re trying to build ties with. The Russians are shipping the contraband into Italy, where the Genoa family has ties, and then members of the family are taking over. Homeland Security and the FBI have been trying to figure out exactly how they\u2019ve been doing it. If Riley\u2019s Rentals is involved, then they\u2019re likely shipping them in vehicles that are coming through as cargo. Riley\u2019s has a reputation of shipping vehicles overseas and back again for wealthy clients. No agency has been able to tie them to anything illegal, though, until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Panic was beginning to edge through her senses as fear began to build.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it, Piper.\u201d Jed\u2019s arms tightened around her as Piper felt the fear beginning to overflow her tenuous control.</p><p>What had she managed to get herself into? Why had she allowed this to happen? She could have just told Dawg, Jed, and Tim what had happened and they would have figured this out a week ago. Before someone had attempted to break into her room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Piper. We have the contacts to fix this,\u201d Dawg promised her as he turned back to her. \u201cYou stay with Jed; Timothy and I will take care of things.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to have to risk yourself,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNone of you. I just wanted to be able to take this meeting without everyone breathing down my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were being protected for a reason, Piper,\u201d Jed stated as Dawg and Tim began to move toward the patio door, where Dawg was pointing out where the lock had been picked.</p><p>\u201cFor a reason I was never allowed to understand.\u201d Turning, she faced him, her gaze meeting his, irritation flooding her as fear and confusion fueled the panic tightening her stomach. \u201cMaybe, Jed, if something\u2014anything\u2014had been explained to me, then I would have been more prone to listen a little more closely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow you\u2019re sounding like a child.\u201d He sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d she mocked him. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m treated. Treat me like an adult and see if I don\u2019t try to act like one.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p> <p>Nothing could possibly be easy, Piper thought as midnight rolled around before she was able to extricate herself from her mother, sisters, cousins, and various family members.</p><p>\u201cDawg couldn\u2019t just keep his mouth shut?\u201d she muttered as Jed escorted her into his room. \u201cHe could have kept all this to himself for a little while longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDawg usually knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Jed assured her, locking the door behind them before turning and striding through the living area. \u201cStay here; I want to check out the bedroom again.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms over her breasts, she watched as he disappeared into the bedroom, closing the door behind him.</p><p>So Dawg usually knew what he was doing, did he?</p> <p>\u201cYou are aware that Dawg is the one whom Tim accuses of constantly living by the seat of his pants, right?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t quite catch Jed\u2019s response, but it was something along the lines of, \u201cThat\u2019s when Dawg is at his best.\u201d</p><p>At his best, her ass.</p><p>It was when he was most dangerous.</p><p>She was still standing there glaring at the door when it opened and Jed walked through, his chest gloriously bare, his shirt conspicuously absent.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need this right now.</p> <p>Hell.</p><p>Tightening her thighs, Piper fought to hold back the ache beginning there. The swelling of her clit, the throb of her pussy. The fiery, desperate need to be filled by the hard thrust of his cock.</p><p>Dark blond hair fell over his brow, while the navy blue of his gaze seemed to deepen and gleam with heated hunger as he stared back at her.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to tell the whole damned family,\u201d she muttered, her mouth drying out as he paced closer.</p><p>\u201cWould you want to know if one of your sisters were in danger?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Dark, thick lashes lowered over the gleam in his eyes as predatory awareness filled them.</p><p>He knew she wanted him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as though she could hide the hardness of her nipples as they pressed into the thin material of the blouse she wore. Or the heavy pulse of blood in her throat.</p> <p>His gaze, heavy with latent lust and intent, flicked to the throbbing of the vein at the side of her neck, then back to the hard tips of her nipples.</p><p>Sensation raced over her flesh as heat built in her womb and fired a need she still had no idea how to handle. Hell, she didn\u2019t even know how he managed to do this to her. What she did know was that resisting him wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me, Piper.\u201d He stopped just in front of her, his wide chest separated from the hard tips of her nipples by no more than a breath of space.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the question again?\u201d Oh, Lord, she was supposed to keep up with the conversation?</p><p>With him walking around with his broad naked chest? Oh, dear Lord, she didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cWould you want to know if your sisters were in danger?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cI remember the question.\u201d She glared back at him, determined to bluff her way through having not heard it the first time. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, so why answer?\u201d</p><p>A knowing smile curled his lips.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Settling his hands on her hips, he brought her body flush against his.</p><p>Broad, fiercely erect, the length of his cock pressed against her belly behind the denim covering it.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Trying not to appear too greedy to touch him, she let her fluttering fingers press against his chest.</p><p>\u201cBeside the point, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Piper closed her eyes, hoping to find some measure of control against the hunger flooding her system.</p><p>\u201cIt really is.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Oh, God, it only made it worse.</p><p>Jerking them open, she fought to catch her breath as his lips settled against the side of her neck for a heated kiss.</p><p>\u201cJed, what do you do to me?\u201d she whispered, needing to know, to understand why she couldn\u2019t deny the fire raging between them.</p><p>\u201cThe same thing you do to me, sweetheart, maybe?\u201d His teeth raked against her neck as he finished the question, bringing a low, keening moan from her throat as she arched her neck.</p><p>\u201cDo I make the world burn for you, too?\u201d</p><p>Jed lifted his head, staring down at her, amazed by the question.</p><p>God, was that what he did for her? Did he make the world burn down around her? Because he swore that was exactly what it felt like to him as well.</p><p>It felt as though the world were burning down around him, and nothing mattered but the flames edging closer toward them.</p><p>\u201cBaby, the world doesn\u2019t even exist for me when I\u2019m touching you.\u201d Were those words really falling from his lips?</p><p>What the hell was she doing to him?</p><p>Moving his hands from her waist, he lowered them to the belt that cinched her waist loosely and released it. He dropped it to the floor, and his fingers moved to the buttons of her blouse.</p><p>Was that him actually fumbling with a button as his lips touched hers?</p><p>But, hell, her kiss was fire itself. It was the flame burning the world around him and searing him with pleasure. It was the fuel feeding it, and the only hope he had of surviving the effect on his senses.</p><p>Parting her lips further, tasting the teasing heat of her tongue against his, Jed had to force his fingers to work. To remove each button from the exquisite softness of the blouse she\u2019d made with her own delicate fingers.</p><p>Fingers that were curling against his chest, blunt little nails rasping against his flesh as she dragged them to the jeans riding low at his hips.</p><p>Hell. She was tugging at his belt, releasing it, dragging it apart slowly as he deepened the kiss and drew in the rich essence of her feminine need.</p><p>The last button parted, the material separating and slowly drifting from her shoulders as he pushed it back from the rapid rise and fall of her breasts.</p><p>Soft, silken lace encased her breasts in a bra as light as air. Sliding the clip between her breasts open and pulling the fabric from the swollen weight of the firm curves, he was forced to pull his lips back from hers, to drag in air as the button of his jeans released.</p><p>His self-control was going to hell in a handbasket.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby.\u201d Swinging her up into his arms, he strode quickly through the sitting room to the bedroom door.</p><p>Opening it and pushing through, he moved to the bed he\u2019d turned back when he\u2019d entered the room earlier to check the doors. Laying her against the cool white sheets, he moved his hands to her delicate legs, where the skirt she wore had fallen back above her knees.</p><p>The midcalf length of the full skirt shouldn\u2019t have been so damned sexy, but it had tormented him all day with the knowledge that it covered flesh softer than the material over it.</p><p>Stroking his hand down one leg to her fragile feet, he removed the sandals covering one before moving to the next.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d Running his hands back up the inside of her legs, he parted them gently, watching as the paisley print of the skirt fell back to her thighs. \u201cDo you know how hard it was to keep from dragging you to this bedroom today? To keep from pushing my hands beneath this skirt to find all the sweet, hot flesh beneath?\u201d</p><p>Piper arched beneath him, watching through lashes that refused to open fully, fighting to breathe through the incredible pleasure pouring through her.</p><p>Pushing his hands beneath the skirt, he curled his fingers beneath the elastic of the low-rise bikini underwear she wore and began pulling them down with exquisite slowness.</p><p>\u201cJed, you\u2019re teasing me,\u201d she accused him, her body tortured with the need for his possession.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m teasing me.\u201d Hot, rich lust echoed in his voice, filled the dark sound with wicked hunger as he pulled her panties free and tossed them to the floor.</p><p>Pulling back, he rose quickly beside the bed, and before she could do more than draw a sharp breath, he\u2019d shed the denim and snug boxer underwear containing the fierce width of his straining erection.</p><p>Heavy veins throbbed forcefully along the shaft as he came to her, while the wide crest, flushed and dark with lust, gleamed with a layer of precome.</p><p>Rather than pushing her legs immediately apart and coming into her, as she\u2019d expected, he lowered himself carefully over her. Rough with an overnight shadow of a beard, his cheek brushed against the side of her breast.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he whispered as her hands gripped his shoulders, her legs parting to encase the muscular strength of his thighs.</p><p>Arching to him, Piper bit back a demanding moan. She needed to feel his lips against her breasts. Needed to feel the heavy draw of his mouth and the flick of his wicked tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me beg, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded, a moan slipping into her voice as his lips brushed against the tight, sensitive point.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>She would have, if he would just\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, God! Oh, Jed. Yes. Please.\u201d Her hands lifted to his head, her fingers fisting in his hair as she strained against him, arching into the heated possession of his mouth as it wrapped around the sensitive peak of her breast.</p><p>The tender bud of her nipple throbbed in agonizing pleasure as he drew on it. Fierce, pleasure-sharp spikes of sensation raced to her clit and the depths of her vagina as the feel of silken warmth eased from the clenched portal.</p><p>Drawing on the tender flesh, he flicked his tongue against it with lashing warmth. Pleasure struck repeatedly at her womb, clenching her pussy and pounding through her clit with exquisite sensation.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Jed, it\u2019s so good.\u201d She arched closer, desperate to feel his touch between her thighs. Piper\u2019s senses became focused on nothing else but each fiery, rapturous tug of his lips and each suckling motion of his hot mouth as his fingers eased slowly, teasingly up her thigh.</p><p>\u201cJed, please.\u201d Begging was so not beneath her as his fingers brushed against the silken folds of her pussy.</p><p>He parted the intimate lips, his touch too slow, almost taunting as she arched and ached for more.</p><p>The pad of his finger rubbed against the clenched entrance; he ignored the desperate motion of her hips as she fought to force his finger inside her.</p><p>\u201cGreedy, baby,\u201d he whispered, the tips of two fingers now rubbing against the entrance to her pussy.</p><p>\u201cGreedy?\u201d She panted. \u201cMore like tormented. You\u2019re tormenting me, Jed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loving you.\u201d The words were whispered against her midriff as his lips moved lower and one hand pushed her skirt higher. \u201cI\u2019m loving you, Piper.\u201d</p><p>Before she could counter his declaration, his lips lowered and covered the straining, tortured bud of her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, yes.\u201d Twisting against the sudden grip he had on her hips, Piper\u2019s hips jerked in reaction. \u201cJed. Oh, Jed, yes, please.\u201d</p><p>Lavish licks surrounded the straining bundle of nerves as Piper cried out, pleading, begging, desperate for release now.</p><p>Nudging at the little bud, licking at it, suckling it into the heat of his mouth, he pushed her toward an abyss of ecstasy that threatened her sanity.</p><p>As he stroked and laved the sensitive bundle of nerve endings, the fingertips stroking at her entrance began to slip inside, stretching her flesh and opening the little portal. Swift, heated flares of sensation raged through her flesh, striking at her womb, at her clit, and stealing her breath.</p><p>The feel of his fingers pressing inside her, separating the tender tissue and caressing hidden nerve endings, had muted cries escaping her throat as she fought for release.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to wait.</p><p>She\u2019d waited long enough.</p><p>She\u2019d waited twenty-four years for this man, for this pleasure, and waiting one second longer for her release seemed entirely uncalled-for.</p><p>\u201cJed, please.\u201d Her fingers kneaded his scalp as her hips lifted, her thighs spreading wider as his fingers fucked slow and easy inside her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me wait.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A muted groan of male pleasure was her only answer as his tongue rolled over her clit, pressed against it, and threatened to ignite the explosion she was reaching so desperately for.</p><p>God.

Waiting was only intensifying the painful eagerness now building inside her.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d Lifting to him, rolling her hips against the invasion of his fingers inside her vagina, against the probing, wicked tongue and suckling lips at her clit, Piper fought to hold on to her sanity as the need became a driving, desperate ache to fly into the heated rapture she could feel awaiting her.</p> <p>\u201cPlease. Jed . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t take much more.</p><p>Oh, God, he was going to pay for this. She was going to make certain he paid for this.</p><p>His lips lifted; his fingers eased back.</p><p>Forcing her lashes open, Piper watched as he dragged himself to his knees before bending to the side of the bed and reaching for a condom.</p><p>The heavy length of his cock jutted out from his body, flushed and eager and tempting a hunger she\u2019d never had the chance to give in to.</p> <p>She had the chance now.</p><p>Her body was humming for the penetration she knew he was preparing for.</p><p>But she wanted . . .</p><p>As he straightened before her, Piper pushed herself into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Her fingers curled around his wrist as he moved to roll the condom over the throbbing, flared crest of the fiercely erect shaft.</p><p>\u201cPiper, baby.\u201d The warning in his voice was clear. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have the control for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure you do.\u201d She breathed out, one hand curling around his erection, marveling at the fact that her fingers couldn\u2019t encircle it, yet her body could accept each hard thrust made into it by the fierce shaft. \u201cJust like I did.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, she tasted him.</p><p>A hard, primal groan sounded above her as her tongue licked over the engorged crest.</p><p>Parting her lips, she covered the width of his cock head, taking him into her mouth as her lips hugged the hard flesh and drew on it with pleasure.</p><p>Salty, male.</p><p>The explosion of taste had a moan tearing from her throat, vibrating against his dick and sending Jed\u2019s senses into overdrive.</p><p>Damn her, she was destroying him, and he couldn\u2019t stop her. She was sucking his control straight from him by the simple act of sucking his dick as though it were a favored treat.</p><p>With her tongue lashing at his cock and her lips tightening around it, her wicked, seductive fingers cupping his balls in one hand as the other stroked the heavy width of it was nearly more than he could bear.</p> <p>\u201cGod, Piper, I\u2019m going to come, babe.\u201d He groaned with a desperation he swore he\u2019d never felt before this woman.</p><p>Her tongue rubbed at the head of his cock. It probed at the oversensitive nerve endings just beneath the head, then sucked the engorged heat with such pleasure he swore he was going to lose control and spill his release into her suckling mouth.</p><p>He had to tighten his fingers, had to grip her hair and try to force her head back from the shaft.</p><p>Her eyes darkened.</p><p>Seeing her staring up at him with the light green of her eyes darkening imperceptibly was nearly too much for the tenuous control he was barely holding on to.</p><p>Yet he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>His hips moved even as he told himself he\u2019d hold still.</p><p>He watched the head of his cock pull back, sink inside. Watched as he fucked her mouth and those pert, pretty lips reddened.</p><p>He watched until he couldn\u2019t take it any longer.</p><p>Pulling free despite her protesting moan, Jed moved back, and before she could react, he managed to turn her to her stomach, his hands gripping her hips and lifting them before him.</p><p>\u201cDamn, your ass is so pretty.\u201d Sliding his hands back to the rounded globes as he positioned his cock at the slick, heated opening of her little pussy, he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the pleasure slicing through his senses. \u201cI love this pretty ass, Piper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d she cried out desperately.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go together.\u201d He groaned as he pushed the head of his cock into the fiery heat of her juice-laden cunt and had to clench his teeth to fight back the release building in his balls. \u201cGod, Piper, we\u2019ll go together, baby, because I never knew pleasure could be this fucking good.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold back.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold on.</p><p>Gripping her hips firmly, Jed pulled his cock back, then in one fierce thrust buried the eager erection halfway inside the gripping, lush little pussy he was certain would steal his sanity.</p><p>Pure, unadulterated ecstasy began building in his senses.</p><p>Blood pounded in his veins, and on the second thrust, nothing else began to matter but the pure, mindless race to shattering rapture.</p><p>Piper tried to scream.</p><p>As the fierce, pleasure-pain sensations began whipping through her pussy, attacking her clit and racing through her senses, she swore she would never survive the cataclysmic pleasure building through her flesh.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t struggle against it; hell, she didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>She gave herself over to it, reaching ever harder for it, poised on the edge of an abyss she wanted nothing more than to fly into.</p><p>\u201cJed, please.\u201d She forced the cry past her lips. \u201cHarder. Please. Please fuck me harder.\u201d</p><p>She wanted that release.</p><p>She wanted it now.</p><p>God, if she had to wait she might not survive it.</p><p>Fingers curling into the sheets beneath her, she held on tightly. She thrust back to him, panting for air, as flames burned through her system, licking across her flesh and attacking the rapidly rising sensitivity of her clit and the aching depths of her overstretched vagina.</p><p>As she fought to break the bonds holding her to reality and to jump headlong into the flames, she felt Jed above her. His lips were at her neck, stinging nips and heated kisses attacking the bend of her shoulder a second before he caught the tender flesh between his lips and delivered a heated kiss that became a catalyst to pure ecstasy.</p><p>The explosion tore through her.</p><p>Rapture ripped her from her place in reality and threw her headlong into the cataclysm of flames awaiting her. Destructive, the tidal wave of pure ecstasy overwhelmed her; as she flew through that place of searing sensation, she found the man who had taken her there.</p><p>Piper felt him inside her, covering her, not just taking her body, but sinking inside her soul.</p><p>His groan echoed around her.</p><p>His cock buried deep one last time, pulsed and throbbed; then her muscles clenched around him further as he found his own release.</p><p>Crying out his name, locked in a world of blinding color and overwhelming rapture, she could do nothing but trust him to hold her, to keep her secure as the pleasure pounded through her, tore past the deepest reaches of her heart and invaded the very depths of her soul.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>There was no denying it. There was no fighting it.</p><p>She belonged to him.</p><p>But as she felt him sinking inside the abyss with her, Piper knew he belonged to her as well.</p><p>He was hers.</p><p>There was no denying her, just as she knew there was no longer any chance of denying him.</p><p>For the first time in her life, she knew exactly what it meant to belong.</p><p>Now if she could just live long enough to enjoy it.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d With a towel wrapped around her, her damp hair lying along her shoulders, Piper stepped from the bathroom after showering, the reality of the danger facing her threatening to overwhelm her optimism.</p><p>The chest-tightening panic was returning, waiting, preparing her for Jed to walk away. . . .</p><p>Like her father had walked away and left her, her mother, and her sisters unprotected and alone. Just as she was afraid Tim and Dawg would walk away.</p><p>Was that why everything inside her shut down whenever she and Dawg moved toward a confrontation? To prepare her heart, to steel herself against the abandonment?</p><p>\u201cWe wait and see,\u201d he answered, the towel he\u2019d wrapped around his waist earlier still in place.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t dressed.</p><p>Heated need for his touch was threatening to weaken her need for answers as she watched him toss their dirty clothes into the hamper next to the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you sit around and wait on anyone or anything, Jed?\u201d she asked, frowning at the feeling that there was much more going on than simply waiting. \u201cWhat are you and my brother up to?\u201d</p><p>Tightening in response to some imperceptible feeling of dread, her heart began to beat at a sluggish pace.</p><p>The impending panic was a result of the look on his face, the darkening of his navy gaze that made his eyes appear almost black.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not just waiting; we\u2019re watching,\u201d he finally stated, his expression hardening just enough to warn her that she was going to hear something she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you watching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour room.\u201d Jed paced to the television, retrieved the remote, and hit the power button.</p><p>Watching the screen, she was surprised as he reached behind the unit, and a second later, the split view of the screen showed both her bedroom as well as her sitting room.</p><p>\u201cBrogan had the cameras installed just after he started sleeping with Eve,\u201d he revealed. \u201cHe was afraid his or Dawg\u2019s enemies would attempt to strike out at her, or take her from him. There were cameras in her room, and GPS on her car and her cell phone.\u201d</p><p>The cameras had been there since before Brogan and Eve moved from the inn? And they were still there?</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to move them,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd I was going to until I learned you were taking her room after she moved in with Brogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve watched me when I didn\u2019t know you were?\u201d</p><p>Controlling her? Maneuvering her?</p><p>Was he so much different than she had begun to believe he was?</p><p>\u201cOnly once or twice.\u201d Broad shoulders shrugged as he watched her carefully. \u201cThe night you were packing to leave for New York.\u201d</p><p>Holding the towel close to her breasts, she sat up, watching the view on the television, wondering what she should feel.</p><p>Was the need to deny that he would do such a thing to control her normal? Was she simply trying to make excuses for him?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy were you watching me?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed at the back of his neck, frustration tightening his face. \u201cI worried about you. I wanted to see you. Hell, Piper, you\u2019ve made me fucking crazy since I\u2019ve moved in here, as you\u2019ve tempted me, then run from me. There were days I wasn\u2019t certain I could keep from playing the caveman I knew you were waiting for me to reveal lurking inside me.\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, she glanced to the screen again.</p><p>\u201cSo why show me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want any secrets at all between us any longer,\u201d he stated. \u201cNot secrets like this.\u201d Flipping his hand toward the screen, he moved to the dresser and pulled his clothes from the chair next to the bed as she watched, then began dressing angrily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take your fucking freedom,\u201d he growled at her as he shoved the white-and-gray-striped shirt into the waistband of his jeans and quickly buckled his belt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to control what you think or feel or what you do.\u201d Glaring at her, he sat down in the chair next to the bed and pulled on dark leather boots. \u201cI just want you.\u201d</p><p>He just wanted her?</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019ve had me,\u201d she said, feeling kind of hollow inside. \u201cDid you change your mind about wanting to control me and my life?\u201d</p><p>Had she made a mistake? The one mistake she had sworn she would never make\u2014had she fallen in love with a man unable to resist the urge to completely take her life over?</p><p>The look he shot her was one of such scorn that anger immediately flared inside her.</p><p>What the hell did he expect her to think?</p><p>Stomping to the end of the bed, where he\u2019d laid the clothes he\u2019d collected from her room earlier, Piper pulled on her own jeans, soft cotton tank camisole, socks, and sneakers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe I should just return to my room.\u201d She felt a bit hollow inside now, as though some part of her had just been cruelly ripped from her chest.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t saying he loved her. He wasn\u2019t mentioning caring for her. There was no hint of commitment or anything other than the fact that he had been watching her and she had driven him crazy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you want from me?\u201d she asked as she finished dressing and turned back to him, aching inside with the knowledge that she could be losing what she hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d so desperately needed.</p> <p>\u201cI want you to stop being frightened of me, to start with,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t pull this crap on me.\u201d Turning on him fully, her arms propped on her hips, Piper confronted him as she had never confronted her brother. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jed, I never knew what the hell you\u2019ve wanted from me. You flirted, you smiled, yet you never asked me out or gave me so much as a hint that you wanted more than a one-night stand. Or is that all you wanted?\u201d</p><p>Heated anger was brewing inside her, rising to the surface and threatening to break free of the shield she normally kept surrounding it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I wanted?\u201d Dark emotion filled his expression and his eyes, warning her of the thin ice she might be stepping onto.</p><p>She\u2019d never heeded the warnings from Jed, though, so why start now?</p> <p>Why should she even attempt to make excuses to herself, let alone to him, Dawg, or anyone else? she thought furiously as she watched him hit the remote, turning the television off before throwing the remote to the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve driven myself insane trying to hold back, trying to ensure you have the space you need to deal with your brother and decide what you want with me, just to stop with a fucking one-night stand?\u201d Jed growled.</p><p>He moved so fast there was no avoiding him.</p><p>His hands were on her shoulders first, jerking her to him before one arm wrapped around her waist to hold her against his hard body while his free hand slid into her hair, clenched, and pulled her head back.</p><p>\u201cYou make me feel like a fucking caveman,\u201d he rasped. Power, hunger, and something much deeper echoed in his voice and gleamed in his eyes. \u201cSon of a bitch, Piper, you make me feel things I\u2019ve never felt before, and I have no idea how to fucking deal with them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do I make you feel, Jed?\u201d</p><p>His lips parted, but what he would have said, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cHow very sweet.\u201d</p><p>That voice.</p><p>Grating. Harsh.</p><p>She knew it. It echoed in her head and slammed through her memories with the force of a sledgehammer.</p><p>Jed\u2019s eyes narrowed as he released her, turning as he used one arm to keep her behind him.</p><p>It was the nightmare she\u2019d had nightly since the attack in New York. The face she could never remember. The vision of horror and pain she hadn\u2019t been able to escape.</p> <p>The man was pockmarked, a scar running through the left side of his upper lip and bisecting a weak chin. Thinning dark brown hair and muscular shoulders combined with mean, cold hazel eyes and a gun leveled at Jed\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stupid man.\u201d Jed seemed to sigh, but she could feel the dangerous fury building in his body.</p><p>\u201cHow do you figure that?\u201d Thin lips curled into a sneer as bulky shoulders shifted beneath a light jacket that strained across them. \u201cI slipped in on you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d Was that amusement in Jed\u2019s voice?</p><p>The other man chuckled. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just move away from the little girlie there,\u201d he suggested. \u201cShe can run over to the next room and collect all those jewels she got in New York and bring them back to me. I might let you live if she hurries. And if she brings them all.\u201d</p><p>Jed was slowly shaking his head. Piper gripped his waist with one hand as the other balled into a fist and pressed against his back. Fear rose inside her and threatened to steal her breath. An ugly flash of life without Jed slammed through her imagination and left her fighting back tears.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you don\u2019t have someone waiting in her room?\u201d Jed asked, as though he hadn\u2019t just been watching the complete emptiness of her suite.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter; we\u2019ll both want the same thing,\u201d the man stated, his voice harsh as he advanced another step. \u201cNow, does she go after those jewels or do I kill you? Then her.\u201d A smile twisted his lips as the mocking question passed them. \u201cOr I could just hurt you a little bit to show her I mean business.\u201d He aimed the gun at Jed\u2019s kneecap.</p><p>\u201cNo need to go that far,\u201d Jed drawled, as though it were all a game. \u201cShe can just do as you ask.\u201d</p><p>She knew Jed\u2019s voice. She knew the passion-rich sound of hunger in it as well as the icy slide of a warning. And the warning in his tone was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cI thought that might be the case.\u201d The intruder\u2019s smile was a terrifying grimace as he glanced to Jed\u2019s side to peek around at her.</p><p>He chuckled with a grating rasp. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you\u2019ve healed from our last meeting. I\u2019ve always thought it a rather wasted effort to add more damage before the old bruises have healed.\u201d</p><p>And he appeared to enjoy the thought of adding those bruises.</p><p>He had every intention of killing them. Piper could see it in the pure anticipation in his gaze. Cruelty was inherent in the man\u2019s face, and in her memory of his heavy blows landing against her undefended body.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Ms. Mackay,\u201d he ordered her softly, waving the gun toward the door between Jed\u2019s room and her own. \u201cCollect all the jewels now. Miss any and he\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d Licking her dry lips, she didn\u2019t have to pretend pure terror; it was there, slapping her in the face. \u201cThey\u2019re mixed in with the rest of the stones.\u201d</p><p>Evil hazel eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you mean? Mixed in with the other stones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stones I bought at the craft store.\u201d Forcing the words past her lips, she tried to hold back the quaver in her voice. \u201cI thought they were the fake stones I\u2019d bought.\u201d</p><p>For the briefest second surprised disbelief filled the man\u2019s gaze before a cackle of laughter left his lips.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d The laughter was almost a wheeze. \u201cWhy am I even surprised? You look about that stupid, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Stupid?</p><p>The gun still aimed at Jed\u2019s knee was all that kept her mouth shut as she stared back at him.</p><p>He might think she was stupid, but she knew he was fucking ugly. She could fake smart if that were true, but there was no way in hell he could fake pretty, she thought mockingly, fighting to hold back her fear.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid, though. What she was, was doing everything she could to buy enough time for Jed to figure their way out of this one.</p><p>\u201cWell, I suggest you learn how to identify the real stuff and separate it from the fakes really fast,\u201d he suggested, his voice lowering and echoing with cruelty. \u201cYou have about four minutes to get that cute little ass back in here before I start putting holes in your man.\u201d He waved the gun at Jed\u2019s knee before lifting it to Jed\u2019s heart and smiling back at her.</p><p>Everything inside her was shaking, trembling in fear now, while Jed\u2019s complete stillness had wariness growing inside her.</p><p>He was up to something; she could feel it.</p><p>She knew Jed. He wasn\u2019t moving; nor was he taunting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you turn the lights out,\u201d Jed suddenly advised her.</p><p>Piper paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat fucking lights?\u201d Fury echoed in the gunman\u2019s voice. The lights went out and the darkness exploded around her.</p><p>Piper found herself thrown to the floor a breath before the explosive report of a weapon echoed through the room.</p><p>Riding close on the sound of the gun\u2019s discharge, shattering glass from the mirror above the dresser began raining down on her, biting sharply against the bare flesh of her arms.</p><p>She covered her head until the stinging storm ceased, then scrambled across the room on her hands and knees, glass pricking into her palms and knees as the sound of an enraged fight could be heard ahead of her.</p><p>She had to find Jed.</p><p>\u201cStay in place, Piper,\u201d Jed yelled out a second before a hard grunt was heard. \u201cStay where you are, dammit.\u201d</p><p>She pushed herself against the wall as she glared into the darkness, her hand pressing against a large shard of the glass on the floor. Curling her fingers around it, she lifted it, holding it against her just in case she might need it.</p><p>A second later a shadow hurled itself toward her as though propelled by some unseen force.</p><p>Or Jed\u2019s fist.</p><p>The wide body of her assailant\u2014or her would-be killer\u2014slammed into the wall beside her.</p><p>Fury surged through Piper at the knowledge of who it was bouncing against the wall. Gripping the glass tighter in her hand, she struck out and buried the arrowed point of the glass into the brute\u2019s back. Or maybe it was his shoulder?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain which.</p><p>The second she slammed it home she tried to move out of his way. The fist was faster than her self-preservation instincts, though. A hard fist in her direction slammed into her shoulder, throwing her off balance and sending her pitching to the floor, her hands scraping against the glass that covered the carpet.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Piper.\u201d Affectionate frustration filled Jed\u2019s voice and covered that underlying well of complete fury she sensed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see a damned thing, but suddenly Jed was picking her up and throwing them both to the side as the report of the weapon blasted through the room once again.</p><p>An animalistic growl left Jed\u2019s throat as he pushed her halfway beneath the bed, then jumped across it.</p><p>The gun went off again as raised voices outside the room could be heard. A high-pitched male scream sounded, and then for the space of a few short seconds, there was unbearable silence.</p><p>Piper stared across the bed, desperate to see Jed\u2019s shadow moving, to see some kind of movement that she could attribute to him.</p><p>Without him, she was lost.</p><p>She felt lost.</p><p>Terror squeezed her heart like a furious vise and left her breathless as she glared over the bed, determined to see him alive. She had to see him alive.</p><p>Her lips parted to call out to him at the same moment the lights flipped on, shocking her senses.</p><p>Piper dropped down and beneath the bed, rolling to peep from beneath the bed skirt at the overly large feet suddenly rushing around the room.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Piper.\u201d Hard hands shoved beneath the bed and gripped her wrists, and she glimpsed Jed\u2019s bruised face as he pulled her from beneath the bed and dragged her against the hard width of his chest.</p><p>Piper pressed one hand against his heart as she pressed her face into his neck, concentrating on the beating of his heart against her palm.</p><p>He was alive.</p><p>That was all she could think, all she could allow herself to focus on.</p><p>He was alive.</p><p>\u201cHell!\u201d Tim\u2019s voice echoed above her with his characteristic mocking frustration. \u201cOnly a Mackay could cause this kind of commotion and still fucking live through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Dawg\u2019s protest was a rasping growl. \u201cI think I resemble that remark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResent, Dawg,\u201d Rowdy repeated the response he\u2019d been repeating for years. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to resent that remark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll resent it when it stops happening.\u201d Dawg sighed.</p><p>Lifting her head from Jed\u2019s shoulder, Piper looked around, her eyes widening.</p><p>The large mirror over the dresser was shattered and lying in bits and sharp pieces in front of the oak dresser. The window across the room was missing a wide section and spiderwebbed with long cracks.</p><p>The flat-screen television was missing its screen and hung lopsided now, its pieces littering the floor. The chair was upended, along with the bedside table, lamp, and clock. Amid all of it, unconscious or dead\u2014she didn\u2019t care which\u2014the broad form of the man who had attacked her in New York lay sprawled, still and silent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know this one.\u201d Tim kicked at a limp, thick leg, his expression reflective. \u201cMarcel Genoa. He\u2019s one of Rudy Genoa\u2019s fists, and Marlena\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we had that organization taken care of, Timothy?\u201d The question rumbled from Jed\u2019s throat, the irritation in his voice heavy.</p><p>A stranger\u2019s voice intruded into the conversation then. \u201cIt\u2019s according to your definition of \u2018taken care of,\u2019 Agent Booker.\u201d</p> <p>Piper\u2019s head jerked up as Jed rose to his feet immediately, lifting her along with him to his side. But no one was moving to defend themselves.</p><p>\u201cMr. Samson?\u201d Swallowing tightly, she moved her gaze from Rhylan Samson, Guido Samson\u2019s son, to the men filling the room around her.</p><p>Rhylan stepped into the room, his thumbs hooking into the pockets of his jeans, lean, muscular shoulders shifting beneath the dark gray silk shirt he wore.</p><p>\u201cMarcel was a bit of a wild card who we were unaware was lurking in the dark,\u201d Rhylan said, moving one hand to close the door behind him before lifting the other to prop both on his tapered, muscular hips.</p><p>Staring down at Marcel Genoa, he shook his head wearily. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for him since the attack on Ms. Mackay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could have informed us,\u201d Timothy snapped, his gaze swinging to Piper. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though she was forthcoming with the information.\u201d</p><p>Piper refused to flush.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, Tim, if I\u2019d been allowed an opinion or a choice in the past year where my security was concerned, then maybe I would have been forthcoming with the information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to stop blaming us,\u201d Dawg muttered behind her. \u201cLet it go, Tim.\u201d</p><p>Letting it go was the best choice her male family members could have made.</p><p>Rhylan chuckled at the response, his gaze moving to Jed\u2019s. \u201cGood luck, Agent Booker. You may need it if you continue dealing with Mackays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI rather doubt it.\u201d The confidence in Jed\u2019s voice had Rhylan inclining his head with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Rhylan?\u201d Tim asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do all of you seem to know this man far better than a few days\u2019 stay would warrant?\u201d Piper asked. Wasn\u2019t it just like Dawg and their cousins, along with Tim, to know it all while leaving everyone else in the dark?</p><p>She was fucking sick of being left in the dark.</p><p>\u201cPiper. There\u2019s information you can\u2019t have, and there will be times your questions will not be answered.\u201d</p><p>Tim lifted his gaze to Jed as Piper felt her chest tighten in pain. She was the one who had carried the bruises, who could have died. Who deserved this information more than she? \u201cTake her to her mother; she\u2019s waiting in the hall. We\u2019ll figure this out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Piper had never been so happy to hear that rough, growling refusal come from Jed\u2019s throat as she stared back at Tim in recrimination.</p> <p>Tim grimaced, his face appearing more lined, his expression more concerned than ever.</p><p>\u201cYou know the delicacy of this information\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop it, Cranston.\u201d Rhylan breathed out roughly as he gave his head a hard shake. \u201cHe\u2019s right. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s been in danger, not the rest of you.\u201d He turned to her again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Mackay; you were caught in a web of deceit that had nothing to do with you, other than the fact that you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and ended up with belongings we were unaware were in that car. The jewels you inadvertently ended up with are the belongings of a particularly sadistic Russian mobster. They\u2019ll be returned to him, so we can then track where they end up and what they\u2019re being used to pay for.\u201d He turned to Tim. \u201cIf you\u2019ll gather the jewels together for me, I have the paperwork you need.\u201d</p><p>Timothy\u2019s lips thinned as the situation was explained to her. \u201cThat\u2019s information that could get her killed, Rhylan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if she tells anyone what she knows,\u201d Rhylan objected. \u201cAnd I think she\u2019s proven she knows how to keep her mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>No, he was wrong; she didn\u2019t need to hear this particular argument.</p><p>Jed had tensed to a breaking point, and Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches looked as though they were facing the gallows at the thought of her hearing whatever information this man had to give.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s waiting for me.\u201d Turning to Jed, she felt the tension slowly easing from his body. \u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>His head lowered, and his lips touched hers with a gentleness that filled her soul with a warmth that went far beyond arousal, need, or hunger. It filled her with a knowledge she hadn\u2019t understood until now.</p><p>As Jed released her she moved quickly to Dawg, threw her arms around him, and immediately felt him enfold her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she whispered in his ear quickly. \u201cI never understood how you feared for our safety until now, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood what, sweetie?\u201d How could she have ever thought it was just arrogance and male superiority that caused him to hover over her and her sisters so closely?</p><p>\u201cWhy.\u201d Her arms tightened around his shoulders. \u201cWhy we have to stay safe for you.\u201d Leaning back, she stared into his eyes and saw the bleak knowledge he held in his soul.</p><p>The knowledge of all the ways she could die, and all the ways he couldn\u2019t protect her, her sisters, and her mother if he weren\u2019t always diligent.</p><p>It was the curse of loving men such as this, whether they were lovers or the best damned brother and cousins anyone could have.</p><p>His jaw bunched, emotions whipping through the light green of his eyes and clenching the muscles of his face before he nodded sharply.</p><p>A quick hug to both Rowdy and Natches, and Piper hurried from the room.</p><p>As Tim had said, her mother was waiting in the hall, but she wasn\u2019t alone. With her were Lyrica and Zoey, and moving up the hall Eve and Brogan strode toward them quickly.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s gaze surveyed her swiftly before he nodded and moved past her, leaving Eve to give her a firm hug as their mother wrapped her arm around Piper\u2019s waist.</p><p>They were all safe\u2014this time.</p><p>But they were Mackays. The sisters were Dawg\u2019s, Brogan\u2019s, and now Jed\u2019s weaknesses. They would always live beneath the shadow of the Mackay males\u2019 strength, as well as the strength of the men they loved.</p><p>A strength that had acquired enemies for them through their dedication to justice.</p><p>Flashing a grin first to Lyrica, then to Zoey, she warned them with amused reflection, \u201cI\u2019d acquire ninja training if I were you. Otherwise they\u2019ll never stop hovering. So give in, or get tough.\u201d</p><p>Lyrica slumped against the wall.</p><p>Zoey just stared back at her with eyes a fierce celadon and an expression of complete rejection of such a thought.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re Mackays,\u201d Zoey stated then. \u201cWe don\u2019t give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Eve laughed lightly.</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime,\u201d Lyrica assured them all.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s time to get tough, then,\u201d Mercedes stated as she had so many times in the past, her smile bright and filled with anticipation as they turned and moved quickly to the kitchen.</p><p>Coffee, a sweet, and a game plan. That was how they dealt with the problems life had thrown at them for as long as Piper could remember. Her mother would prepare hot drinks, some sweet she had baked, and they would figure out the best way they could handle the situation. The best way to get tough and fight back against whatever problems they faced.</p><p>It was time to get tough.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>The Mackay women had learned how to fight back\u2014if not in strength then with their intelligence\u2014fight silently, and fight with success years before Chandler Mackay had died. They had perfected the art.</p><p>Until now, Piper, her sisters, and her mother had been certain they could make their male family members back up and stop hovering so closely. Piper could see now that it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>But she could also see why.</p><p>With Eve sitting with them, coffee and a slice of Mercedes\u2019s coconut cream pie in front of them, they began to plot and to plan.</p><p>Not for their freedom.</p><p>Not for their independence.</p><p>They were plotting, planning, and they would do all they could to defend all they loved, however they had to.</p><p>No matter what it took.</p><p>TWO DAYS LATER</p><p>Stepping into the upstairs bedroom Piper\u2019s mother had moved them into, Jed closed the door quietly behind him and stared at the woman still sleeping deeply.</p><p>The quilt had been pushed to the bottom of the bed and nothing but a soft cotton sheet covered her naked back.</p><p>Piper was stronger than he\u2019d ever imagined. Stronger and more fierce than he\u2019d ever given her credit for.</p><p>In the past two days she\u2019d given them as many details as she could remember about the rental agency, the young girl who had given her the car, as well as the location of the packets of jewels as she\u2019d found them.</p><p>Her purse had fallen from the backseat, knocking over the shopping bag containing the rhinestones and crystals she had bought that morning. She\u2019d thought nothing of the packets she\u2019d found beneath the seat. She\u2019d simply gathered them all together and thrown them into her bag before rushing to the cab waiting for her.</p><p>Why should she think anything of it? They were the same plastic packs the crystals and rhinestones she\u2019d bought were packaged in.</p><p>There was nothing unusual about finding the packets, and nothing that could have tipped her off that she had anything that wasn\u2019t hers.</p><p>Now Homeland Security had answers they\u2019d been searching for for years: how the Russian mob was smuggling the gold, jewels, and drugs that were funding the criminal organization they were building\u2014and the terrorists it was suspected were backing them\u2014into the United States.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t over, but neither was it a threat to Piper any longer, and that was all that mattered to him: making certain she was no longer in danger.</p><p>Now that the task was completed, his body was reminding him of another task that needed to be taken care of.</p><p>Two days without her touch, without having her, and his cock was like an iron wedge in his jeans, demanding relief.</p><p>Unbuttoning the shirt he wore and shrugging it from his shoulders, he allowed it to fall, forgotten, to the floor. Stopping at the bed near the stool positioned at the footboard, he sat down to remove his boots.</p><p>Standing seconds later and releasing his jeans, he shed them and the boxer briefs he wore, discarding them on the floor where he stood. A smile curled his lips, the fingers of one hand gripped his dick, and he moved to the side of the bed to pull the sheet from the silken body of the woman he reckoned he loved more than life.</p><p>As the sheet cleared the rounded globes of her pert ass, her hips shifted and she rolled to her back. Jed felt his breath still in his chest for precious seconds as he stared down at her, still marveling that such beauty was laid out for him, tempting him, hungry for him.</p><p>Firm, cherry-tipped breasts drew his gaze. As he watched, she parted her creamy thighs, revealing the sheen of slick dew on the lush folds of her pussy. Above, the moist, swollen little bud of her clit peeked out at him and tempted his tongue as her nimble little fingers stroked up his thigh before cupping the taut sac of his balls.</p><p>Fuck, her fingers were like hot silk.</p><p>Cupping, stroking, fondling the tense flesh beneath his hard dick, she drove him to complete distraction and had him panting as she slowly sat up on the bed. Her fingers moved from his balls, brushed his fingers aside, then slowly curled around the tortured length of his dick.</p><p>He clenched his teeth, fighting for control, yet a moan still slipped past his lips as he watched her lips part as she eased forward and slowly\u2014fuck him, so damned slowly\u2014covered the engorged crest of his cock and sucked it inside.</p><p>It was like being immersed in white-hot pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell, this wasn\u2019t just pleasure. It was pure fucking rapture.</p><p>The deep draws of her mouth had shards of incredible heat raking across the too-sensitive flesh, while her wicked little tongue flicked and tasted the throbbing head she held captive.</p><p>Thick lashes closed over her green eyes as he buried his fingers in the thick, black length of her hair. Creamy cheeks hollowed as she suckled him like a favored treat, moaning around the width of the throbbing head and lashing at it with her hungry little tongue.</p><p>\u201cAh, fuck.\u201d The words were dragged past his lips as she began stroking the tortured shaft with warm, silken fingers. \u201cPiper, sweetheart, I\u2019m going to end up coming in your mouth instead of that hot little pussy.\u201d</p><p>She moaned around the head, a hot little sound of hunger and need that had his stomach tightening as he fought to hold back his release. He wasn\u2019t ready to come. Not yet. Fuck, he just wanted to feel this a little longer. Just wanted to luxuriate in the pure ecstasy of each suckling motion of her mouth, each lick of her tongue and stroke of her fingers.</p><p>Staring into her face, seeing her pleasure and arousal, was more than he could stand. He could feel his balls tightening. The head of his cock flexed and clenched in her hungry mouth, and before he could push back the driving spikes of tortured pleasure, a spurt of release washed over her tongue.</p><p>It was like giving her a taste of rapture rather than a taste of his seed.</p><p>Desperate moans fell from her lips. Her fingers milked the hard shaft as her lips and tongue searched for more of the rich, male taste, clearly eager\u2014no, craving\u2014more.</p><p>Pulling back took every ounce of control that he possessed.</p><p>Watching the slow release of his cock from the hot moisture of her mouth was like tearing out a piece of his soul.</p><p>But there was so much more pleasure to be found.</p><p>Coming to her, he covered her lips with his, his tongue slipping past her lips and dancing against hers as he moved between her thighs. With one hand he quickly rolled the latex condom over his cock, then twisted against the hold of her thighs and found the slick entrance he was searching for.</p><p>It was pure heat raining down on the head of his cock as he tucked it against the clenched opening of her heated cunt.</p><p>Soft as luxury, as hot and tight as pure sin itself, the clenched tissue milked at the head of his cock, tightening with each shallow thrust, then spasming with delicate greed as he thrust heavily inside her.</p><p>Control.</p><p>God help him, just a little control, because he wanted nothing more than to sink inside her and hold himself there forever.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Piper.\u201d The words were torn from his lips, pulled from his soul, and whispered against her lips as he thrust inside her, hard and deep, burying himself to the hilt in the milking grip of her pussy. \u201cSweet God, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Piper felt her breath catch.</p><p>Holding tight to the strength of Jed\u2019s shoulders as she fought to adapt to the width of the iron-hard cock throbbing inside her, she hadn\u2019t expected the declaration. Nor had she expected the emotion that filled it.</p><p>Forcing her eyes open, meeting his gaze, and seeing the love in his eyes had her own gaze dampening.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jed,\u201d she whispered, her breath hitching, her heart catching at the depth she knew that her love filled her.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a cell in her body that wasn\u2019t filled with the ever-deepening love she felt for him.</p> <p>Tears blurred her vision and wet her cheeks, and as his lips lowered to hers once again, the tears infused their kiss.</p><p>Piper caught her breath as his hips shifted, his cock retreating from the tightened depths of her pussy. His kisses fed the hunger raging inside her. Each fierce, deep thrust of his cock sent searing pleasure racing through every nerve ending.</p><p>Her clit, swollen and throbbing, ached for relief as each thrust of his hips pressed his pelvis into it, and each heavy penetration inside her tender cunt pushed her closer to release.</p><p>She was on the verge of begging.</p><p>Oh, God, it was like being immersed in pure pleasure.</p><p>Flames burned inside her, whipped over her flesh. They tore through her pussy, wrapped around her clit, and with each stroke inside her pushed her closer\u2014</p><p>\u201cJed, please,\u201d she begged, her neck arching, knees lifting to grip his hips tighter, to push closer with each stroke inside her. \u201cOh, God, please. Fuck me harder. . . .\u201d</p><p>A harsh groan rasped from his throat.</p><p>One hand gripped her hip as he buried his face at her neck, stinging kisses pressing against her flesh as the pace increased. Rapid-fire thrusts impaled the tender, sensitive flesh. The heat built inside her, raced through her womb, struck at her clit and in the depths of her pussy. Blinding, white-hot, and intense, the orgasm exploded inside her, flinging her from the edge of reality and tossing her into a chaotic storm of pure sensation that seemed never-ending.</p><p>Like a supernova, it expanded and burned, searing everything in its path as Jed buried himself deep inside her, stilled, then, with a heavy growl against her neck, gave in to his own release.</p><p>What she felt in that moment shouldn\u2019t have surprised her: The feeling that suddenly she and Jed inhabited the same soul, the same body, the same storm of emotion and pleasure, shouldn\u2019t have been a shock. But she had a feeling it was something she would never get used to. It was something she would never tire of experiencing.</p><p>It was a bonding, she realized as tears spilled from her eyes once again. A bonding she would never be free of. One she never wanted to be free of.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Piper.\u201d His voice was a mix of hope and desperation as he held tight to her. \u201cBeyond my last breath, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Beyond his last breath, and beyond forever itself . . .</p><p>They loved.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>It was that deepest part of the night.</p><p>That time when sound carried its best and revealed the secrets others would prefer remain hidden.</p><p>For Lyrica, it was that time of night that haunted her the most. The time that seeped into her soul, filled her with chaos, and left her staring into the darkness and hearing the secrets she had no desire to know.</p><p>It was that time when she ached for what she now knew she could never have, yet was forced to acknowledge that settling for less wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>It was that time of night when, no matter the locks on the doors, or how tightly the windows were closed, still he found a way to her. . . .</p><p>\u201cPretty Lyrica,\u201d he whispered from the darkness. \u201cDid you really think I\u2019d let you hide . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014don\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head, helpless as she felt his weight on the bed, watched his shadow come over her as he slowly drew the sheets back from her naked, aching body. \u201cPlease . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
