DON\u2019T PANIC. The answer will come to me any minute. I just have to think hard about what marriage is all about. It\u2019s about love, obviously. And companionship, and mutual support. And... soup?</p><p>My eye rests on a huge antique silver tureen, complete with ladle. Now, that would make a perfect wedding gift. I can just see it: Suze and Tarquin sitting by the fire, ladling soup into each other\u2019s bowls. It\u2019ll be all lovely and domestic and heartwarming, and every time they drink soup they\u2019ll think of me.</p><p>Perhaps I could even have it engraved. \u201cTo my best friends Suze and Tarquin on their wedding day with love and affection from Becky.\u201d And a little poem, maybe.</p> <p>Mind you, engraving is quite expensive. I\u2019d better check how much it would all come to.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, how much is this soup tureen?\u201d I say, turning to Arthur Graham, who is the owner of Graham\u2019s Antiques. This shop has to be one of my favorites in the West Village. It\u2019s small and intimate like someone\u2019s home, and everywhere you turn, there\u2019s something you might want. Like that fantastic carved chair, and a hand-painted velvet throw, and that amazing grandfather clock over in the corner...</p><p>\u201cThe tureen?\u201d Arthur comes over, dapper in his jacket and tie. \u201cThis is very special. Eighteenth-century silver. Exquisite craftsmanship. You see this detail on the rim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful!\u201d I look obediently.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s priced at...\u201d He consults a little book. \u201cFour thousand dollars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d My smile falters, and I carefully put the ladle back. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll... keep looking.\u201d</p><p>So maybe marriage isn\u2019t about soup. Maybe it\u2019s about... chess? I run my hand over a beautiful old chess set, all set up as though a game\u2019s in progress. But I\u2019m not sure Suze knows how to play chess.</p><p>A clock? No.</p><p>A... an antique barometer?</p><p>Oh God, I\u2019m really clutching at straws here. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s Suze\u2019s wedding in two days and I still haven\u2019t got her and Tarquin a present. Or at least, not one I can actually give them. Months ago I bought them this gorgeous picnic hamper, filled with picnicware, a champagne cooler, really cool knives and forks, and even a rug. It took me ages to choose all the stuff, and I was so pleased with it. But Suze phoned last night to check what time we\u2019d be arriving, and told me her aunt had just given her a fantastic present \u2014 a picnic hamper filled with Conran tableware!</p><p>Well, no way am I giving Suze the same present as someone else. So here I am in the only place I can think of where I\u2019ll find something unique. Except... what? She hasn\u2019t registered for gifts, because she says she hates the idea of asking people for things. And anyway, I\u2019d never just get her some boring set of plates off a list. Suze is my best friend, and I\u2019m going to be her bridesmaid, and my present has to be something really special.</p> <p>I can feel myself starting to get anxious. OK, just think laterally. What do Suze and Tarquin enjoy doing?</p><p>\u201cDo you have any horse saddles?\u201d I ask in sudden inspiration. \u201cOr... bridles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Oh well. Anyway, I\u2019d have to get two, wouldn\u2019t I? And they probably wouldn\u2019t even fit the horses properly...</p><p>A carved music stand? Except how would I get it home on the plane? And anyway, neither of them plays an instrument. A marble bust of Abraham Lincoln? A picture of...</p><p>Hang on a minute. I push the bust of Lincoln aside and look carefully at the old trunk he\u2019s been resting on. Now that\u2019s rather nice. In fact it\u2019s very nice. I undo the straps and gently lift the lid, inhaling the smell of old leather.</p><p>Wow. This is stunning. All pale silk and leather straps, and a mirror, and little compartments to put your cuff links in. Suze will adore this, I know she will. She can use it to keep jumpers in and when she and Tarquin go on a cruise a porter can wheel it up the ramp for her and she\u2019ll look all glamorous and film-star-like.</p><p>And the point is, even if someone else gives them a suitcase or something, one of my great maxims of life is: you can never have too much luggage.</p> <p>\u201cHow much is this trunk?\u201d I ask Arthur Graham a little nervously. Please don\u2019t let it be $10,000\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had that awhile.\u201d He frowns at it. \u201cI could let you have it for... three hundred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d I breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>Mission accomplished! I\u2019ve got Suze\u2019s wedding present! Thank goodness for that. Now all I need is my bridesmaid\u2019s dress, and I\u2019m there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss Bloomwood, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Arthur, opening a large leather-bound notebook. \u201cI\u2019m sure we have your address... And yes. Here it is.\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cIs that all for today?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t need anything else. I don\u2019t even need to look around the rest of the shop.</p><p>\u201cUm... Well.\u201d Idly I glance around again. It\u2019s always a good idea to have your eyes open when you\u2019re in antique shops, because there are some really good bargains out there. And it\u2019s all a good investment. I mean, this is how some people make their money.</p><p>Through the door to the back room I see the corner of a lace shawl, and feel a tug of desire. Antique shawls are so in at the moment. And since I\u2019m buying the trunk, it occurs to me, Arthur might give it to me for half price. Or maybe even for free!</p><p>Oh, come on. I\u2019ll just have a quick look. But only at very small things, because I\u2019ve promised Luke no more furniture.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a bit of a browse.\u201d I smile back at Arthur. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I head happily into the back room and reach for the lace shawl, but close up it looks a bit ragged. I put it down again and pick up a cocktail shaker. This is nice. Maybe I should get it for Suze as well.</p><p>\u201cThis is cool!\u201d I beam at Arthur, who has followed me in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he agrees. \u201cIt goes with the 1930s cocktail cabinet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocktail cabinet?\u201d I echo, feeling prickles of interest. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d He walks over to what I thought was a cupboard, unhooks the front flap, and displays the mirrored Art Deco fittings inside. \u201cYou see, here\u2019s where your bottles go... here are your highballs...\u201d</p><p>I gaze at it, completely smitten. A real, genuine, 1930s cocktail cabinet. I\u2019ve always wanted a cocktail cabinet.</p><p>Just think, if we had one of these in the apartment it would change our lives. Every night Luke and I would mix martinis, and dance to old-fashioned songs, and watch the sun go down. It\u2019d be so atmospheric! We\u2019d have to buy one of those old-fashioned record players with the big horns, and start collecting 78s, and I\u2019d start wearing gorgeous vintage tea dresses.</p><p>We have to have this. We have to. This isn\u2019t some boring chair, or set of shelves. This is different. Luke will understand.</p><p>\u201cHow much is that?\u201d I say, trying to sound nonchalant. I\u2019m rather good at getting good prices in this shop. The trick is to sound as though you don\u2019t care whether you buy it or not.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d Arthur looks at it thoughtfully, and I hold my breath. \u201cThis really should be seven hundred dollars. But since you\u2019re taking the trunk as well... I could let you have the pair for... eight hundred?\u201d</p> <p>Eight hundred dollars. For a wedding present and a unique cocktail cabinet that we\u2019ll treasure all our lives. I mean, this isn\u2019t like buying some pair of shoes that you\u2019ll forget about. This is a genuine investment for the future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take them!\u201d I beam at Arthur Graham.</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d He smiles back. \u201cYou have a very good eye.\u201d</p><p>Luke and I\u2019ve been living together in New York now for a year, and our apartment is on West 11th Street, in the really nice leafy, atmospheric bit. There are ornate little balconies on all the houses, and stone steps up to all the front doors, and trees all along the pavement. Right opposite us lives someone who plays jazz piano, and on summer evenings we stroll up to the roof terrace that we share with our neighbors, and sit on cushions and drink wine and listen. (At least, we did that one time and I\u2019m sure we will again.)</p><p>As I let myself into the house, there\u2019s a pile of post for us in the hall, and I quickly flick through it.</p><p>Boring...</p><p>Boring...</p><p>British Vogue!</p> <p>Boring...</p><p>Oh. My Saks Fifth Avenue store card bill.</p><p>I look at the envelope for moment, then remove it and put it in my bag. Not because I\u2019m hiding it. Simply because there\u2019s no particular point in Luke seeing it. I read this really good magazine article recently, entitled \u201cToo Much Information?\u201d in which it said you should filter out the day\u2019s events rather than tell your partner every single tiny thing and overload his or her weary mind. It said your home should be a sanctuary, and that no one needs to know everything. Which, when you think about it, makes a lot of sense.</p><p>I put the rest of the post under my arm and start to walk up the stairs. There aren\u2019t any letters from England, but then, I wouldn\u2019t expect there to be today, because tonight we\u2019re flying home for the wedding! I just can\u2019t wait.</p><p>Suze is my first friend to take the plunge and get married. She\u2019s marrying Tarquin, who\u2019s a really sweet guy she\u2019s known all her life. (In fact, he\u2019s her cousin. But it\u2019s legal. They checked.) The wedding\u2019s going to be at her parents\u2019 house in Hampshire, and there\u2019s going to be loads of champagne, and a horse and carriage... and best of all, I\u2019m going to be her bridesmaid! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the thought, I feel a pang of yearning. I\u2019m so looking forward to it. Not just being bridesmaid \u2014 but seeing Suze, my parents, and my home. It occurred to me yesterday I haven\u2019t been back to Britain for over six months, which suddenly seems like a really long time. I completely missed Dad getting elected captain of the golf club, which was his life ambition. And I missed the scandal when Siobhan at the church stole the roof money and used it to go to Cyprus. And worst of all, I missed Suze getting engaged \u2014 although she came out to New York two weeks later to show me her ring.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I mind exactly, because I\u2019m having such a great time out here. My job at Barneys is perfect, and living in the West Village is even more perfect. I love walking through the tiny tucked-away streets, and buying cupcakes at the Magnolia Bakery on Saturday mornings and walking back through the market. Basically, I love everything I have here in New York. Except possibly Luke\u2019s mother.</p><p>But still. Your home\u2019s your home.</p><p>As I reach the second floor, I hear music coming from our apartment, and I feel a little fizz of anticipation inside. That\u2019ll be Danny, working away. He\u2019ll probably have finished by now! My dress will be ready!</p> <p>Danny Kovitz lives upstairs from us, in his brother\u2019s apartment, and he\u2019s become one of my best friends since I\u2019ve been in New York. He\u2019s a fabulous designer, really talented \u2014 but he\u2019s not that successful yet. Five years after leaving fashion school, he\u2019s still waiting for his big break to come along. But like he always says, making it as a designer is even harder than making it as an actor. If you don\u2019t know the right people or have an ex-Beatle as a father, you might as well forget it. I feel so sorry for him, because he does deserve to succeed. So as soon as Suze asked me to be her bridesmaid, I asked him to make my dress. The great thing is, Suze\u2019s wedding is going to be stuffed full of rich, important guests. So hopefully loads of people will ask me who designed my dress, and then a whole word-of-mouth buzz will start, and Danny will be made!</p><p>I just can\u2019t wait to see what he\u2019s done. All the sketches he\u2019s shown me have been amazing \u2014 and of course, a handmade dress will have far more workmanship and detail than you\u2019d get off the peg. Like, the bodice is going to be a boned, hand-embroidered corset \u2014 and Danny suggested putting in a tiny beaded love-knot using the birthstones of all the bridal party, which is just so original.</p><p>My only slight worry \u2014 tiny niggle \u2014 is that the wedding\u2019s in two days\u2019 time, and I haven\u2019t actually tried the dress on yet. Or even seen it. This morning I rang Danny\u2019s doorbell to remind him I was leaving for England today, and after he\u2019d eventually staggered to the door, he promised me he\u2019d have it by lunchtime. He told me he always lets his ideas ferment until the very last minute \u2014 then he gets a surge of adrenaline and inspiration. It\u2019s just the way he works, he assured me, and he\u2019s never missed a deadline yet.</p><p>I open the door and call \u201cHello!\u201d cheerfully. There\u2019s no response, so I push open the door to our all-purpose living room. The radio is blaring Madonna, the television is playing MTV, and Danny\u2019s novelty robot dog is trying to walk up the side of the sofa.</p><p>And Danny is slumped over his sewing machine in a cloud of gold silk, fast asleep.</p> <p>\u201cDanny?\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cHey, wake up!\u201d</p><p>With a start, Danny sits up and rubs his thin face. His curly hair is rumpled, and his pale blue eyes are even more bloodshot than they were when he answered the door this morning. His skinny frame is clad in an old gray T-shirt and a bony knee is poking out of his ripped jeans, complete with a scab that he got Rollerblading this past weekend. He looks like a ten-year-old with stubble.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d he says blearily. \u201cHi! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my apartment. Remember? You were working down here because your electricity fused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d He looks around dazedly. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d I peer at him anxiously. \u201cI got some coffee.\u201d</p> <p>I hand him a cup and he takes a couple of deep gulps. Then his eyes land on the pile of mail in my hand and for the first time, he seems to wake up.</p><p>\u201cHey, is that British Vogue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d I say, putting it down where he can\u2019t reach it. \u201cSo \u2014 how\u2019s the dress doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going great! Totally under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I try it on yet?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Danny looks at the mound of gold silk in front of him as though he\u2019s never seen it before in his life.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, no,\u201d he says at last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut it will be ready in time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Absolutely.\u201d He puts his foot down and the sewing machine starts whirring busily. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he says over the noise. \u201cI could really do with a glass of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up!\u201d</p><p>I hurry into the kitchen, turn on the tap, and wait for the cold to come through. The plumbing in this building is a little bit eccentric, and we\u2019re always on at Mrs. Watts, the owner, to fix it. But she lives miles away in Florida, and doesn\u2019t really seem interested. And other than that, the place is completely wonderful. Our apartment is huge by New York standards, with wooden floors and a fireplace, and enormous floor-to-ceiling windows.</p> <p>(Of course, Mum and Dad weren\u2019t at all impressed when they came over. First they couldn\u2019t understand why we didn\u2019t live in a house. Then they couldn\u2019t understand why the kitchen was so small. Then they started saying wasn\u2019t it a shame we didn\u2019t have a garden, and did I know that Tom next door had moved into a house with a quarter of an acre? Honestly. If you had a quarter of an acre in New York, someone would just build ten office buildings on it.)</p><p>\u201cOK! So how\u2019s it\u2014\u201d I walk back into the living room and break off. The sewing machine has stopped, and Danny\u2019s reading my copy of Vogue.</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d I wail. \u201cWhat about my dress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see this?\u201d says Danny, jabbing at the page. \u201c\u2018Hamish Fargle\u2019s collection demonstrated his customary flair and wit,\u201d he reads aloud. \u201cGive me a break! He has zero talent. Zero. You know, he was at school with me. Totally ripped off one of my ideas\u2014\u201d He looks up at me, eyes narrowed. \u201cIs he stocked at Barneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... I don\u2019t know,\u201d I lie.</p> <p>Danny is completely obsessed with being stocked at Barneys. It\u2019s the only thing he wants in the world. And just because I work there as a personal shopper, he seems to think I should be able to arrange meetings with the head buyer.</p><p>In fact, I have arranged meetings with the head buyer for him. The first time, he arrived a week late for the appointment and she\u2019d gone to Milan. The second time, he was showing her a jacket and as she tried it on, all the buttons fell off.</p><p>Oh God. What was I thinking, asking him to make my dress?</p><p>\u201cDanny, just tell me. Is my dress going to be ready?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause.</p><p>\u201cDoes it actually have to be ready for today?\u201d says Danny at last. \u201cLike literally today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m catching a plane in six hours!\u201d My voice rises to a squeak. \u201cI\u2019ve got to walk down the aisle in less than...\u201d I break off and shake my head. \u201cLook, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll wear something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d Danny puts down Vogue and stares at me blankly. \u201cWhat do you mean, something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you firing me?\u201d He looks as though I\u2019ve told him our ten-year marriage is over. \u201cJust because I\u2019ve run a tad over schedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not firing you! But I mean, I can\u2019t be a bridesmaid without a dress, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what else would you wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d I twist my fingers awkwardly. \u201cI do have this one little reserve dress in my wardrobe...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t tell him I\u2019ve actually got three. And two on hold at Barneys.</p> <p>\u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... Donna Karan,\u201d I say guiltily.</p><p>\u201cDonna Karan?\u201d His voice cracks with betrayal. \u201cYou prefer Donna Karan to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! But I mean, the seams are actually sewn...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear my dress! Please!\u201d He throws himself down on the floor and walks toward me on his knees. \u201cIt\u2019ll be ready. I\u2019ll work all day and all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got all day and all night! We\u2019ve got about... three hours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll work all three hours. I\u2019ll do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can really make a boned embroidered corset from scratch in three hours?\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>Danny looks abashed. \u201cSo... um... we may have to rethink the design very slightly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He drums his fingers for a few moments, then looks up. \u201cDo you have a plain white T-shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA T-shirt?\u201d I can\u2019t hide my dismay.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great. I promise!\u201d From outside comes the chugging sound of a van pulling up and Danny glances out of the window. \u201cHey, did you buy another antique?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>An hour later I stare at myself in the mirror. I\u2019m wearing a full sweeping skirt made of gold silk \u2014 topped by my white T-shirt, which is now completely unrecognizable. Danny\u2019s ripped off the sleeves, sewn on sequins, gathered hems, created lines where there were none \u2014 and basically turned it into the most fantastic top I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d I beam at Danny. \u201cI love it! I\u2019ll be the coolest bridesmaid in the world!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Danny gives a casual shrug, but I can see he\u2019s pleased with himself.</p><p>I take another gulp of my cocktail, draining the glass. \u201cDelicious. Shall we have another one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I squint vaguely at the bottles lined up in the cocktail cabinet. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>It took a while to get the cocktail cabinet up the stairs and into our apartment. To be honest, it\u2019s a bit bigger than I remembered, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll fit into that little alcove behind the sofa where I\u2019d planned to put it. But still, it looks fantastic! It\u2019s standing proudly in the middle of the room, and we\u2019ve already put it to good use. As soon as it arrived, Danny went upstairs and raided his brother Randall\u2019s drinks cupboard, and I got all the booze I could find in the kitchen. We\u2019ve had a margarita each and a gimlet, and my invention called the Bloomwood, which consists of vodka, orange, and M&amp;M\u2019s, which you scoop out with a spoon.</p><p>\u201cGive me the top again. I want to pull in that shoulder tighter.\u201d</p><p>I peel off the top, hand it to him, and reach for my jumper, not bothering to be modest. I mean, this is Danny. He threads a needle and starts expertly gathering along the hem of the T-shirt. \u201cSo, these weird cousin-marrying friends of yours,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not weird!\u201d I hesitate for a moment. \u201cWell, OK, Tarquin is a tiny bit weird. But Suze isn\u2019t weird at all. She\u2019s my best friend! You\u2019ve met her!\u201d</p><p>Danny raises an eyebrow. \u201cSo \u2014 couldn\u2019t they find anyone else to marry except their own family? Was it like, \u2018OK, Mom\u2019s taken... my sister, too fat... the dog... mmm, don\u2019t like the hair.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d I can\u2019t help giggling. \u201cThey just suddenly realized they were meant for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Harry Met Sally.\u201d He puts on a film-trailer voice. \u201cThey were friends. They came from the same gene pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He relents, and snips off the thread. \u201cSo, what about you and Luke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think you\u2019ll get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I have no idea!\u201d I say, feeling a slight color coming to my cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s ever crossed my mind.\u201d</p><p>Which is completely true.</p><p>Well, OK. It\u2019s not completely true. Maybe it has crossed my mind on the very odd occasion. Maybe just occasionally I\u2019ve doodled \u201cBecky Brandon\u201d on my notepad to see what it looked like. And I might possibly have flicked through Martha Stewart Weddings once or twice. Just out of idle curiosity.</p><p>Perhaps, also, it\u2019s occurred to me that Suze is getting married and she\u2019s been going out with Tarquin for less time than me and Luke.</p><p>But you know. It\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m really not into weddings. In fact, if Luke asked me, I\u2019d probably say no.</p><p>Well... OK. I\u2019d probably say yes.</p> <p>But the point is, it\u2019s not going to happen. Luke doesn\u2019t want to get married \u201cfor a very long time, if at all.\u201d He said that in an interview in the Telegraph three years ago, which I found in his file of clippings. (I wasn\u2019t poking about. I was looking for an elastic band.) The piece was mainly about his business, but they asked him about personal stuff too \u2014 and then they captioned his picture Brandon: marriage at the bottom of agenda.</p><p>Which is absolutely fine by me. It\u2019s at the bottom of my agenda, too.</p><p>While Danny\u2019s finishing off the dress, I do a little housework. Which is to say I tip the dirty breakfast dishes into the sink where they can soak, dab at a spot on the counter \u2014 and then spend some time rearranging the spice jars in the spice rack, according to color. That\u2019s such a satisfying job. Almost as good as organizing my felt-tip pens used to be.</p><p>\u201cSo do you guys find it hard living together?\u201d says Danny, coming to the door and watching me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I look at him in surprise. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend Kirsty just tried living with her boyfriend. Disaster. All they did was fight. She said she doesn\u2019t know how anyone does it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slot the cumin jar next to fenugreek (what is fenugreek?), feeling rather smug. The truth is, Luke and I have had hardly any problems since living together. Except maybe the incident when I repainted the bathroom and got gold glitter paint on his new suit. But that doesn\u2019t count, because, as Luke admitted afterward, he completely overreacted, and anybody with sense would have seen that the paint was wet.</p><p>Now that I think about it, perhaps we\u2019ve had the odd teeny little dispute about how many clothes I buy. Perhaps Luke has on occasion opened the wardrobe door and said in exasperation, \u201cAre you ever going to wear any of these?\u201d</p><p>Perhaps we\u2019ve also had the odd argu-frank discussion about how many hours Luke works. He runs his own very successful financial PR company, Brandon Communications, which has branches in London and New York and is expanding all the time. He loves his work, and maybe once or twice I\u2019ve accused him of loving work more than me.</p><p>But the point is, we\u2019re a mature, flexible couple who are able to talk things through. We went out to lunch not long ago and had a long talk, during which I sincerely promised I would try to shop a bit less and Luke sincerely promised he would try to work a bit less. And I reckon we\u2019re both making a pretty good effort.</p> <p>\u201cLiving together has to be worked at,\u201d I say wisely. \u201cYou have to be flexible. You have to give as well as take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Luke and I share our finances, we share the chores... it\u2019s all a matter of teamwork. The point is, you can\u2019t expect everything to stay as it was before. You have to accommodate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Danny looks interested. \u201cSo who do you think accommodates more? You or Luke?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m thoughtful for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say, really,\u201d I say at last. \u201cI expect it\u2019s about equal on both sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, like... all this stuff.\u201d Danny gestures around the cluttered apartment. \u201cIs it mostly yours or mostly his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I look around, taking in all my aromatherapy candles, vintage lace cushions, and stacks of magazines. For an instant, my mind flicks back to the immaculate, minimalist apartment Luke had in London.</p><p>\u201cYou know...\u201d I say at last. \u201cA bit of both...\u201d</p><p>Which is kind of true. I mean, Luke\u2019s got his laptop in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cThe point is, there\u2019s no friction between us,\u201d I continue. \u201cWe think as one. We\u2019re like one unit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d says Danny, reaching for an apple from the fruit bowl. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we are.\u201d I look at him confidingly. \u201cYou know, Luke and I are so in tune, sometimes there\u2019s almost a... sixth sense between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Danny stares at me. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes. I\u2019ll know what he\u2019s about to say, or I\u2019ll kind of feel when he\u2019s around...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike The Force?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d I give a nonchalant shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s like a gift. I don\u2019t question it too closely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreetings, Obi-Wan Kenobi,\u201d says a deep voice behind us, and Danny and I both jump out of our skins. I swivel round \u2014 and there\u2019s Luke, standing at the door with an amused grin. His face is flushed from the cold and there are snowflakes in his dark hair, and he\u2019s so tall, the room suddenly seems a little smaller.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cYou scared us!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI assumed you would feel my presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, I did kind of feel something...\u201d I say, a little defiantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d He gives me a kiss. \u201cHi, Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d says Danny, watching as Luke takes off his navy cashmere coat, then loosens his cuffs while simultaneously unknotting his tie, with the same assured, deft movements he always makes.</p><p>Once, after a few too many cocktails, Danny asked me, \u201cDoes Luke make love the same way he opens a champagne bottle?\u201d And although I shrieked and hit him, and said it was none of his business, I could kind of see what he meant. Luke never fumbles or hesitates or looks confused. He always seems to know exactly what he wants, and he pretty much gets it, whether it\u2019s a champagne bottle opening smoothly or a new client for his company, or, in bed, for us to...</p><p>Well. Anyway. Let\u2019s just say, since we\u2019ve been living together, my horizons have been broadened.</p><p>Now he picks up the post and starts to leaf briskly through it. \u201cSo how are you, Danny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks,\u201d says Danny, taking a bite of apple. \u201cHow\u2019s the world of high finance? Did you see my brother today?\u201d Danny\u2019s brother Randall works in a financing company, and Luke\u2019s had lunch with him a couple of times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot today, no,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cOK, well, when you do,\u201d says Danny, \u201cask him if he\u2019s put on weight. Really casually. Just say, \u2018Why, Randall, you\u2019re looking well-covered.\u2019 And then maybe comment on his choice of entree. He is so paranoid that he\u2019s getting fat. It\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrotherly love,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He comes to the end of the post and looks at me with a slight frown.</p><p>\u201cBecky, has our joint account statement come yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr... no. Not yet.\u201d I give him a reassuring smile. \u201cI expect it\u2019ll come tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>Our bank statement actually came yesterday, but I put it straight in my underwear drawer. I\u2019m slightly concerned about some of the entries, so I\u2019m just going to see if there\u2019s anything I can do to rectify the situation. The truth is, despite what I said to Danny, I\u2019ve been finding this whole joint account thing a bit tricky.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for sharing money. In fact, hand on heart, I love sharing Luke\u2019s money. It gives me a real buzz! I just don\u2019t love it when he suddenly asks, \u201cWhat was this seventy dollars in Bloomingdale\u2019s for?\u201d and I can\u2019t remember. So I\u2019ve worked out a whole new tactical response \u2014 which is so simple, it\u2019s brilliant.</p><p>It\u2019s to spill something on the statement, so he can\u2019t read it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d says Luke, gathering up the post. And he\u2019s almost out of the room \u2014 when he stops. Very slowly he turns back and looks at the cocktail cabinet as though seeing it for the first time.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he says slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cocktail cabinet!\u201d I say brightly.</p><p>\u201cWhere has it come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt... umm... actually, I bought it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky...\u201d Luke closes his eyes. \u201cI thought we said no more crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not crap! It\u2019s genuine 1930s! We can make amazing cocktails every night!\u201d I\u2019m feeling a bit nervous at his expression, so I start to gabble. \u201cLook, I know we said no more furniture. But this is different. I mean, when you see a one-off like this, you have to grab it!\u201d</p> <p>I trail away and bite my lip. Luke silently walks toward the cabinet. He runs a hand along the top, then picks up a cocktail shaker, his mouth tight.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I just thought it would be fun! I thought you\u2019d like it. The guy in the shop said I\u2019ve got a really good eye...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA really good eye,\u201d echoes Luke as though in disbelief.</p><p>I gasp and scream as he throws the cocktail shaker in the air, and I\u2019m wincing, waiting for it to land with a crash on the wooden floor \u2014 when Luke neatly catches it. Danny and I gape as he throws it again, twirls round, and rolls it down his arm.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m living with Tom Cruise.</p><p>\u201cI worked as a barman for a summer,\u201d says Luke, his face breaking into a smile.</p><p>I never knew that! Luke is so driven and businesslike and you think he doesn\u2019t care about anything except work... and then all of a sudden, he surprises you.</p><p>\u201cTeach me how to do it!\u201d I cry excitedly. \u201cI want to be able to do that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd me!\u201d says Danny. He picks up the other cocktail shaker, gives it an inexpert twirl, then tosses it at me. I make a grab, but it lands on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cButterfingers!\u201d mocks Danny. \u201cCome on, Becky. You need to get in practice for catching the bouquet at this wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. You wanna be next, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny...\u201d I try to give a lighthearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou two should definitely get married,\u201d Danny continues, ignoring me. He picks up the cocktail shaker and begins tossing it from hand to hand. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect. Look at you. You live together, you don\u2019t want to kill each other, you\u2019re not already related... I could make you a fabulous dress...\u201d He puts down the shaker with a suddenly intent expression. \u201cHey, listen, Becky. Promise me, if you get married, I can make your dress.\u201d</p><p>This is appalling. If he carries on like this, Luke will think I\u2019m trying to pressure him. He might even think I told Danny to bring up the subject deliberately.</p><p>I\u2019ve got to redress the balance somehow. Quickly.</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t want to get married,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cNot for at least ten years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Danny looks taken aback. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Luke looks up with an unreadable expression. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201d I reply, trying to sound nonchalant. \u201cWell... now you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to get married for ten years?\u201d says Danny.</p><p>\u201cI... erm...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cAs it happens, I have a lot of things I want to do first. I want to concentrate on my career, and I want to... explore my full potential... and... get to know the real me first... and... be a whole... umm... rounded person.\u201d</p><p>I tail off and meet Luke\u2019s quizzical gaze slightly defiantly.</p> <p>\u201cI see,\u201d he says, nodding. \u201cWell, that sounds very sensible.\u201d He looks at the cocktail shaker in his hand, then puts it down. \u201cI\u2019d better go and pack.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t supposed to agree with me.</p><p>Two</p><p>WE ARRIVE AT Heathrow at seven the next morning and pick up our rental car. As we drive along to Suze\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Hampshire, I peer blearily out of the window at the snowy countryside, the hedgerows and fields and little villages, as though I\u2019ve never seen them before. After Manhattan, everything looks so tiny and pretty. For the first time I realize why Americans go around calling everything in England \u201cquaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich way now?\u201d says Luke, as we arrive at yet another little crossroads.</p> <p>\u201cErm, you definitely turn left here. I mean... right. No, I mean left.\u201d</p><p>As the car swings round, I fish in my bag for the invitation, just to check the exact address.</p><p>Sir Gilbert and Lady Cleath-Stuart</p><p>request the pleasure of your company...</p><p>I stare, slightly mesmerized, at the grand swirly writing. God, I still can\u2019t quite believe Suze and Tarquin are getting married.</p><p>I mean, of course I believe it. After all, they\u2019ve been going out for well over a year now, and Tarquin\u2019s basically moved into the flat I used to share with Suze \u2014 although they seem to be spending more and more time in Scotland. They\u2019re both really sweet and laid back, and everyone\u2019s agreed that they make a brilliant couple.</p> <p>But just occasionally, when I\u2019m not concentrating, my mind will suddenly yell, \u201cWhaat? Suze and Tarquin?\u201d</p><p>I mean, Tarquin used to be Suze\u2019s weird geeky cousin. For years he was just that awkward guy in the corner with the ancient jacket and a tendency to hum Wagner in public places. He was the guy who rarely ventured beyond the safe haven of his Scottish castle \u2014 and when he did, it was to take me on the worst date of my life (although we don\u2019t talk about that anymore).</p><p>But now he\u2019s... well, he\u2019s Suze\u2019s boyfriend. Still slightly awkward, and still prone to wearing woolly jumpers knitted by his old nanny. Still a bit tatty round the edges. But Suze loves him, and that\u2019s what counts.</p><p>Oh God, I can\u2019t start crying yet. I have to pace myself.</p><p>\u201cHarborough Hall,\u201d reads Luke, pausing at a pair of crumbling stone pillars. \u201cIs this it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I sniff, and try to look businesslike. \u201cYes, this is it. Just drive in.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been to Suze\u2019s house plenty of times before, but I always forget quite how impressive it is. We sweep down a great big long avenue lined with trees and into a circular gravel drive. The house is large and gray and ancient-looking, with pillars at the front and ivy growing over it.</p><p>\u201cNice house,\u201d says Luke as we head toward the huge front door. \u201cHow old is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDunno,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cIt\u2019s been in their family for years.\u201d I tug at the bell pull to see if by any remote chance it\u2019s been mended \u2014 but it obviously hadn\u2019t. I knock a couple of times with the heavy door knocker \u2014 and when there\u2019s no answer to that either, I push my way into the huge flagstoned hall, where an old Labrador is asleep by a crackling fire.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I call. \u201cSuze?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I notice that Suze\u2019s father is also asleep by the fireplace, in a large winged armchair. I\u2019m a bit scared of Suze\u2019s father, actually. I certainly don\u2019t want to wake him up.</p><p>\u201cSuze?\u201d I say, more quietly.</p><p>\u201cBex! I thought I heard something!\u201d</p><p>I look up \u2014 and there\u2019s Suze standing on the staircase, in a tartan dressing gown with her blond hair streaming down her back and a huge excited smile.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d</p><p>I bound up the stairs and give her a huge hug. As I pull away we\u2019re both a bit pink about the eyes, and I give a shaky laugh. God, I\u2019ve missed Suze, even more than I\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cCome up to my room!\u201d says Suze, tugging my hand. \u201cCome and see my dress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it really lovely?\u201d I say excitedly. \u201cIn the picture it looked amazing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just perfect!

There\u2019s coffee and newspapers and stuff in the kitchen, through there.\u201d She points down a corridor. \u201cYou can have bacon and eggs if you like! Mrs. Gearing will make them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Gearing sounds like my kind of woman,\u201d says Luke with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p> <p>Suze\u2019s room is light and airy and overlooks the garden. I say garden. It\u2019s about twelve thousand acres, with lawns running down from the back of the house to a clump of cedar trees and a lake, which Suze nearly drowned in once when she was three. There\u2019s also a walled rose garden to the left, all flower beds and gravel paths and hedges, which is where Tarquin proposed to Suze. (Apparently he got down on one knee and when he stood up, gravel was clinging to his trousers. That is so Tarquin.) On the right there\u2019s an old tennis court and then rough grass, extending all the way to a hedge, beyond which is the village church graveyard. As I look out of the window now, I can see a huge marquee billowing to the rear of the house, and a tented walkway being put up, which will snake past the tennis court and over the grass, all the way to the churchyard gate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to walk to the church?\u201d I say, suddenly fearful for Suze\u2019s Emma Hope shoes.</p><p>\u201cNo, silly! I\u2019m going in the carriage. But all the guests can walk back to the house, and there\u2019ll be people handing out hot whiskeys as they go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s going to be spectacular!\u201d I say, watching as a man in jeans begins to hammer a stake into the ground. And in spite of myself, I can\u2019t help feeling a twinge of envy. I\u2019ve always dreamed of having some huge, amazing wedding, with horses and carriages and lots of hoopla, ever since...</p><p>Well, since...</p> <p>To be completely, perfectly honest, ever since Princess Diana\u2019s wedding. I was six years old when we all watched it round at our neighbor Janice\u2019s house, and I can still remember goggling at her as she got out of the carriage in that dress. It was like Cinderella come to life. It was better than Cinderella. I wanted to be her so much, it hurt. Mum had bought me a commemorative book of photographs called Diana\u2019s Big Day \u2014 and the next day I spent ages making my own version called Becky\u2019s Big Day, with lots of drawings of me in a big frilly dress, wearing a crown. (And, in some versions, carrying a magic wand.)</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ve moved on a little since then. I don\u2019t dream about wearing a crumpled cream-colored lampshade for a wedding dress. I\u2019ve even given up on marrying a member of the royal family. But still, whenever I see a wedding, part of me turns back into that starry-eyed six-year-old.</p><p>\u201cI know! Isn\u2019t it going to be great?\u201d Suze beams happily. \u201cNow, I must just brush my teeth...\u201d</p><p>She disappears into the bathroom and I wander over to her dressing table, where the announcement of the engagement is stuck in the mirror. The Hon. Susan Cleath-Stuart and The Hon. Tarquin Cleath-Stuart. Blimey. I always forget Suze is so grand.</p><p>\u201cI want a title,\u201d I say, as Suze comes back into the room with a hairbrush in her hair. \u201cI feel all left out. How do I get one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, no you don\u2019t,\u201d says Suze, wrinkling her nose. \u201cThey\u2019re crap. People send you letters saying Dear Ms. Hon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill. It\u2019d be so cool. What could I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d Suze tugs at a tangle in her hair. \u201cDame Becky Bloomwood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me sound about ninety-three,\u201d I say doubtfully. \u201cWhat about... Becky Bloomwood MBE. Those MBE things are quite easy to get, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy-peasy,\u201d says Suze confidently. \u201cYou could get one for services to industry or something. I\u2019ll nominate you, if you like. Now come on, I want to see your dress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d I heave my case onto the bed, click it open, and carefully draw out Danny\u2019s creation. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I proudly hold it up against myself and swoosh the gold silk around. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic!\u201d says Suze, staring at it with wide eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it!\u201d She fingers the sequins on the shoulder. \u201cWhere did you get it? Is this the one from Barneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is the one from Danny. Remember, I told you he was making me a dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She screws up her face. \u201cWhich one\u2019s Danny, again?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy upstairs neighbor,\u201d I remind her. \u201cThe designer.

He was on his way to visit his parents in Connecticut and she was pretty jet-lagged at the time and they barely spoke. Still. It\u2019s weird to think that Suze doesn\u2019t really know Danny, and he doesn\u2019t know her, when they\u2019re both so important to me. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve got two completely separate lives, and the longer I\u2019m in New York, the farther they split apart.</p> <p>\u201cOK, here\u2019s mine,\u201d says Suze excitedly.</p><p>She opens a wardrobe door and unzips a calico cover \u2014 and there\u2019s a simply stunning dress, all drifting white silk and velvet with long sleeves and a traditional long train.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Suze,\u201d I breathe, my throat tight. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be so completely beautiful. I still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re getting married! \u2018Mrs. Cleath-Stuart.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, don\u2019t call me that!\u201d says Suze, wrinkling her nose. \u201cIt sounds like my mother. But actually it is quite handy marrying someone in the family,\u201d she adds, closing the wardrobe, \u201cbecause I can keep my name and take his, all at the same time. So I can keep being S C-S for my frames.\u201d She reaches into a cardboard box and pulls out a beautiful glass frame, all spirals and whorls. \u201cLook, this is the new range\u2014\u201d</p><p>Suze\u2019s career is designing photograph frames, which sell all over the country, and last year she diversified into photograph albums, wrapping paper, and gift boxes too.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole theme is shell shapes,\u201d she says proudly. \u201cD\u2019you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful!\u201d I say, running my finger round the spirals. \u201cHow did you come up with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got the idea from Tarkie, actually! We were out walking one day and he was saying how he used to collect shells when he was a child and about all the different amazing shapes in nature... and then it hit me!\u201d</p><p>I look at her face, all lit up, and have a sudden image of her and Tarquin walking hand in hand on the blustery moors, in Aran sweaters by The Scotch House.</p><p>\u201cSuze, you\u2019re going to be so happy with Tarquin,\u201d I say heartfeltly.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think?\u201d She flushes with pleasure. \u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely. I mean, look at you! You\u2019re simply glowing!\u201d</p><p>Which is true. I hadn\u2019t really noticed it before, but she looks completely different from the old Suze. She\u2019s still got the same delicate nose and high cheekbones, but her face is rounder, and kind of softer. And she\u2019s still slim, but there\u2019s a kind of a fullness... almost a...</p><p>My gaze runs down her body and stops.</p><p>Hang on a minute.</p><p>No. Surely...</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cSuze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuze, are you...\u201d I swallow. \u201cYou\u2019re not... pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she replies indignantly. \u201cOf course not! Honestly, whatever can have given you\u2014\u201d She meets my eye, breaks off, and shrugs. \u201cOh, all right then, yes I am. How did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did I guess? From you... I mean, you look pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t! No one else has guessed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey must have. It\u2019s completely obvious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t!\u201d She sucks in her stomach and looks at herself in the mirror. \u201cYou see? And once I\u2019ve got my Rigby and Peller on...\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t get my head round this. Suze is pregnant!</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 is it a secret? Don\u2019t your parents know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no! Nobody knows. Not even Tarkie.\u201d She pulls a face. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit tacksville, being pregnant on your wedding day, don\u2019t you think? I thought I\u2019d pretend it\u2019s a honeymoon baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must be at least three months gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour months. It\u2019s due at the beginning of June.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her. \u201cSo how on earth are you going to pretend it\u2019s a honeymoon baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She thinks for a moment. \u201cIt could be a bit premature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour whole months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK then. I\u2019ll think of something else,\u201d says Suze airily. \u201cIt\u2019s ages away. Anyway, the important thing is, don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. I won\u2019t.\u201d Gingerly I reach out and touch her stomach. Suze is having a baby. She\u2019s going to be a mother. And Tarquin\u2019s going to be a father. God, it\u2019s like we\u2019re all suddenly growing up or something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suze is right on one point at least. Once she\u2019s squeezed into her corset, you can\u2019t see the bulge at all. In fact, as we both sit in front of her dressing table on the morning of the wedding, grinning excitedly at each other, she actually looks thinner than me, which is a tad unfair.</p><p>We\u2019ve had such a great couple of days, chilling out, watching old videos and eating endless KitKats. (Suze is eating for two, and I need energy after my transatlantic flight.) Luke brought some paperwork with him and has spent most of the time in the library \u2014 but for once I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s just been so nice to be able to spend some time with Suze. I\u2019ve heard all about the flat she and Tarquin are buying in London and I\u2019ve seen pictures of the gorgeous hotel on Antigua where she and Tarquin are going for their honeymoon, and I\u2019ve tried on most of the new clothes in her wardrobe.</p><p>There\u2019s been loads going on all over the house, with florists and caterers and relations arriving every minute. What\u2019s a bit weird is, none of the family seems particularly bothered by it. Suze\u2019s mother has been out hunting both the days that I\u2019ve been here, and her father has been in his study. Mrs. Gearing, their housekeeper, is the one who\u2019s been organizing the marquee and flowers and everything \u2014 and even she seems pretty relaxed. When I asked Suze about it she just shrugged and said, \u201cI suppose we\u2019re used to throwing big parties.\u201d</p><p>Last night there was a grand drinks party for Suze and Tarquin\u2019s relations who have all come down from Scotland, and I was expecting everyone to be talking about the wedding then, at least. But every time I tried to get anyone excited about the flowers, or how romantic it all was, I got blank looks. It was only when Suze mentioned that Tarquin was going to buy her a horse as a wedding present that they all suddenly got animated, and started talking about breeders they knew, and horses they\u2019d bought, and how their great chum had a very nice young chestnut mare Suze might be interested in.</p> <p>I mean, honestly. No one even asked me what my dress was like.</p><p>Anyway. I don\u2019t care, because it looks wonderful. We both look wonderful. We\u2019ve both been made up by a fantastic makeup artist, and our hair is up in sleek chignons. The photographer has taken so-called \u201ccandid\u201d pictures of me buttoning Suze into her dress (he made us do it three times, in fact my arms were aching by the end). Now Suze is umming and aahing over about six family tiaras while I take sips of champagne. Just to keep me from getting nervous.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d says the hairdresser to Suze, as she pulls wispy blond tendrils round her face. \u201cDoes she want a blow-dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d says Suze, pulling a face. \u201cShe\u2019s not really into that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she wearing?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cGod knows,\u201d says Suze. \u201cThe first thing that comes to hand, probably.\u201d She meets my eye, and I pull a tiny sympathetic face. Last night Suze\u2019s mother came downstairs for drinks in a dirndl skirt and patterned woolly jumper, with a large diamond brooch on the front. Mind you, Tarquin\u2019s mother looked even worse. I really don\u2019t know where Suze has managed to get her sense of style.</p><p>\u201cBex, could you just go and make sure she doesn\u2019t put on some hideous old gardening dress?\u201d says Suze. \u201cShe\u2019ll listen to you, I know she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d I say doubtfully. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>As I let myself out of the room, I see Luke coming along the corridor in his morning dress.</p><p>\u201cYou look very beautiful,\u201d he says with a smile.</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d I do a little twirl. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely dress, isn\u2019t it? And it fits so well\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at the dress,\u201d says Luke. His eyes meet mine with a wicked glint and I feel a flicker of pleasure. \u201cIs Suze decent?\u201d he adds. \u201cI just wanted to wish her well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say. \u201cGo on in. Hey, Luke, you\u2019ll never guess!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been absolutely dying to tell Luke about Suze\u2019s baby for the last two days, and now the words slip out before I can stop them.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...\u201d I can\u2019t tell him, I just can\u2019t. Suze would kill me. \u201cShe\u2019s... got a really nice wedding dress,\u201d I finish lamely.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d says Luke, giving me a curious look. \u201cThere\u2019s a surprise. Well, I\u2019ll just pop in and have a quick word. See you later.\u201d</p><p>I cautiously make my way to Suze\u2019s mother\u2019s bedroom and give a gentle knock.</p><p>\u201cHellooo?\u201d thunders a voice in return, and the door is flung open by Suze\u2019s mother, Caroline. She\u2019s about six feet tall with long rangy legs, gray hair in a knot, and a weatherbeaten face that creases into a smile when she sees me.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d she booms, and looks at her watch. \u201cNot time yet, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite!\u201d I smile gingerly and run my eyes over her outfit of ancient navy blue sweatshirt, jodhpurs, and riding boots. She\u2019s got an amazing figure for a woman her age. No wonder Suze is so skinny. I glance around the room, but I can\u2019t see any telltale suit-carriers or hatboxes.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, Caroline... I was just wondering what you were planning to wear today. As mother of the bride!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother of the bride?\u201d She stares at me. \u201cGood God, I suppose I am. Hadn\u2019t thought of it like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight! So, you... haven\u2019t got a special outfit ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBit early to be dressing up, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Caroline. \u201cI\u2019ll just fling something on before we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t I help you choose?\u201d I say firmly, and head toward the wardrobe. I throw open the doors, preparing myself for a shock \u2014 and gape in astonishment.</p><p>This has got to be the most extraordinary collection of clothes I\u2019ve ever seen. Riding habits, ball dresses, and thirties suits are jostling for space with Indian saris, Mexican ponchos... and an extraordinary array of tribal jewelry.</p><p>\u201cThese clothes!\u201d I breathe.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Caroline looks at them dismissively. \u201cA load of old rubbish, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld rubbish? My God, if you found any of these in a vintage shop in New York...\u201d I pull out a pale blue satin coat edged with ribbon. \u201cThis is fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you like it?\u201d says Caroline in surprise. \u201cHave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear girl, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely the sentimental value... I mean, your memories\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy memories are in here.\u201d She taps her head. \u201cNot in there.\u201d She surveys the melee of clothes, then picks up a small piece of bone on a leather cord. \u201cNow, this I\u2019m rather fond of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat?\u201d I say, trying to summon some enthusiasm. \u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was given to me by a Masai chief, many years ago now. We were driving at dawn to find a pride of elephants, when a chieftain flagged us down. A tribeswoman was in a fever after giving birth. We helped bring down her temperature and the tribe honored us with gifts. Have you been to the Masai Mara, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no. I\u2019ve never actually been to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this little lovely.\u201d She picks up an embroidered purse. \u201cI bought this at a street market in Konya. Bartered for it with my last packet of cigarettes before we trekked up the Nemrut Dagi. Have you been to Turkey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not there, either,\u201d I say, feeling rather inadequate. God, I feel undertraveled. I scrabble around in my mind, trying to think of somewhere I\u2019ve been that will impress her \u2014 but it\u2019s a pretty paltry lineup, now that I think about it. France a few times, Spain, Crete... and that\u2019s about it. Why haven\u2019t I been anywhere exciting? Why haven\u2019t I been trekking round Mongolia?</p><p>I was going to go to Thailand once, come to think of it. But then I decided to go to France instead and spend the money I saved on a Lulu Guinness handbag.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t really traveled much at all,\u201d I admit reluctantly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you must, dear girl!\u201d booms Caroline. \u201cYou must broaden your horizons. Learn about life from real people. One of the dearest friends I have in the world is a Bolivian peasant woman. We ground maize together on the plains of the Llanos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>A little clock on the mantelpiece chimes the half hour, and I suddenly realize we\u2019re not getting anywhere.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway... did you have any ideas for a wedding outfit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething warm and colorful,\u201d says Caroline, reaching for a thick red and yellow poncho.</p><p>\u201cErm... I\u2019m not so sure that would be entirely appropriate...\u201d I push between the jackets and dresses, and suddenly see a flash of apricot silk. \u201cOoh! This is nice.\u201d I haul it out \u2014 and I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s Balenciaga.</p><p>\u201cMy going-away outfit,\u201d says Caroline reminiscently. \u201cWe traveled on the Orient Express to Venice, then explored the caves of Postojna. Do you know that region?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to wear this!\u201d I say, my voice rising to a squeak of excitement. \u201cYou\u2019ll look spectacular. And it\u2019s so romantic, wearing your own going-away outfit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it might be rather fun.\u201d She holds it up against herself with red, weatherbeaten hands that make me wince every time I look at them. \u201cThat should still fit, shouldn\u2019t it? Now, there must be a hat around here somewhere...\u201d She puts down the suit and starts rooting around on a shelf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo \u2014 you must be really happy for Suze,\u201d I say, picking up an enameled hand mirror and examining it.</p><p>\u201cTarquin\u2019s a dear boy.\u201d She turns round and taps her beaky nose confidentially. \u201cVery well endowed.\u201d</p><p>This is true.

But I\u2019m a bit surprised at Suze\u2019s mother bringing it up.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes...\u201d I say. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t suppose Suze really needs the money...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about money!\u201d She gives me a knowing smile and suddenly I realize what she means.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I feel myself blushing furiously. \u201cRight! I see!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the Cleath-Stuart men are the same. They\u2019re famous for it. Never a divorce in the family,\u201d she adds, plonking a green felt hat on top of her head.</p><p>Gosh. I\u2019m going to look at Tarquin a bit differently now.</p><p>It takes me a while to persuade Caroline out of the green felt hat and into a chic black cloche. As I\u2019m walking back along the corridor toward Suze\u2019s room, I hear some familiar voices in the hall downstairs.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge. Foot-and-mouth was caused by carrier pigeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPigeons? You\u2019re telling me that this huge epidemic, which has wiped out stocks of cattle across Europe, was caused by a few harmless pigeons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarmless?

Dad\u2019s in morning dress with a top hat under his arm, and Mum\u2019s dressed in a navy jacket, floral skirt, and bright red shoes, which don\u2019t quite match her red hat.</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum! Dad!\u201d I hurry down the stairs and envelop them both in a hug, breathing in the familiar scent of Yardley\u2019s talc and Tweed.</p><p>This trip is getting more emotional by the minute. I haven\u2019t seen my parents since they came out to visit me in New York four months ago. And even then, they only stayed for three days before going off to Florida to see the Everglades.</p><p>\u201cMum, you look amazing! Have you done something to your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaureen put some highlights in,\u201d she says, looking pleased. \u201cAnd I popped next door to Janice this morning, so she could do my face. You know, she\u2019s taken a course in professional makeup. She\u2019s a real expert!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can... see!\u201d I say feebly, looking at the lurid stripes of blusher and highlighter painted on Mum\u2019s cheeks. Maybe I can manage to wipe them off accidentally on purpose.</p><p>\u201cSo, is Luke here?\u201d says Mum, looking around with bright eyes, like a squirrel searching for a nut.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere around,\u201d I say \u2014 and Mum and Dad exchange glances.</p><p>\u201cHe is here, though?\u201d Mum gives a tense little laugh. \u201cYou did fly on the same plane, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMum, don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s here. Really.\u201d</p><p>Mum still doesn\u2019t look convinced \u2014 and I can\u2019t honestly blame her. The truth is, there was this tiny incident at the last wedding we all attended. Luke didn\u2019t turn up, and I was completely desperate, and I resorted to... um...</p><p>Well. It was only a tiny white lie. I mean, he could have been there, mingling somewhere. If they hadn\u2019t had that stupid group photograph, no one would ever have known.</p><p>\u201cJane! Graham! Hello!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s Luke, striding through the front door. Thank God for that.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d Mum gives a relieved trill of laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re here! Graham, he\u2019s here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s here!\u201d says my father, rolling his eyes. \u201cWhere did you think he was? On the moon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Jane?\u201d says Luke with a smile, and kisses her on the cheek.</p><p>Mum\u2019s face is pink with happiness, and she\u2019s clutching onto Luke\u2019s arm as though he might vanish in a puff of smoke. He gives me a little smile, and I beam happily back. I\u2019ve been looking forward to this day for so long, and now it\u2019s actually here. It\u2019s like Christmas. In fact, it\u2019s better than Christmas. Through the open front door I can see wedding guests walking past on the snowy gravel in morning dress and smart hats. In the distance, the church bells are pealing, and there\u2019s a kind of excited, expectant atmosphere.</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s the blushing bride?\u201d says Dad.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d comes Suze\u2019s voice. We all look up \u2014 and there she is, floating down the stairs, clutching a stunning bouquet of roses and ivy.</p><p>\u201cOh, Suzie,\u201d says Mum, and claps a hand to her mouth. \u201cOh, that dress! Oh... Becky! You\u2019re going to look\u2014\u201d She turns to me with softened eyes and for the first time seems to take in my dress. \u201cBecky... is that what you\u2019re wearing? You\u2019ll freeze!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.

Don\u2019t you have to match the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any others,\u201d explains Suze. \u201cThe only other person I would have asked is Tarquin\u2019s sister, Fenny. But she said if she was a bridesmaid again she\u2019d jinx her chances of marriage. You know what they say, \u2018Three times a bridesmaid.\u2019 Well, she\u2019s been one about ninety-three times! And she\u2019s got her eye on this chap who works in the City, so she doesn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a short silence. I can see Mum\u2019s brain working hard. Oh God, please don\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky love, how many times have you been a bridesmaid?\u201d she says, a little too casually. \u201cThere was Uncle Malcolm and Aunt Sylvia\u2019s wedding... but I think that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Ruthie and Paul\u2019s,\u201d I remind her.</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t a bridesmaid at that,\u201d says Mum at once. \u201cYou were a... flower girl. So it\u2019s twice, including today. Yes, twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get that, Luke?\u201d says Dad with a grin. \u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, what are my parents like?</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway!\u201d I say, trying quickly to think of another subject. \u201cSo... er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Becky has a good ten years before she needs to worry about anything like that...\u201d says Luke conversationally.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mum stiffens, and her eyes dart from Luke to me and back again. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky wants to wait at least ten years before she gets married,\u201d says Luke. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, Becky?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a stunned silence. I can feel my face growing hot.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I clear my throat and try to give a nonchalant smile. \u201cThat\u2019s... that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Suze, staring at me, wide-eyed. \u201cI never knew that! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can... um... explore my full potential,\u201d I mumble, not daring to look at Mum. \u201cAnd... get to know the real me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to know the real you?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice is slightly shrill. \u201cWhy do you need ten years to do that? I could show it to you in ten minutes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Bex, how old will you be in ten years\u2019 time?\u201d says Suze, wrinkling her brow.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t necessarily need ten whole years exactly,\u201d I say, feeling a little rattled. \u201cYou know, maybe... eight will be long enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEight?\u201d Mum looks as though she wants to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d says Suze, looking perturbed. \u201cDid you know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe discussed it the other day,\u201d says Luke with an easy smile.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she persists. \u201cWhat about the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time?\u201d Luke cuts her off neatly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I think we should all get going. You know, it\u2019s five to two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes?\u201d Suze suddenly looks petrified. \u201cReally? But I\u2019m not ready! Bex, where are your flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... in your room, I think. I put them down somewhere...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get them! And where\u2019s Daddy got to? Oh shit, I want a cigarette\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, you can\u2019t smoke!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for the\u2014\u201d I stop myself just in time.</p><p>\u201cFor the dress?\u201d suggests Luke helpfully.</p><p>\u201cYes. She might... drop ash on it.\u201d</p><p>By the time I\u2019ve found my flowers in Suze\u2019s bathroom, redone my lipstick, and come downstairs again, only Luke is left in the hall.</p><p>\u201cYour parents have gone over,\u201d he says. \u201cSuze says we should go over too, and she\u2019ll come with her father in the carriage. And I\u2019ve found a coat for you,\u201d he adds, proffering a sheepskin jacket. \u201cYour mother\u2019s right, you can\u2019t walk over like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I agree reluctantly. \u201cBut I\u2019m taking it off in the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know your dress is unraveling at the back, by the way?\u201d he says as he puts it on.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look at him in dismay. \u201cDoes it look awful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks very nice.\u201d His mouth twitches into a smile. \u201cBut you might want to find a safety pin after the service.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBloody Danny!\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI knew I should have gone for Donna Karan.\u201d</p><p>As Luke and I make our way over the gravel to the tented walkway, the air is still and silent and a watery sun is coming out. The pealing bells have diminished to a single chiming, and there\u2019s no one about except a sole scurrying waiter. Everyone else must already be inside.</p><p>\u201cSorry if I brought up a sensitive subject just then,\u201d says Luke as we begin to walk toward the church.</p><p>\u201cSensitive?\u201d I raised my eyebrows. \u201cOh, what, that. That\u2019s not a sensitive subject at all!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour mother seemed a bit upset...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum? Honestly, she\u2019s not bothered either way. In fact... she was joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, a little defiantly. \u201cJoking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Luke takes my arm as I stumble slightly on the matting. \u201cSo you\u2019re still determined to wait eight years before you get married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I nod. \u201cAt least eight years.\u201d</p><p>In the distance I can hear hooves on gravel, which must be Suze\u2019s carriage setting off.</p><p>\u201cOr you know, maybe six,\u201d I add casually. \u201cOr... five, possibly. It all depends.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence, broken only by the soft, rhythmic sound of our footsteps on the walkway. The atmosphere is growing very strange between us, and I don\u2019t quite dare look at Luke. I clear my throat and rub my nose, and try to think of a comment about the weather.</p><p>We reach the church gate, and Luke turns to look at me \u2014 and suddenly his face is stripped of its usual quizzical expression.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Becky,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you really want to wait five years?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, confused. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment of stillness between us, and my heart starts to thump.</p><p>Oh my God. Oh my God. Maybe he\u2019s going to... Maybe he\u2019s about to\u2014</p><p>\u201cAh! The bridesmaid!\u201d The vicar bustles out of the porch and Luke and I both jump. \u201cAll set to walk up the aisle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, er... think so,\u201d I say, aware of Luke\u2019s gaze. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! You\u2019d better get inside!\u201d adds the vicar to Luke. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to miss the moment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, after a pause. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He drops a kiss on my shoulder and walks inside without saying anything else, and I stare after him, still completely confused.</p> <p>Did we just talk about... Was Luke really saying...</p><p>Then there\u2019s the sound of hooves, and I\u2019m jolted out of my reverie. I turn to see Suze\u2019s carriage coming down the road like something out of a fairy tale. Her veil is blowing in the wind and she\u2019s smiling radiantly at some people who have stopped to watch, and I\u2019ve never seen her look more beautiful.</p><p>I honestly wasn\u2019t planning to cry. In fact, I\u2019d already planned a way to stop myself doing so, which is to recite the alphabet backward in a French accent. But even as I\u2019m helping Suze straighten her train I\u2019m feeling damp around the eyes. And as the organ music swells and we start to process slowly forward into the packed church, I\u2019m having to sniff hard every two beats, along with the organ. Suze is holding tightly to her father\u2019s arm and her train is gliding along the old stone floor. I\u2019m walking behind, trying not to tap my heels on the floor, and hoping no one will notice my dress unraveling.</p><p>We reach the front \u2014 and there\u2019s Tarquin waiting, with his best man. He\u2019s as tall and bony as ever, and his face still reminds me of a stoat, but I have to admit he\u2019s looking pretty striking in his sporran and kilt. He\u2019s gazing at Suze with such transparent love and admiration that I can feel my nose starting to prickle again. He turns briefly, meets my eye, and grins nervously \u2014 and I give an embarrassed little smile back. To be honest, I\u2019ll never be able to look at him again without thinking about what Caroline said.</p><p>The vicar begins his \u201cDearly beloved\u201d speech, and I feel myself relax with pleasure. I\u2019m going to relish every single, familiar word. This is like watching the start of a favorite movie, with my two best friends playing the main parts.</p><p>\u201cSusan, wilt thou take this man to be thy wedded husband?\u201d The vicar\u2019s got huge bushy eyebrows, which he raises at every question, as though he\u2019s afraid the answer might be no. \u201cWilt thou love him, comfort him, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause \u2014 then Suze says, \u201cI will,\u201d in a voice as clear as a bell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wish bridesmaids got to say something. It wouldn\u2019t have to be anything very much, just a quick \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>When we come to the bit where Suze and Tarquin have to hold hands, Suze gives me her bouquet, and I take the opportunity to turn round and have a quick peek at the congregation. The place is crammed to the gills, in fact there isn\u2019t even room for everyone to sit down. There are lots of strapping men in kilts and women in velvet suits, and there\u2019s Fenny and a whole crowd of her London friends, all wearing Philip Treacy hats, it looks like. And there\u2019s Mum, squashed right up against Dad, with a tissue pressed to her eyes. She looks up and sees me and I give a little smile \u2014 but all she does is sob again.</p><p>I turn back and Suze and Tarquin are kneeling down, and the vicar is intoning severely, \u201cThose whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder.\u201d</p><p>I look at Suze as she beams radiantly at Tarquin. She\u2019s completely lost in him. She belongs to him now. And to my surprise, I suddenly feel slightly hollow inside. Suze is married. It\u2019s all changed.</p> <p>It\u2019s a year since I went off to live in New York, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it. Of course I have. But subconsciously, I realize, I\u2019ve always had it in the back of my mind that if everything went wrong, I could come back to Fulham and have my old life with Suze.</p><p>Suze doesn\u2019t need me anymore. She\u2019s got someone else, who will always come first in her life. I watch as the vicar places his hands on Suze\u2019s and Tarquin\u2019s heads to bless them \u2014 and my throat feels a little tight as I remember all the times we\u2019ve had together. The time I cooked a horrible curry to save money and she kept saying how delicious it was even while her mouth was burning. The time she tried to seduce my bank manager so he would extend my overdraft. Every time I\u2019ve got myself into trouble, she\u2019s been there for me.</p><p>And now it\u2019s all over.</p><p>Suddenly I feel in need of a little reassurance. I turn round and quickly scan the rows of guests, looking for Luke\u2019s face. For a few moments I can\u2019t spot him, and although I keep wearing my confident smile, I feel a ridiculous panic rising inside me, like a child realizing she\u2019s been left behind at school; that everyone else has been collected but her.</p><p>Until suddenly I see him. Standing behind a pillar toward the back, tall and dark and solid, his eyes fixed on mine. Looking at me and no one else. And as I gaze back at him, I feel restored. I\u2019ve been collected too; it\u2019s OK.</p> <p>We emerge into the churchyard, the sound of bells behind us, and a crowd of people who have gathered outside on the road start to cheer.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d I cry, giving Suze a huge hug. \u201cAnd to you, Tarquin!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve always been a teeny bit awkward around Tarquin. But now I see him with Suze \u2014 married to Suze \u2014 the awkwardness seems to melt away.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ll be really happy,\u201d I say warmly, and give him a kiss on the cheek, and we both laugh as someone throws confetti at us. Guests are already piling out of the church like sweets out of a jar, talking and laughing and calling to each other in loud confident voices. They swarm around Suze and Tarquin, kissing and hugging and shaking hands, and I move away a little, wondering where Luke is.</p><p>The whole churchyard is filling up with people, and I can\u2019t help staring at some of Suze\u2019s relations. Her granny is coming out of the church very slowly and regally, holding a stick, and is being followed by a dutiful-looking young man in morning dress. A thin, pale girl with huge eyes is wearing an enormous black hat, holding a pug and chain-smoking. There\u2019s a whole army of almost identical brothers in kilts standing by the church gate, and I remember Suze telling me about her aunt who had six boys before finally getting twin girls.</p><p>\u201cHere. Put this on.\u201d Luke\u2019s voice is suddenly in my ear, and I turn round, to see him holding out the sheepskin jacket. \u201cYou must be freezing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, there\u2019s snow on the ground,\u201d says Luke firmly, and drapes the coat round my shoulders. \u201cVery good wedding,\u201d he adds.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I look up at him carefully, wondering if by any chance we can work the conversation back to what we were talking about before the service. But now Luke\u2019s looking at Suze and Tarquin, who are being photographed under the oak tree. Suze looks absolutely radiant, but Tarquin looks as though he\u2019s facing gunfire.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a very nice chap,\u201d he says, nodding toward Tarquin. \u201cBit odd, but nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He is. Luke\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like a glass of hot whiskey?\u201d interrupts a waiter, coming up with a tray. \u201cOr champagne?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHot whiskey,\u201d I say gratefully. \u201cThanks.\u201d I take a few sips and close my eyes as the warmth spreads through my body. If only it could get down to my feet, which, to be honest, are completely freezing.</p><p>\u201cBridesmaid!\u201d cries Suze suddenly. \u201cWhere\u2019s Bex? We need you for a photograph!\u201d</p><p>My eyes open.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I shout, slipping the sheepskin coat off my shoulders. \u201cLuke, hold my drink\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I hurry through the melee and join Suze and Tarquin. And it\u2019s funny, but now that all these people are looking at me, I don\u2019t feel cold anymore. I smile my most radiant smile, and hold my flowers nicely, and link arms with Suze when the photographer tells me to, and, in between shots, wave at Mum and Dad, who have pushed their way to the front of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll head back to the house soon,\u201d says Mrs. Gearing, coming up to kiss Suze. \u201cPeople are getting chilly. You can finish the pictures there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Suze. \u201cBut let\u2019s just take some of me and Bex together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea!\u201d says Tarquin at once, and heads off in obvious relief to talk to his father, who looks exactly like Tarquin but forty years older. The photographer takes a few shots of me and Suze beaming at each other, then pauses to reload his camera. Suze accepts a glass of whiskey from a waiter and I reach surreptitiously behind me to see how much of my dress has unraveled.</p><p>\u201cBex, listen,\u201d comes a voice in my ear. I look round, and Suze is gazing at me earnestly. She\u2019s so close I can see each individual speck of glitter in her eyeshadow. \u201cI need to ask you something. You don\u2019t really want to wait ten years before you get married, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell... no,\u201d I admit. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do think Luke\u2019s the one? Just... honestly. Between ourselves.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. Behind me I can hear someone saying, \u201cOf course, our house is fairly modern. I think it was built in 1853\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say eventually, feeling a deep pink rising through my cheeks. \u201cYes. I think he is.\u201d</p><p>Suze looks at me searchingly for a few moments longer \u2014 then abruptly seems to come to a decision. \u201cRight!\u201d she says, putting down her whiskey. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw my bouquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her in bewilderment. \u201cSuze, don\u2019t be stupid. You can\u2019t throw your bouquet yet!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes I can! I can throw it when I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to throw it when you leave for your honeymoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d says Suze obstinately. \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019m going to throw it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re supposed to do it at the end!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the bride? You or me? If I wait till the end it won\u2019t be any fun! Now, stand over there.\u201d She points with an imperious hand to a small mound of snowy grass. \u201cAnd put your flowers down. You\u2019ll never catch it if you\u2019re holding things! Tarkie?\u201d She raises her voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw my bouquet now, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK!\u201d Tarquin calls back cheerfully. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, Bex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly! I don\u2019t even want to catch it!\u201d I say, slightly grumpily.</p> <p>But I suppose I am the only bridesmaid \u2014 so I put my flowers down on the grass, and go and stand on the mound as instructed.</p><p>\u201cI want a picture of this,\u201d Suze is saying to the photographer. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Luke?\u201d</p><p>The slightly weird thing is, no one else is coming with me. Everyone else has melted away. Suddenly I notice that Tarquin and his best man are going around murmuring in people\u2019s ears, and gradually all the guests are turning to me with bright, expectant faces.</p><p>\u201cReady, Bex?\u201d calls Suze.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I cry. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got enough people! There should be lots of us, all standing together...\u201d</p><p>I feel so stupid, up here on my own. Honestly, Suze is doing this all wrong. Hasn\u2019t she been to any weddings?</p><p>\u201cWait, Suze!\u201d I cry again, but it\u2019s too late.</p><p>\u201cCatch, Bex!\u201d she yells. \u201cCaaatch!\u201d</p><p>The bouquet comes looping high through the air, and I have to jump slightly to catch it. It\u2019s bigger and heavier than I expected, and for a moment I just stare dazedly at it, half secretly delighted and half completely furious with Suze.</p><p>And then my eyes focus. And I see the little envelope. To Becky.</p><p>An envelope addressed to me in Suze\u2019s bouquet?</p><p>I look up bewilderedly at Suze, and with a shining face she nods toward the envelope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With trembling fingers, I open the card. There\u2019s something lumpy inside. It\u2019s...</p><p>It\u2019s a ring, all wrapped up in cotton wool. I take it out, feeling dizzy. There\u2019s a message in the card, written in Luke\u2019s handwriting. And it says...</p><p>It says Will You...</p><p>I stare at it in disbelief, trying to keep control of myself, but the world is shimmering, and blood is pounding through my head.</p> <p>I look up dazedly, and there\u2019s Luke, coming forward through the people, his face serious but his eyes warm.</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d he begins, and there\u2019s a tiny intake of breath around the churchyard. \u201cWill you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Yeee-esssss!\u201d I hear the joyful sound ripping through the churchyard before I even realize I\u2019ve opened my mouth. I\u2019m so charged up with emotion, my voice doesn\u2019t even sound like mine. In fact, it sounds more like...</p><p>Mum.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it.</p> <p>As I whip round, she claps a hand over her mouth in horror. \u201cSorry!\u201d she whispers, and a ripple of laughter runs round the crowd.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bloomwood, I\u2019d be honored,\u201d says Luke, his eyes crinkling into a smile. \u201cBut I believe you\u2019re already taken.\u201d</p><p>Then he looks at me again.</p><p>\u201cBecky, if I had to wait five years, then I would. Or eight \u2014 or even ten.\u201d He pauses, and there\u2019s complete silence except for a tiny gust of wind, blowing confetti about the churchyard. \u201cBut I hope that one day \u2014 preferably rather sooner than that \u2014 you\u2019ll do me the honor of marrying me?\u201d</p><p>My throat\u2019s so tight, I can\u2019t speak. I give a tiny nod, and Luke takes my hand. He unfolds my fingers and takes out the ring. My heart is hammering. Luke wants to marry me. He must have been planning this all along. Without saying a thing.</p><p>I look at the ring, and feel my eyes start to blur. It\u2019s an antique diamond ring, set in gold, with tiny curved claws. I\u2019ve never seen another quite like it. It\u2019s perfect.</p> <p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, and watch as he slides it onto my finger. He looks at me again, his eyes more tender than I\u2019ve ever seen them, and kisses me, and the cheering starts.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m engaged.</p><p>Three</p><p>OK. NOW, I may be engaged, but I\u2019m not going to get carried away.</p><p>No way.</p><p>I know some girls go mad, planning the biggest wedding in the universe and thinking about nothing else... but that\u2019s not going to be me. I\u2019m not going to let this take over my life. I mean, let\u2019s get our priorities right here. The most important thing is not the dress, or the shoes, or what kind of flowers we have, is it? It\u2019s making the promise of lifelong commitment. It\u2019s pledging our troth to one another.</p><p>I pause, halfway through putting on my moisturizer, and gaze at the reflection in my old bedroom mirror. \u201cI, Becky,\u201d I murmur solemnly. \u201cI, Rebecca. Take thee, Luke.\u201d</p> <p>Those ancient words just send a shiver up your spine, don\u2019t they?</p><p>\u201cTo be thine... mine... husband. For better, for richer...\u201d</p><p>I break off with a puzzled frown. That doesn\u2019t sound quite right. Still, I can learn it properly nearer the time. The point is, the vows are what matters, nothing else. We don\u2019t have to go over the top. Just a simple, elegant ceremony. No fuss, no hoopla. I mean, Romeo and Juliet didn\u2019t need a big wedding with sugared almonds and vol-au-vents, did they?</p><p>In fact, maybe we should even get married in secret, like they did! Suddenly I\u2019m gripped by a vision of Luke and me kneeling before an Italian priest in the dead of night, in some tiny stone chapel. God, that would be romantic. And then somehow Luke would think I was dead, and he\u2019d commit suicide, and so would I, and it would be incredibly tragic, and everyone would say we did it for love and the whole world should learn from our example...</p><p>\u201cKaraoke?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice outside the bedroom door brings me back to reality. \u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly a possibility...\u201d</p><p>The door opens and he holds out a cup of coffee to me. He and I have been staying here at my parents\u2019 house since Suze\u2019s wedding, and when I left the breakfast table, he was refereeing my parents as they argued over whether or not the moon landings actually happened.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s already found a possible date for the wedding,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat do you think about the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I put up a hand to stop him. \u201cLuke. Let\u2019s just take this one step at a time, shall we?\u201d I give him a kind smile. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve only just got engaged. Let\u2019s just get our heads round that first. There\u2019s no need to dash into setting dates.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance at myself in the mirror, feeling quite grown-up and proud of myself.

And the date your mother suggested would be a terrible hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I take a thoughtful sip of coffee. \u201cSo... just out of interest... when was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune 22nd. This year.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cCrazy, really. It\u2019s only a few months away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMadness!\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s no hurry, is there?\u201d</p><p>June 22nd. Honestly! What is Mum thinking?</p><p>Although... I suppose a summer wedding would be nice in theory.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing actually stopping us getting married this year.</p><p>And if we did make it June, I could start looking at wedding dresses straight away. I could start trying on tiaras. I could start reading Brides! Yes!</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand,\u201d I add casually, \u201cthere\u2019s no real reason to delay, is there? I mean, now we\u2019ve decided, in one sense, we might as well just... do it. Why hang around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Becky, I don\u2019t want you to feel pressured\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. I\u2019m quite sure. Let\u2019s get married in June!\u201d I give him an exhilarated beam. \u201cShall we go and register today?\u201d</p><p>Oops. That just kind of slipped out.</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d says Luke, looking taken aback. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I give a lighthearted laugh. \u201cI\u2019m joking! Although, you know, we could go and start looking at a few things, purely for information...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m busy today, remember?\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cIn fact, I must get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d I say, trying to muster some enthusiasm. \u201cYes, you don\u2019t want to be late, do you?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s spending the day with his mother, Elinor, who is over in London on her way to Switzerland. The official version is that she\u2019s going there to stay with some old friends and \u201cenjoy the mountain air.\u201d Of course everyone knows she\u2019s really going to have her face lifted for the zillionth time.</p><p>Then this afternoon, Mum, Dad, and I are going up to meet them for tea at Claridges. Everyone has been exclaiming about what a lucky coincidence it is that Elinor\u2019s over here, so the two families will be able to meet. But every time I think about it, my stomach turns over. I wouldn\u2019t mind if it was Luke\u2019s real parents \u2014 his dad and stepmum, who are really lovely and live in Devon. But they\u2019ve just gone out to Australia, where Luke\u2019s sister has moved, and they probably won\u2019t be back until just before the wedding. So all we\u2019re left with to represent Luke is Elinor.</p><p>Elinor Sherman. My future mother-in-law.</p><p>OK... let\u2019s not think about that.</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d I pause, trying to find the right words. \u201cHow do you think it\u2019ll be? Our parents meeting for the first time? You know \u2014 your mother... and my mother... I mean, they\u2019re not exactly similar, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine! They\u2019ll get on wonderfully, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>He honestly hasn\u2019t a clue what I\u2019m talking about.</p><p>I know it\u2019s a good thing that Luke adores his mother. I know sons should love their mothers. And I know he hardly ever saw her when he was tiny, and he\u2019s trying to make up for lost time... but still. How can he be so devoted to Elinor?</p><p>As I arrive downstairs in the kitchen, Mum\u2019s tidying up the breakfast things with one hand and holding the portable phone in the other.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she\u2019s saying. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Bloomwood, B-l-o-o-m-w-o-o-d. Of Oxshott, Surrey. And you\u2019ll fax that over? Thank you.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She puts away the phone and beams at me. \u201cThat\u2019s the announcement gone in the Surrey Post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother announcement? Mum, how many have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the standard number!\u201d she says defensively. \u201cThe Times, the Telegraph, the Oxshott Herald, and the Esher Gazette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Surrey Post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So only... five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, you only get married once!\u201d says Mum.</p><p>\u201cI know. But honestly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, listen.\u201d Mum is rather pink in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re our only daughter, Becky, and we\u2019re not going to spare any expense. We want you to have the wedding of your dreams. Whether it\u2019s the announcements, or the flowers, or a horse and carriage like Suzie had... we want you to have it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMum, I wanted to talk to you about that,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cLuke and I will contribute to the cost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d says Mum briskly. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always hoped we\u2019d be paying for a wedding one day. We\u2019ve been putting money aside especially, for a few years now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at her, feeling a sudden swell of emotion. Mum and Dad have been saving all this time, and they never said a word. \u201cI... I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well. We weren\u2019t going to tell you, were we? Now!\u201d Mum snaps back into businesslike mode. \u201cDid Luke tell you we\u2019ve found a date? You know, it wasn\u2019t easy! Everywhere\u2019s booked up. But I\u2019ve spoken to Peter at the church, he\u2019s had a cancellation, and he can fit us in at three on that Saturday. Otherwise it would be a question of waiting until November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovember?\u201d I pull a face. \u201cThat\u2019s not very weddingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So I told him to pencil it in. I\u2019ve put it on the calendar, look.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at the fridge calendar, which has a different recipe using Nescaf\u00e9 for each month. And sure enough, there in June is a big felt-tipped \u201cBECKY\u2019S WEDDING.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at it, feeling slightly weird. I am going to get married. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve secretly thought about for so long \u2014 and now it really is happening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having a few ideas about the marquee,\u201d adds Mum. \u201cI saw a beautiful striped one in a magazine somewhere, and I thought, \u2018I must show that to Becky...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>She reaches behind her and hauls out a stack of glossy magazines. Brides. Modern Bride. Wedding and Home. All shiny and succulent and inviting, like a plate of sticky doughnuts.</p><p>\u201cGosh!\u201d I say, forcing myself not to reach greedily for one. \u201cI haven\u2019t read any of those bridal things yet. I don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re like!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither have I,\u201d says Mum at once, as she flicks expertly through an issue of Wedding and Home. \u201cNot properly. I\u2019ve just glanced through for the odd idea. I mean, they\u2019re really just adverts mainly...\u201d</p><p>I hesitate, my fingers running over the cover of You and Your Wedding. I can hardly believe I\u2019m actually allowed to read these now. Openly! I don\u2019t have to sidle up to the rack and take tiny, guilty peeks, like stuffing a biscuit into my mouth and all the time wondering if someone will see me.</p> <p>The habit\u2019s so ingrained I almost can\u2019t break it, even though I\u2019ve got an engagement ring on my finger now.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it makes sense to have a very brief look,\u201d I say casually. \u201cYou know, just for basic information... just to be aware what\u2019s available...\u201d</p><p>Oh, sod it. Mum\u2019s not even listening, anyway, so I might as well give up pretending I\u2019m not going to read every single one of these magazines avidly from cover to cover. Happily I sink into a chair and reach for Brides, and for the next ten minutes we\u2019re both completely silent, gorging on pictures.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d says Mum suddenly. She turns her magazine round so I can see a picture of a billowing white and silver striped marquee. \u201cIsn\u2019t that nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pretty.\u201d I run my gaze down interestedly to the picture of the bridesmaids\u2019 dresses, and the bride\u2019s bouquet... and then my eye comes to rest on the dateline.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cThis is from last year! How come you were looking at wedding magazines last year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea!\u201d says Mum shiftly. \u201cI must have... picked it up in a doctor\u2019s waiting room or something. Anyway. Are you getting any ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cI suppose I just want something simple.\u201d</p> <p>A vision of myself in a big white dress and sparkly tiara suddenly pops into my head. Getting out of a carriage at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral... my handsome prince waiting for me... cheering crowds...</p><p>OK, stop. I\u2019m not going to go over the top. I\u2019ve already decided that.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Mum is saying. \u201cYou want something elegant and tasteful. Oh, look, grapes covered with gold leaf. We could do that!\u201d She turns a page. \u201cLook, identical twin bridesmaids! Don\u2019t they look pretty? Do you know anyone with twins, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Ooh, you can buy a special wedding countdown alarm clock! And a wedding organizer with matching bridal diary for those special memories. Do you think I should get one of those?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d says Mum. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll only wish you had.\u201d She puts down her magazine. \u201cYou know, Becky, one thing I will say to you is, don\u2019t do this by half-measures.

Janice is our next-door neighbor and I\u2019ve known her forever.

It\u2019s traditional, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know where I am if you want any help,\u201d says Janice. \u201cHave you set a date yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune 22nd,\u201d says Mum over the shriek of the coffee grinder. \u201cThree o\u2019clock at St. Mary\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree o\u2019clock!\u201d says Janice. \u201cLovely.\u201d She puts down the magazine and gives me a suddenly earnest look. \u201cNow, Becky, there\u2019s something I want to say. To both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d I say, slightly apprehensively, and Mum puts down the coffeepot.</p><p>Janice takes a deep breath. \u201cIt would give me great pleasure to do your wedding makeup. You and the whole bridal party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice!\u201d exclaims my mother in delight. \u201cWhat a kind thought! Think of that, Becky. Professional makeup!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr... fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned such a lot on my course, all the tricks of the trade. I\u2019ve got a whole book full of photographs you can browse through, to choose your style. In fact I\u2019ve brought it with me, look!\u201d Janice opens the folder and begins to flip over laminated cards of women who look as though they had their makeup applied during the seventies. \u201cThis look is called Prom Princess, for the younger face,\u201d she says breathlessly. \u201cNow, here we have Radiant Spring Bride, with extra-waterproof mascara... Or Cleopatra, if you wanted something more dramatic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I say feebly. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll have a look nearer the time.\u201d</p><p>There is no way in a million years I\u2019m letting Janice near my face.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll be getting Wendy to do the cake, will you?\u201d asks Janice as Mum puts a cup of coffee in front of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, no question,\u201d says Mum. \u201cWendy Prince, who lives on Maybury Avenue,\u201d she adds to me. \u201cYou remember, she did Dad\u2019s retirement cake with the lawnmower on it? The things that woman can do with a nozzle!\u201d</p><p>I remember that cake. The icing was virulent green and the lawnmower was made out of a painted matchbox. You could still see \u201cSwan\u201d through the green.</p><p>\u201cYou know, there are some really amazing wedding cakes in here,\u201d I say, tentatively holding out an issue of Brides. \u201cFrom this special place in London. Maybe we could go and have a look.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, but love, we have to ask Wendy!\u201d says Mum in surprise. \u201cShe\u2019d be devastated if we didn\u2019t. You know her husband\u2019s just had a stroke? Those sugar roses are what\u2019s keeping her going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d I say, putting down the magazine guiltily. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. Well... OK then. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were very pleased with Tom and Lucy\u2019s wedding cake.\u201d Janice sighs. \u201cWe\u2019ve saved the top tier for the first christening. You know, they\u2019re with us at the moment. They\u2019ll be round to offer their congratulations, I\u2019m sure. Can you believe they\u2019ve been married a year and a half already!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave they?\u201d Mum takes a sip of coffee and gives a brief smile.</p><p>Tom and Lucy\u2019s wedding is still a very slightly sore point in our family. I mean, we love Janice and Martin to bits so we never say anything, but to be honest, we\u2019re none of us very keen on Lucy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre there any signs of them...\u201d Mum makes a vague, euphemistic gesture. \u201cStarting a family,\u201d she adds in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d Janice\u2019s smile flickers briefly. \u201cMartin and I think they probably want to enjoy each other first. They\u2019re such a happy young couple. They just dote on each other! And of course, Lucy\u2019s got her career\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so,\u201d says Mum consideringly. \u201cAlthough it doesn\u2019t do to wait too long...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know,\u201d agrees Janice. They both turn to look at me \u2014 and suddenly I realize what they\u2019re driving at.</p> <p>For God\u2019s sake, I\u2019ve only been engaged a day! Give me a chance!</p><p>I escape to the garden and wander round for a bit, sipping my coffee. The snow is starting to melt outside, and you can just see patches of green lawn and bits of rosebush. As I pick my way down the gravel path, I find myself thinking how nice it is to be in an English garden again, even if it is a bit cold. Manhattan doesn\u2019t have any gardens like this. There\u2019s Central Park, and there\u2019s the odd little flowery square. But it doesn\u2019t have any proper English gardens, with lawns and trees and flower beds.</p><p>I\u2019ve reached the rose arbor and am looking back at the house, imagining what a marquee will look like on the lawn, when suddenly there\u2019s a rumble of conversation from the garden next door. I wonder if it\u2019s Martin, and I\u2019m about to pop my head over the fence and say \u201cHello!\u201d when a girl\u2019s voice comes clearly over the snow, saying: \u201cDefine frigid! Because if you ask me\u2014\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s Lucy. And she sounds furious! There\u2019s a mumbled reply, which can only be Tom.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re such a bloody expert, are you?\u201d</p> <p>Mumble mumble.</p><p>\u201cOh, give me a break.\u201d</p><p>I edge surreptitiously toward the fence, wishing desperately I could hear both sides.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe if we had more of a life, maybe if you actually organized something once in a blue moon, maybe if we weren\u2019t stuck in such a bloody rut...\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s voice is so hectoring. And now Tom\u2019s voice is raised defensively in return.</p><p>\u201cWe went out to... all you could do was complain... made a real bloody effort...\u201d</p> <p>Crack!</p><p>Shit. Shit. I\u2019ve stepped on a twig.</p><p>For an instant I consider running. But it\u2019s too late, their heads have already appeared over the garden fence, Tom\u2019s all pink and distressed, and Lucy\u2019s tight with anger.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi!\u201d I say, trying to look relaxed. \u201cHow are you? I\u2019m just... um... having a little stroll... and I dropped my... hanky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hanky?\u201d Lucy looks suspiciously at the ground. \u201cI can\u2019t see any hanky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... erm... So... how\u2019s married life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d says Lucy shortly. \u201cCongratulations, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an awkward pause, and I find myself running my eyes over Lucy\u2019s outfit, taking in her top (black polo-neck, probably M&amp;S), trousers (Earl Jeans, quite cool, actually), and boots (high-heeled with laces, Russell &amp; Bromley).</p><p>This is something I\u2019ve always done, checking out people\u2019s clothes and listing them in my mind like on a fashion page. I thought I was the only one who did it. But then I moved to New York \u2014 and there, everyone does it. Seriously, everybody. The first time you meet anyone, whether it\u2019s a rich society lady or a doorman, they give you a swift, three-second top-to-toe sweep. You can see them costing your entire outfit to the nearest dollar before they even say hello. I call it the Manhattan Onceover.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great! Really exciting... I love my job... it\u2019s such a great place to live!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been,\u201d says Tom wistfully. \u201cI wanted to go there for our honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, don\u2019t start that again,\u201d says Lucy sharply. \u201cOK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could come and visit,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI could come for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes! Maybe! You could both come...\u201d I tail off lamely as Lucy rolls her eyes and stomps toward the house. \u201cAnyway, lovely to see you and I\u2019m glad married life is treating you... er... treating you, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I hurry back into the kitchen, dying to tell Mum what I just heard, but it\u2019s empty.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mum!\u201d I call. \u201cI just saw Tom and Lucy!\u201d</p><p>I hurry up the stairs, and Mum is halfway down the loft ladder, pulling down a big white squashy bundle all wrapped up in plastic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask, helping her to get it down.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d she says, with suppressed excitement. \u201cJust...\u201d Her hands are trembling as she unzips the plastic cover. \u201cJust... look!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your wedding dress!\u201d I say in astonishment as she pulls out the white frothy lace. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you still had that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve still got it!\u201d She brushes away some sheets of tissue paper. \u201cThirty years old, but still as good as new. Now, Becky, it\u2019s only a thought...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a thought?\u201d I say, helping her to shake out the train.</p><p>\u201cIt might not even fit you...\u201d</p><p>Slowly I look up at her. She\u2019s serious.</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t think it will,\u201d I say, trying to sound casual. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were much thinner than me! And... shorter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re the same height!\u201d says Mum in puzzlement. \u201cOh, go on, try it, Becky!\u201d</p> <p>Five minutes later I stare at myself in the mirror in Mum\u2019s bedroom. I look like a sausage roll in layered frills. The bodice is tight and lacy, with ruffled sleeves and a ruffled neckline. It\u2019s tight down to my hips where there are more ruffles, and then it fans out into a tiered train.</p><p>I have never worn anything less flattering in my life.</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky!\u201d I look up \u2014 and to my horror, Mum\u2019s in tears. \u201cI\u2019m so silly!\u201d she says, laughing and brushing at her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just... my little girl, in the dress I wore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mum...\u201d Impulsively I give her a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s a... a really lovely dress...\u201d</p><p>How exactly do I add, But I\u2019m not wearing it?</p><p>\u201cAnd it fits you perfectly,\u201d gulps Mum, and rummages for a tissue. \u201cBut it\u2019s your decision.\u201d She blows her nose. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think it suits you... just say so. I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... well...\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll... think about it,\u201d I manage at last, and give Mum a lame smile.</p><p>We put the wedding dress back in its bag, and have some sandwiches for lunch, and watch an old episode of Changing Rooms on the new cable telly Mum and Dad have had installed. And then, although it\u2019s a bit early, I go upstairs and start getting ready to see Elinor. Luke\u2019s mother is one of those Manhattan women who always look completely and utterly immaculate, and today of all days I want to match her in the smartness stakes.</p><p>I put on the DKNY suit I bought myself for Christmas, brand-new tights, and my new Prada sample sale shoes. Then I survey my appearance carefully, looking all over for specks or creases. I\u2019m not going to be caught out this time. I\u2019m not going to have a single stray thread or crumpled bit which her beady X-ray eyes can zoom in on.</p><p>I\u2019ve just about decided that I look OK, when Mum comes busting into my bedroom. She\u2019s dressed smartly in a purple Windsmoor suit and her face is glowing with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she says with a little laugh. \u201cSmart enough for Claridges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely, Mum! That color really suits you. Let me just...\u201d</p> <p>I reach for a tissue, dampen it under the tap, and wipe at her cheeks where she\u2019s copied Janice\u2019s badger-look approach to blusher.</p><p>\u201cThere. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, darling!\u201d Mum peers at herself in the wardrobe mirror. \u201cWell, this will be nice. Meeting Luke\u2019s mother at last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I say noncommittally.</p><p>\u201cI expect we\u2019ll get to be quite good friends! What with getting together over the wedding preparations... You know, Margot across the road is such good friends with her son-in-law\u2019s mother, they take holidays together. She says she hasn\u2019t lost a daughter, she\u2019s gained a friend!\u201d</p><p>Mum sounds really excited. How can I prepare her for the truth?</p><p>\u201cAnd Elinor certainly sounds lovely! The way Luke describes her. He seems so fond of her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d I admit grudgingly. \u201cIncredibly fond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was telling us this morning about all the wonderful charity work she does. She must have a heart of gold!\u201d</p><p>As Mum prattles on, I tune out and remember a conversation I had with Luke\u2019s stepmum, Annabel, when she and his dad came out to visit us.</p><p>I completely adore Annabel. She\u2019s very different from Elinor, much softer and quieter, but with a lovely smile that lights up her whole face. She and Luke\u2019s father live in a sleepy area of Devon near the beach, and I really wish we could spend more time with them. But Luke left home at eighteen, and he hardly ever goes back. In fact, I get the feeling he thinks his father slightly wasted his life by settling down as a provincial lawyer, instead of conquering the world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they came to New York, Annabel and I ended up having an afternoon alone together. We walked around Central Park talking about loads of different things, and it seemed as though no subject was off-limits. So at last I took a deep breath and asked her what I\u2019ve always wanted to know \u2014 which is how she can stand Luke being so dazzled by Elinor. I mean, Elinor may be his biological mother, but Annabel has been there for him all his life. She was the one who looked after him when he was ill and helped him with his homework and cooked his supper every night. And now she\u2019s been pushed aside.</p><p>For an instant I could see the pain in Annabel\u2019s face. But then she kind of smiled and said she completely understood it. That Luke had been desperate to know his real mother since he was a tiny child, and now that he was getting the chance to spend time with her, he should be allowed to enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cImagine your fairy godmother came along,\u201d she said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be dazzled? Wouldn\u2019t you forget about everyone else for a while? He needs this time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not his fairy godmother!\u201d I retorted. \u201cShe\u2019s the wicked old witch!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, she\u2019s his natural mother,\u201d Annabel said, with a gentle reproof. Then she changed the subject. She wouldn\u2019t bitch about Elinor, or anything.</p><p>Annabel is a saint.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame they didn\u2019t get to see each other while Luke was growing up!\u201d Mum is saying. \u201cWhat a tragic story.\u201d She lowers her voice, even though Luke\u2019s left the house. \u201cLuke was telling me only this morning how his mother was desperate to take him with her to America. But her new American husband wouldn\u2019t allow it! Poor woman. She must have been in misery. Leaving her child behind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, maybe,\u201d I say, feeling a slight rebellion. \u201cExcept... she didn\u2019t have to leave, did she? If she was in so much misery, why didn\u2019t she tell the new husband where to go?\u201d</p><p>Mum looks at me in surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s very harsh, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh... I suppose so.\u201d I give a little shrug and reach for my lip liner.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to stir things up before we even begin. So I won\u2019t say what I really think, which is that Elinor never showed any interest in Luke until his PR company started doing so well in New York. Luke has always been desperate to impress her \u2014 in fact, that\u2019s the real reason he expanded to New York in the first place, though he won\u2019t admit it. But she completely ignored him, like the cow she is, until he started winning a few really big contracts and being mentioned in the papers and she suddenly realized he could be useful to her. Just before Christmas, she started her own charity \u2014 the Elinor Sherman Foundation \u2014 and made Luke a director. Then she had a great big gala concert to launch it \u2014 and guess who spent about twenty-five hours a day helping her out with it until he was so exhausted, Christmas was a complete washout?</p><p>But I can\u2019t say anything to him about it. When I once brought up the subject, Luke got all defensive and said I\u2019d always had a problem with his mother (which is kind of true) and she was sacrificing loads of her time to help the needy and what more did I want, blood?</p><p>To which I couldn\u2019t really find a reply.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably a very lonely woman,\u201d Mum is musing. \u201cPoor thing, all on her own. Living in her little flat. Does she have a cat to keep her company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum...\u201d I put a hand to my head. \u201cElinor doesn\u2019t live in a \u2018little flat.\u2019 It\u2019s a duplex on Park Avenue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA duplex? What \u2014 like a maisonette?\u201d Mum pulls a sympathetic little face. \u201cOh, but it\u2019s not the same as a nice house, is it?\u201d</p><p>Oh, I give up. There\u2019s no point.</p><p>As we walk into the foyer at Claridges, it\u2019s full of smart people having tea. Waiters in gray jackets are striding around with green and white striped teapots, and everyone\u2019s chattering brightly and I can\u2019t see Luke or Elinor anywhere. As I peer around, I\u2019m seized by sudden hope. Maybe they\u2019re not here. Maybe Elinor couldn\u2019t make it! We can just go and have a nice cup of tea on our own! Thank God for\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>I swivel round \u2014 and my heart sinks. There they are, on a sofa in the corner. Luke\u2019s wearing that radiant expression he gets whenever he sees his mother, and Elinor\u2019s sitting on the edge of her seat in a houndstooth suit trimmed with fur. Her hair is a stiff lacquered helmet and her legs, encased in pale stockings, seem to have got even thinner. She looks up, apparently expressionless \u2014 but I can see from the flicker of her eyelids that she\u2019s giving both Mum and Dad the Manhattan Onceover. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that her?\u201d whispers Mum in astonishment, as we give our coats in. \u201cGoodness!

That\u2019s living in America for you, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>As we approach the sofa, Elinor looks up and her mouth extends by three millimeters, which is her equivalent to a smile.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Rebecca. And felicitations on your engagement. Most unexpected.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean?</p> <p>\u201cThanks very much!\u201d I say, forcing a smile. \u201cElinor, I\u2019d like to introduce my parents, Jane and Graham Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d says Dad with a friendly smile, and holds out his hand. He looks so distinguished in his dark gray suit, I feel a twinge of pride. He\u2019s actually very handsome, my dad, even though his hair is going a bit gray.</p><p>\u201cGraham, don\u2019t stand on ceremony!\u201d exclaims Mum. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be family now!\u201d Before I can stop her she\u2019s enveloping a startled Elinor in a hug. \u201cWe\u2019re so pleased to meet you, Elinor! Luke\u2019s told us all about you!\u201d As she stands up again I see she\u2019s rumpled Elinor\u2019s collar, and can\u2019t help giving a tiny giggle.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this nice?\u201d Mum continues as she sits down. \u201cVery grand!\u201d She looks around, her eyes bright. \u201cNow, what are we going to have? A nice cup of tea, or something stronger to celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea, I think,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cLuke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and sort it out,\u201d says Luke, leaping to his feet.</p> <p>I hate the way he behaves around his mother. Normally he\u2019s so strong and assured. But with Elinor it\u2019s as though she\u2019s the president of some huge multinational and he\u2019s some junior minion. He hasn\u2019t even said hello to me yet.</p><p>\u201cNow, Elinor,\u201d says Mum. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you a little something. I saw them yesterday and I couldn\u2019t resist!\u201d</p><p>She pulls out a package wrapped in gold paper and hands it to Elinor. A little stiffly, Elinor takes off the paper \u2014 and pulls out a blue padded notebook, with the words \u201cHis Mum\u201d emblazoned on the front in swirly silver writing. She stares at it as though Mum\u2019s presented her with a dead rat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a matching one!\u201d says Mum triumphantly. She reaches in her bag and brings out an equivalent \u201cHer Mum\u201d notebook, in pink. \u201cThey\u2019re called the Mums\u2019 Planning Kit! There\u2019s a space for us to write in our menus, guest l ists... color schemes... and here\u2019s a plastic pocket for swatches, look... This way we can keep coordinated! And this is the ideas page... I\u2019ve already jotted down a few thoughts, so if you want to contribute anything... or if there\u2019s any particular food you like... The point is, we want you to be involved as much as possible.\u201d She pats Elinor\u2019s hand. \u201cIn fact, if you\u2019d like to come and stay for a while, so we could really get to know each other...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy schedule is rather full, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d says Elinor with a wintry smile as Luke reappears, holding his mobile.</p><p>\u201cThe tea\u2019s on its way. And... I\u2019ve just had rather a nice phone call.\u201d He looks around with a suppressed smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve just landed NorthWest Bank as a client. We\u2019re going to manage the launch of an entire new retail division. It\u2019s going to be huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s been wooing NorthWest for absolutely ages, and last week he admitted he\u2019d thought he\u2019d lost them to another agency. So this is really fantastic.</p> <p>\u201cWell done, Luke,\u201d says Dad.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant, love!\u201d chimes in Mum.</p><p>The only one who hasn\u2019t said anything is Elinor. She\u2019s not even paying attention, but looking in her Herm\u00e8s bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Elinor?\u201d I say deliberately. \u201cIt\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope this won\u2019t interfere with your work for the foundation,\u201d she says, and snaps her bag shut.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t,\u201d says Luke easily.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Luke\u2019s work for your foundation is voluntary,\u201d I point out sweetly. \u201cWhereas this is his business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Elinor gives me a stony look. \u201cWell, Luke, if you don\u2019t have time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve got time,\u201d says Luke, shooting me a glance of annoyance. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Great. Now they\u2019re both pissed off with me.</p><p>Mum has been watching this exchange in slight bewilderment, and as the tea arrives her face clears in relief.</p> <p>\u201cJust what the doctor ordered!\u201d she exclaims as a waiter places a teapot and silver cake stand on our table. \u201cElinor, shall I pour for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a scone,\u201d says Dad heartily to Elinor. \u201cAnd some clotted cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Elinor shrinks slightly as though cream particles might be floating through the air and invading her body. She takes a sip of tea, then looks at her watch. \u201cI must go, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Mum looks up in surprise. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, could you fetch the car?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Luke, draining his cup.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Now it\u2019s my turn to stare. \u201cLuke, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drive my mother to the airport,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why can\u2019t she take a taxi?\u201d</p><p>As the words come out of my mouth I realize I sound a bit rude \u2014 but honestly. This was supposed to be a nice family meeting. We\u2019ve only been here about three seconds.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things I need to discuss with Luke,\u201d says Elinor, picking up her handbag. \u201cWe can do so in the car.\u201d She stands up and brushes an imaginary crumb off her lap. \u201cSo nice to meet you,\u201d she says to Mum.</p> <p>\u201cYou too!\u201d exclaims Mum, leaping up in a last-ditch attempt at friendliness. \u201cLovely to meet you, Elinor! I\u2019ll get your number from Becky and we can have some nice chats about what we\u2019re going to wear! We don\u2019t want to clash with each other, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d says Elinor, glancing at Mum\u2019s shoes. \u201cGood-bye, Rebecca.\u201d Elinor nods at Dad. \u201cGraham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Elinor,\u201d says Dad in an outwardly polite voice \u2014 but as I glance at him I can tell he\u2019s not at all impressed. \u201cSee you later, Luke.\u201d As they disappear through the doors, he looks at his watch. \u201cTwelve minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d says Mum.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how long she gave us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham! I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean...\u201d Mum breaks off as she notices the blue \u201cHis Mum\u201d book, still lying on the table amid the wrapping paper. \u201cElinor\u2019s left her wedding planner behind!\u201d she cries, grabbing it. \u201cBecky, run after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum...\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s that interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on her for any help,\u201d says Dad. He reaches for the clotted cream and piles a huge amount onto his scone.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mum looks from my face to Dad\u2019s \u2014 then slowly subsides into her seat, clutching the book. \u201cOh, I see.\u201d</p><p>She takes a sip of tea, and I can see her struggling hard to think of something nice to say.</p><p>\u201cWell... she probably just doesn\u2019t want to interfere!\u201d she says at last. \u201cIt\u2019s completely understandable.\u201d</p><p>But even she doesn\u2019t look that convinced. God, I hate Elinor.</p><p>\u201cMum, let\u2019s finish our tea,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then why don\u2019t we go to the sales?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Mum after a pause. \u201cYes, let\u2019s do that! Now you mention it, I could do with some new gloves.\u201d She takes a sip of tea and looks more cheerful. \u201cAnd perhaps a nice bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a lovely time,\u201d I say, and squeeze her arm. \u201cJust us.\u201d</p><p>FRANTON, BINTON AND OGLEBY</p><p>Attorneys At Law</p><p>739 Third Avenue</p><p>Suit 503</p><p>New York, NY 10017</p><p>Miss Rebecca Bloomwood</p><p>251 W. 11th Street, Apt.

As Mum said, it\u2019s her loss, and she\u2019ll regret it on the day, when she doesn\u2019t feel part of the celebrations. We cheered up quite a lot after we left Claridges, actually. We went to the Selfridges sale and Mum found a nice new bag and I got some volumizing mascara, while Dad went and had a pint of beer, like he always does. Then we all went out for supper, and by the time we got home we were all a lot more cheerful and finding the whole situation quite funny.</p><p>The next day, when Janice came round for coffee, we told her all about tea with Elinor and she was really indignant on our behalf, and said if Elinor thought she was getting her makeup done for free, she had another think coming! Then Dad joined in and did a good imitation of Elinor looking at the clotted cream as if it was about to mug her and we all started giggling hysterically \u2014 until Luke came downstairs and asked what was funny, and we had to pretend we were laughing at a joke on the radio.</p><p>I really don\u2019t know what to do about Luke and his mother. Part of me thinks I should be honest. I should tell him how upset she made us all, and how Mum was really hurt. But the trouble is, I\u2019ve tried to be honest with him in the past about Elinor and it\u2019s always led to a huge row. And I really don\u2019t want to have any rows now, while we\u2019re just engaged, and all blissful and happy. So I didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>The following day we left to come back to New York, and when we said good-bye, Mum gave Luke a huge affectionate hug, as though to make up for the way she feels about Elinor. After all, he can\u2019t help his mother, can he? Then she hugged me, and wrote down my fax number for the zillionth time and promised she\u2019d be in touch as soon as she\u2019d talked to some caterers.</p><p>Apart from the small issue of Elinor, everything is going perfectly. Just to prove it, on the plane back to New York, I did this quiz in Wedding and Home on \u201cAre You Ready for Marriage?\u201d And we got the top marks! It said, \u201cCongratulations! You are a committed and loving couple, able to work through your problems. The lines of communication are open between you and you see eye to eye on most issues.\u201d</p><p>OK, maybe I did cheat a tiny bit. Like for the question \u201cWhich part of your wedding are you most looking forward to?\u201d I was going to put (a) \u201cChoosing my shoes\u201d until I saw that (c) \u201cMaking a lifelong commitment\u201d got ten points whereas (a) only got two.</p><p>But then, I\u2019m sure everyone else has a little peek at the answers too. They probably factor it in somehow.</p><p>At least I didn\u2019t put (d) \u201cDessert\u201d (no points).</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>We arrived back at the apartment an hour ago and Luke is going through the post. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen that joint account statement, have you? I\u2019ll have to give them a ring.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, it came. Sorry, I forgot to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I hurry into the bedroom and take the statement from its hiding place, feeling a slight beat of apprehension.</p><p>Come to think of it, there was a question about financial matters in that quiz. I think I ticked (b) \u201cWe have similar patterns of expenditure and money is never an issue between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d I say lightly, handing him the sheet of paper.</p> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t see why we keep going overdrawn on this account,\u201d Luke\u2019s saying. \u201cOur household expenses can\u2019t increase every month...\u201d He peers at the page, which is covered in thick white blobs. \u201cBecky... why has this statement got Wite-Out all over it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. The bottle was there, and I was moving some books, and it just... tipped over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s almost impossible to read!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d I say innocently. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. Still, never mind. These things happen...\u201d And I\u2019m about to pluck it from his fingers when suddenly his eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cDoes that say...\u201d He starts scraping at the statement with his fingernail, and suddenly a big blob of Wite-Out falls off.</p> <p>Damn. I should have used tomato ketchup, like last month.</p><p>\u201cMi\u00f9 Mi\u00f9. I thought so. Becky, what\u2019s Mi\u00f9 Mi\u00f9 doing in here?\u201d He scrapes again, and Wite-Out starts to shower off the page like snow.</p><p>Oh God. Please don\u2019t see\u2014</p><p>\u201cSephora... and Joseph... No wonder we\u2019re overdrawn!\u201d He gives me an exasperated look. \u201cBecky, this account is supposed to be for household expenses. Not skirts from Mi\u00f9 Mi\u00f9!\u201d</p><p>OK. Fight or flight.</p><p>I cross my arms defiantly and lift my chin. \u201cSo... a skirt isn\u2019t a household expense. Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p> <p>Luke stares at me. \u201cOf course that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, maybe that\u2019s the problem. Maybe the two of us just need to clarify our definitions a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d says Luke after a pause, and I can see his mouth twitching slightly. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that you would classify a Mi\u00f9 Mi\u00f9 skirt as a household expense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... might! It\u2019s \u2018in the household,\u2019 isn\u2019t it? And anyway,\u201d I continue quickly. \u201cAnyway. At the end of the day, what does it matter? What does any of it matter? We have our health, we have each other, we have the... the beauty of life. Those are the things that matter. Not money. Not bank accounts. Not the mundane, soul-destroying details.\u201d I make a sweeping gesture with my hand, feeling as though I\u2019m making an Oscar-winning speech. \u201cWe\u2019re on this planet for all too short a time, Luke. All too short a time. And when we come to the end, which will count for more? A number on a piece of paper \u2014 or the love between two people? Knowing that a few meaningless figures balanced \u2014 or knowing that you were the person you wanted to be?\u201d</p><p>As I reach the end, I\u2019m choked by my own brilliance. I look up in a daze, half expecting Luke to be near tears and whispering, \u201cYou had me at \u2018And.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cVery stirring,\u201d says Luke crisply. \u201cJust for the record, in my book \u2018household expenses\u2019 means joint expenses pertaining to the running of this apartment and our lives. Food, fuel, cleaning products, and so on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I shrug. \u201cIf that\u2019s the narrow... frankly limited definition you want to use \u2014 then fine.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rings and I open it to see Danny standing in the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cDanny, is a Mi\u00f9 Mi\u00f9 skirt a household expense?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Danny, coming into the living area.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I raise my eyebrows at Luke. \u201cBut fine, we\u2019ll go with your definition...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you hear?\u201d says Danny morosely.</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Watts is selling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as the lease is up, we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the owner.

My mother wants to have lunch with you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s back?\u201d I say in dismay. \u201cI mean... she\u2019s back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had to postpone her surgery.\u201d Luke pulls a little face. \u201cThe clinic was placed under investigation by the Swiss medical authorities while she was there and all the procedures were put on hold. So... one o\u2019clock, La Goulue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I shrug unenthusiastically.</p><p>Then, as the door closes behind Luke, I feel a bit bad. Maybe Elinor\u2019s had a change of heart. Maybe she wants to bury the hatchet and get involved with the wedding. You never know.</p><p>I\u2019d planned to be really cool and only tell people I was engaged if they asked me \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d</p><p>But when the time comes I find myself running into the personal shopping department at Barneys where I work, thrusting out my hand, and yelling \u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>Erin, who works there with me, looks up startled, peers at my hand, then claps her hands over her mouth. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re engaged? To Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course to Luke! We\u2019re getting married in June!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to wear?\u201d she gabbles. \u201cI\u2019m so jealous! Let me see the ring! Where did you get it? When I get engaged I\u2019m going straight to Harry Winstons. And forget a month\u2019s salary, we\u2019re talking at least three years\u2019...\u201d She tails off as she examines my ring. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Luke\u2019s family\u2019s,\u201d I say. \u201cHis grandmother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right. So... it isn\u2019t new?\u201d Her face falls slightly. \u201cOh well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... vintage,\u201d I say carefully \u2014 and her entire expression lifts again.</p><p>\u201cVintage! A vintage ring! That\u2019s such a cool idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, Becky,\u201d says Christina, my boss, and gives me a warm smile. \u201cI know you and Luke will be very happy together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I try it on?\u201d says Erin. \u201cNo! I\u2019m sorry. Forget I mentioned it. I just... A vintage ring!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still gazing at it as my first client, Laurel Johnson, comes into the department. Laurel is president of a company that leases private jets and is one of my favorite clients, even though she tells me all the time how she thinks everything in the store is overpriced and she\u2019d buy all her clothes from Kmart if it weren\u2019t for her job.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I see?\u201d she says, taking off her coat and shaking out her dark curly hair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m engaged!\u201d I say, beaming.</p><p>\u201cEngaged!\u201d She comes over and scrutinizes the ring with dark, intelligent eyes. \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019ll be very happy. I\u2019m sure you will be. I\u2019m sure your husband will have sense enough to keep his dick out of the little blonde who came to work as his intern and told him she\u2019d never met a man who filled her with awe before. Awe. I ask you. Did you ever hear such a\u2014\u201d She stops midtrack, claps her hand to her mouth, and gives me a rueful look. \u201cDamn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d I say comfortingly. \u201cYou were provoked.\u201d</p><p>Laurel has made a New Year\u2019s resolution not to talk about her ex-husband or his mistress anymore, because her therapist, Hans, has told her it isn\u2019t healthy for her. Unfortunately she\u2019s finding this resolution quite hard to keep. Not that I blame her. He sounds like a complete pig.</p><p>\u201cYou know what Hans told me last week?\u201d she says as I open the door of my fitting room. \u201cHe told me to write down a list of everything I wanted to say about that woman \u2014 and then tear it up. He said I\u2019d feel a sense of freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right,\u201d I say interestedly. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wrote it all down,\u201d says Laurel. \u201cAnd then I mailed it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. Not helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on in,\u201d I say, trying not to laugh, \u201cand tell me what you\u2019ve been up to. I\u2019m a little behind this morning...\u201d</p><p>One of the best things about working as a personal shopper is you get really close to your clients. In fact, some of them feel like friends. When I first met Laurel, she\u2019d just split up with her husband. She was really low, and had zero self-confidence. Now, I\u2019m not trying to boast, but when I found her the perfect Armani dress to wear to this huge ballet gala that he was going to be at \u2014 when I watched her staring at herself in the mirror, raising her chin and smiling and feeling like an attractive woman again \u2014 I honestly felt I\u2019d made a difference to her life.</p> <p>This morning Laurel is looking for a couple of suits for work. I know her so well now it\u2019s easy to pick out what will sit well on her tall frame. We have a nice easy chat, and talk about the new Brad Pitt movie, and Laurel tells me all about her new, very sexy golf coach.</p><p>\u201cMy entire game has fallen to pieces,\u201d she says, pulling a face. \u201cI\u2019m no longer aiming to hit the ball in the hole. I\u2019m just aiming to look thin and attractive and the ball can go where the hell it likes.\u201d</p><p>As she gets changed back into her own daywear I come out of the fitting room, holding a pile of clothes.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t possibly wear that,\u201d comes a muffled voice from Erin\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cIf you just try it\u2014\u201d I can hear Erin saying.</p><p>\u201cYou know I never wear that color!\u201d The voice rises, and I freeze.</p> <p>That\u2019s a British accent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not wasting my time anymore! If you bring me things I can\u2019t wear\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tiny spiders are crawling up and down my back. I don\u2019t believe it. It can\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut you asked for a new look!\u201d says Erin helplessly.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you\u2019ve got what I asked for.\u201d</p><p>And before I can move, here she is, walking out of Erin\u2019s fitting room, as tall and blonde and immaculate as ever, her lips already curving into a supercilious smile. Her hair is sleek and her blue eyes are sparkling and she looks on top of the world.</p><p>Alicia Billington.</p><p>Alicia Bitch Longlegs.</p> <p>I meet her eyes \u2014 and it\u2019s like an electric shock all over my body. Inside my tailored gray trousers, I can feel my legs starting to tremble. I haven\u2019t laid eyes on Alicia Billington for well over a year. I should be able to deal with this. But it\u2019s as though that time has concertinaed into nothing. The memories of all our encounters are as strong and sore as ever. What she did to me. What she tried to do to Luke.</p><p>She\u2019s looking at me with the same patronizing air she used to use when she was a PR girl and I was a brand-new financial reporter. And although I tell myself firmly that I\u2019ve grown up a lot since then, that I\u2019m a strong woman with a successful career and nothing to prove... I can still feel myself shrinking inside. Turning back into the girl who always felt a bit of a flake, who never knew quite what to say.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d she says, looking at me as though highly amused. \u201cWell, I never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Alicia,\u201d I say, and somehow force myself to smile courteously. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had heard you were working in a shop, but I thought that must be a joke.\u201d She gives a little laugh. \u201cYet... here you are. Makes sense, really.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t just \u201cwork in a shop\u201d! I want to yell furiously. I\u2019m a personal shopper! It\u2019s a skilled profession! I help people!</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still with Luke, are you?\u201d She gives me mock concerned look. \u201cIs his company finally back on track? I know he went through a rough time.\u201d</p><p>I cannot believe this girl. It was she who tried to sabotage Luke\u2019s company. It was she who set up a rival PR company that went bust. It was she who lost all her boyfriend\u2019s money \u2014 and apparently had to be bailed out by her dad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now she\u2019s behaving as though she won.</p><p>I swallow several times, trying to find the right response. I know I\u2019m worth more than Alicia. I should be able to come up with the perfect, polite, yet witty retort. But somehow it doesn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m living in New York myself,\u201d she says airily. \u201cSo I expect we\u2019ll see each other again. Maybe you\u2019ll sell me a pair of shoes.\u201d She gives me a final patronizing smile, hoists her Chanel bag on her shoulder, and walks out of the department.</p><p>When she\u2019s left, there\u2019s silence all around.</p> <p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d says Laurel at last, who has come out of the fitting room only half dressed, without me noticing.</p><p>\u201cThat was... Alicia Bitch Longlegs,\u201d I say, half dazed.</p><p>\u201cAlicia Bitch Fatass more like,\u201d says Laurel. \u201cI always say, there\u2019s no bitch like an English bitch.\u201d She gives me a hug. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Whoever she is, she\u2019s just jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and rub my head, trying to clear my thoughts. But I\u2019m still a bit shell-shocked, to be honest. I never thought I\u2019d have to set eyes on Alicia again.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d says Erin, as Laurel goes back into the fitting room. \u201cI had no idea you and Alicia knew each other!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea she was a client of yours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t show up very often.\u201d Erin pulls a face. \u201cI never met anyone so fussy. So what\u2019s the story between you two?\u201d</p><p>Oh, nothing! I want to say. She just trashed me to the tabloids and nearly ruined Luke\u2019s career, and has been a complete bitch to me from the very first moment I met her. Nothing to speak of.</p><p>\u201cWe just have a bit of a history,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cYou know she\u2019s engaged too? To Peter Blake. Very old money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d My brow wrinkles. \u201cI thought she got married last year. To a British guy. Ed... somebody?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe did! Except she didn\u2019t. Oh my God, didn\u2019t you hear the story?\u201d A pair of customers are wandering past the personal shopping area, and Erin lowers her voice. \u201cThey had the wedding and they were at the reception \u2014 when in walks Peter Blake as someone\u2019s date. Alicia hadn\u2019t known he was coming, but apparently the minute she found out who he was, she totally zeroed in on him. So they started chatting and were really getting on \u2014 like, really getting on... but what can Alicia do, she\u2019s married!\u201d Erin\u2019s face is shiny with glee. \u201cSo she went up to the priest and said she wanted an annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked for an annulment! At her own wedding reception! She said they hadn\u2019t consummated it so it didn\u2019t count.\u201d Erin gives a little gurgle of laughter. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help giving a halfhearted laugh in response. \u201cI can believe anything of Alicia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said she always gets what she wants. Apparently the wedding is going to be to die for. But she\u2019s a complete bridezilla. Like, she\u2019s practically forced one of the ushers to have a nose job, and she\u2019s sacked every florist in New York... the wedding planner\u2019s going nuts! Who\u2019s your wedding planner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum,\u201d I reply, and Erin\u2019s eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s a wedding planner? I never knew that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you moron!\u201d I giggle, starting to cheer up. \u201cMy mum\u2019s organizing the wedding. She\u2019s got it all under control already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh right.\u201d Erin nods. \u201cWell \u2014 that probably makes things easier. So you can keep your distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It should be really simple. Cross fingers!\u201d I add, and we both laugh.</p><p>Five</p><p>I ARRIVE AT LA Goulue at one o\u2019clock on the dot, but Elinor isn\u2019t there yet. I\u2019m shown to a table and sip my mineral water while I wait for her. The place is busy, as it always is at this time, mostly with smartly dressed women. All around me is chatter and the gleam of expensive teeth and jewels, and I take the opportunity to eavesdrop shamelessly. At the table next to mine, a woman wearing heavy eyeliner and an enormous brooch is saying emphatically, \u201cYou simply cannot furnish an apartment these days under one hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I said to Edgar, \u2018I am a human being,\u2019 \u201d says a red-haired girl on my other side.</p><p>Her friend chews on a celery stick and looks at her with bright, avid eyes. \u201cSo what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne room, you\u2019re talking thirty thousand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018Hilary\u2014\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRebecca?\u201d</p><p>I look up, a bit annoyed to miss what Edgar said, to see Elinor approaching the table, wearing a cream jacket with large black buttons and carrying a matching clutch bag. To my surprise she\u2019s not alone. A woman with a shiny chestnut bob, wearing a navy blue suit and holding a large Coach bag, is with her.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, may I present Robyn de Bendern,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cOne of New York\u2019s finest wedding planners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cWell... Hello!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d says Robyn, taking both my hands and gazing intently into my eyes. \u201cWe meet at last. I\u2019m so delighted to meet you. So delighted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d I say, trying to match her vivacity while simultaneously racking my brain. Did Elinor mention meeting a wedding planner? Am I supposed to know about this?</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty face!\u201d says Robyn, without letting go of my hands. She\u2019s taking in every inch of me, and I find myself reciprocating. She looks in her forties, immaculately made up with bright hazel eyes, sharp cheekbones, and a wide smile exposing a row of immaculate teeth. Her air of enthusiasm is infectious, but her eyes are appraising as she takes a step back and sweeps over the rest of me.</p><p>\u201cSuch a young, fresh look. My dear, you\u2019ll make a stunning bride. Do you know yet what you\u2019ll be wearing on the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... a wedding dress?\u201d I say stupidly, and Robyn bursts into peals of laughter.</p> <p>\u201cThat humor!\u201d she cries. \u201cYou British girls! You were quite right,\u201d she adds to Elinor, who gives a gracious nod.</p><p>Elinor was right? What about?</p><p>Have they been talking about me?</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d I say, trying to take an unobtrusive step backward. \u201cShall we...\u201d I nod toward the table.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d says Robyn, as though I\u2019ve made the most genius suggestion she\u2019s ever heard. \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d As she sits down I notice she\u2019s wearing a brooch of two intertwined wedding rings, encrusted with diamonds.</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d says Robyn. \u201cThe Gilbrooks gave it to me after I planned their daughter\u2019s wedding. Now that was a drama! Poor Bitty Gilbrook\u2019s nail broke at the last minute and we had to fly her manicurist in by helicopter...\u201d She pauses as though lost in memories, then snaps to. \u201cSo, Rebecca.\u201d She beams at me and I can\u2019t help beaming back. \u201cLucky, lucky girl. Tell me, are you enjoying every moment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I always say is, the first week after you\u2019re engaged is the most precious time of all. You have to savor it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s been a couple of weeks now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSavor it,\u201d says Robyn, lifting a finger. \u201cWallow in it. What I always say is, no one else can have those memories for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK!\u201d I say with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll... wallow in it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we start,\u201d says Elinor, \u201cI must give you one of these.\u201d She reaches into her bag and puts an invitation down on the table.</p><p>What\u2019s this?</p><p>Mrs. Elinor Sherman requests the pleasure of your company...</p> <p>Wow. Elinor\u2019s holding an engagement party! For us!</p><p>\u201cGosh!\u201d I look up. \u201cWell... thanks. I didn\u2019t know we were having an engagement party!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discussed the matter with Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He never mentioned it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have slipped his mind.\u201d Elinor gives me a cold, gracious smile. \u201cI will have a stack of these delivered to your apartment and you can invite some friends of your own. Say... ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... er... thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, shall we have some champagne, to celebrate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely idea!\u201d says Robyn. \u201cWhat I always say is, if you can\u2019t celebrate a wedding, what can you celebrate?\u201d She gives me a twinkling smile and I smile back. I\u2019m warming to this woman. But I still don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing here.</p><p>\u201cErm... I was just wondering, Robyn,\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cAre you here in a... professional capacity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no. No, no, nooooo.\u201d Robyn shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not a profession. It\u2019s a calling. The hours I put in... the sheer love I put into my job...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I glance uncertainly at Elinor. \u201cWell, the thing is \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to need any help. Although it\u2019s very kind of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo help?\u201d Robyn throws back her head and peals with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to need any help? Please!

But when they see the results...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobyn is unparalleled in this city,\u201d says Elinor, taking a sip of champagne, and Robyn gives a modest smile.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s start with the basics,\u201d she says, and takes out a large, leather-bound notebook. \u201cThe wedding\u2019s on June 22nd...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca and Luke...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the Plaza Hotel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking it that both the ceremony and reception will take place there?\u201d She looks up at Elinor.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d says Elinor, nodding. \u201cMuch easier that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 the ceremony in the Terrace Room?\u201d She scribbles for a moment. \u201cAnd then the reception in the Ballroom. Lovely. And how many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d I say, planting a hand on her notebook. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wedding,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cTo my son.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt the Plaza Hotel,\u201d says Robyn with a beam. \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you how lucky you are, getting the date you wanted! Luckily it was a client of mine who made the cancellation, so I was able to snap it right up for you then and there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting married at the Plaza Hotel!\u201d</p><p>Robyn looks sharply at Elinor, concern creasing her brow. \u201cI thought you\u2019d spoken to John Ferguson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d replies Elinor crisply. \u201cI spoke with him yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! Because as you know, we\u2019re on a very tight schedule. A Plaza wedding in less than five months? There are some wedding planners who would simply say, impossible! I am not that wedding planner. I did a wedding once in three days. Three days! Of course, that was on a beach, so it was a little different\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, the Plaza\u2019s booked?\u201d I turn in my chair. \u201cElinor, we\u2019re getting married in Oxshott. You know we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOxshott?\u201d Robyn wrinkles her brow. \u201cI don\u2019t know it. Is it upstate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome provisional arrangements have been made,\u201d says Elinor dismissively. \u201cThey can easily be cancelled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not provisional!\u201d I stare at Elinor in fury. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t be cancelled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I sense some tension here,\u201d says Robyn brightly. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just go make a few calls...\u201d She picks up her mobile and moves off to the side of the restaurant, and Elinor and I are left glaring at each other.</p><p>I take a deep breath, trying to stay calm. \u201cElinor, I\u2019m not getting married in New York. I\u2019m getting married at home. Mum\u2019s already started organizing it. You know she has!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not getting married in some unknown backyard in England,\u201d says Elinor crisply. \u201cDo you know who Luke is? Do you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone with a modicum of intelligence, you\u2019re very naive.\u201d Elinor takes a sip of champagne. \u201cThis is the most important social event in all our lives. It must be done properly. Lavishly. The Plaza is unsurpassed for weddings. You must be aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mum\u2019s already started planning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she can stop planning. Rebecca, your mother will be grateful to have the wedding taken off her hands. It goes without saying, I will fund the entire event. She can attend as a guest.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe won\u2019t want to attend as some guest!

I can\u2019t believe Luke knows anything about this. In fact, I feel like ringing him up right now and telling him exactly what I think.</p> <p>But then I remember he\u2019s at a board lunch... and I also remember him asking me to give his mother a chance. Well, fine. I\u2019ll give her a chance. I\u2019ll go along and see the room, and walk around and nod politely and say nothing. And then tonight I\u2019ll tell her equally politely that I\u2019m still getting married in Oxshott.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Elinor\u2019s mouth moves a few millimeters. \u201cShall we order?\u201d</p><p>Throughout lunch, Elinor and Robyn talk about all the New York weddings they\u2019ve ever been to, and I eat my food silently, resisting their attempts to draw me into the conversation. Outwardly I\u2019m calm, but inside I can\u2019t stop seething. How dare Elinor try and take over? How dare she just hire a wedding planner without even consulting me? How dare she call Mum\u2019s garden an \u201cunknown backyard\u201d?</p><p>She\u2019s just an interfering cow, and if she thinks I\u2019m going to get married in some huge anonymous New York hotel instead of at home with all my friends and family, she can just think again.</p> <p>We finish lunch and decline coffee, and head outside. It\u2019s a brisk, breezy day with clouds scudding along the blue sky.</p><p>As we walk toward the Plaza, Robyn smiles at me. \u201cI can understand if you\u2019re a little tense. It can be very stressful, planning a New York wedding. Some of my clients get very... wound up, shall we say.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not planning a New York wedding! I want to yell. I\u2019m planning an Oxshott wedding! But instead I just smile and say, \u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have one client in particular who\u2019s really quite demanding...\u201d Robyn exhales sharply. \u201cBut as I say, it is a stressful business... Ah. Here we are! Isn\u2019t it an impressive sight?\u201d</p><p>As I look up at the opulent facade of the Plaza I grudgingly have to admit it looks pretty good. It stretches up above Plaza Square like a wedding cake, with flags flying above a grand porticoed entrance.</p><p>\u201cHave you been to a wedding here before?\u201d asks Robyn.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve never been inside at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! Well... In we go...\u201d says Robyn, ushering Elinor and me up the steps, past uniformed porters, through a revolving door, and into an enormous reception hall with a high, ornate ceiling, a marble floor, and huge gilded pillars. Directly in front of us is a light, bright area filled with palms and trellises where people are drinking coffee and a harp is playing and waiters in gray uniforms are hurrying around with silver coffeepots.</p><p>I suppose, if I\u2019m honest, this is quite impressive too.</p><p>\u201cAlong here,\u201d says Robyn, taking my arm and leading us to a cordoned-off staircase. She unclasps a heavy rope cordon and we head up a grand staircase, and through another vast marble hall. Everywhere I look are ornate carvings, antiques, wall hangings, the hugest chandeliers I\u2019ve ever seen...</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Ferguson, the executive director of catering.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, a dapper man in a jacket has appeared. He shakes my hand and beams at me.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the Plaza, Rebecca! And may I say, you\u2019ve made a very wise choice. There\u2019s nothing in the world like a Plaza wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d I say politely. \u201cWell, it seems a very nice hotel...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever your fantasy, whatever your cherished dream, we\u2019ll do everything we can to create it for you. Isn\u2019t that right, Robyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d says Robyn fondly. \u201cYou simply couldn\u2019t be in better hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go and look at the Terrace Room first?\u201d Mr. Ferguson\u2019s eyes twinkle. \u201cThis is the room where the ceremony will take place. I think you\u2019ll like it.\u201d</p><p>We sweep back through the vast marble hall and he opens a pair of double doors, and we walk into an enormous room, surrounded by a white balustraded terrace. At one end is a marble fountain, at the other steps up to a raised area. Everywhere I look, people are scurrying around, arranging flowers and draping chiffon and placing gilt chairs in angled rows on the richly patterned carpet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wow.</p><p>This is actually... quite nice.</p><p>Oh, sod it.

They\u2019re the hugest, most spectacular flower arrangements I\u2019ve ever seen in my life! Cascading roses, and tulips, and lilies... and are those orchids?</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ll come in through these double doors,\u201d says Robyn, leading me along the terrace, \u201cand then the bugles will play... or trumpets... whatever you wish... You\u2019ll pause in front of the grotto, arrange your train, have some photographs. And then the string orchestra will begin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cString orchestra?\u201d I echo dazedly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to the New York Phil,\u201d she adds to Elinor. \u201cThey\u2019re checking their tour schedule, so, fingers crossed...\u201d</p> <p>The New York Phil?</p><p>\u201cThe bride on Saturday is having seven harpists,\u201d says Mr. Ferguson. \u201cAnd a soprano soloist from the Met.\u201d</p><p>Robyn and Elinor look at each other.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s an idea,\u201d says Robyn, and reaches for her notebook. \u201cI\u2019ll get onto it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go and look at the Baroque Room now?\u201d suggests Mr. Ferguson, and leads us to a large, old-fashioned elevator.</p><p>\u201cThe night before the wedding, you\u2019ll probably want to take a suite upstairs and enjoy the spa facilities,\u201d he says pleasantly as we travel upward. \u201cThen on the day, you can bring in your own professional hair and makeup people.\u201d He smiles. \u201cBut I expect you\u2019ve already thought of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI... er...\u201d My mind flicks madly back to Janice and Radiant Spring Bride. \u201cKind of...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guests will be served cocktails as they pass along the corridor,\u201d explains Robyn as we leave the elevator. \u201cThen this is the Baroque Room, where hors d\u2019oeuvres will be served before we go into the Grand Ballroom. I expect you haven\u2019t even given hors d\u2019oeuvres a thought yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... um... you know...\u201d I\u2019m about to say that everyone likes minisausages.</p><p>\u201cBut for example,\u201d she continues, \u201cyou could consider a caviar bar, an oyster bar, a Mediterranean meze table, sushi, perhaps...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I gulp. \u201cThat... sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd of course, the space itself can be themed however you like.\u201d She gestures around the room. \u201cWe can transform it into a Venetian carnival, a Japanese garden, a medieval banqueting hall... wherever your imagination takes you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then into the Grand Ballroom for the main reception!\u201d says Mr. Ferguson cheerfully. He throws open a pair of double doors and... oh my God. This room is the most spectacular of all. It\u2019s all white and gold, with a high ceiling and theatrical boxes, and tables set around the vast, polished dance floor.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you and Luke will lead the dancing,\u201d says Robyn with a happy sigh. \u201cI always say, that\u2019s the moment of a wedding I love the most. The first dance.\u201d</p> <p>I gaze at the shining floor, and have a sudden vision of Luke and me whirling round among the candlelight and everyone looking on.</p><p>And seven harps.</p><p>And the New York Phil.</p><p>And caviar... and oysters... and cocktails...</p><p>\u201cRebecca, are you all right?\u201d says Mr. Ferguson, suddenly seeing my expression.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s a little overwhelmed,\u201d says Robyn with a little laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to take in, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes. I suppose so.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath and turn away for a moment. OK, let\u2019s not get carried away. This may all be very glitzy, but I am not going to be swayed by any of it. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to get married in England \u2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. End of story.</p><p>Except... just look at it all.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit down,\u201d says Robyn, patting a gilt chair beside her. \u201cNow, I know from your point of view it still seems far off. But we\u2019re on a pretty tight schedule... so I just wanted to talk to you about your overall view of the wedding. What\u2019s your fantasy? What, for you, is the image of pure romance? A lot of my clients say Scarlett and Rhett, or Fred and Ginger...\u201d She looks at me with sparkling eyes, her pen poised expectantly over the page.</p><p>This has gone far enough.

Of course I\u2019m not. It\u2019s unthinkable. I\u2019m going to get married at home, just like I planned, with a nice marquee in the garden. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to change my plans. None at all.</p><p>Except... it would be amazing. Walking down that aisle in front of four hundred people, to the sound of a string orchestra, with amazing flower arrangements everywhere. Having the huge, dreamy, Lady Di wedding I always fantasized about but thought was beyond my grasp. I mean, it\u2019d be Becky\u2019s Big Day come to life.</p><p>Then we\u2019d all sit down to some incredible dinner... Robyn gave me some sample dinner menus, and the food! Rosace of Maine Lobster... Fowl Consomm\u00e9 with Quenelles of Pheasant... Wild Rice with Pignoli Nuts...</p><p>I know Oxshott and Ashtead Quality Caterers are good \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure they even know what a pignoli nut is. (To be honest, I don\u2019t either. But that\u2019s not the point.)</p><p>And maybe Elinor\u2019s right, Mum would be grateful if we took the whole thing off her hands. Yes. Maybe she\u2019s finding the organization more of a strain than she\u2019s letting on. Maybe she\u2019s already wishing she hadn\u2019t volunteered to do the whole thing. Whereas if we get married at the Plaza, she won\u2019t have to do anything, just turn up. Plus Mum and Dad wouldn\u2019t have to pay for a thing... I mean, it would be doing them a favor!</p><p>So as I\u2019m walking back to Barneys, I take out my mobile and dial the number for home. As Mum answers I can hear the closing music of Crimewatch in the background, and I suddenly feel a wave of nostalgia for home. I can just imagine Mum and Dad sitting there, with the curtains drawn and the gas-effect fire flickering cozily.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d exclaims Mum. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve phoned! I\u2019ve been trying to fax you through some menus from the catering company, but your machine won\u2019t work. Dad says, have you checked your paper recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm... I don\u2019t know. Listen, Mum\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd listen to this! Janice\u2019s sister-in-law knows someone who works at a balloon printing company! She says if we order two hundred or more balloons we can have the helium for free!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat!

Damn. I should never have mentioned Elinor.</p><p>\u201cYes, well. We don\u2019t want her contributions, thank you. We can manage very well by ourselves. Is this Elinor\u2019s idea, then, a hotel? Does she think we can\u2019t put on a nice wedding?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say hastily. \u201cIt\u2019s just... it\u2019s nothing! I was just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad says, if she\u2019s so keen on hotels, she can stay at one instead of with us.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019m just making everything worse.</p><p>\u201cLook... forget it. It was a silly idea.\u201d I rub my face. \u201cSo \u2014 how are the plans going?\u201d</p><p>We chat for a few more minutes, and I hear all about the nice man from the marquee company and how his quote was very reasonable, and how his son was at school with cousin Alex, isn\u2019t it a small world? By the end of our conversation Mum sounds completely mollified and all talk of American hotels has been forgotten.</p><p>I say good-bye, turn off the phone, and exhale sharply. Right. Well, that\u2019s decided. I might as well call Elinor and tell her. No point in hanging around.</p><p>I turn on my mobile again, dial two digits, and then stop.</p><p>On the other hand \u2014 is there any point in rushing straight into a decision?</p> <p>I mean, you never know. Maybe Mum and Dad will talk it over this evening and change their minds. Maybe they\u2019ll come out to have a look. Maybe if they actually saw the Plaza... if they saw how magical it was all going to be... how luxurious... how glamorous... I can\u2019t quite bear to give it up. Not quite yet.</p><p>When I get home, Luke is sitting at the table, frowning over some papers.</p><p>\u201cYou came home early!\u201d I say, pleased.</p><p>\u201cI had some papers to go over,\u201d says Luke. \u201cThought I\u2019d get some peace and quiet here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>As I get near I see that they\u2019re all headed \u201cThe Elinor Sherman Foundation.\u201d I open my mouth to say something \u2014 then close it again.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, looking up with a little smile, \u201cwhat did you think of the Plaza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about it?\u201d I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course I did. I would have come along too if I hadn\u2019t had a lunch appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Luke...\u201d I take a deep breath, trying not to overreact. \u201cYou know my mother\u2019s planning a wedding in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early days, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have just fixed up a meeting like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother thought it would be a good way to surprise you. So did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpring it on me, you mean!\u201d I retort crossly, and Luke looks at me, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you like the Plaza? I thought you\u2019d be overwhelmed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I liked it. That\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how much you\u2019ve always wanted a big, magnificent wedding. When my mother offered to host a wedding at the Plaza, it seemed like a gift. In fact, it was my idea to surprise you. I thought you\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>He looks a bit deflated and immediately guilt pours over me. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that Luke might have been in on the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I am thrilled! It\u2019s just... I don\u2019t think Mum would be very happy, us getting married in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you talk her round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that easy. Your mother\u2019s been pretty high-handed, you know\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHigh-handed? She\u2019s only trying to give us a wonderful wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she really wanted to, she could give us a wonderful wedding in England,\u201d I point out. \u201cOr she could help Mum and Dad \u2014 and they could all give us a wonderful wedding! But instead, she talks about their garden as an \u2018unknown backyard\u2019!\u201d Resentment flares up inside me again as I remember Elinor\u2019s dismissive voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because it isn\u2019t in the middle of New York! I mean, she doesn\u2019t know anything about it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK, fine,\u201d says Luke shortly. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your point. You don\u2019t want the wedding. But if you ask me, my mother\u2019s being incredibly generous. Offering to pay for a wedding at the Plaza, plus she\u2019s arranged us a pretty lavish engagement party...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I want a lavish engagement party?\u201d I retort before I can stop myself.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit churlish, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t care about all the glitz and the glamour and the... the material things! Maybe my family is more important to me! And tradition... and... and honor. You know, Luke, we\u2019re only on this planet for a short time...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d says Luke in exasperation. \u201cYou win! If it\u2019s really going to be a problem, forget it! You don\u2019t have to come to the engagement party if you don\u2019t want to \u2014 and we\u2019ll get married in Oxshott. Happy now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI...\u201d I break off, and rub my nose. Of course, it is a fairly amazing offer. And if I could somehow persuade Mum and Dad, maybe we\u2019d all have the most fantastic time of our lives.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a question of getting married in Oxshott,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of... of... coming to the right decision. Look, you were the one saying we didn\u2019t have to rush into anything...\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s expression softens, and he gets up.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sighs. \u201cLook, Becky, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d I mumble.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is ridiculous.\u201d He puts his arms around me and kisses my forehead. \u201cAll I wanted to do was give you the wedding you\u2019ve always dreamed of. If you really don\u2019t want to get married at the Plaza, then of course we won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just explain to her how you feel.\u201d Luke gazes at me for a few moments. \u201cBecky, it doesn\u2019t matter to me where we get married. It doesn\u2019t matter to me whether we have pink flowers or blue flowers. What matters to me is we\u2019re going to become a couple \u2014 and the whole world is going to know it.\u201d</p><p>He sounds so sure and steady, I feel a sudden lump in my throat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what matters to me too,\u201d I say, and swallow hard. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. So let\u2019s agree. You can make the decision. Just tell me where to turn up \u2014 and I\u2019ll turn up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I smile back at him. \u201cI promise to give you at least forty-eight hours\u2019 notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four will do.\u201d He kisses me again, then points to the sideboard. \u201cThat arrived, by the way. An engagement present.\u201d</p><p>I look over and gape. It\u2019s a robin\u2019s-egg-blue box, tied up with white ribbon. A present from Tiffany!</p> <p>\u201cShall I open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Excitedly I untie the ribbon and open the box to find a blue glass bowl nestling in tissue paper, and a card reading \u201cWith best wishes from Marty and Alison Gerber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! This is nice! Who are the Gerbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Friends of my mother\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... will everyone who comes to the party bring us a present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... right.\u201d</p><p>Gosh. When Tom and Lucy had their engagement party, only about three people brought presents. And they certainly weren\u2019t from Tiffany. I stare at the bowl thoughtfully, running my finger over its gleaming surface.</p><p>You know, maybe Luke does have a point. Maybe it would be churlish to throw Elinor\u2019s generosity back in her face.</p><p>OK, what I\u2019ll do is, I\u2019ll wait until the engagement party\u2019s over. And then I\u2019ll decide.</p><p>The engagement party is at six o\u2019clock the following Friday. I mean to get there early, but we have a frantic day at work, with three big emergencies \u2014 one of which involves our most demanding celebrity client, who clearly has not got over her recent breakup, whatever she may say in People magazine. Anyway, so I don\u2019t arrive until ten past six, feeling a little flustered. On the plus side, I\u2019m wearing a completely fabulous black strapless dress, which fits me perfectly. (Actually, it was earmarked for Regan Hartman, one of my clients. But I\u2019ll just tell her I don\u2019t think it would suit her after all.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elinor\u2019s duplex is in a grand building on Park Avenue, with the most enormous marble-floored foyer and walnut-lined elevators that always smell of expensive scent. As I step out at the sixth floor I can hear the hubbub and tinkle of piano music. There\u2019s a queue of people waiting at the door, and I wait politely behind an elderly couple in matching fur coats. I can just see through to the apartment, which is dimly lit and already seems to be full of people.</p><p>To be honest, I\u2019ve never really liked Elinor\u2019s apartment. It\u2019s all done in pale blue, with silk sofas and heavy curtains and the dullest pictures in the world hanging on the walls. I can\u2019t believe she really likes any of them. In fact, I can\u2019t believe she ever looks at any of them.</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d A voice interrupts my thoughts and I realize I\u2019ve reached the head of the queue. A woman in a black trouser suit, holding a clipboard, is giving me a professional smile.</p><p>\u201cMay I have your name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRebecca Bloomwood,\u201d I say modestly, expecting her to gasp, or at least light up with recognition.</p><p>\u201cBloomwood... Bloomwood...\u201d The woman looks down the list, turns a page, and runs her finger to the bottom before looking up. \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at her. \u201cIt must be there somewhere!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look again...\u201d The woman goes up to the top and runs her eyes down more slowly. \u201cNo,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Sorry.\u201d She turns to a blond woman who has just arrived. \u201cGood evening! May I take your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but... the party\u2019s for me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVanessa Dillon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh yes,\u201d says the door woman, and crosses off her name with a smile. \u201cPlease go in. Serge will take your coat. Could you please step aside, miss?\u201d she adds coldly to me. \u201cYou\u2019re blocking the doorway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to let me in! I must be on the list!\u201d I peer inside the door, hoping to see Luke, or even Elinor \u2014 but it\u2019s just a load of people I don\u2019t recognize. \u201cPlease! Honestly, I\u2019m supposed to be here!\u201d</p><p>The woman in black sighs. \u201cDo you have your invitation with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t have one. I\u2019m the... the engagee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d She stares at me blankly.</p> <p>\u201cThe party\u2019s for me! And Luke... oh God...\u201d I peer again into the party and suddenly spot Robyn, dressed in a silver beaded top and floaty skirt.</p><p>\u201cRobyn!\u201d I call, as discreetly as I can. \u201cRobyn! They won\u2019t let me in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Robyn\u2019s face lights up. \u201cAt last!\u201d She beckons gaily with her champagne glass with one hand, while with the other she moves a pair of men in dinner jackets out of my path. \u201cCome on, belle of the ball!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I say desperately. \u201cI\u2019m not gate-crashing! The party\u2019s being given for me!\u201d</p><p>The blond woman stares at me for a long time \u2014 then shrugs. \u201cOK. You can go in. Serge will take your coat. Do you have a gift?\u201d</p><p>A gift? Has she listened to anything I\u2019ve been saying?</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The woman rolls her eyes as though to say, \u201cThat figures\u201d\u2014then turns to the next person in the queue, and I hurry in before she changes her mind.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay long,\u201d says Robyn as I join her. \u201cI have three rehearsal dinners to go to. But I particularly wanted to see you tonight, because I have exciting news. A very talented event designer is going to be working on your wedding! Sheldon Lloyd, no less!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I say, trying to match her tone even though I have no idea who Sheldon Lloyd is. \u201cGosh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bowled over, aren\u2019t you? What I always say is, if you want to make things happen, make them happen now! So I\u2019ve been speaking with Sheldon and we\u2019ve been tossing around some ideas. He thought your Sleeping Beauty concept was fabulous, by the way. Really original.\u201d She looks around and lowers her voice. \u201cHis idea is... we turn the Terrace Room into an enchanted forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019m so thrilled, I just have to show you!\u201d</p><p>She opens her bag and pulls out a sketch, and I stare at it in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have birch trees imported from Switzerland, and garlands of fairy lights. You\u2019ll walk down an avenue of trees, with their branches hanging over you. Pine needles will give off a wonderful scent as you walk, flowers will magically blossom as you pass, and trained songbirds will sing overhead... What do you think about an animatronic squirrel?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cErm...\u201d I pull a little face.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t sure about that, either. OK... we\u2019ll forget the woodland creatures.\u201d She takes out a pen and scores out an entry. \u201cBut otherwise... it\u2019s going to be fabulous. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... Well...\u201d</p><p>Should I tell her I\u2019m still not quite decided about whether to get married in New York?</p> <p>Oh, but I can\u2019t. She\u2019ll stop all the preparations on the spot. She\u2019ll go and tell Elinor, and there\u2019ll be a terrible fuss.</p><p>And the thing is, I\u2019m sure we will end up going for the Plaza in the end. Once I\u2019ve worked out exactly how to win Mum round. I mean, we\u2019d be mad not to.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Sheldon has worked for many Hollywood stars,\u201d says Robyn, lowering her voice still further. \u201cWhen we meet him you can look at his portfolio. I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s quite something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel a sparkle of excitement. \u201cIt all sounds... fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d She looks at her watch. \u201cNow, I have to run. But I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d She squeezes my hand, downs her champagne, and hurries toward the door \u2014 and I stare after her, still a little dazzled.</p> <p>Hollywood stars! I mean, if Mum knew about that, wouldn\u2019t she see the whole thing differently? Wouldn\u2019t she realize what an amazing opportunity this is?</p><p>The trouble is, I can\u2019t quite pluck up courage to bring up the subject again. I didn\u2019t even dare tell her about this party. She\u2019d only get all upset and say, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Elinor think we can throw a nice engagement party?\u201d or something. And then I\u2019d feel even more guilty than I already do. Oh God. I just need a way to introduce the idea into her head once more, without her immediately getting upset. Maybe if I spoke to Janice... if I told her about the Hollywood stars...</p><p>A burst of laughter nearby brings me out of my thoughts, and I realize I\u2019m standing all alone. I take a sip of champagne and look for someone to join. The slightly weird thing is, this is supposed to be an engagement party for me and Luke. But there must be at least a hundred people here, and I don\u2019t know any of them. At least, I dimly recognize the odd face here and there \u2014 but not really well enough to bound up and say hello. I try smiling at a woman coming in, but she eyes me suspiciously and pushes her way toward a group standing by the window. You know, whoever said Americans were friendlier than the British can\u2019t ever have been to New York.</p><p>Danny should be here somewhere, I think, peering through the throng. I invited Erin and Christina too \u2014 but they were both still hard at it when I left Barneys. I expect they\u2019ll be along later.</p><p>Oh come on, I\u2019ve got to talk to someone. I should at least let Elinor know I\u2019m here. I\u2019m just elbowing my way past a group of women in matching black Armani when I hear someone saying \u201cDo you know the bride?\u201d</p><p>I freeze behind a pillar, trying to pretend I\u2019m not eavesdropping.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Does anybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe West Village somewhere. But apparently they\u2019re moving to this building.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the pillar in bemusement. What\u2019s that?</p><p>\u201cOh really? I thought it was impossible to get in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re related to Elinor Sherman!\u201d The women laugh gaily and move off into the melee, and I stare blankly at a molded curlicue.</p><p>They must have got that wrong. There\u2019s no way we\u2019re moving here. No way.</p><p>I wander aimlessly around for another few minutes, find myself a glass of champagne, and try to keep a cheerful smile on my face. But try as I might, it keeps slipping. This isn\u2019t exactly how I pictured my engagement party would be. First of all the doorpeople try to stop me going in. Then I don\u2019t know anybody. Then the only things to eat are low-fat, high-protein cubes of fish \u2014 and even then, the wait staff look taken aback when you actually eat them.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help thinking back slightly wistfully to Tom and Lucy\u2019s engagement party. It wasn\u2019t nearly as grand as this, of course. Janice made a big bowl of punch and there was a barbecue, and Martin sang \u201cAre You Lonesome Tonight?\u201d on the karaoke machine. But still. At least it was fun. At last I knew people. I knew more people at that party than I do at this one\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky! Why are you hiding?\u201d I look up and feel a swoosh of relief. There\u2019s Luke.</p><p>\u201cLuke! At last!\u201d I say, moving forward \u2014 then gasp in joy as I see a familiar, balding, middle-aged man standing beside him, grinning cheerfully at me. \u201cMichael!\u201d I throw my arms around him and give him a big hug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael Ellis has to be one of my favorite people in the world.

I\u2019m a bit rusty, but I could probably remember the words...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cAre you secretly a minister, as well as everything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He throws back his head and laughs. \u201cBut a few years back, some friends wanted me to marry them.

People would flock to your church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn atheist minister.\u201d Michael raises his eyebrows. \u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t be the first.\u201d He takes a sip of champagne. \u201cSo how\u2019s the shopping business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great, thanks.\u201d I beam at him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I recommend you to everyone I meet. \u2018You need clothes, go to Becky Bloomwood at Barneys.\u2019 I tell busboys, businessmen, random people I meet on the street...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered why I kept getting all these strange people through.\u201d I smile at him.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I wanted to ask a small favor.\u201d Michael lowers his voice slightly. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful if you could help out my daughter, Lucy. She just broke up with a guy and I think she\u2019s going through a patch of lacking self-confidence. I told her I knew who could fix her up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say, feeling touched. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t bankrupt her, though. Because she\u2019s only on a lawyer\u2019s salary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to,\u201d I say, laughing. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, you look pretty good already.\u201d I gesture to his immaculate dark gray suit, which I\u2019m certain didn\u2019t give him much change out of $3,000.</p><p>\u201cI always dress up when I know I\u2019m going to be seeing the beautiful people,\u201d says Michael. He looks around the party with an amused expression, and I follow his gaze. A nearby group of six middle-aged women are talking at each other animatedly, seemingly without taking breath. \u201cAre these your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I admit. \u201cI don\u2019t know many people here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed as much.\u201d He gives me a quizzical smile and takes a sip of champagne. \u201cSo... how are you getting along with your future mother-in-law?\u201d His expression is so innocent, I want to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, like a house on fire,\u201d I say, grinning. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d says Luke, suddenly appearing at my shoulder. He hands me a full glass of champagne and I shoot a glance at Michael.</p><p>\u201cWe were just talking about wedding plans,\u201d says Michael easily. \u201cHave you decided on a honeymoon location yet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t really talked about it.\u201d I look at Luke. \u201cBut I\u2019ve had some ideas.

And somewhere I\u2019ve never been before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to fit in much of a honeymoon,\u201d says Luke with a small frown. \u201cWe\u2019ve just taken on NorthWest and that means we may be looking at expanding again. So we might have to make do with a long weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long weekend?\u201d I stare at him in dismay. \u201cThat\u2019s not a honeymoon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d says Michael reprovingly. \u201cThat won\u2019t do. You have to take your wife on a nice honeymoon. As best man, I insist. Where have you never been, Becky? Venice? Rome? India? Africa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to any of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Michael raises his eyebrows. \u201cThis could turn out to be some honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has seen the world except me. I never even had a gap year. I never did Australia, or Thailand...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d says Luke, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything! You know, Suze\u2019s mother\u2019s best friend in the whole world is a Bolivian peasant.\u201d I look at Luke impressively. \u201cThey ground maize together on the plains of the Llanos!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s Bolivia,\u201d says Michael to Luke.</p><p>\u201cYou want to grind maize on our honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just think maybe we should broaden our horizons a bit. Like... go backpacking, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you aware of the concept of backpacking?\u201d says Luke mildly. \u201cAll your possessions in one rucksack. Which you have to carry. Not FedEx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cEasily! And we\u2019d meet loads of really interesting people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know interesting people already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know bankers and PR people! Do you know any Bolivian peasants? Do you know any homeless people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I do,\u201d says Luke. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... no,\u201d I admit after a pause. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. We should!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, Becky,\u201d says Luke lifting a hand. \u201cI have a solution. You organize the honeymoon. Anywhere you want, as long as it doesn\u2019t take more than two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I gape at him. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. You\u2019re right, we can\u2019t get married and not have a proper honeymoon.\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cSurprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, OK. I will!\u201d</p><p>I take a sip of champagne, feeling all bubbly with excitement. How cool is this? I get to choose the honeymoon! Maybe we should go to an amazing spa in Thailand, or something. Or some spectacular safari...</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of homeless,\u201d says Luke to Michael, \u201cwe\u2019ll be out on the streets in September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Michael. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lease on our apartment is up \u2014 and the owner\u2019s selling. Everyone out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say, suddenly diverted from pleasant visions of me and Luke standing on top of one of the pyramids. \u201cThat reminds me. Luke, I heard this really odd conversation just now. Some people were saying that we were going to move to this building. Where did they get that from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him blankly. \u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s a possibility? Have you gone mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I lower my voice a little. \u201cDo you really think I want to live in this stuffy building full of horrible old women who look at you as though you smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d interrupts Michael, jerking his head meaningfully.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d I turn to him. \u201cNot one of the people who lives in this building is nice! I\u2019ve met them, and they\u2019re all absolutely\u2014\u201d</p><p>Abruptly I halt, as I realize what Michael\u2019s trying to tell me.</p><p>\u201cExcept... for... Luke\u2019s mother,\u201d I add, trying to sound as natural as possible. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Rebecca,\u201d comes a chilly voice behind me, and I stand up, cheeks flaming.</p><p>There she is, standing behind me, wearing a long white Grecian-style dress that falls in pleats to the ground. She\u2019s so thin and pale, she looks just like one of her own pillars.</p><p>\u201cHello, Elinor,\u201d I say politely. \u201cYou look lovely. I\u2019m sorry I was a little late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d she replies, and offers me a cheek. \u201cI hope you\u2019ve been circulating?

Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now another happy occasion.\u201d He gestures around the room. \u201cI was just saying to Luke, how lucky he was to have landed such a beautiful, talented, accomplished girl as Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Elinor\u2019s smile freezes slightly.</p><p>\u201cBut you must feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d says Elinor at last.

I glance at Luke, and he\u2019s glowing with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cSo!

She visited Hampton Court six times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is spectacular,\u201d says a low voice in my ear, and I look round to see Danny gazing over my shoulder at Tarquin. \u201cUtterly spectacular. Is he a model?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, this story about him being a farmer.\u201d Danny drags on his cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Tarquin should be a model?\u201d I can\u2019t help a snort of laughter erupting through me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Danny defensively. \u201cHe has a fantastic look. I could design a whole collection around him. Prince Charles meets... Rupert Everett... meets\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny, you do know he\u2019s straight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I know he\u2019s straight! What do you take me for?\u201d Danny gives a thoughtful pause. \u201cBut he went to English boarding school, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d I give him a shove and look up. \u201cHi, Tarquin! You managed to get away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d says Tarquin, looking a bit harassed. \u201cSuze, darling, have you given Becky the stuff from her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s back at the hotel,\u201d says Suze, and turns to me. \u201cBex, we dropped in on your mum and dad on the way to the airport.

Think.</p><p>\u201cDanny,\u201d I say casually. \u201cI think the editor of Women\u2019s Wear Daily is over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Where?\u201d Danny\u2019s head swivels round. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second.\u201d He disappears off into the party and I subside in relief.</p><p>\u201cWhen we were there, they were having this huge argument about how big the marquee should be,\u201d says Suze with another giggle. \u201cThey made us sit on the lawn, pretending to be guests.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear about this.

So we were all admiring it, and I was holding a cup of coffee...\u201d She hangs her head. \u201cAnd then \u2014 I don\u2019t know how it happened, but... I spilled my coffee on the dress.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her incredulously. \u201cOn the dress? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe offered to clean it, of course,\u201d says Tarquin. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure it will be wearable. We\u2019re so incredibly sorry, Becky. And we\u2019ll pay for another dress, of course.\u201d He looks at his empty glass. \u201cCan I get anyone another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the dress is... ruined?\u201d I say, just to be sure.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it wasn\u2019t easy, I can tell you!\u201d says Suze as soon as Tarquin is out of earshot. \u201cThe first time I tried, your mum whisked it away just in time. Then she started getting all worried and saying she\u2019d better put it away. I had to practically throw my coffee cup at it, just as she was packing it up \u2014 and even then it only just caught the train. Of course, your mum hates me now,\u201d she adds gloomily. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t think I\u2019ll get invited to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Suze. She doesn\u2019t really. And thank you so much. You\u2019re a complete star.

But in real life...\u201d She pulls a little face.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Oh, Suze, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d Impulsively I give her a hug. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be all... married. What\u2019s being married like, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of the same,\u201d says Suze after a pause. \u201cExcept we have more plates\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a tapping on my shoulder and look up to see a red-haired woman wearing a pale silk trouser suit.</p><p>\u201cLaura Redburn Seymour,\u201d she says, extending her hand. \u201cMy husband and I have to go, but I just wanted to say I just heard about your wedding plans.

Does Barneys have a bridal department?\u201d</p><p>Thank God Suze is so sweet and unsuspicious.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ve had a quick look, but I haven\u2019t tried anything on yet. The only thing is, I haven\u2019t got an appointment, and it\u2019s a Saturday tomorrow.\u201d I wrinkle my brow. \u201cWe could try Vera Wang but that\u2019ll probably be all booked up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go baby shopping as well. I\u2019ve got a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve bought a couple of things,\u201d I say, looking fondly at her bump. \u201cYou know. Just little presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a really nice mobile...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got you one of those. And some really cute little outfits!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBex! You shouldn\u2019t have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a sale on at Baby Gap!\u201d I say defensively.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d interrupts a voice, and we both look up to see a lady in black and pearls approaching. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help overhearing your conversation just now. My name is Cynthia Harrison. I\u2019m a great friend of Elinor\u2019s and also of Robyn, your wedding planner. You\u2019re in very good hands there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I say politely. \u201cThat\u2019s nice to hear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a wedding dress, may I invite you both along to my new bridal boutique, Dream Dress?\u201d Cynthia Harrison beams at me. \u201cI\u2019ve been selling wedding dresses for twenty years, and this very week I\u2019ve opened a store on Madison Avenue. We have a huge selection of designer gowns, shoes, and accessories. Personal service in a luxurious environment. All your bridal needs catered to, however great or small.\u201d</p><p>She stops rather abruptly, as though she\u2019s been reading off a card.</p><p>\u201cWell... OK! We\u2019ll come tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we say eleven o\u2019clock?\u201d suggests Cynthia, and I glance at Suze, who nods.</p><p>\u201cEleven it is. Thank you very much!\u201d</p><p>As Cynthia Harrison departs, I grin at Suze excitedly. But she\u2019s peering over at the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with Luke?\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I turn round and stare. Luke and Michael are in the corner of the room, away from everyone else, and it looks as though they\u2019re arguing.</p><p>As I watch, Luke raises his voice defensively, and I catch the words \u201cthe bigger picture, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they talking about?\u201d says Suze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no idea!\u201d</p><p>I strain as hard as I can, but I can only hear the odd phrase.</p><p>\u201c... simply don\u2019t feel... appropriate...\u201d Michael is saying.</p><p>\u201c... short term... feel it\u2019s entirely appropriate...\u201d</p><p>Luke looks really rattled.</p><p>\u201c... wrong impression... abusing your position...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c... had enough of this!\u201d</p><p>I watch in dismay as Luke stalks off, out of the room. Michael looks completely taken aback by his reaction. For a moment he\u2019s stock still \u2014 then he reaches for his glass and takes a slug of whiskey.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve never known Luke and Michael to have a cross word before. I mean, Luke adores Michael. He practically sees him as a father figure. What on earth can be going on?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d I murmur to Suze, and hurry, as discreetly as possible, over to where Michael is still standing, staring into space.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d I demand as soon as I reach him. \u201cWhy were you and Luke fighting?\u201d</p><p>Michael looks up, startled \u2014 then quickly composes his features into a smile.</p><p>\u201cJust a little business disagreement,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing to worry about. So, have you decided on a honeymoon location yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael, come on. It\u2019s me! Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cWhat did you mean, Luke\u2019s abusing his position? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause and I can see Michael weighing up whether or not to tell me.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know,\u201d he says at last, \u201cthat at least one member of staff from Brandon Communications has been redeployed to work for the Elinor Sherman Foundation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him in shock. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve recently discovered that a new assistant at the company has been assigned to work for Luke\u2019s mother. Brandon Communications is still paying her salary \u2014 but essentially she\u2019s Elinor\u2019s full-time lackey. Naturally she\u2019s unhappy about the situation.\u201d Michael sighs. \u201cAll I wanted to do was raise the point, but Luke\u2019s very defensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything about this to me!\u201d I say incredulously.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said anything about it to anybody. I only found out because it so happens that this assistant knows my daughter, and felt she could call me up.\u201d Michael lowers his voice. \u201cThe real danger is that she might complain to the investors. Then Luke would be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his mother,\u201d I say at last. \u201cYou know what a hold she\u2019s got over him. He\u2019ll do anything to impress her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d says Michael. \u201cAnd I can understand that. Everyone has their own hang-ups.\u201d He looks at his watch. \u201cI have to go, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave! Not without talking to him again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that would do any good right now.\u201d Michael looks at me kindly. \u201cBecky, don\u2019t let this spoil your evening. And don\u2019t go and give Luke a hard time. It\u2019s obviously a very sensitive topic.\u201d He squeezes my arm. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I promise!\u201d I force myself to smile brightly. \u201cAnd thanks for coming, Michael. It meant a lot to us. Both of us.\u201d</p><p>I give him a warm hug and watch as he walks away. Then, when he\u2019s gone, I head out of the room. I have to talk to Luke, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Obviously, Michael\u2019s right. It\u2019s a very sensitive subject, so I won\u2019t go charging in. I\u2019ll just ask a few probing, tactful questions, and gently steer him in the right direction. Just like a future wife should.</p><p>Eventually I find him upstairs, sitting in a chair in his mother\u2019s bedroom, staring into space.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I just spoke to Michael!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cHe told me you were sending the Brandon Communications staff over to work for your mother\u2019s charity!\u201d</p> <p>Oops. That didn\u2019t quite come out right.</p><p>\u201cOne assistant,\u201d says Luke without turning his head. \u201cOK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t she hire her own assistant? Luke, what if your investors find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m not completely stupid. This whole charity thing will be good for the company too.\u201d At last he turns his head to look at me. \u201cThis business is all about image. When I\u2019m photographed handing over some enormous check to a deserving charity, the positive effect will be enormous. These days, people want to be associated with companies that give something back. I\u2019ve already planned a photo opportunity in the New York Post in a couple of weeks\u2019 time, plus a couple of carefully placed features. The effect on our profile will be huge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t Michael see it like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t listening. All he could talk about was how I was \u2018setting the wrong precedent.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he has a point! I mean, surely you hire staff in order to work for you, not to send off to other companies\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is a one-off example,\u201d says Luke impatiently. \u201cAnd in my opinion, the benefits to the company will far outweigh any costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael\u2019s your partner! You should listen to him. You should trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he should trust me!\u201d retorts Luke angrily. \u201cThere won\u2019t be a problem with the investors. Believe me, when they see the publicity we\u2019re going to generate, they\u2019ll be more than happy. If Michael could just understand that, instead of quibbling over stupid details... Where is he, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael had to go,\u201d I say \u2014 and see Luke\u2019s face tighten in shock.</p> <p>\u201cHe left? Oh, well. Great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. He had to.\u201d I sit down on the bed and take hold of Luke\u2019s hand. \u201cLuke, don\u2019t fight with Michael. He\u2019s been such a good friend. Come on, remember everything he\u2019s done for you? Remember the speech he made on your birthday?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying to lighten the atmosphere, but Luke doesn\u2019t seem to notice. His face is taut and defensive and his shoulders are hunched up. He\u2019s not going to listen to a word I say. I give an inward sigh and take a sip of champagne. I\u2019ll just have to wait until a better time.</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a few minutes \u2014 and after a while we both relax. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve called a truce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better go,\u201d I say at last. \u201cSuze doesn\u2019t know anybody down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long is she in New York for?\u201d asks Luke, looking up.</p><p>\u201cJust a few days.\u201d</p><p>I look idly around the room. I\u2019ve never been in Elinor\u2019s bedroom before. It\u2019s immaculate, like the rest of the place, with pale walls and lots of expensive-looking custom-made furniture.</p><p>\u201cHey, guess what,\u201d I say, suddenly remembering. \u201cSuze and I are going to choose a wedding dress tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>Luke looks at me in surprise. \u201cI thought you were going to wear your mother\u2019s wedding dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well.\u201d I frown. \u201cThe thing is, there was this awful accident...\u201d</p> <p>And all I can say is thank God. Thank God for Suze and her well-aimed cup of coffee.</p><p>As we approach the window of Dream Dress on Madison Avenue the next morning, I suddenly realize what Mum was asking me to do. How could she want me to dress up in white frills, instead of one of these gorgeous, amazing, Oscar-winner creations? We open the door and silently look around the hushed showroom, with its champagne-colored carpet and painted trompe l\u2019oeil clouds on the ceiling \u2014 and, hanging in gleaming, glittery, sheeny rows on two sides of the room, wedding dresses.</p><p>I can feel overexcitement rising through me like a fountain. Any minute I might giggle out loud.</p><p>\u201cRebecca!\u201d Cynthia has spotted us and is coming forward with a beam. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you came. Welcome to Dream Dress, where our motto is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I bet I know!\u201d interrupts Suze. \u201cIs it \u2018Live out your dream at Dream Dress\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d Cynthia smiles.</p><p>\u201cIs it \u2018Dreams come true at Dream Dress\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cynthia\u2019s smile tightens slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018We\u2019ll find your Dream Dress.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, lovely!\u201d Suze nods politely.</p><p>Cynthia ushers us into the hushed room and seats us on a cream sofa. \u201cI\u2019ll be with you in a moment,\u201d she says pleasantly. \u201cHave a browse through some magazines meanwhile.\u201d Suze and I grin excitedly at each other \u2014 then she reaches for Contemporary Bride, and I pick up Martha Stewart Weddings.</p><p>I adore Martha Stewart Weddings.</p><p>Secretly, I want to be Martha Stewart Weddings. I just want to crawl inside the pages with all those beautiful people getting married in Nantucket and South Carolina and riding to the chapel on horses and making their own place-card holders out of frosted russet apples.</p><p>I stare at a picture of a wholesome-looking couple standing in a poppy field against a staggeringly beautiful backdrop of mountains. You know, maybe we should get married in a poppy field too, and I could have barley twined round my hair and Luke could make us a loving seat with his own bare hands because his family has worked in wood crafting for six generations. Then we\u2019d ride back to the house in an old country wagon\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018French white-glove service\u2019?\u201d says Suze, peering puzzledly at an ad.</p><p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d I look up dazedly. \u201cHey, Suze, look at this. Shall I make my own bouquet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I point to the page. \u201cYou can make your own flowers out of crepe paper for an imaginative and individual bouquet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou?

Let\u2019s begin.\u201d We both look up to see Cynthia coming back, a clipboard in her hand. She sits down on a small gilt chair and we both look at her attentively.</p><p>\u201cNothing in your life,\u201d she says, \u201ccan prepare you for the experience of buying your wedding dress. You may think you know about buying clothes.\u201d Cynthia gives a little smile and shakes her head. \u201cBuying a wedding dress is different. We at Dream Dresses like to say, you don\u2019t choose your dress...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dress chooses you?\u201d suggests Suze.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Cynthia with a flash of annoyance. \u201cYou don\u2019t choose your dress,\u201d she repeats, turning to me, \u201cyou meet your dress. You\u2019ve met your man... now it\u2019s time to meet your dress. And let me assure you, there is a dress waiting for you. It might be the first dress you try on.\u201d Cynthia gestures to a halter-top sheath hanging up nearby. \u201cIt might be the twentieth. But when you put on the right dress... it\u2019ll hit you here.\u201d She clasps her solar plexus. \u201cIt\u2019s like falling in love. You\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look around, feeling tentacles of excitement. \u201cHow will I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say... you\u2019ll know.\u201d She gives me a wise smile. \u201cHave you had any ideas at all yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously I\u2019ve had a few thoughts...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! It\u2019s always helpful if we can narrow the search down a little. So before we start, let me ask you a few basic questions.\u201d She unscrews her pen. \u201cWere you after something simple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say, nodding my head. \u201cReally simple and elegant. Or else quite elaborate,\u201d I add, my eye catching sight of an amazing dress with roses cascading down the back.</p> <p>\u201cRight. So... simple or elaborate...\u201d She scribbles on her notebook. \u201cDid you want beading or embroidery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK... now. Sleeves or strapless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly strapless,\u201d I say thoughtfully. \u201cOr else sleeves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want a train?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, yes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t mind if you didn\u2019t have a train, would you?\u201d puts in Suze, who is leafing through Wedding Hair. \u201cI mean, you could always have one of those really long veils for the procession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I do like the idea of a train...\u201d I stare at her, gripped by a sudden thought. \u201cHey, Suze, if I waited a couple of years to get married, your baby would be two \u2014 and it could hold my train up!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d Suze claps her hand over her mouth. \u201cThat would be so sweet! Except, what if it fell over? Or screamed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind! And we could get it a really gorgeous little outfit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we could just get back to the subject...\u201d Cynthia smiles at us and surveys her clipboard. \u201cSo we\u2019re after something either simple or elaborate, with sleeves or strapless, possibly with beading and/or embroidery and either with a train or without.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d My eye follows hers around the shop. \u201cBut you know, I\u2019m quite flexible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Cynthia stares at her notes silently for a few moments. \u201cRight,\u201d she says again. \u201cWell, the only way you can know is by trying a few dresses on... so let\u2019s get started!\u201d</p><p>Why have I never done this before? Trying on wedding dresses is simply the most fun I\u2019ve had ever, in my whole life. Cynthia shows me into a large fitting room with gold and white cherub wallpaper and a big mirror and gives me a lacy basque and high satin shoes to put on \u2014 and then her assistant brings in dresses in lots of five. I try on silk chiffon sheaths with low backs, ballerina dresses with tight bodices and layers of tulle, dresses made from duchesse satin and lace, starkly plain dresses with dramatic trains, simple dresses, glittery dresses...</p><p>\u201cWhen you see the right one, you\u2019ll know,\u201d Cynthia keeps saying as the assistant heaves the hangers up onto the hooks. \u201cJust... keep trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d I say happily, as I step into a strapless dress with beaded lace and a swooshy skirt. I come outside and parade around in front of Suze. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic!\u201d she says. \u201cEven better than the one with the little straps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!

Put it down as a possible.\u201d I parade a bit more, then look around the shop, trying to see if there\u2019s anything I haven\u2019t looked at yet.

For a June wedding, you\u2019re already leaving it very late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I be leaving it late?\u201d I say in astonishment. \u201cI\u2019ve only just got engaged!\u201d</p> <p>Cynthia shakes her head. \u201cIn wedding dress terms, that\u2019s late. What we recommend is that if brides think they may have a short engagement, they begin to look for a dress before they get engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d I give a gusty sigh. \u201cI had no idea it was all going to be so difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry on that one at the end,\u201d suggests Suze. \u201cThe one with the chiffon trumpet sleeves. You haven\u2019t tried that, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, looking at it in surprise. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I carry the dress back to the fitting room, clamber out of the swooshy skirt, and step into it.</p><p>It skims sleekly over my hips, hugs my waist, and falls to the floor in a tiny, rippling train. The neckline flatters my face, and the color is just right against my skin. It feels good. It looks good.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d says Suze, sitting up as I come out. \u201cNow, that\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say, stepping up onto the podium.</p> <p>I stare at my reflection and a feel a little glow of pleasure. It\u2019s a simple dress \u2014 but I look fantastic in it. It makes me look really thin! It makes my skin look radiant and... God, maybe this is the one!</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the shop.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel it here?\u201d says Cynthia, clutching her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI... don\u2019t know! I think so!\u201d I give an excited little laugh. \u201cI think I might!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it. You see? When you find the right dress, it just hits you. You can\u2019t plan for it, you can\u2019t work it out on paper. You just know when it\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found my wedding dress!\u201d I beam at Suze. \u201cI\u2019ve found it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt last!\u201d There\u2019s a ring of relief to Cynthia\u2019s voice. \u201cLet\u2019s all have a glass of champagne to celebrate!\u201d</p><p>As she disappears I admire myself again. It just shows, you can\u2019t tell. Who would have thought I\u2019d go for trumpet sleeves?</p><p>An assistant is carrying past another dress and I catch sight of an embroidered silk corset bodice, tied up with ribbons.</p><p>\u201cHey, that looks nice,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind what that is!\u201d says Cynthia, handing me a glass of champagne. \u201cYou\u2019ve found your dress!\u201d She lifts her glass, but I\u2019m still looking at the ribboned bodice.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just try that one on. Just quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I was thinking?\u201d says Suze, looking up from Brides. \u201cMaybe you should have a dress that isn\u2019t a wedding dress. Like a color!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d I stare at Suze, my imagination gripped. \u201cLike red or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr a trouser suit!\u201d suggests Suze, showing me a magazine picture. \u201cDon\u2019t those look cool?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve found your dress!\u201d chips in Cynthia, her voice slightly shrill. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to look any further!

Could we put it down as another possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she says at last. \u201cAnother possible. I\u2019ll just write that down.\u201d</p><p>As she walks off, Suze leans back on the sofa and beams at me. \u201cOh, Bex, it\u2019s going to be so romantic! Tarkie and I went to look at the church you\u2019re getting married in. It\u2019s beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is nice,\u201d I agree, quelling an automatic wave of guilt.</p> <p>Although nothing\u2019s been decided yet. I haven\u2019t definitely chosen the Plaza. We still might get married in Oxshott.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cYour mum\u2019s planning to put this gorgeous arch of roses over the gate, and bunches of roses on all the pews... and then everyone will get a rose buttonhole. She thought maybe yellow, but it depends on the other colors...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Well, I\u2019m not really sure yet...\u201d I tail off as I see the shop door opening behind me.</p><p>Robyn is coming into the shop, dressed in a mauve suit and clutching her Mulberry bag. She catches my eye in the mirror and gives a little wave.</p><p>What\u2019s Robyn doing here?</p> <p>\u201cAnd then on the tables, maybe some sweet little posies...\u201d</p><p>Robyn\u2019s heading toward us. I\u2019m not sure I like this.</p><p>\u201cHey, Suze!\u201d I turn with what I hope is a natural smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and look at those... um... ring cushions over there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze stares at me as though I\u2019ve gone mad. \u201cYou\u2019re not having a ring cushion, are you? Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve turned into an American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then... the tiaras. I might have one of those!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I say brightly. \u201cI just thought you might want to... oh, hi, Robyn!\u201d As she approaches, I force myself to give her a friendly smile.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d says Robyn, clasping her hands. \u201cIsn\u2019t that gown beautiful? Don\u2019t you look adorable? Is that the one, do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d My smile is so fixed, it\u2019s hurting. \u201cSo, Robyn, how on earth did you know I\u2019d be here? You must be telepathic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia told me you\u2019d be coming in. She\u2019s an old friend.\u201d Robyn turns to Suze. \u201cAnd is this your chum from England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... yes. Suze, Robyn, Robyn, Suze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze? The maid of honor herself? Oh, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Suze! You\u2019ll look simply wonderful in\u2014\u201d She stops abruptly as her gaze takes in Suze\u2019s stomach. \u201cDear, are you expecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have had the baby by then,\u201d Suze assures her.</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Robyn\u2019s face relaxes. \u201cAs I say, you\u2019ll look wonderful in violet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cViolet?\u201d Suze looks puzzled. \u201cI thought I was wearing blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, definitely violet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, I\u2019m sure your mum said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, anyway!\u201d I interrupt hurriedly. \u201cRobyn, I\u2019m a bit tied up here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I don\u2019t want to get in your way. But since I\u2019m here, there\u2019s just a couple of things... Two seconds, I promise!\u201d She reaches into her bag and pulls out her notebook. \u201cFirst of all, the New York Philharmonic will unfortunately be on tour at the time of the wedding, but I\u2019m working on an alternative. Now, what else...\u201d She consults her notebook.</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d I dart a quick glance at Suze, who\u2019s staring at Robyn with a puzzled frown on her face. \u201cYou know, maybe you should just give me a call sometime, and we can talk about all this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long! So the other thing was... we\u2019ve scheduled in a tasting at the Plaza on the 23rd in the chef\u2019s dining room. I passed on your views on monkfish, so they\u2019re having a rethink on that...\u201d Robyn flips a page. \u201cOh, and I still really need that guest list from you!\u201d She looks up and wags her finger in mock reproof. \u201cWe\u2019ll be needing to think about invitations before we know it! Especially for the overseas guests!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOK.

Those cakes... you are going to swoon. Now I have to run.\u201d She closes her notebook and smiles at Suze. \u201cNice to meet you, Suze. See you at the wedding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you there!\u201d says Suze in a too-cheerful voice. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>The door closes behind Robyn and I swallow hard, my face tingling.</p><p>\u201cSo, ahm... I might as well get changed.\u201d</p><p>I head to the fitting room without meeting Suze\u2019s eye. A moment later, she\u2019s in there with me.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she says lightly as I unzip the dress.</p><p>\u201cThat was... Robyn! She\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what was she talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust... wedding chitchat... you know... Can you help me out of this corset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does she think you\u2019re getting married at the Plaza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... um... I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you do!

You\u2019re not getting married at the Plaza. Are you?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, feeling my face grow hotter and hotter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... an option,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, it\u2019s an option?\u201d Suze stares at me, her grip on me loosening. \u201cHow can it be an option?\u201d</p><p>I adjust the dress on the hanger, playing for time, trying to stifle the guilt rising inside me. If I behave as though this is a completely normal situation, then maybe it will be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that... well, Elinor\u2019s offered to throw this really spectacular wedding for me and Luke. And I haven\u2019t quite decided whether or not to take her up.\u201d I see Suze\u2019s expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018what?\u2019 \u201d expostulates Suze. \u201cWhat about (a) your mum\u2019s already organizing your wedding? What about (b) Elinor is a complete cow? What about (c) you\u2019ve gone off your head? Why on earth would you want to get married at the Plaza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... because...\u201d I close my eyes briefly. \u201cSuze, you have to see it. We\u2019re going to have a great big string orchestra, and caviar, and an oyster bar... and Tiffany frames for everyone on the tables... and Cristal champagne... and the whole place will be this magical enchanted forest, and we\u2019re going to have real birch trees and songbirds...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReal birch trees?\u201d Suze pulls a face. \u201cWhat do you want those for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like Sleeping Beauty! And I\u2019m going to be the princess, and Luke\u2019s going to be the...\u201d I tail off feebly to see Suze staring at me reproachfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your mum?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence, and I pretend to be preoccupied unhooking my basque. I don\u2019t want to have to think about Mum right at the moment.</p><p>\u201cBex! What about your mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just have to... talk her round,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cTalk her round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said herself I shouldn\u2019t do the wedding by halves!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cIf she came and saw the Plaza, and saw all the plans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s done such a lot of preparation already! When we were there she could talk about nothing else. Her and \u2014 what\u2019s your neighbor called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. They\u2019re calling your kitchen the control center. There\u2019s about six pin boards up, and lists, and bits of material everywhere... And they\u2019re so happy doing it.\u201d Suze stares at me earnestly. \u201cBecky, you can\u2019t just tell them it\u2019s all off. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElinor would fly them over!\u201d There\u2019s a guilty edge to my voice, which I pretend I can\u2019t hear. \u201cI mean, they\u2019d have a fantastic time! It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them too! They could stay in the Plaza, and dance all night, and see New York... They\u2019d have the most fabulous holiday ever!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying desperately to paint a picture that, deep down, I know isn\u2019t true. As I meet Suze\u2019s eyes I can feel shame pouring over me, and I quickly look away.</p><p>\u201cHave you said this to your mum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I... I haven\u2019t told her anything about it. Not yet. Not until I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d There\u2019s a pause while Suze\u2019s eyes narrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBex, you are going to do something about this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she says suddenly. \u201cPromise me you\u2019re not just going to bury your head in the sand and pretend it isn\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly!

I have to decide.</p><p>The day after she\u2019s left to go home I sit down in my fitting room at lunchtime with a piece of paper and a pen. I\u2019m just going to have to do this logically. Work out the pros and cons, weigh them all up \u2014 and make a rational decision. Right. Let\u2019s go.</p> <p>For Oxshott</p><p>1. Mum will be happy</p><p>2. Dad will be happy</p><p>3. It\u2019ll be a lovely wedding</p><p>I stare at the list for a few seconds \u2014 then make a new heading.</p><p>For New York</p><p>1. I get to have the most amazing wedding in the world</p><p>I bury my head in my hands. It isn\u2019t any easier on paper.</p><p>In fact it\u2019s harder, because it\u2019s thrusting the dilemma right in my face, instead of where I want it \u2014 which is in a little box at the back of my mind where I don\u2019t have to look at it.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I look up, automatically covering up the sheet of paper with my hand. Standing at the door of my fitting room is Elise, one of my clients. She\u2019s a thirty-five-year-old corporate lawyer who\u2019s just been assigned to Hong Kong for a year. I\u2019ll quite miss her actually. She\u2019s always nice to chat to, even though she doesn\u2019t really have a sense of humor. I think she\u2019d like to have one \u2014 it\u2019s just that she doesn\u2019t quite understand what jokes are for.</p><p>\u201cHi, Elise!\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cDo we have an appointment? I thought you were leaving today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. But I wanted to buy you a wedding gift before I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! You don\u2019t have to do that!\u201d I exclaim, secretly pleased.</p><p>\u201cI just need to find out where you\u2019re registered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, we haven\u2019t registered yet,\u201d I say, feeling a flicker of frustration. It\u2019s not my fault we haven\u2019t registered yet. It\u2019s Luke\u2019s! He keeps saying he\u2019s too busy to spend a day in the shops, which frankly just doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t?\u201d Elise frowns. \u201cSo how can I buy you a gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... um... you could just... buy something. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a list?\u201d Elise stares at me blankly. \u201cBut what would I get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Anything you felt like!\u201d I give a little laugh. \u201cMaybe a... toaster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA toaster. OK.\u201d Elise roots around in her bag for a piece of paper. \u201cWhat model?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no idea! It was just off the top of my head! Look, Elise, just... I don\u2019t know, get me something in Hong Kong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you registering there too?\u201d Elise looks alert. \u201cWhich store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I just meant...\u201d I sigh. \u201cOK, look. When we register, I\u2019ll let you know the details. You can probably do it online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. OK.\u201d Elise puts her piece of paper away, giving me a reproving look. \u201cBut you really should register.

I pick up my phone and speed-dial Luke\u2019s number.</p><p>As it rings, I suddenly remember promising the other day to stop phoning him at work with what he called \u201cwedding trivia.\u201d I\u2019d made him stay on the line for half an hour while I described three different table settings, and apparently he missed a really important call from Japan.</p><p>But surely this is an exception?</p><p>\u201cListen!\u201d I say urgently as he picks up. \u201cWe need to register! We can\u2019t put it off any longer!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m in a meeting. Can this wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s important!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence \u2014 then I hear Luke saying, \u201cIf you could excuse me for a moment\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says, returning to the phone. \u201cStart again. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is, people are trying to buy us presents! We need a list! If there\u2019s nothing for them to buy, who knows what they might get us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s register, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to!\u201d I squeak in frustration. \u201cYou know I have! I\u2019ve been waiting and waiting for you to have a spare day, or even an evening\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been tied up with things,\u201d he says, a defensive edge to his voice. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>I know why he\u2019s so defensive. It\u2019s because he\u2019s been working every night on some stupid promotion for Elinor\u2019s charity. And he knows what I think about that.</p><p>\u201cWell, we need to get started,\u201d I say. \u201cWe need to decide what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Becky. Do I really need to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you need to be there! Don\u2019t you care what plates we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I take a deep breath, about to launch into a tirade along the lines of, \u201cIf you don\u2019t care about our plates, then maybe you don\u2019t care about our relationship!\u201d</p> <p>Then, just in time I realize, this way I get to choose everything exactly as I want it.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. And I agreed we\u2019d have a drink with my mother tonight, at her apartment. Six thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say, pulling a face. \u201cAll right. See you then. Shall I call you after I\u2019ve been to Tiffany to let you know what I registered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky,\u201d says Luke, deadpan. \u201cIf you call me again with any more wedding talk during office hours, it\u2019s entirely possible we may not be having a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say. \u201cFine! If you\u2019re not interested, I\u2019ll just organize it all and see you at the altar, shall I? Would that suit you?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause, and I can tell Luke\u2019s laughing.</p><p>\u201cDo you want an honest answer or the Cosmo \u2018Does Your Man Really Love You?\u2019 full marks answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the full marks answer,\u201d I say after a moment\u2019s thought.</p><p>\u201cI want to be involved in every tiny detail of our wedding,\u201d says Luke earnestly. \u201cI understand that if I show any lack of interest at any stage it is a sign that I am not committed to you as a woman and beautiful, caring, all-round special person, and, frankly, don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty good, I suppose,\u201d I say, a little grudgingly. \u201cNow give me the honest answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you at the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-di-ha. Well, all I can say is, you\u2019ll be sorry when I put you in a pink tuxedo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI will. Now I have to go. Really. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>I put down the phone, reach for my coat, and pick up my bag. As I\u2019m zipping it up, I glance at my piece of paper again and bite my lip. Maybe I should stay here and think a bit more, and try to come to a decision.</p><p>But then... whether we get married in England or America, we\u2019ll need a wedding present list, won\u2019t we? So in a way it\u2019s more sensible to go and register first \u2014 and decide about which country to get married in later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Exactly.</p><p>OK, so perhaps I should have realized that lots of brides might want to register at Tiffany. And this is a very busy time of day, and they only have so many members of staff available at one time. I told them it was an emergency, and I have to say, they were very sympathetic, but even so, they couldn\u2019t fit me in right at that moment. They asked if I could possibly come back at two o\u2019clock, or tomorrow.</p><p>But I\u2019m working at two o\u2019clock. And tomorrow I\u2019ll be so busy, I already know I won\u2019t get a proper lunch hour. God, how are you supposed to plan a wedding and have a job at the same time? As I walk back to Barneys, I\u2019m fizzing with frustration. Now that I\u2019ve decided to register, I can\u2019t wait a minute longer. I want to do it now, while I\u2019m all excited, and before anyone goes and buys us a green decanter. I\u2019m just wondering whether I should quickly call all our relations to let them know there will be a list... when my eye is caught by an ad for Crate and Barrel. \u201cWalk right in and register,\u201d it says, above a picture of a big shiny tea kettle.</p><p>I stop still in the middle of the street. There\u2019s a huge Crate and Barrel about two minutes away. I mean, it\u2019s not Tiffany \u2014 but it\u2019s presents, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s all cool pans and stuff... Oh, I\u2019m going. I start to walk again, quicker and quicker, until I\u2019m almost running down the sidewalk.</p> <p>It\u2019s only as I\u2019m pushing my way into the store, out of breath, that I realize I don\u2019t know anything about registering. In fact, I don\u2019t know much about wedding lists at all. For Tom and Lucy\u2019s wedding I chipped in with Mum and Dad, and Mum organized it all \u2014 and the only other person I know who\u2019s got married is Suze, and she and Tarquin didn\u2019t have a list.</p><p>I look randomly around the shop, wondering where to start. It\u2019s bright and light, with colorful tables here and there laid out as though for dinner, and lots of displays full of gleaming glasses, racks of knives, and stainless-steel cookware.</p><p>As I wander toward a pyramid of shiny saucepans, I notice a girl in a high swingy ponytail who is going around marking things on a form. I edge nearer, trying to see what she\u2019s doing, and spot the words \u201cCrate and Barrel Registry\u201d on the paper. She\u2019s registering! OK, I can watch what she does.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says, looking up. \u201cYou know anything about cookware? You know what this thing is?\u201d</p><p>She holds up a pan, and I can\u2019t help hiding a smile. Honestly. These Manhattanites don\u2019t know anything. She\u2019s probably never cooked a meal in her life!</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a frying pan,\u201d I say kindly. \u201cYou use it to fry things with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. What about this?\u201d</p><p>She holds up another pan with a ridged surface and two looped handles. Blimey. What on earth\u2019s that for?</p><p>\u201cI... um... I think it\u2019s an... omelette... griddle... skillet... pan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d She looks at it puzzledly and I back quickly away. I pass a display of pottery cereal bowls and find myself at a computer terminal marked \u201cRegistry.\u201d Maybe this is where you get the forms.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Crate and Barrel,\u201d says a cheerful message on the screen. \u201cPlease enter the choice you require.\u201d</p> <p>Distractedly I punch a few times at the screen. I\u2019m half listening to a couple behind me arguing about plates.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to be taupe stoneware,\u201d the girl is saying almost tearfully.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you want to be?\u201d retorts the man.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m taupe stoneware, Marie?\u201d</p><p>Oh God, I must stop eavesdropping. I look down at the screen again, and stop in surprise. I\u2019ve arrived at the place where you look up people\u2019s lists so you can buy them a gift. I\u2019m about to press \u201cClear\u201d and walk away, when I pause.</p><p>It would be quite cool to see what other people put down, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>Cautiously I enter the name \u201cR. Smith\u201d and press \u201cEnter.\u201d</p> <p>To my astonishment the screen starts filling up with a whole series of couples\u2019 names.</p><p>Rachel Smith and David Forsyth, Oak Springs, Miss.</p><p>Annie M. Winters and Rod Smith, Raleigh, N.C.</p><p>Richard Smith and Fay Bullock, Wheaton, Ill.</p><p>Leroy Elms and Rachelle F. Smith...</p><p>This is so cool! OK, let\u2019s see what Rachel and David chose. I press \u201cEnter\u201d and a moment later the machine starts spewing out pieces of paper.</p><p>Glass Caviar/Shrimp Server \u2014 4</p><p>Footed Cake Platter with Dome \u2014 1</p><p>Water Lily Bowl \u2014 2</p><p>Classic Decanter 28 oz</p><p>Wow, that all sounds really nice. I definitely want a water lily bowl. And a shrimp server. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>OK, now let\u2019s see what Annie and Rod chose.

I wonder why they want three ice buckets.</p><p>This is completely addictive! Let\u2019s see what Richard and Fay are getting. And then Leroy and Rachelle... I print them both out, and am just wondering whether to try another name, like Brown, when a voice says, \u201cCan I help you, miss?\u201d My head jerks up and I see a salesman wearing a name badge reading \u201cBud\u201d smiling at me. \u201cAre you having some trouble locating the list you want?\u201d</p><p>I feel myself prickle with embarrassment.</p> <p>I can\u2019t admit I\u2019m just snooping.</p><p>\u201cI... actually... I\u2019ve just found it.\u201d I grab randomly for Richard and Fay\u2019s list. \u201cThey\u2019re friends of mine. Richard and Fay.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI want to buy them a wedding present. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Also, I want to register myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s deal with the purchase first. What would you like to buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm... well...\u201d I look down at the list. \u201cUm...\u201d</p><p>Come on. I\u2019m not really going to buy a present for a pair of complete strangers. Just admit the truth. I was nosy.</p> <p>\u201cActually... I think I\u2019ll leave it for another day,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I would like to register a list myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem!\u201d says Bud cheerily. \u201cHere\u2019s the form for you to fill in as you go around... you\u2019ll see that most of our merchandise breaks down into sections...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. What sort of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitchenware, flatware, hollowware, barware, stemware, glassware...\u201d He pauses for breath. \u201cAnd miscellaneous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be a little overwhelming, deciding what you\u2019re going to want in your new home.\u201d He smiles at me. \u201cSo what I suggest is, you start with the basics. Think about your everyday needs \u2014 and work up from there. If you need me, just give me a shout!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat! Thanks very much!\u201d</p><p>Bud moves away and I look around the store with a fizz of anticipation. I haven\u2019t been so excited since I used to write out lists for Father Christmas. And even then, Mum would stand over my shoulder, saying things like \u201cI\u2019m not sure Father Christmas can give you the real ruby slippers, darling. Why not ask for a nice coloring book instead?\u201d</p><p>Now, no one\u2019s telling me what I can or can\u2019t have. I can write down anything I like! I can ask for those plates over there... and that jug... and that chair... I mean, if I wanted to, I could ask for everything! The whole shop!</p><p>You know. In theory.</p><p>But I\u2019m not going to get carried away. I\u2019ll start with everyday needs, just as Bud suggested. Feeling pleasantly grown-up, I wander toward a display of kitchen equipment and start perusing the shelves.</p><p>Ooh. Lobster crackers! Let\u2019s get some of those. And those cute little corn holders. And those sweet little plastic daisies. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re for, but they look so gorgeous!</p><p>I note the numbers carefully down on my list. OK. What else? As I look around again, my attention is caught by a gleaming array of chrome.</p><p>Wow. We just have to have a frozen yogurt maker. And a waffle maker. And a bread cooker, and a juicer, and a Pro Chef Premium Toaster Oven. I write down all the numbers and look around with a sigh of satisfaction. Why on earth have I never registered before? Shopping without spending any money!</p> <p>You know, I should have got married a long time ago.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d The girl with the ponytail is over in the knife section. \u201cDo you know what poultry shears are?\u201d She holds up a piece of equipment I\u2019ve never seen before in my life.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re... shears for poultry... I guess...\u201d</p><p>For a moment we stare at each other blankly, then the girl shrugs, says \u201cOK,\u201d and writes it down on her list.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019ll get some poultry shears too. And one of those cool herb-chopper things. And a professional blowtorch for making cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.</p><p>Not that I\u2019ve ever made cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e \u2014 but you know. When I\u2019m married, I\u2019m bound to. I have a sudden vision of myself in an apron, nonchalantly br\u00fbl\u00e9eing with one hand and drizzling a homemade fruit coulis with the other, while Luke and an assortment of witty guests look on admiringly.</p><p>\u201cSo where else are you registering?\u201d says the girl, picking up an egg whisk and peering at it.</p><p>I look at her in surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean? Are you allowed more than one list?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019m having three. Here, Williams-Sonoma, and Bloomies. It\u2019s really cool there, you scan everything on this gun\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree lists!\u201d I can\u2019t keep the elation out of my voice.</p><p>And actually, when you think about it, why stop at three?</p><p>So by the time I arrive at Elinor\u2019s apartment that evening I\u2019ve made appointments to register at Tiffany, Bergdorf, Bloomingdale\u2019s, and Barneys, ordered the Williams-Sonoma catalogue, and started an online wedding list.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t managed to think any more about where we\u2019re going to get married \u2014 but then, first things first.</p><p>As Elinor opens the door, music is playing and the apartment smells pleasantly of flowers. Elinor\u2019s wearing a wrap dress and her hair looks slightly softer than usual \u2014 and as she kisses me she gives my hand a little squeeze.</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s already here,\u201d she says as we walk along the corridor. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty pair of shoes. Are they new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr, actually, they are. They\u2019re Dolce and Gabbana! Thanks!\u201d I can\u2019t help gaping at her in astonishment. I\u2019ve never known Elinor to compliment me before. Not once.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost a little weight,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt suits you.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m so gobsmacked I stop, right in the middle of the doorway \u2014 then have to hurry to catch up. Is Elinor Sherman finally, after all this time, going to start making an effort to be nice to me? I can\u2019t quite believe it.</p><p>But then... come to think of it, she was quite nice at the end of the engagement party too. She said it had been a mistake about me not being on the door list and that she was really sorry.</p><p>Actually no, she didn\u2019t exactly say she was sorry \u2014 she said she would sue the party planners. But still. That shows concern, doesn\u2019t it?</p><p>God, maybe Elinor has a hidden nice side, I find myself thinking. Maybe there\u2019s a whole different persona under that icy exterior. Yes! She\u2019s all vulnerable and insecure but she\u2019s put up a protective shell around herself. And I\u2019m the only one who can see beneath it, and when I coax the true Elinor into the world, all New York society will marvel, and Luke will love me even more, and people will call me The Girl Who Changed Elinor Sherman, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke\u2019s voice penetrates my thoughts. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, realizing with a start that I\u2019m blundering into the coffee table. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine!\u201d</p> <p>I sit down next to him on the sofa, Elinor hands me a glass of icy-cold wine, and I sip it, gazing out the window over the glittering Manhattan lights stretching into the distance. Elinor and Luke are in the middle of some discussion about the foundation, and I nibble a salted almond and tune out. Somehow I\u2019ve arrived in the middle of a dreamlike picture in which Elinor is saying to a crowded room, \u201cBecky Bloomwood is not only a model daughter-in-law, but a valued friend,\u201d and I\u2019m smiling modestly as people start applauding, when there\u2019s a snapping sound, and I come to, slightly spilling my drink.</p><p>Elinor has closed the crocodile notebook she\u2019s been writing in. She puts it away, turns down the music slightly, and looks directly at me.</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked you here tonight because there\u2019s something I\u2019d like to discuss with you.\u201d She refreshes my drink and I smile at her.</p><p>\u201cOh yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, Luke is a very wealthy young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right,\u201d I say, a little embarrassed. \u201cWell... yes, I suppose so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been speaking with my lawyers... and with Luke\u2019s lawyers... and we are all agreed. So if I could just give you this...\u201d She gives me a glittering smile and hands over a thick white envelope \u2014 then hands another to Luke.</p><p>As I take it I feel a tingle of anticipation. You see? Elinor\u2019s already becoming friendlier. This is just like Dallas. She\u2019s probably making me an associate of some family company or something, to welcome me into the dynasty. God, yes! And I\u2019ll get to go to board meetings and everything and we\u2019ll mount some amazing takeover together and I\u2019ll wear big earrings...</p><p>Excitedly, I open the envelope and pull out a thick, typed document. But as I read the words I can feel my excitement ebb away.</p><p>Memorandum of Agreement</p><p>Between Luke James Brandon (hereinafter called \u201cThe Groom\u201d)</p><p>and Rebecca Jane Bloomwood (hereinafter called \u201cThe Bride\u201d) of\u2014</p><p>I don\u2019t get it.

It just doesn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d I say, breathing hard. \u201cYou think I\u2019m just after Luke for his money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, of course she doesn\u2019t,\u201d exclaims Luke.</p><p>\u201cYes, she does!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prenuptial contract is simply a sensible premarital step.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s a step I really don\u2019t think we need to take,\u201d says Luke with a little laugh.</p><p>\u201cI would beg to differ,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to protect you. Both of you,\u201d she adds unconvincingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, I\u2019m going to... divorce Luke and get all his money?\u201d</p><p>Just like you did with your husbands, I\u2019m about to add, but stop myself just in time. \u201cYou think that\u2019s why I want to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may, of course, look the contract over in your own time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to look it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I take it you\u2019re refusing to sign?\u201d Elinor gives me a triumphant look as though I\u2019ve confirmed every suspicion she had.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in a trembling voice. \u201cI\u2019m not refusing to sign! I\u2019ll sign whatever you like! I\u2019m not going to have you think I want Luke\u2019s money!\u201d I grab the pen off the table and furiously start scrawling my signature on the first page, so hard I rip the paper.</p><p>\u201cBecky, don\u2019t be stupid!\u201d exclaims Luke. \u201cMother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine! I\u2019ll sign every single... bloody...\u201d</p><p>My face is hot and my eyes a little blurry as I turn the pages, signing again and again without even looking at the text above. Rebecca Bloomwood. Rebecca Bloomwood.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not signing it,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI never wanted a prenup! And I\u2019m certainly not going to sign something I\u2019ve never seen before in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere. Done.\u201d I put down my pen and pick up my bag. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go now. Bye, Elinor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky\u2014\u201d says Luke. \u201cMother, what on earth possessed you to do this?\u201d</p><p>As I head out of Elinor\u2019s apartment my head is still pounding. I wait for the lift for a few seconds \u2014 but when it doesn\u2019t come, head for the stairs instead. I feel shaky with fury, with mortification. She thinks I\u2019m a gold digger.</p><p>Is that what everyone thinks?</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Luke is coming down the stairs after me, three at a time. \u201cBecky, wait. I\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea...\u201d As we reach the ground floor he envelops me in his arms and I stand there rigidly.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me. That was as much of a shock for me as it was for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... you know... I think you should sign it,\u201d I say, staring at the floor. \u201cYou should protect yourself. It\u2019s only sensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky. This is me. This is us.\u201d Gently he lifts my chin until I haven\u2019t got anywhere to look except into his dark eyes. \u201cI know you\u2019re angry. Of course you are. But you have to excuse my mother. She\u2019s lived in America a long time. Prenups are standard issue here. She didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d I say, feeling a fresh surge of humiliation. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what she meant. She thinks I\u2019ve got some plan to... to take all your money and spend the whole lot on shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your plan?\u201d Luke feigns shock. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this now? Well, if you\u2019re going to change the ground rules, perhaps we should have a prenup\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I give a half-smile \u2014 but I\u2019m still raw inside.</p><p>\u201cI know loads of people have prenups here,\u201d I say. \u201cI know that.

You\u2019re never furious with her! That\u2019s the trouble.\u201d I break away from his arms, trying to keep calm.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Luke stares at me. \u201cIs something else wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just this. It\u2019s... everything! The way she\u2019s taken over the wedding. The way she was so supercilious and horrible with my parents...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s naturally a very formal person,\u201d says Luke defensively. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s trying to be supercilious. If your parents really got to know her\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the way she uses you!\u201d I know I\u2019m on dangerous ground \u2014 but now I\u2019ve started, I can\u2019t stop everything pouring out. \u201cYou\u2019ve given her hours and hours of your time. You\u2019ve provided staff for her charity. You\u2019ve even fallen out with Michael because of her. I just don\u2019t understand it! You know Michael cares about you. You know he\u2019s only got your best interests at heart. But because of your mother, you\u2019re not even talking to him.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s face flinches, and I can see I\u2019ve touched a nerve.</p><p>\u201cAnd now she wants us to move to this building. Don\u2019t you see? She just wants to get her claws into you! She\u2019ll have you running errands for her all day long, and she\u2019ll never leave us alone... Luke, you\u2019re already giving her so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Luke\u2019s expression is gradually becoming tighter. \u201cShe\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she is! But come on. She was never even interested in you before you became a success over here. Remember our first trip to New York? You were so desperate to impress her \u2014 and she didn\u2019t even make the effort to see you! But now that you\u2019ve made it here, you\u2019ve got a name, you\u2019ve got contacts in the media, you\u2019ve got resources \u2014 and all of a sudden she wants to get all the credit and just use you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is true! You just can\u2019t see it! You\u2019re too dazzled by her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Becky, it\u2019s easy for you to criticize,\u201d says Luke hotly. \u201cYou have a fantastic relationship with your mother. I barely saw mine when I was growing up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d I cry, before I can stop myself. \u201cThat proves my point! She didn\u2019t give a shit about you then either!\u201d</p><p>Oh, bugger. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. A flash of pain passes through Luke\u2019s eyes and suddenly he looks about ten years old.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not true,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother wanted me. It wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d I move toward him, but he jerks away.</p><p>\u201cPut yourself in her shoes for a change, Becky. Think about what she\u2019s gone through. Having to leave behind her child; having to put on a brave face. She\u2019s been used to hiding her feelings for so long, no wonder her manner can be a little awkward.\u201d</p><p>Listening to him, I almost want to cry. He\u2019s got it all worked out. He\u2019s still like the boy who made every excuse in the world for why his mother never came to see him.</p> <p>\u201cBut now we\u2019re having a chance to forge our relationship once again,\u201d Luke is saying. \u201cMaybe she is a bit tactless now and then. But she\u2019s doing her best.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right, I want to say. She\u2019s really trying hard with me.</p><p>Instead I give a tiny shrug and mumble, \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>Luke walks over and takes hold of my hand. \u201cCome back upstairs. We\u2019ll have another drink. Forget this ever happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I exhale sharply. \u201cI think I\u2019ll... go home. You go. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>As I make my way home it starts to rain, big splashy drops that puddle in the gutters and drip off canopies. They spatter on my hot cheeks and wet my hair and make marks on my new suede-trimmed shoes. But I barely notice them. I\u2019m still too wound up by the evening; by Elinor\u2019s gimlet gaze; by my own humiliation; by my frustration with Luke.</p><p>The moment I get inside the apartment there\u2019s a crack of thunder outside. I switch all the lights on and the television, and pick up the post. There\u2019s an envelope from Mum and I open it first. A swatch of fabric falls out and a long letter smelling faintly of her perfume. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darling Becky,</p><p>Hope all\u2019s well in the Big Apple!Here\u2019s the color we were thinking of for the table napkins. Janice says we should have pink but I think this pale plum is very pretty, especially with the colors we were thinking of for the flowers. But let me know what you think, you\u2019re the bride, darling!The photographer that Dennis recommended came round yesterday and we were all very impressed. Dad has heard good things about him at the golf club, which is always a good sign. He can do color and black-and-white, and includes a photograph album in the price, which seems a very good deal. Also, he can turn the picture you like best into one hundred mini jigsaw puzzles to send to all the guests as a little thank-you!The most important thing of all, I told him, is that we have lots of pictures of you by the flowering cherry tree. We planted that when you were born, and it\u2019s always been my secret dream that our little baby Rebecca would grow up and one day stand beside it on her wedding day. You are our only child and this day is so important to us.</p><p>Yours with lots of love,</p><p>Mum</p> <p>By the end, I\u2019m crying. I don\u2019t know why I ever thought I wanted to get married in New York. I don\u2019t know why I let Elinor even show me the stupid Plaza. Home is where I want to get married. With Mum and Dad, and the cherry tree, and my friends, and everything that really matters to me.</p><p>That\u2019s it, I\u2019ve made my choice.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d</p><p>I give a startled jump and turn round. There\u2019s Luke, standing at the door, out of breath and drenched from head to foot. His hair is plastered to his head and raindrops are still running down his face. \u201cBecky...\u201d he says urgently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have let you go like that. I saw the rain... I don\u2019t know what I was thinking\u2014\u201d He breaks off as he sees my tear-stained face. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I wipe my eyes. \u201cAnd Luke... I\u2019m sorry too.\u201d</p> <p>Luke gazes at me for a long time, his face trembling, his eyes burning.</p><p>\u201cBecky Bloomwood,\u201d he says at last. \u201cYou\u2019re the most generous-spirited... giving... loving... I don\u2019t deserve...\u201d</p><p>He breaks off and comes toward me, his face almost fierce with intent. As he kisses me, raindrops spatter from his hair onto my mouth and mingle with the warm salty taste of him. I close my eyes and let my body gradually unwind, the pleasure gradually begin. I can already feel him hard and determined, gripping my hips and wanting me right now, right this minute, to say sorry, to say he loves me, to say he\u2019ll do anything for me...</p><p>God, I love make-up sex.</p><p>Nine</p><p>I WAKE UP THE next morning all snug and contented and happy with myself. As I lie in bed, curled up against Luke, I\u2019m full of a strong inner resolve. I\u2019ve sorted out my priorities. Nothing will change my mind now.</p> <p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I say, as he makes a move to get out of bed.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d He turns and kisses me, and he\u2019s all warm and delicious and lovely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go. Stay here. All day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could pretend we were ill.\u201d I stretch luxuriously out on the pillows. \u201cActually, I do feel rather ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Which bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy... tummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks fine to me,\u201d says Luke, peeking under the duvet. \u201cFeels fine... Sorry. You don\u2019t get a note.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpoilsport.\u201d</p><p>I watch as he gets out of bed, puts on a robe, and heads for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I say again as he reaches the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell him I made a big decision last night. That I want to get married in Oxshott, just like we originally planned. That I\u2019m going to cancel the Plaza. That if Elinor is furious, then so be it.</p><p>Then I close it again.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cJust... don\u2019t use up all my shampoo,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>I can\u2019t face bringing up the subject of the wedding. Not now, when everything\u2019s so lovely and happy between us. And anyway, Luke doesn\u2019t care where we get married. He said so himself.</p><p>I\u2019ve taken the morning off work for the cake-tasting meeting with Robyn, but our appointment\u2019s not until ten. So after Luke\u2019s gone I slowly pad around the apartment, making myself some breakfast and thinking about what I\u2019m going to say to Elinor.</p><p>The thing is to be direct. Firm and direct but pleasant. Grown-up and professional, like businesspeople who have to fire other businesspeople. Stay calm and use phrases like \u201cWe chose to go another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Elinor,\u201d I say to my reflection. \u201cI have something I need to say to you. I have chosen to go another way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No. She\u2019ll think I\u2019m becoming a lesbian.</p><p>\u201cHello, Elinor,\u201d I try again. \u201cI\u2019ve been bouncing around your wedding-scenario proposal. And while it has many merits...\u201d</p><p>OK, come on. Just do it.</p><p>Ignoring my butterflies, I pick up the phone and dial Elinor\u2019s number.</p> <p>\u201cElinor Sherman is unable to take your call...\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s out.</p><p>I can\u2019t just leave her a message saying the wedding\u2019s off. Can I?</p><p>Could I?</p><p>No.</p> <p>I put the phone down hurriedly, before the bleep sounds. OK. What shall I do now?</p><p>Well, it\u2019s obvious. I\u2019ll call Robyn. The important thing is that I tell someone, before anything else gets done.</p><p>I gather my thoughts for a moment, then dial Robyn\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHello! Do I hear wedding bells? I hope so, because this is Robyn de Bendern, the answer to your wedding planning prayers. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m unavailable at present, but your call is so important to me...\u201d</p><p>Robyn\u2019s probably already on her way to meet me at the cake-maker\u2019s studio, it occurs to me. I could call her there. Or I could leave a message.</p><p>But as I hear her bright, chirruping voice, I feel a pang of guilt. Robyn\u2019s already put so much into this. In fact, I\u2019ve already become quite fond of her. I just can\u2019t tell her it\u2019s all off over the phone. Feeling suddenly firm, I put down the phone and reach for my bag.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be a grown-up, go along to the cake studio, and break the news to her face-to-face.</p><p>And I\u2019ll deal with Elinor later.</p><p>To be honest, I don\u2019t really like wedding cake. I always take a piece because it\u2019s bad luck or something if you don\u2019t, but actually all that fruitcake and marzipan and icing like blocks of chalk makes me feel a bit sick. And I\u2019m so nervous at the thought of telling Robyn it\u2019s all off that I can\u2019t imagine eating anything.</p><p>Even so, my mouth can\u2019t help watering as I arrive at the cake studio. It\u2019s big and light, with huge windows and the sweetest, most delicious sugary-buttery smell wafting through the air. There are huge mounted cakes on display, and rows of flower decorations in transparent boxes, and people at marble tables, carefully making roses out of icing and painting strands of sugar ivy.</p><p>As I hover at the entrance, a skinny girl in jeans and strappy high heels is being led out by her mother, and they\u2019re in the middle of a row.</p><p>\u201cYou only had to taste it,\u201d the mother is saying furiously. \u201cHow many calories could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d retorts the girl tearfully. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a size two on my wedding day if it kills me.\u201d</p><p>Size two!</p> <p>Anxiously I glance at my thighs. Should I be aiming for size two as well? Is that the size brides are supposed to be?</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d I look up to see Robyn, who seems a little flustered. \u201cHello! You made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobyn.\u201d As I see her, I feel my stomach clench with apprehension. \u201cListen. I need to talk to you. I tried calling Elinor, but she was... Anyway. There\u2019s something I need to... tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d says Robyn distractedly. \u201cAntoine and I will be with you in a moment, but we have a slight crisis on our hands.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cThere was an accident with one of the cakes. Very unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Bloomwood?\u201d I look up to see a man with gray hair and twinkling eyes in a white chef\u2019s outfit. \u201cI am Antoine Montignac. The cake maker of cake makers. Perhaps you have seen me in my television show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAntoine, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve quite resolved the problem with the... other client...\u201d says Robyn anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI come in a moment.\u201d He dismisses her with his hand. \u201cMiss Bloomwood. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure I really want to...\u201d I begin. But before I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ve been seated on a plushy chair at a polished table, and Antoine is spreading glossy portfolios in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI can create for you the cake that will surpass all your dreams,\u201d he announces modestly. \u201cNo image is beyond my powers of creativity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look at a photograph of a spectacular sixtier cake decorated with sugar tulips, then turn the page to see one in the shape of five different butterflies. These are the hugest cakes I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. And the decorations!</p><p>\u201cSo, are these all fruitcakes inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFruitcake? Non, non, non!\u201d Antoine laughs. \u201cThis is very English notion, the fruitcake at the wedding. This particular cake...\u201d He points to the butterfly cake. \u201cIt was a light angel sponge, each tier layered with three different fillings: burnt orange caramel, passion-fruit-mango, and hazelnut souffl\u00e9.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gosh.</p><p>\u201cIf you like chocolate, we can construct a cake purely from different varieties of chocolate.\u201d He turns to another page. \u201cThis was a dark chocolate sponge layered with chocolate fondant, white chocolate cream, and a Grand Marnier truffle filling.\u201d</p><p>I had no idea wedding cakes could be anything like this. I flip through dazedly, looking at cake after spectacular cake.</p><p>\u201cIf you do not want the traditional tiers, I can make for you a cake to represent something you love. A favorite painting... or a sculpture...\u201d He looks at me again. \u201cA Louis Vuitton trunk, perhaps...\u201d</p> <p>A Louis Vuitton trunk wedding cake! How cool would that be?</p><p>\u201cAntoine? If you could just come here a moment?\u201d Robyn pokes her head out of a small meeting room to the right \u2014 and although she\u2019s smiling, she sounds pretty harassed.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Miss Bloomwood,\u201d says Antoine apologetically. \u201cDavina. Some cake for Miss Bloomwood to taste.\u201d</p><p>A smiling assistant disappears through a pair of double doors \u2014 then returns with a glass of champagne and a china plate holding two slices of cake and a sugar lily. She hands me a fork and says, \u201cThis one is passion-fruit-mango, strawberry, and tangerine mousseline, and this is caramel creme with pistachio and mocha truffle. Enjoy!\u201d</p><p>Wow. Each slice is a light sponge, with three different pastel-colored fillings. I don\u2019t know where to start!</p> <p>OK... let\u2019s go for mocha truffle.</p><p>I put a piece in my mouth and nearly swoon. Now this is what wedding cakes should all be like. Why don\u2019t we have these in England?</p><p>I take a few sips of champagne and nibble the sugar lily, which is all yummy and lemony \u2014 then take a second piece and munch blissfully, watching a girl nearby as she painstakingly makes a spray of lilies of the valley.</p><p>You know, maybe I should get Suze a nice cake for her baby\u2019s christening. I mean, I\u2019ll get a present as well \u2014 but I could always buy a cake as a little extra.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much these cakes are?\u201d I ask the girl as I polish off the second slice.</p><p>\u201cWell... it really varies,\u201d she says, looking up. \u201cBut I guess they start at about a thousand dollars.\u201d</p> <p>I nearly choke on my champagne. A thousand dollars? They start at $1,000?</p><p>For a cake?</p><p>I mean, how much have I eaten, just now? That must have been at least $50 worth of cake on my plate!</p><p>\u201cWould you like another slice?\u201d says the girl, and glances at the meeting room. \u201cIt looks like Antoine is still held up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, well... Why not! And could I try one of those sugar tulips? You know. Just for research purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d says the girl pleasantly. \u201cWhatever you like.\u201d</p><p>She gives me a tulip and a spray of tiny white flowers, and I crunch through them happily, washing them down with champagne.</p><p>Then I look idly around and spy a huge, elaborate flower, yellow and white with tiny drops of dew. Wow. That looks yummy. I reach over a display of sugar hearts, pick it up, and it\u2019s almost in my mouth when I hear a yell.</p> <p>\u201cStooooop!\u201d A guy in whites is pounding across the studio toward me. \u201cDon\u2019t eat the jonquil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops!\u201d I say, stopping just in time. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t realize. Is it very special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me three hours to make,\u201d he says, taking it gently from my hand. \u201cNo harm done, though.\u201d He smiles at me, but I notice there\u2019s sweat on his forehead.</p><p>Hmm. Maybe I should just stick to the champagne from now on. I take another sip, and am looking around for the bottle, when raised voices start coming from the side room where Robyn and Antoine are closeted.</p><p>\u201cI deed not do this deliberately! Mademoiselle, I do not have a vendetta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do! You bloody hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d comes a muffled voice.</p><p>I can hear Robyn\u2019s voice, saying something soothing, which I can\u2019t make out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one thing after another!\u201d The girl\u2019s voice is raised now \u2014 and as I hear it clearly, I freeze, glass halfway to my mouth.</p><p>I don\u2019t believe it.</p><p>It can\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cThis bloody wedding is jinxed!\u201d she\u2019s exclaiming. \u201cRight from the word go, everything\u2019s gone wrong.\u201d</p><p>The door swings open and now I can hear her properly.</p><p>It is. It\u2019s Alicia.</p><p>I feel my whole body stiffen.</p><p>\u201cFirst the Plaza couldn\u2019t fit us in! Now this fiasco with the cake! And do you know what I just heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Robyn fearfully.</p><p>\u201cMy maid of honor dyed her hair red! She won\u2019t match the others! Of all the bloody inconsiderate, selfish...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door is flung open and out stalks Alicia, her stilettos echoing like gunfire on the wooden floor. When she sees me, she stops dead and I look at her, my heart thumping hard.</p><p>\u201cHi, Alicia,\u201d I say, forcing myself to sound relaxed. \u201cSorry to hear about your cake. That was delicious, by the way, Antoine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d says Alicia blankly. Her eyes flash to my engagement ring, to my face, back to my ring, to my shoes, to my bag \u2014 taking in my skirt on the way \u2014 and finally back to my ring. It\u2019s like the Manhattan Onceover in a hall of mirrors.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d she says at last. \u201cTo Luke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d I glance nonchalantly at the diamond on my left hand, then smile innocently up at her.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to relax now. I\u2019m starting to enjoy this.</p><p>(Also, I just gave Alicia the Manhattan Onceover myself. And my ring is a teeny bit bigger than hers. Not that I\u2019m comparing or anything.)</p><p>\u201cHow come you didn\u2019t say?\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t ask, I want to reply, but instead I just give a little shrug.</p> <p>\u201cSo where are you getting married?\u201d Alicia\u2019s old supercilious expression is returning and I can see her getting ready to pounce.</p><p>\u201cWell... as it happens...\u201d I clear my throat.</p><p>OK, this is the moment. This is the time to make the big announcement. To tell Robyn I\u2019ve changed my mind. I\u2019m going to get married in Oxshott.</p><p>\u201cActually...\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. Come on. It\u2019s like a Band-Aid. The quicker I do it, the quicker it\u2019ll be over. Just say it.</p><p>And I really am on the brink of it \u2014 when I make the fatal mistake of looking up. Alicia\u2019s looking as patronizing and smug as she ever did. I feel years of feeling stupid and small welling up in me like a volcano \u2014 and I just can\u2019t help it, I hear my voice saying, \u201cActually, we\u2019re getting married at the Plaza.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia\u2019s face snaps in shock, like an elastic band. \u201cThe Plaza? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be rather lovely,\u201d I add casually. \u201cSuch a beautiful venue, the Plaza. Is that where you\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d says Alicia, her chin rather tight. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t fit us in at such short notice. When did you book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... a week or two ago,\u201d I say, and give a vague shrug.</p><p>Yes! Yes! Her expression!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be wonderful,\u201d puts in Robyn enthusiastically. \u201cI spoke to the designer this morning, by the way. He\u2019s ordered two hundred birch trees, and they\u2019re going to send over some samples of pine needles...\u201d</p><p>I can see Alicia\u2019s brain working hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one having the enchanted forest in the Plaza,\u201d she says at last. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about that. Sheldon Lloyd\u2019s designing it. Is that true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one,\u201d I say, and smile at Robyn, who beams back as though I\u2019m an old ally.</p><p>\u201cMees Bloomwood.\u201d Antoine appears from nowhere and presses my hand to his lips. \u201cI am now completely at your service. I apologize for the delay. One of these irritating little matters...\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s face goes rigid.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be off then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAu revoir,\u201d says Antoine, without even looking up.</p><p>\u201cBye, Alicia,\u201d I say innocently. \u201cHave a lovely wedding.\u201d</p><p>As she stalks out, I subside back in my seat, heart still pumping wth exhilaration. That was one of the best moments of my life. Finally getting the better of Alicia Bitch Longlegs. Finally! I mean, how often has she been horrible to me? Answer: approximately one thousand times. And how often have I had the perfect put-down at my lips? Answer: never.</p><p>Until today!</p><p>I can see Robyn and Antoine exchanging looks, and I\u2019m dying to ask them what they think of Alicia. But... it wouldn\u2019t be becoming in a bride-to-be.</p><p>Plus if they bitch about her, they might bitch about me too.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d says Robyn. \u201cOn to something more pleasant. You\u2019ve seen the details of Becky\u2019s wedding, Antoine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d says Antoine, beaming at me. \u201cEet will be a most beautiful event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I hear myself saying happily. \u201cI\u2019m so looking forward to it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... we discuss the cake... I must fetch some pictures for you... meanwhile, can I offer you some more champagne, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d I say, and hold out my glass. \u201cThat would be lovely!\u201d</p><p>The champagne fizzes, pale and delicious, into my glass. Then Antoine disappears off again and I take a sip, smiling to hide the fact that inside, I\u2019m feeling a slight unease. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now that Alicia\u2019s gone, there\u2019s no need to pretend anymore. What I should do is put my glass down, take Robyn aside, apologize for having wasted her time \u2014 and inform her that the wedding is off and I\u2019m getting married in Oxshott. Quite simple and straightforward.</p><p>That\u2019s what I should do.</p><p>But... something very strange has happened since this morning. I can\u2019t quite explain it \u2014 but somehow, sitting here, drinking champagne and eating thousand-dollar cake, I just don\u2019t feel like someone who\u2019s going to get married in a garden in Oxshott.</p><p>If I\u2019m really honest, hand on heart \u2014 I feel exactly like someone who\u2019s going to have a huge, luxurious wedding at the Plaza.</p> <p>More than that, I want to be someone who\u2019s going to have a huge, luxurious wedding at the Plaza. I want to be that girl who swans around expensive cake shops and has people running after her and gets treated like a princess. If I call off the wedding, then it\u2019ll all stop. Everyone will stop making a fuss. I\u2019ll stop being that special, glossy person.</p><p>Oh God, what\u2019s happened to me? I was so resolved this morning.</p><p>Determinedly I close my eyes and force myself to think back to Mum and her flowering cherry tree. But even that doesn\u2019t work. Perhaps it\u2019s the champagne \u2014 but instead of being overcome with emotion, and thinking: I must get married at home, I find myself thinking: Maybe we can incorporate the cherry tree into the enchanted forest.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Becky?\u201d says Robyn, beaming at me. \u201cPenny for them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I say, my head jerking up guiltily. \u201cI was just thinking that... the um... wedding will be fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>What am I going to do? Am I going to say something?</p><p>Am I not going to say anything?</p><p>Come on, Becky. Decide.</p><p>\u201cSo \u2014 you want to see what I have in my bag?\u201d says Robyn brightly.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTa-daah!\u201d She pulls out a thick, embossed card, covered in swirly writing, and hands it to me.</p> <p>Mrs. Elinor Sherman</p><p>requests the honour of your presence</p><p>at the marriage of</p><p>Rebecca Bloomwood</p><p>to her son</p><p>Luke Brandon</p><p>I stare at it, my heart thumping hard.</p><p>This is real. This is really real. Here it is, in black and white.</p> <p>Or at least, bronze and taupe.</p><p>I take the stiff card from her and turn it over and over in my fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Robyn beams. \u201cIt\u2019s exquisite, isn\u2019t it? The card is 80 percent linen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... lovely.\u201d I swallow. \u201cIt seems very soon to be sending out invitations, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t sending them out yet! But I always like to get the invitations done early. What I always say is, you can\u2019t proofread too many times. We don\u2019t want to be asking our guests to wear \u2018evening press,\u2019 like one bride I could mention...\u201d She trills with laughter.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I stare down at the words again.</p><p>Saturday June 21st at seven o\u2019clock</p><p>at the Plaza Hotel</p><p>New York City</p><p>This is serious. If I\u2019m going to say anything, I have to say it now. If I\u2019m going to call this wedding off, I have to do it now. Right this minute.</p><p>My mouth remains closed.</p><p>Does this really mean I\u2019m choosing the Plaza after all? That I\u2019m selling out? That I\u2019m choosing the gloss and glitter? That I\u2019m going with Elinor instead of Mum and Dad?</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d like to send one to your mother!\u201d says Robyn.</p><p>My head jerks up sharply \u2014 but Robyn\u2019s face is blithely innocent. \u201cSuch a shame she isn\u2019t here to get involved with the preparations. But she\u2019ll love to see this, won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say after a long pause. \u201cYes, she\u2019ll... love it.\u201d</p><p>I put the invitation into my bag and snap the clasp shut, feeling slightly sick.</p><p>So this is it. New York it is.</p><p>Mum will understand. When I tell her all about it properly, she\u2019ll come round. She has to.</p><p>Antoine\u2019s new mandarin and lychee cake is fabulous. But somehow as I nibble at it, my appetite\u2019s gone.</p><p>After I\u2019ve tried several more flavors and am no nearer a decision, Antoine and Robyn exchange looks and suggest I probably need time to think. So with one last sugar rose for my purse, I say good-bye and head to Barneys, where I deal with all my clients perfectly pleasantly, as though nothing\u2019s on my mind.</p><p>But all the time I\u2019m thinking about the call I\u2019ve got to make. About how I\u2019m going to break the news to Mum. About how I\u2019m going to explain to Mum.</p><p>I won\u2019t say anything as strong as I definitely want to get married in the Plaza. Not initially. I\u2019ll just tell her that it\u2019s there as a possibility, if we both want it. That\u2019s the key phrase. If we both want it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The truth is, I didn\u2019t present it properly to her before. She\u2019ll probably leap at the chance once I explain it all to her fully. Once I tell her about the enchanted forest and the string orchestra, and the dance band and the thousand-dollar cake. A lovely luxury wedding, all expenses paid! I mean, who wouldn\u2019t leap at it?</p><p>But my heart\u2019s thumping as I climb the stairs to our apartment. I know I\u2019m not being honest with myself. I know what Mum really wants.</p><p>I also know that if I make enough fuss, she\u2019ll do anything I ask her.</p><p>I close the door behind me and take a deep breath. Two seconds later, the doorbell rings behind me and I jump with fright. God, I\u2019m on edge at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, opening it. \u201cOh, Danny, it\u2019s you. Listen, I need to make quite an important phone call. So if you wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I have to ask you a favor,\u201d he says, coming into the apartment and completely ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandall\u2019s been pressuring me. He\u2019s like, where exactly do you sell your clothes? Who exactly are your customers? Do you have a business plan? So I\u2019m like, of course I have a business plan, Randall. I\u2019m planning to buy up Coca-Cola next year, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo then he starts saying if I don\u2019t have any genuine client base I should give up and he\u2019s not going to subsidize me anymore. He used the word subsidize! Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say distractedly. \u201cHe does pay your rent. And he bought you all those rolls of pink suede you wanted...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Danny after a pause. \u201cOK. So the pink suede was a mistake. But Jesus! He just wouldn\u2019t leave it alone. I told him about your dress \u2014 but he was like, Daniel, you can\u2019t base a commercial enterprise on one customer who lives downstairs.\u201d Danny chews the skin on his thumb nervously. \u201cSo I told him I just had a big order from a department store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Which one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarneys.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, my attention finally caught.</p> <p>\u201cBarneys? Danny, why did you say Barneys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can back me up! If he asks you, you stock me, OK? And all your clients are falling over themselves to buy my stuff, you\u2019ve never known anything like it in the history of the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad. He\u2019ll never fall for it. And what will you say when he wants some money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have money by then!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he checks up? What if he goes to Barneys to look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t check up,\u201d says Danny scornfully. \u201cHe only has time to talk to me once a month, let alone make unscheduled visits to Barneys. But if he meets you on the stairs, go along with my story. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... all right,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>Honestly. As if I haven\u2019t got enough to worry about already.</p> <p>\u201cDanny, I really must make this call...\u201d I say helplessly.</p><p>\u201cSo did you find somewhere else to live yet?\u201d he says, flopping down into an armchair.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even thought about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElinor wants us to move to her building and I\u2019ve said no. That\u2019s as far as we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Danny stares at me. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to stay in the Village?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m moving there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... don\u2019t know! I\u2019ve just got too many other things to think about at the moment. Speaking of which\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPre-wedding stress,\u201d says Danny knowingly. \u201cThe solution is a double martini.\u201d He opens up the cocktail cabinet and a sheaf of wedding list brochures falls out onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he says reproachfully, picking them up. \u201cDid you register without me? I cannot believe that! I have been dying to register my entire life! Did you ask for a cappuccino maker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. I think so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig mistake. You\u2019ll use it three times, then you\u2019ll be back at Starbucks. Listen, if you ever want me to take delivery of any presents, you know I\u2019m right upstairs...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d I give him a look. \u201cAfter Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Christmas is still a slightly sore point with me. I thought I\u2019d be really clever and order a load of presents off the Internet. But they never arrived, so I spent Christmas Eve rushing round the shops buying replacements. Then on Christmas morning we went upstairs to have a drink with Danny and Randall \u2014 to find Danny sitting in the silk robe I\u2019d bought for Elinor, eating the chocolates that were meant for Samantha at work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, what was I supposed to think?\u201d he says defensively. \u201cIt was Christmas, they were gift-wrapped... it was like, Yes, Daniel, there is a Santa Claus\u2014\u201d He reaches for the Martini bottle and sloshes it into the cocktail shaker. \u201cStrong?

If it\u2019s an emergency I can look up the number they left\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s... it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p><p>My frustration has started to subside. Instead I\u2019m feeing a tiny secret relief. This kind of lets me off the hook for the moment. I mean, it\u2019s not my fault if they\u2019re away, is it?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d says Janice. \u201cIf it\u2019s important, I can easily get the number...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honestly, it\u2019s fine! Nothing important,\u201d I hear myself saying. \u201cWell, lovely to speak to you... bye then!\u201d I thrust down the receiver, trembling slightly.</p><p>It\u2019s only for a few more days. It won\u2019t make any difference either way.</p><p>I walk back into the living room to find Danny reclining on the sofa, flipping channels.</p><p>\u201cAll OK?\u201d he says, lifting his head.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s have that drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the shaker,\u201d he says, nodding his head toward the cabinet, just as the front door opens.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I call. \u201cLuke, is that you? You\u2019re just in time for a\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stop abruptly as Luke enters the room and stare at him in dismay. His face is pale and hollow, his eyes even darker than usual. I\u2019ve never seen him look like this before.</p><p>Danny and I glance at each other and I feel my heart plunge in dread.</p><p>\u201cLuke!\u201d I gulp. \u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to call for an hour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou weren\u2019t at work, the line here was busy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was probably on my way home. And then I had to make a call.\u201d Anxiously I take a step toward him. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Luke? Is it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Michael,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019ve just heard. He\u2019s had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Ten</p><p>MICHAEL\u2019S ROOM IS on the fourth floor of the George Washington University Hospital. We walk along the corridors in silence, both staring straight ahead. We arrived in Washington last night. Our hotel bed was very big and comfortable, but even so, neither of us slept very well. In fact, I\u2019m not sure Luke slept at all. He hasn\u2019t said much, but I know he\u2019s feeling eaten up with guilt.</p><p>\u201cHe could have died,\u201d he said last night, as we were both lying awake in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t,\u201d I replied, and reached for his hand.</p><p>\u201cBut he could have.\u201d</p><p>And when you think about it, it\u2019s true. He could have. Every time I think about it I feel a horrible lurch in my tummy. I\u2019ve never before known anyone close to me to be ill. I mean, there was my great-aunt Muriel, who had something wrong with her kidneys \u2014 but I only met her about twice. And all my grandparents are still alive except Grandpa Bloomwood, who died when I was two, so I never even knew him.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019ve hardly ever been into a hospital before, unless you count ER and Terms of Endearment. As we walk along, past scary signs like \u201cOncology\u201d and \u201cRenal Unit,\u201d I realize yet again how sheltered my life has been.</p><p>We arrive at room 465 and Luke stops. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d he says. \u201cReady?\u201d He knocks gently and, after a moment, pushes the door open.</p><p>Michael is lying asleep in a big clanky metal bed, with about six huge flower arrangements on the table next to him and more around the room. There\u2019s a drip attached to his hand and another tube going from his chest to some machine with little lights. His face is pale and drawn and he looks... vulnerable.</p><p>I don\u2019t like this. I\u2019ve never seen Michael in anything other than an expensive suit, holding an expensive drink. Big and reassuring and indestructible. Not lying in a bed in a hospital gown.</p><p>I glance at Luke and he\u2019s staring at Michael, pale-faced. He looks like he wants to cry.</p> <p>Oh God. Now I want to cry.</p><p>Then Michael opens his eyes, and I feel a swoosh of relief. His eyes, at least, are exactly the same. The same warmth. The same flash of humor.</p><p>\u201cNow, you didn\u2019t have to come all this way,\u201d he says. His voice sounds dry and even more gravelly than usual.</p><p>\u201cMichael,\u201d says Luke, taking an eager step forward. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Better than I was feeling.\u201d Michael\u2019s eyes run quizzically over Luke. \u201cHow are you feeling? You look terrible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel terrible,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI feel absolutely...\u201d He breaks off and swallows.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Michael. \u201cMaybe you should have some tests run. It\u2019s a very reassuring process. I now know that I have angina. On the other hand, my lymph is fine and I\u2019m not allergic to peanuts.\u201d His eyes rest on the fruit basket in Luke\u2019s hand. \u201cIs that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d says Luke, seeming to come to. \u201cJust a little... Shall I put it here?\u201d</p><p>He clears a space among the exotic flower arrangements, and as he does so I notice one of the attached cards has a White House heading. Gosh.</p><p>\u201cFruit,\u201d says Michael, nodding. \u201cVery thoughtful. You\u2019ve been talking to my doctor. They\u2019re extremely strict here. Visitors who bring candy are marched to a little room and forced to jog for ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael...\u201d Luke takes a deep breath, and I can see his hands gripping the handle of the fruit basket. \u201cMichael, I just wanted to say... I\u2019m sorry. About our argument.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s forgotten. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not. Not by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke.\u201d Michael gives Luke a kind look. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I just feel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a disagreement, that\u2019s all. Since then I\u2019ve been thinking about what you said. You do have a point. If Brandon Communications is publicly associated with a worthy cause, it can only do the company profile good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should never have acted without consulting you,\u201d mutters Luke.</p><p>\u201cWell. As you said, it\u2019s your company. You have executive control. I respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I respect your advice,\u201d says Luke at once. \u201cI always will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo. Shall we agree to bury the hatchet?\u201d Michael extends his hand, all bruised from where the drip needle goes into it \u2014 and after a moment, Luke gently takes it.</p><p>Now I\u2019m completely choked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get some... water...\u201d I mumble, and back out of the room, breathing hard.</p><p>I can\u2019t burst into tears in front of Michael. He\u2019ll think I\u2019m completely pathetic.</p><p>Or else he\u2019ll think I\u2019m crying because I know something he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019ll think we\u2019ve seen his medical charts and it wasn\u2019t angina at all. It was a brain clot that is inoperable except by a specialist from Chicago who\u2019s turned down Michael\u2019s case because of an old feud between the hospitals...</p><p>OK, look, I must stop confusing this with ER.</p><p>I walk to a nearby reception area, taking deep breaths to calm myself down, and sit down next to a middle-aged woman. There are people sitting on upholstered seats and a couple of patients in wheelchairs with drips, and I see a frail old woman greeting what must be her grandchildren. As she sees them, her whole face lights up and suddenly she looks ten years younger \u2014 and to my horror I find myself sniffing again.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I look up and see the middle-aged woman offering me a tissue. She smiles \u2014 but her eyes are red-rimmed. \u201cIt gets to you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she says as I blow my nose. \u201cIs a relation of yours in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a friend. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband, Ken,\u201d says the woman. \u201cHe\u2019s had bypass surgery. He\u2019s doing fine, though.\u201d She gives a half-smile. \u201cHe hates to see me upset.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGod. I\u2019m... really sorry.\u201d</p><p>I feel a shiver go down my back as I try to imagine how I\u2019d be feeling if it were Luke in that hospital bed.</p><p>\u201cHe should be be OK, if he starts looking after himself. These men. They take it all for granted.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBut coming in here... it teaches you what\u2019s important, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d I say fervently.</p> <p>We sit quietly for a while, and I think anxiously about Luke. Maybe I\u2019ll get him to start going to the gym a bit more. And eating that low-fat spread stuff that lowers your cholesterol. Just to be on the safe side.</p><p>\u201cI should go back,\u201d says the woman, looking at her watch. She smiles at me. \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d I watch as she walks off down the corridor, then stand up and head back to Michael\u2019s room, shaking back my hair and putting on a cheerful expression. No more dissolving into tears.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d says Luke as I enter. He\u2019s sitting on a chair by Michael\u2019s bed, and the atmosphere is a lot more relaxed, thank goodness.</p><p>\u201cI was just telling Luke,\u201d says Michael as I sit down. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s on at me to retire. Or at least downscale. Move to New York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Ooh, yes, do! We\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d says Luke. \u201cBearing in mind you currently do about six full-time jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like your daughter,\u201d I say enthusiastically. \u201cWe had such fun when she came into Barneys. How\u2019s her new job going?\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s daughter is an attorney who specializes in patent law, and just exudes extreme cleverness. On the other hand, she hadn\u2019t spotted that she was choosing colors that did nothing for her skin tone until I pointed it out to her.</p><p>\u201cVery well indeed, thanks. She just moved to Finerman Wallstein,\u201d Michael adds to Luke. \u201cVery swanky offices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know them,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI use them for personal matters. In fact, last time I went in there was a few weeks ago. Just about my will. Next time, I\u2019ll call in on her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo that,\u201d says Michael. \u201cShe\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you made a will, Luke?\u201d I say with interest.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ve made a will.\u201d Luke stares at me. \u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say \u2014 then look from Luke to Michael. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone should make a will,\u201d says Michael gravely.</p><p>\u201cIt never even occurred to me you might not have made one,\u201d says Luke, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cIt never even occurred to me to make one!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m only twenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make an appointment with my lawyer,\u201d says Luke. \u201cWe need to sort this out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell. OK. But honestly...\u201d I give a little shrug. Then a thought occurs to me. \u201cSo, who have you left everything to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d says Luke. \u201cMinus the odd little bequest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I gape at him. \u201cReally? Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is customary for husbands to leave their property to their wives,\u201d he says with a small smile. \u201cOr do you object?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not! I just... kind of... didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d</p><p>I feel a strange glow of pleasure inside me. Luke\u2019s leaving everything to me!</p><p>I don\u2019t know why that should be a surprise. I mean, we live together. We\u2019re getting married. It\u2019s obvious. But still, I can\u2019t help feeling a bit proud.</p><p>\u201cDo I take it you\u2019re not planning to leave anything to me?\u201d inquires Luke mildly.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI mean \u2014 of course I will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pressure,\u201d says Luke, grinning at Michael.</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d I say, growing flustered. \u201cI just hadn\u2019t really thought about it!\u201d</p><p>To cover my confusion I reach for a pear and start munching it. Come to think of it, why have I never made a will?</p><p>I suppose because I\u2019ve never really thought I\u2019ll die. But I could easily, couldn\u2019t I? I mean, our train could crash on the way back to New York. Or an ax murderer could break into our apartment...</p><p>And who would get all my stuff?</p><p>Luke\u2019s right. This is an emergency.</p><p>\u201cBecky? Are you OK?\u201d I look up to see Luke putting on his coat. \u201cWe must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d says Michael, and squeezes my hand as I bend to kiss him. \u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be in touch about the wedding,\u201d says Luke, and smiles at Michael. \u201cNo skiving your best-man duties.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d says Michael. \u201cBut that reminds me, I got a little confused at the engagement party, talking to different people. Are you two getting married in New York or England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew York,\u201d says Luke, frowning in slight puzzlement. \u201cThat has been finally decided, hasn\u2019t it, Becky? I never even asked how your mother took the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... um...\u201d I play for time, wrapping my scarf around my neck.</p><p>I can\u2019t admit the truth. I can\u2019t admit that Mum still doesn\u2019t know about the Plaza.</p> <p>Not here. Not now.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, feeling my cheeks flame. \u201cYes, she was fine. New York it is!\u201d</p><p>As we get onto the train, Luke looks pale and drained. I think it upset him more than he\u2019s letting on, seeing Michael looking so helpless. He sits staring out of the darkening window, and I try to think of something that will cheer him up.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d I say at last. I reach into my bag and take out a book I bought just the other day called The Promise of Your Life. \u201cWe need to talk about composing our wedding vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComposing them?\u201d Luke frowns. \u201cAren\u2019t they always the same?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! That\u2019s old hat. Everyone writes their own these days. Listen to this. \u2018Your wedding vows are the chance for you to show the world what you mean to each other. Together with the proclamation by the officiant that you are now married, they are the linchpin of the entire ceremony. They should be the most beautiful and moving words spoken at your wedding.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I look up expectantly at Luke, but he\u2019s gazing out of the window again.</p><p>\u201cIt says in this book, we must think about what sort of couple we are,\u201d I press on. \u201cAre we Young Lovers or Autumn Companions?\u201d</p><p>Luke isn\u2019t even listening. Perhaps I should find a few specific examples. My eye falls on a page marked Summertime Wedding, which would be quite appropriate.</p><p>\u201c\u2018As the roses bloom in summertime, so did my love bloom for you. As the white clouds soar above, so does my love soar,\u2019\u201d I read aloud.</p><p>I pull a face. Maybe not. I flick through a few more pages, glancing down as I go.</p> <p>You helped me through the pain of rehab...</p><p>Though you are incarcerated for murder, our love will</p><p>shine like a beacon...</p><p>\u201cOoh, look,\u201d I say suddenly. \u201cThis is for high school sweethearts. \u2018Our eyes met in a math class. How were we to know that trigonometry would lead to matrimony?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOur eyes met across a crowded press conference,\u201d says Luke. \u201cHow were we to know love would blossom as I announced an exciting new range of unit trusts investing in European growth companies with tracking facility, fixed-rate costs, and discounted premiums throughout the first accounting period?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2014\u201d</p><p>Well, OK. Maybe this isn\u2019t the time for vows. I shut the book and look anxiously at Luke. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you worried about Michael?\u201d I reach for his hand. \u201cBecause honestly, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to be fine. You heard what he said. It was just a wake-up call.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence for a while \u2014 then Luke turns his head.</p><p>\u201cWhile you were going to the rest room,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cI met the parents of the guy in the room next to Michael\u2019s. He had a heart attack last week. Do you know how old he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d I say apprehensively.</p><p>\u201cThirty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, really? That\u2019s awful!\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s only a year older than that.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bond trader, apparently. Very successful.\u201d He exhales slowly. \u201cIt makes you think, doesn\u2019t it? Think about what you\u2019re doing with your life. And wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d I say, feeling as though I\u2019m walking across eggshells. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s never spoken like this before. Usually if I start conversations about life and what it all means \u2014 which, OK, I don\u2019t do very often \u2014 he either brushes me off or turns it into a joke. He certainly never confesses to doubting what he\u2019s doing with his life. I really want to encourage him \u2014 but I\u2019m worried I might say the wrong thing and put him off.</p><p>Now he\u2019s staring silently out of the window again.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly were you thinking?\u201d I prompt gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says Luke after a pause. \u201cI suppose it just makes you see things differently for a moment.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me \u2014 and just for an instant I think I can see deep inside him, to a part of him I rarely have access to.

The publicity that we\u2019ll get through the foundation will benefit the company enormously.

Luke heads off to a rest room, and I head to a kiosk to buy a candy bar. I walk straight past a stand of newspapers \u2014 then stop. Hang on a minute. What was that?</p><p>I retrace my steps and stare at the New York Post. Right at the top, flagging an inside feature, is a little picture of Elinor.</p> <p>I grab the paper and turn quickly to the inside page.</p><p>There\u2019s a headline, \u201cHow to Fight Charity Fatigue.\u201d Then there\u2019s a picture of Elinor with a frosty smile, standing on the steps of some big building and handing over a check to some man in a suit. My eyes run puzzledly over the caption. Elinor Sherman has battled against apathy to raise money for a cause she believes in.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t the photo opportunity supposed to be for Luke?</p><p>I scan the piece quickly, searching for any mention of Brandon Communications. For any mention of Luke. But I get to the end of the page \u2014 and his name hasn\u2019t appeared once. It\u2019s as though he doesn\u2019t figure at all.</p><p>I stare down at the page in disbelief.</p><p>After everything he\u2019s done for her. How can she treat him like this?</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I give a startled jump at Luke\u2019s voice. For an instant I consider hiding the paper under my coat. But then, there\u2019s no point, is there? He\u2019ll see it sooner or later.</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d I hesitate \u2014 then swivel the page so he can see it.</p><p>\u201cIs that my mother?\u201d Luke looks astounded. \u201cShe never told me anything was set up. Let me have a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke...\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mention you anywhere. Or the company.\u201d</p><p>I wince as I see him scanning the page; as I watch the sheer disbelief growing on his face. It\u2019s been a hard enough day already, without discovering that his mother has completely screwed him.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she even tell you she was doing the interview?\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t reply. He takes out his mobile, jabs in a number, and waits for a few moments. Then he makes a noise of frustration.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot. She\u2019s gone back to Switzerland.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten that too. She\u2019s gone to \u201cvisit her friends\u201d again, in time for the wedding. This time she\u2019s staying for two whole months, which means she\u2019s having the full works. She must have done the interview just before she left.</p><p>I try to take Luke\u2019s hand, but he doesn\u2019t respond. God knows what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>\u201cLuke... maybe there\u2019s some explanation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust forget it.\u201d There\u2019s an edge to his voice that makes me flinch. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, difficult day. Let\u2019s just get home.\u201d</p><p>THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF REBECCA BLOOMWOOD</p><p>I, REBECCA JANE BLOOMWOOD, do make, publish, and declare this to be my Last Will and Testament.</p><p>FIRST: I hereby revoke all former Wills and Codicils by me made.</p><p>SECOND: (a) I give and bequeath to SUSAN CLEATH-STUART my collection of shoes, all my jeans, my tan leather coat, all my makeup except the Chanel lipstick, my leather floor cube, my red Kate Spade handbag, 1 my silver ring with the moonstone, and my painting of two elephants.</p><p>(b) I give and bequeath to my mother JANE BLOOMWOOD all my remaining handbags, my Chanel lipstick, all my jewelry, my Barneys white cotton duvet set, my waffle-weave dressing gown, my suede cushions, my Venetian glass vase, my collection of jam spoons, and my Tiffany watch. 2</p><p>(c) I give and bequeath to my father GRAHAM BLOOMWOOD my chess set, my CDs of classical music that he gave me for Christmas, my Bill Amberg weekend bag, my titanium desk lamp, and the incomplete manuscript of my self-help book Manage Money the Bloomwood Way, all rights of which are hereby passed to him.</p><p>(d) I give and bequeath to my friend DANNY KOVITZ all my old copies of British Vogue, 3 my lava lamp, my customized denim jacket, and my juicer.(e) I give and bequeath to my friend ERIN GAYLER my Tse cashmere jumper, my Donna Karan evening dress, all my Betsey Johnson dresses, and my Louis Vuitton hair bobbles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>THIRD: I bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my property of whatsoever kind or character and wheresoever situated, apart from any clothes found in carrier bags at the bottom of the wardrobe, 4 to LUKE JAMES BRANDON.</p><p>1. Unless she would prefer the new DKNY bag with the long straps.</p><p>2. Also my Tiffany keyring, which I have lost, but must be in the apartment somewhere.</p><p>3. Plus any other magazines I subsequently buy.</p> <p>4. Which are to be disposed of discreetly, in secret.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>THIS IS NOT a good time.</p><p>In fact, it\u2019s horrendous. Ever since he saw that piece in the paper, Luke has been really withdrawn and silent. He won\u2019t talk about it, and the atmosphere in the apartment is getting really tense, and I just don\u2019t know how to make things better. A few days ago I tried buying some soothing scented candles, but they didn\u2019t really smell of anything except candle wax. So then yesterday I tried rearranging the furniture to make it more feng shui and harmonious. But Luke came into the living room just as I\u2019d jammed a sofa leg into the DVD player, and I don\u2019t think he was very impressed.</p><p>I wish he\u2019d open up to me, like they do on Dawson\u2019s Creek. But whenever I say, \u201cDo you want to talk?\u201d and pat the sofa invitingly, instead of saying, \u201cYes, Becky, I have some issues I\u2019d like to share,\u201d he either ignores me or tells me we\u2019ve run out of coffee.</p> <p>I know he\u2019s tried calling his mother, but the patients at her stupid Swiss clinic aren\u2019t allowed mobile phones, so he hasn\u2019t been able to speak to her. I also know that he\u2019s been on the phone to Michael several times. And that the assistant who had been assigned to work for the Elinor Sherman Foundation is now back working for Brandon Communications. When I asked him about it, though, he just shut off and wouldn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s as though he can\u2019t bring himself to admit any of it has happened.</p><p>The only thing that is going at all well at the moment is the wedding preparations. Robyn and I have had several meetings with the event designer, whose ideas for the room are absolutely spectacular. Then we had the dessert tasting at the Plaza the other day, and I nearly swooned at all the amazing, out-of-this-world sweets there were to choose from. It was champagne all the way through, and deferential waiters, and I was treated exactly like a princess...</p><p>But if I\u2019m really honest, even that didn\u2019t feel quite as relaxed and wonderful as it should. Even while I was sitting there, being served poached white peaches with pistachio mousse and anise biscotti on a gilded plate, I couldn\u2019t help feeling little pricks of guilt through the pleasure, like tiny pinpoints of light through a blanket.</p><p>I think I\u2019ll feel a lot better when I\u2019ve broken the news to Mum.</p><p>I mean, not that there\u2019s any reason to feel bad. Because I couldn\u2019t do anything about it while they were in the Lake District, could I? I wasn\u2019t exactly going to interrupt their nice relaxing holiday. But they get back tomorrow. So then what I\u2019ll do is very calmly phone up Mum, and tell her that I really appreciate everything she\u2019s done, and it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not grateful, but that I\u2019ve decided...</p><p>No. That Luke and I have decided...</p> <p>No. That Elinor has very kindly offered... That we have decided to accept...</p><p>Oh God. My insides are churning, just thinking about it.</p><p>OK, I won\u2019t think about it yet. Anyway, I don\u2019t want to come out with some stilted, awkward speech. Much better just to wait until the moment and be spontaneous.</p><p>As I arrive at Barneys, Christina is sorting through a rack of evening jackets.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d she says as I walk in. \u201cDid you sign those letters for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say distractedly. \u201cOh, sorry. I forgot. I\u2019ll do it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Christina looks at me more closely. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! I\u2019m just... I don\u2019t know, the wedding...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw India from the bridal atelier last night. She said you\u2019d reserved a Richard Tyler dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I could have sworn I heard you telling Erin the other day about a dress at Vera Wang.\u201d</p><p>I look away and fiddle with the zip of my bag. \u201cWell. The thing is, I\u2019ve kind of reserved more than one dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d I say after a pause. I needn\u2019t tell her about the one at Kleinfeld.</p><p>Christina throws back her head in a laugh. \u201cBecky, you can\u2019t wear more than one dress! You\u2019re going to have to fix on one in the end, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say weakly, and disappear into my fitting room before she can say anything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My first client is Laurel, who is here because she\u2019s been invited on a corporate weekend, dress \u201ccasual,\u201d and her idea of casual is a pair of track pants and a Hanes T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d she says as soon she walks in. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d I smile brightly. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit preoccupied at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fighting with your mother?\u201d</p> <p>My head jerks up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cWhy do you ask that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course,\u201d says Laurel, taking off her coat. \u201cAll brides fight with their mothers. If it\u2019s not over the ceremony, it\u2019s over the floral arrangements. I threw a tea strainer at mine because she cut three of my friends off the guest list without asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? But then you made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t speak for five years afterward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive years?\u201d I stare at her, aghast. \u201cJust over a wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, there\u2019s no such thing as just a wedding,\u201d says Laurel. She picks up a cashmere sweater. \u201cThis is nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I say distractedly. Oh God, now I\u2019m really worried.</p><p>What if I fall out with Mum? What if she gets really offended and says she never wants to see me again? And then Luke and I have children and they never get to know their grandparents. And every Christmas they buy presents for Granny and Grandpa Bloomwood, just in case, but every year they sit under the tree unopened, and we quietly put them away, and one year our little girl says, \u201cMummy, why does Granny Bloomwood hate us?\u201d and I have to choke back my tears and say, \u201cDarling, she doesn\u2019t hate us. She just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>I snap into the present, to see Laurel peering at me concernedly. \u201cYou know, you really don\u2019t look yourself. Maybe you need a break.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! Honestly.\u201d I summon up a professional smile. \u201cSo... here are the skirts I was thinking of. If you try this beige one, with the off-white shirt...\u201d</p><p>As Laurel tries on different pieces, I sit on a stool, nodding and making the odd absent comment, while my mind still frets on the subject of Mum. I feel like I\u2019ve got so far into this mess, I\u2019ve lost all sense of proportion. Will she flip out when I tell her about the Plaza? Won\u2019t she? I just can\u2019t tell.</p><p>I mean, take what happened at Christmas. I thought Mum was going to be devastated when I told her Luke and I weren\u2019t coming home, and it took me ages to pluck up the courage to tell her. But to my astonishment, she was really nice about it and told me that she and Dad would have a lovely day with Janice and Martin, and I mustn\u2019t worry. So maybe this will be the same. When I explain the whole story to her, she\u2019ll say, \u201cOh darling, don\u2019t be silly, of course you must get married wherever you want to.\u201d</p><p>Or else she\u2019ll burst into tears, say how could I deceive her like this, and she\u2019ll come to the Plaza over her dead body.</p><p>\u201cSo I was going into Central Park for my marathon training, and who should I see, standing right there like a Barbie doll?\u201d</p><p>Laurel\u2019s voice filters into my mind and I look up.</p><p>\u201cNot the blond intern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight! So my heart starts thumping, I\u2019m walking toward her and I\u2019m wondering what I\u2019m going to say. Do I yell at her? Do I hit her? Do I completely ignore her? You know, which will give me most satisfaction? And of course half of me wants to run away and hide...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d I say eagerly.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got up close, it wasn\u2019t even her. It was some other girl!\u201d Laurel puts a hand to her head. \u201cIt\u2019s like, now she\u2019s messing with my mind. Not content with taking my husband, wrecking my life, stealing my jewelry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stolen your jewelry?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have told you this. No? Things started going missing around the time Bill was taking her back to our apartment. An emerald pendant my grandmother gave me. A couple of bracelets. Of course, I had no idea what was going on, so I thought I was being careless. But then it all came out, and I realized. It had to be her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you do anything?\u201d I say, appalled.</p><p>\u201cOh, I did. I called the police.\u201d Laurel\u2019s chin tightens as she buttons up her dress. \u201cThey went and asked her some questions, but they didn\u2019t get anywhere. Of course they didn\u2019t.\u201d She gives me a strange little smile. \u201cThen Bill found out. He went crazy. He went to the police and told them... well, I don\u2019t know exactly what he told them. But that same afternoon the police called me back and said they were dropping the case. It was obvious they thought I was just some vindictive, spurned wife.

Maybe two. Then he\u2019d crawl back, I\u2019d send him away, he\u2019d crawl back again, we\u2019d fight, but eventually...\u201d She exhales slowly. \u201cBut he\u2019s not. He\u2019s not coming back.\u201d</p><p>She meets my eye in the mirror and I feel a sudden pang of outrage. Laurel\u2019s the nicest person in the world.

It\u2019s still early for regular shoppers and the floor is nearly empty. But as I\u2019m searching for another dress in Laurel\u2019s size, I\u2019m suddenly aware of a familiar figure in the corner of my vision. I turn, puzzled, but the figure has gone.</p><p>Weird. Eventually I find the dress, and pick out a matching fringed stole. I turn around \u2014 and there he is again. It\u2019s Danny. What on earth is he doing in Barneys? As I get nearer, I stare at him. His eyes are bloodshot, his hair is awry, and he\u2019s got a wild, fidgety look.</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d I say \u2014 and he visibly jumps. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d he says. \u201cNothing! Just... browsing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d He glances at his watch. \u201cSo \u2014 I guess you\u2019re in the middle of something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, actually,\u201d I say regretfully. \u201cI have a client waiting. Otherwise we could go and have a coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, and walk back to my fitting room, rather puzzled.</p><p>Laurel decides to take three of the outfits I chose for her, and when she leaves she gives me a big hug. \u201cDon\u2019t let the wedding get you down,\u201d she says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t listen to me. I have a somewhat jaded view. I know you and Luke will be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurel.\u201d I squeeze her tightly back. \u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201d</p> <p>God, if I ever meet that stupid husband of hers I\u2019m going to let him have it.</p><p>When she\u2019s gone, I consult my schedule for the rest of the day. I\u2019ve got an hour before my next client, so I decide to wander up to the bridal department and look at my dress again. It\u2019s definitely between this one and the Vera Wang. Or maybe the Tracy Connop.</p><p>Definitely one of those three, anyway.</p><p>As I walk out onto the sales floor again, I stop in surprise. There\u2019s Danny, standing by a rack of tops, fingering one casually. What on earth is he still doing here? I\u2019m about to call out to him, and say does he want to come and see my dress and then go for a quick cappuccino? But then, to my astonishment, he glances around, surreptitiously bends down, and reaches for something in his canvas bag. It\u2019s a T-shirt with glittery sleeves, on a hanger. He shoves it onto the rack, looks around again, and reaches for another one.</p><p>I stare at him in utter stupefaction. What does he think he\u2019s doing?</p><p>He looks around again \u2014 then reaches into his bag and pulls out a small laminated sign, which he props up at the end of the display.</p><p>What the hell is he up to?</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d I say, heading toward him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He gives a startled jump, then turns and sees me. \u201cSssh! Jesus, Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing with those Tshirts?\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stocking myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, stocking yourself?\u201d</p><p>He jerks his head toward the laminated sign and I read it in disbelief.</p><p>THE DANNY KOVITZ COLLECTION</p><p>AN EXCITING NEW TALENT AT BARNEYS</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not all on Barneys hangers,\u201d says Danny, thrusting another two Tshirts on the rack. \u201cBut I figure that won\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny... you can\u2019t do this! You can\u2019t just... put your stuff on the racks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no choice, OK?\u201d says Danny, turning his head. \u201cRandall\u2019s on his way here right now, expecting to see a Danny Kovitz line at Barneys.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him in horror.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said he would never check!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have!\u201d Danny shoves another hanger onto the rack. \u201cBut his stupid girlfriend has to poke her nose in. She never showed any interest in me before, but as soon as she hears the word Barneys, it\u2019s like Oh, Randall, you should support your brother! Go to Barneys tomorrow and buy one of his pieces! So I\u2019m saying, you really don\u2019t have to do that \u2014 but now Randall\u2019s got the idea in his head, he\u2019s like, well, maybe I will pop in and take a look!

That should be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny...\u201d I glance around the sales floor to see Carla, one of the assistants, giving us an odd look. \u201cHi!\u201d I call brightly. \u201cJust... helping one of my clients... for his girlfriend...\u201d Carla gives us another suspicious look, then moves away. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work!\u201d I mutter as soon as she\u2019s out of earshot. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to take these down.

No one\u2019s even going to...\u201d He freezes. \u201cHere he is.\u201d</p> <p>I follow his gaze and see Danny\u2019s brother Randall walking across the floor toward us.</p><p>For the millionth time I wonder how on earth Randall and Danny can have come from the same parents. While Danny is wiry and constantly on the move, Randall fills his double-breasted suit comfortably, and always wears the same disapproving frown.</p><p>\u201cHello, Daniel,\u201d he says, and nods to me. \u201cBecky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Randall,\u201d I say, and give what I hope is a natural smile. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo here they are!\u201d says Danny triumphantly, moving away from the rack and gesturing to the Tshirts. \u201cMy collection. In Barneys. Just like I said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d says Randall, and carefully scrutinizes the rack of clothes. I feel sure he\u2019s about to look up and say, \u201cWhat on earth are you playing at?\u201d But he says nothing \u2014 and with a slight dart of shock I realize that he\u2019s been completely taken in.</p><p>There again, why is that such a surprise? Danny\u2019s clothes don\u2019t look so out of place, up there on the rack.</p><p>\u201cWell, congratulations,\u201d says Randall at last. \u201cThis is quite an achievement.\u201d He pats Danny awkwardly on the shoulder, then turns to me. \u201cAre they selling well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes!\u201d I say. \u201cVery popular, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, for how much do they retail?\u201d He reaches for a T-shirt, and both Danny and I involuntarily draw breath. We watch, frozen, while he searches for the label, then looks up with a deep frown. \u201cThese have no price tags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because... they\u2019re only just out,\u201d I hear myself saying hurriedly. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re priced at... erm... eighty-nine dollars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see.\u201d Randall shakes his head. \u201cWell, I never was one for high fashion\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelling me,\u201d Danny whispers in my ear.</p><p>\u201cBut if they\u2019re selling, they must have something. Daniel, I take my hat off to you.\u201d He reaches for another one, with rivets round the neck, and looks at it with a fastidious dismay. \u201cNow, which one shall I buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t buy one!\u201d says Danny at once. \u201cI\u2019ll... make you one. As a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist,\u201d says Randall. \u201cIf I can\u2019t support my own brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandall, please.\u201d Danny\u2019s voice crackles with sincerity. \u201cAllow me to make a gift to you. It\u2019s the least I can do after all your kindness to me over the years. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re sure,\u201d says Randall at last, with a shrug. He looks at his watch. \u201cI must go. Good to see you, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk to the elevator with you,\u201d says Danny, and darts me a jubilant look.</p> <p>As they walk away, I feel a giggle of relief rising in me. I can\u2019t quite believe we got away with it so easily.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d comes a voice behind me suddenly. \u201cLook at these! They\u2019re new, aren\u2019t they?\u201d A manicured hand appears over my shoulder and plucks one of Danny\u2019s Tshirts off the rail before I can stop it. My head whips round and I feel a plunge of dismay. It\u2019s Lisa Farley, a sweet but completely dippy client of Erin\u2019s. She\u2019s about twenty-two, doesn\u2019t seem to have a job, and always says whatever pops into her head, never mind whether someone might be offended. (She once asked Erin in all innocence, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it bother you, having such a weird-shaped mouth?\u201d)</p><p>Now she\u2019s holding the T-shirt up against her, looking down at it appraisingly.</p><p>Damn it. I should have whipped them down off the rack straight away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Becky!\u201d she says cheerily. \u201cHey, this is cute!

In fact, I need to... um... take them back to the stock room.\u201d I try to grab for the T-shirt, but she moves away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just take a look in the mirror. Hey, Tracy! What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Another girl, wearing the new Dior print jacket, is coming toward us.</p> <p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese new Tshirts. They\u2019re cool, aren\u2019t they?\u201d She reaches for another one and hands it to Tracy.</p><p>\u201cIf you could just give them back to me\u2014\u201d I say helplessly.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s nice!\u201d</p><p>Now they\u2019re both searching through the hangers with brisk fingers, and the poor Tshirts just can\u2019t take the strain. Hems are unraveling, bits of glitter and strings of diamante are coming loose, and sequins are shedding all over the floor.</p> <p>\u201cOops, this seam just came apart.\u201d Lisa looks up in dismay. \u201cBecky, it just fell apart. I didn\u2019t pull it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d I say weakly.</p><p>\u201cIs everything supposed to fall off like this? Hey, Christina!\u201d Lisa suddenly calls out. \u201cThis new line is so fun!\u201d</p><p>Christina?</p><p>I wheel round and feel a lurch of horror. Christina is standing at the entrance to the personal shopping department, in conversation with the head of personnel.</p><p>\u201cWhat new line?\u201d she says, looking up. \u201cOh, hi, Becky.\u201d</p> <p>Shit. I have to stop this right now.</p><p>\u201cLisa\u2014\u201d I say desperately. \u201cCome and see the new Marc Jacobs coats we\u2019ve got in!\u201d</p><p>Lisa ignores me.</p><p>\u201cThis new... what\u2019s it called...\u201d She squints at the label. \u201cDanny Kovitz! I can\u2019t believe Erin didn\u2019t tell me these were coming in! Naughty naughty!\u201d She wags a finger in mock reproach.</p><p>I watch in dismay as Christina looks up, alert. There\u2019s nothing to galvanize her like someone suggesting her department is less than perfect.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me a minute,\u201d she says to the head of personnel, and comes across the floor toward us, her dark hair gleaming under the lights.</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t Erin tell you about?\u201d she says pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cThis new designer!\u201d says Lisa. \u201cI never even heard of him before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d says Tracy suddenly, and draws her hand away from the T-shirt. \u201cThat was a pin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pin?\u201d echoes Christina. \u201cGive me that!\u201d</p><p>She takes the ragged T-shirt and stares at it bewilderedly. Then she catches sight of Danny\u2019s laminated sign.</p><p>Oh, I\u2019m so stupid. Why didn\u2019t I take that down, at least?</p><p>As she reads it, her expression changes. She looks up and meets my eye, and I feel my whole body prickle with fear. I\u2019ve never been in trouble with Christina before. But I\u2019ve heard her telling people off over the phone, and I know she can be pretty fierce.</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything about this, Becky?\u201d she asks pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cThe thing is...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Lisa, I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s been a little confusion.\u201d She gives Lisa a professional smile. \u201cThese items are not for sale. Becky \u2014 I think I\u2019d better see you in my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, I\u2019m... sorry,\u201d I say, feeling my face flush beetroot. \u201cI really am...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d says Tracy. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they for sale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Becky in trouble?\u201d says Lisa in dismay. \u201cWill she get fired? Don\u2019t fire Becky! We like her better than Erin... Oh.\u201d She claps her hand over her mouth. \u201cSorry, Erin. I didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d says Erin, giving a rather pinched smile.</p><p>\u201cChristina, all I can do is apologize,\u201d I say humbly. \u201cI never meant to cause any trouble. I never meant to mislead the customers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my office,\u201d says Christina, lifting a hand to stop me. \u201cIf you have anything to say, Becky, then you can say it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d comes a melodramatic voice behind us, and we all whip round, to see Danny heading toward us, his eyes even wilder than usual. \u201cJust stop right there! Don\u2019t blame Becky for this!\u201d he says, placing himself in front of me. \u201cShe had nothing to do with it. If you\u2019re going to fire anyone \u2014 fire me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny, she can\u2019t fire you,\u201d I mutter. \u201cYou\u2019re not employed by Barneys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would be?\u201d inquires Christina. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDanny Kovitz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny Kovitz. Ah.\u201d Light dawns on Christina\u2019s face. \u201cSo it was you who... assembled these garments. And planted them on our racks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He\u2019s not a real designer?\u201d says Tracy in horror. \u201cI knew it! I wasn\u2019t fooled.\u201d She thrusts the hanger she\u2019s holding back onto the rack as though she\u2019s been contaminated.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that breaking the law?\u201d says Lisa, wide-eyed.</p> <p>\u201cIt may well be,\u201d says Danny defensively. \u201cBut shall I tell you why I\u2019m reduced to criminal measures? Do you know the impossibility of getting a break in this so-called business of fashion?\u201d He glances around to make sure his audience is listening. \u201cI put every ounce of my life-force into my work. I weep, I cry out in pain, I squeeze myself dry of creative blood. But the fashion establishment isn\u2019t interested in new talent! They aren\u2019t interested in nurturing the newcomer who dares to be a little different!\u201d His voice rises impassionedly. \u201cIf I have to take desperate measures, can you blame me? If you cut me, do I not bleed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d breathes Lisa. \u201cI had no idea it was so tough out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did cut me,\u201d puts in Tracy, who looks far less impressed by Danny\u2019s speech. \u201cWith your stupid pin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristina, you have to give him a chance!\u201d exclaims Lisa. \u201cLook! He\u2019s so dedicated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to bring my ideas to people who will love them,\u201d begins Danny again. \u201cMy only desire is that someone, someday, will wear one of my garments and feel themselves transformed. But as I crawl toward them on my hands and knees, the doors keep being slammed in my face\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEnough already!\u201d says Christina, half exasperated, half amused. \u201cYou want your big break? Let me have a look at these clothes.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden intrigued quiet. I glance quickly at Danny. Perhaps this is going to be it! Christina will spot his genius and Barneys will buy his entire collection and he\u2019ll be made! Then Gwyneth Paltrow will wear one of his Tshirts on Leno, and there\u2019ll be a rush for them, and suddenly he\u2019ll be famous and have his own boutique!</p><p>Christina reaches for a T-shirt with spattered dye and rhinestones on the front, and as she runs her eye up and down it, I hold my breath. Lisa and Tracy raise their eyebrows at each other, and although Danny is motionless, I can see his face tightening with hope. There\u2019s dead silence as she puts it down \u2014 and as she reaches for a second T-shirt we all give an intake of breath, as though the Russian judge\u2019s hand has hovered over the perfect six scorecard. With a critical frown, she stretches it out to look at it properly... and as she does so, one of the sleeves comes off in her hand, leaving a ragged seam behind.</p><p>Everyone stares at it speechlessly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the look,\u201d says Danny, a little too late. \u201cIt\u2019s a... a deconstructive approach to design...\u201d</p><p>Christina is shaking her head and putting the T-shirt back. \u201cYoung man. You certainly have flair. You may even have talent. Unfortunately these are not enough. Until you can finish off your work properly, you\u2019re not going to get very far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy designs are usually immaculately finished!\u201d says Danny at once. \u201cPerhaps this particular collection was a little hurried...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you go back to the beginning, make a few pieces, very carefully...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m careless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you need to learn how to follow a project through to the end.\u201d Christina smiles kindly at him. \u201cThen we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can follow a project through!\u201d says Danny indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my strengths! It\u2019s one of my\u2014 Would I be making Becky\u2019s wedding dress otherwise?\u201d He grabs me, as though we\u2019re about to sing a duet. \u201cThe most important outfit of her whole life? She believes in me, even if nobody else does. When Becky Bloomwood walks down the aisle at the Plaza Hotel in a Danny Kovitz creation, you won\u2019t be calling me careless then. And when the phones start ringing off their hooks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say stupidly. \u201cDanny\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making Becky\u2019s wedding dress?\u201d Christina turns to me. \u201cI thought you were wearing Richard Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard Tyler?\u201d echoes Danny blankly.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were wearing Vera Wang,\u201d says Erin, who wandered over to the little scene two minutes ago and has been staring agog ever since.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were wearing your mother\u2019s dress,\u201d chips in Lisa. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m making your dress!\u201d says Danny, his eyes wide with shock. \u201cAren\u2019t I?

What about that, Becky?\u201d</p> <p>Their voices seem to be drilling into my head, and they\u2019re all staring at me avidly, waiting for an answer... and with no warning I feel myself snap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, OK?\u201d I cry desperately. \u201cI just... don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I feel almost tearful \u2014 which is completely ridiculous.

Becky, come with me.\u201d</p><p>We go into Christina\u2019s smart beige suede office and she closes the door. She turns round \u2014 and for an awful moment I think she\u2019s going to yell at me. But instead she gestures for me to sit down and gives me a long, penetrating look through her tortoiseshell glasses.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Becky?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine. I see.\u201d Christina gives a skeptical nod. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in your life at the moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cYou know! Same old same old...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding plans going all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say at once. \u201cYes! Absolutely no problems there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Christina is silent for a moment, tapping her teeth with a pen. \u201cYou visited a friend in the hospital recently. Who was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. That was... a friend of Luke\u2019s, actually. Michael. He had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been a shock for you.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment I\u2019m silent.</p><p>\u201cWell... yes, I suppose it was,\u201d I say at last, running a finger along the arm of my chair. \u201cEspecially for Luke. The two of them have always been really close, but they\u2019d had a falling out, and Luke was already feeling really guilty. Then we got the call about Michael \u2014 I mean, if he\u2019d died, Luke never would have been able to...\u201d I break off and rub my face, feeling emotion rising. \u201cAnd then of course, there\u2019s all this tension between Luke and his mother at the moment, which doesn\u2019t help. She completely used him. In fact, she more than used him, she abused him. He feels utterly betrayed by her. But he won\u2019t talk to me about it.\u201d My voice starts to tremble. \u201cHe won\u2019t talk to me about anything at the moment. Not the wedding, not the honeymoon... Not even where we\u2019re going to live! We\u2019re being chucked out of our apartment, and we haven\u2019t found anywhere else to go yet, and I don\u2019t know when we\u2019re even going to start looking...\u201d</p><p>To my astonishment a tear starts trickling down the side of my nose. Where did that come from?</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re fine, apart from that,\u201d says Christina.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d I brush at my face. \u201cApart from that, everything\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Christina shakes her head. \u201cThis is no good. I want you to take some vacation days. You\u2019re due some, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a vacation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d noticed you\u2019ve been tense recently, but I had no idea it was this bad.

What did she just say?</p><p>\u201cI can understand the strain it\u2019s been putting you under.\u201d Christina looks at me sympathetically. \u201cEspecially if you and your mother have always been close in the past?\u201d</p><p>Christina thinks...</p> <p>Suddenly I realize she\u2019s waiting for an answer.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes!\u201d I gulp. \u201cIt has been... rather difficult.\u201d</p><p>Christina nods, as though I\u2019ve confirmed every suspicion she had. \u201cBecky, I don\u2019t often give you advice, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want you to listen to me on this. I want you to remember, this is your wedding. Not your mother\u2019s. It\u2019s yours and Luke\u2019s, and you only get one shot. So do it the way you want to. Believe me, if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. The thing is...\u201d I swallow. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite that simple\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is that simple. It\u2019s exactly that simple. Becky, it\u2019s your wedding. It\u2019s your wedding.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is clear and emphatic and I stare at her, glass halfway to my lips, feeling as though a shaft of light is cutting through the cloud.</p><p>It\u2019s my wedding. I\u2019ve never thought of it like that before.</p><p>It\u2019s not Mum\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s not Elinor\u2019s wedding. It\u2019s mine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of wanting to please your mother too much,\u201d Christina is saying. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural, generous instinct. But sometimes you have to put yourself first. When I got married\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were married?\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time ago. It didn\u2019t work out. Maybe it didn\u2019t work out because I hated every moment of the wedding. From the processional music to the vows that my mother insisted on writing.\u201d Her hand tenses around a plastic water stirrer. \u201cFrom the lurid blue cocktails to that tacky, tacky dress...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s awful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s water under the bridge now.\u201d The water stirrer snaps and she gives me a slightly brittle smile. \u201cBut just bear my words in mind. It\u2019s your day. Yours and Luke\u2019s. Do it the way you want, and don\u2019t feel guilty about it. And Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember, you and your mother are both adults now. So have an adult conversation.\u201d She raises her eyebrows. \u201cYou might be surprised at how it turns out.\u201d</p><p>Christina is so right.</p><p>As I make my way home, I can suddenly see everything clearly. My whole approach to the wedding has changed. I feel full of a fresh, clean determination. This is my wedding. It\u2019s my day. And if I want to get married in New York, then that\u2019s where I\u2019ll get married. If I want to wear a Vera Wang dress, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll wear. It\u2019s ridiculous to feel guilty about it.</p><p>I\u2019ve been putting off talking to Mum for far too long. I mean, what am I expecting her to do, burst into tears? We\u2019re both adults. We\u2019ll have a sensible, mature conversation and I\u2019ll put forward my point of view calmly, and the whole thing will be sorted out, once and for all. God, I feel liberated. I\u2019m going to call her straight away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I march into the bedroom, dump my bag on the bed, and dial the number.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d I say as he answers. \u201cIs Mum there?

It\u2019s rather important.\u201d</p><p>As I glance at my face in the mirror, I feel like a newsreader on NBC, all crisp and cool and in charge.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d says Dad puzzledly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very well,\u201d I say. \u201cI just have to discuss a... a couple of issues with Mum.\u201d</p><p>As Dad disappears off the line I take a deep breath and push my hair back, feeling suddenly very grown-up. Here I am, about to have an adult-to-adult, straight-down-the-line conversation with my mother, for probably the first time in my life.</p><p>You know, maybe this is the beginning of a whole new relationship with my parents. A new mutual respect. A shared understanding of life.</p><p>\u201cHello, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum.\u201d I take a deep breath. Here goes. Calm and mature. \u201cMum\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Becky, I was going to give you a ring. You\u2019ll never guess who we saw up in the Lake District!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuntie Zannie! You used to dress up in all her old necklaces, do you remember? And her shoes. We were laughing about it, the sight you made, tottering around...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum. There\u2019s something important I need to discuss with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019ve still got the same grocer in the village. The one who used to sell you strawberry ice-cream cones. Do you remember the time you ate too many and weren\u2019t very well? We laughed about that too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the Tivertons still live in the same house... but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid, love... Carrot the donkey has...\u201d Mum lowers her voice. \u201cGone to donkey heaven. But he was very old, darling, and he\u2019ll be very happy up there...\u201d</p><p>This is impossible. I don\u2019t feel like a grown-up. I feel about six years old.</p><p>\u201cThey all send you their love,\u201d Mum says, eventually coming to the end of her reminiscences, \u201cand of course they\u2019ll all be at the wedding! So, Dad said you wanted to talk about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I clear my throat, suddenly aware of the echoey silence on the line; of the distance between us. \u201cWell, I wanted to... um...\u201d</p><p>Oh God. My mouth is trembling and my newsreader voice has turned into a nervous squeak.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Becky?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice rises in concern. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s just that... that...\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s no good.</p><p>I know what Christina said is right. I know there\u2019s no need to feel guilty. It\u2019s my wedding, and I\u2019m a grown-up, and I should have it wherever I like. I\u2019m not asking Mum and Dad to pay. I\u2019m not asking them to make any effort.</p><p>But even so.</p><p>I can\u2019t tell Mum I want to get married in the Plaza over the phone. I just can\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come home and see you,\u201d I hear myself saying in a rush. \u201cThat\u2019s all I wanted to say.

She\u2019s standing next to Dad at Terminal 4, scanning the arrivals gate, and as she sees me her whole face lights up with a mixture of delight and anxiety. She was quite taken aback when I told her I was coming home without Luke \u2014 in fact, I had to reassure her several times that everything was still OK between us.</p><p>Then I had to reassure her that I hadn\u2019t been sacked.</p><p>And then promise I wasn\u2019t being chased by international loan sharks.</p><p>You know, when I think back over the last few years, I sometimes feel a teeny bit bad about everything I\u2019ve put my parents through.</p><p>\u201cBecky! Graham, she\u2019s here!\u201d She runs forward, elbowing a family in turbans out of the way. \u201cBecky, love! How are you? How\u2019s Luke? Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mum,\u201d I say, and give her a huge hug. \u201cI\u2019m well. Luke sends his love.

There\u2019s no point mentioning it yet. There\u2019s no point even thinking about it yet. I\u2019ll bring the subject up later, when we\u2019re all at home, when there\u2019s a natural opening in the conversation.</p><p>Which there\u2019s bound to be.</p><p>\u201cSo, Becky, did you think any more about getting married in America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Mum. It\u2019s funny you should ask that...\u201d</p> <p>Exactly. I\u2019ll wait for some opportunity like that.</p><p>But although I act as relaxed as I can, I can\u2019t think about anything else. All the while that Mum and Dad are finding the car, disagreeing on which way the exit is, and arguing over whether \u00a33.60 for an hour\u2019s parking is a reasonable amount, I\u2019ve got an anxious knot in my stomach that tightens every time the words wedding, Luke, New York, or America are mentioned, even in passing.</p><p>This is just like the time when I told my parents I was doing the Further Maths GCSE. Tom next door was doing Further Maths and Janice was really smug about it, so I told Mum and Dad I was too. then the exams came, and I had to pretend I was sitting an extra paper (I spent three hours in Top Shop instead). And then the results came out and they kept saying, \u201cBut what did you get in Further Maths?\u201d</p><p>So then I made up this story that it took the examiners longer to mark Further Maths than the other subjects because it was harder. And I honestly think they would have believed me, except then Janice came running in, saying, \u201cTom got an A in Further Maths, what did Becky get?\u201d</p><p>Bloody Tom.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked about the wedding yet,\u201d says Mum as we zoom along the A3 toward Oxshott.</p><p>\u201cOh! No, I haven\u2019t, have I?\u201d I force a bright note into my voice. \u201cSo \u2014 er... how are preparations going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, we haven\u2019t done very much,\u201d says Dad as we approach the turning for Oxshott.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early days yet,\u201d says Mum easily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a wedding,\u201d adds Dad. \u201cPeople get far too het up about these things in my opinion. You can put it all together at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say in slight relief. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more!\u201d</p> <p>Well, thank goodness for that. I sink back in my seat and feel the anxiety drain out of me. This is going to make everything a lot easier. If they haven\u2019t arranged very much yet, it\u2019ll take no time to call it all off. In fact, it sounds like they\u2019re really not bothered about it. This is going to be fine. I\u2019ve been worrying about nothing!</p><p>\u201cSuzie phoned, by the way,\u201d says Mum as we start to get near home. \u201cShe said, would you like to meet up later on today? I said I was sure you would... Oh, and I should warn you.\u201d Mum turns in her seat. \u201cTom and Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I resign myself to hearing the details of the latest kitchen they\u2019ve had put in, or which promotion Lucy has won at work.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve split up.\u201d Mum lowers her voice, even though it\u2019s just the three of us in the car.</p><p>\u201cSplit up?\u201d I stare at her, taken aback. \u201cAre you serious? But they\u2019ve only been married for...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even two years. Janice is devastated, as you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I say blankly, and Mum purses her lips.</p><p>\u201cThat Lucy ran off with a drummer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA drummer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a band. Apparently he\u2019s got a pierced...\u201d She pauses disapprovingly, and my mind ranges wildly over all the possibilities, some of which I\u2019m sure Mum\u2019s never heard of. (To be honest, I hadn\u2019t either, till I moved to the West Village.) \u201cNipple,\u201d she says at last, to my slight relief.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. Lucy\u2019s run off... with a drummer... with a pierced nipple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lives in a trailer,\u201d puts in Dad, signaling left.</p><p>\u201cAfter all the work Tom did on that lovely conservatory,\u201d says Mum, shaking her head. \u201cSome girls have no gratitude.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t get my head round this. Lucy works for Wetherby\u2019s Investment Bank. She and Tom live in Reigate. Their curtains match their sofa. How on earth did she meet a drummer with a pierced nipple?</p><p>Suddenly I remember that conversation I overheard in the garden when I was here last. Lucy didn\u2019t exactly sound happy. But then she didn\u2019t exactly sound like she was about to run off, either.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s Tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coping,\u201d says Dad. \u201cHe\u2019s at home with Janice and Martin at the moment, poor lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ask me, he\u2019s well out of it,\u201d says Mum crisply. \u201cIt\u2019s Janice I feel sorry for. After that lovely wedding she put on. They were all fooled by that girl.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We pull up outside the house, and to my surprise there are two white vans parked in the drive.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d says Mum.</p><p>\u201cPlumbing,\u201d says Dad.</p> <p>But they\u2019ve both got slightly strange expressions. Mum\u2019s eyes are bright, and she glances at Dad a couple of times as we walk up to the front door.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you ready?\u201d says Dad casually. He puts his key into the lock and swings open the door.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d cry Mum and Dad simultaneously, and my jaw drops to the ground.</p><p>The old hall wallpaper has gone. The old hall carpet has gone. The whole place has been done in light, fresh colors, with pale carpet and new lighting everywhere. As my eye runs disbelievingly upward I see an unobtrusive man in overalls repainting the banisters; on the landing are two more, standing on a stepladder and putting up a candelabra. Everywhere is the smell of paint and newness. And money being spent.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having the house done up,\u201d I say feebly.</p> <p>\u201cFor the wedding!\u201d says Mum, beaming at me.</p><p>\u201cYou said\u2014\u201d I swallow. \u201cYou said you hadn\u2019t done much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to surprise you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Becky?\u201d says Dad, gesturing around. \u201cDo you like it? Does it meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>His voice is jokey. But I can tell it really matters to him whether I like it. To both of them. They\u2019re doing all this for me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s... fantastic,\u201d I say huskily. \u201cReally lovely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow, come and look at the garden!\u201d says Mum, and I follow her dumbly through to the French windows, where I see a team of uniformed gardeners working away in the flower beds.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to plant \u2018Luke and Becky\u2019 in pansies!\u201d says Mum. \u201cJust in time for June.\u201d And we\u2019re having a new water feature put in, right by where the entrance to the marquee will be. I saw it in Modern Garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds... great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it lights up at night, so when we have the fireworks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fireworks?\u201d I say, and Mum looks at me in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI sent you a fax about the fireworks, Becky! Don\u2019t say you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d</p><p>My mind flicks back to the pile of faxes Mum\u2019s been sending me, and which I\u2019ve been guiltily thrusting under the bed, some skimmed over, some completely unread.</p> <p>What have I been doing? Why haven\u2019t I paid attention to what\u2019s been going on?</p><p>\u201cBecky, love, you don\u2019t look at all well,\u201d says Mum. \u201cYou must be tired after the flight. Come and have a nice cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>We walk into the kitchen, and I feel my insides gripped with new horror.</p><p>\u201cHave you installed a new kitchen too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d says Mum gaily. \u201cWe just had the units repainted. They look pretty, don\u2019t they? Now. Have a nice croissant. They come from the new bakery.\u201d</p><p>She hands me a basket \u2014 but I can\u2019t eat. I feel sick.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Mum peers at me. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s all... perfect.\u201d</p><p>What am I going to do?</p><p>\u201cYou know... I think I\u2019ll just go and unpack,\u201d I say, and manage a weak smile. \u201cSort myself out a bit.\u201d</p><p>As I close my bedroom door behind me, the weak smile is still pasted to my face, but inside my heart is thumping wildly.</p><p>This is not going as planned.</p><p>This is not going remotely as planned. New wallpaper? Water features? Fireworks displays? How come I didn\u2019t know about any of this? I should have been more attentive. This is all my own fault. Oh God, oh God...</p><p>How can I tell Mum and Dad this has all got to be called off? How can I do it?</p><p>I can\u2019t.</p><p>But I have to.</p><p>But I can\u2019t, I just can\u2019t.</p><p>It\u2019s my wedding, I remind myself firmly, trying to regain my New York kick-ass confidence. I can have it where I like.</p><p>But the words ring false in my brain, making me wince. Maybe that was true at the beginning. Before anything had been done, before any effort had been made. But now... this isn\u2019t just my wedding anymore. This is Mum\u2019s and Dad\u2019s gift to me. It\u2019s the biggest present they\u2019ve ever given me in my life, and they\u2019ve invested it with all the love and care they can muster.</p><p>And I\u2019m proposing to reject it. To say thanks, but no thanks.</p><p>What have I been thinking?</p><p>Heart thumping, I reach into my pocket for the notes I scribbled on the plane, trying to remember all my justifications. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reasons why our wedding should be at the Plaza:</p><p>1.

A marquee would only mess up the garden.</p><p>5. You won\u2019t have to invite Auntie Sylvia.</p><p>6. You get free Tiffany frames.</p><p>They seemed so convincing when I was writing them. Now they seem like jokes. Mum and Dad don\u2019t know anything about the Plaza. Why would they want to fly off to some snooty hotel they\u2019ve never clapped eyes on?

Lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s decaffeinated,\u201d says Mum, handing me a mug reading You Don\u2019t Have to Be Mad to Organize a Wedding But Your Mother Does. \u201cI thought maybe you were drinking decaffeinated these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd how are you feeling?\u201d Mum sits down next to me and I surreptitiously transfer my screwed-up piece of paper from one hand to the other. \u201cA little bit tired? Sick, too, probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot too bad.\u201d I give a slightly heavier sigh than I meant to. \u201cThe airline food was pretty grim, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must keep your strength up!\u201d Mum squeezes my arm. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve got something for you, darling!\u201d She hands me a piece of paper. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I unfold the paper and stare at it in bewilderment. It\u2019s house details. A four-bedroom house in Oxshott, to be precise.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mum\u2019s face is glowing. \u201cLook at all the features!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to move, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for us, silly! You\u2019d be just round the corner from us! Look, it\u2019s got a built-in barbecue, two en-suite bathrooms...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, we live in New York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do at the moment. But you won\u2019t want to stay in New York forever, will you? Not in the long term.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden thread of concern in her voice; and although she\u2019s smiling, I can see the tension in her eyes. I open my mouth to answer \u2014 then realize, to my own surprise, that Luke and I haven\u2019t ever talked properly about the long term.</p><p>I suppose I\u2019ve always assumed that we\u2019ll come back to Britain one day. But when?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not planning to stay there for good, surely?\u201d she adds, and gives a little laugh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say confusedly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t bring up a family in that poky flat! You\u2019ll want to come home! You\u2019ll want a nice house with a garden! Especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow...\u201d She makes a euphemistic circling gesture.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Becky.\u201d Mum sighs. \u201cI can understand if you\u2019re a little... shy about telling people. But it\u2019s all right, darling! These days, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable. There\u2019s no stigma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStigma? What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing we\u2019ll need to know\u201d\u2014she pauses delicately\u2014\u201cis how much to let the dress out by? For the day?\u201d</p><p>Let out the dress? What on...</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>\u201cMum! You haven\u2019t got the idea that I\u2019m... I\u2019m...\u201d I make the same euphemistic gesture that she made.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d Mum\u2019s face falls in disappointment.</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course I\u2019m not! Why on earth would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had something important to discuss with us!\u201d says Mum, defensively taking a sip of coffee. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Luke, it wasn\u2019t your job, and it wasn\u2019t your bank manager. And Suzie\u2019s having a baby, and you two girls always do things together, so we assumed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not, OK? And I\u2019m not on drugs either, before you ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then, what did you want to tell us?\u201d She puts her coffee down and looks at me anxiously. \u201cWhat was so important that you had to come home?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the bedroom. My fingers tighten around my mug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This is it.

My throat is tight and I feel slightly sick. How can I possibly do this?</p><p>I close my eyes and allow the glitter of the Plaza to flash before my eyes, trying to summon up all the excitement and glamour again. The gilded rooms, the plushiness everywhere. Images of myself sweeping around that huge shiny dance floor before an admiring crowd.</p> <p>But somehow... it doesn\u2019t seem quite as overpowering as it did before. Somehow it doesn\u2019t seem as convincing.</p><p>Oh God. What do I want? What do I really want?</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><p>I look up to see Mum gazing at me in dismay. \u201cI knew it! You and Luke have fallen out, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just knew it! I said to your father several times, \u2018I can feel it in my bones, Becky\u2019s coming home to call off the wedding.\u2019 He said nonsense, but I could just feel it, here.\u201d Mum clasps her chest. \u201cA mother knows these things. And I was right, wasn\u2019t I? You do want to cancel the wedding, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her dumbly. She knows I came home to cancel the wedding. How does she know that?</p><p>\u201cBecky? Are you all right?\u201d Mum puts an arm round my shoulders. \u201cDarling, listen. We won\u2019t mind. All Dad and I want is the best for you. And if that means calling off the wedding, then that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. Love, you mustn\u2019t go ahead with it unless you\u2019re 100 percent sure\u2014110 percent!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but you\u2019ve made so much effort...\u201d I mumble. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent all this money...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter! Money doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d She squeezes me tight. \u201cBecky, if you have any doubts at all, we\u2019ll cancel straight away. We just want you to be happy. That\u2019s all we want.\u201d</p><p>Mum sounds so sympathetic and understanding, for a few instants I can\u2019t speak. Here she is, offering me the very thing I came home to ask for. Without any questions, without any recriminations. Without anything but love and support.</p> <p>As I look at her kind, cozy, familiar face, I know, beyond any doubt, that it\u2019s impossible.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cMum, Luke and I haven\u2019t fallen out. The... the wedding\u2019s still on.\u201d I rub my face. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019ll just go outside and... and get some air.\u201d</p><p>As I step out into the garden, a couple of of the hired gardeners look up and say hello, and I smile weakly back. I feel completely paranoid, as though my secret is so huge, I must somehow be giving it away. As though people must be able to see it, bulging out of me, or floating above my head in bubble captions. I have another wedding planned.For the same day as this one.My parents have no idea.Yes, I know I\u2019m in trouble.Yes, I know I\u2019ve been stupid.Oh, just piss off and leave me alone, can\u2019t you see how completely stressed out I am?</p><p>\u201cHello, Becky.\u201d</p><p>I give a start of surprise and turn round. Standing at the garden fence in the next-door garden, looking mournfully at me, is Tom.</p><p>\u201cTom! Hi!\u201d I say, trying not to give away my shock at his appearance.</p><p>But... blimey. He looks awful, all pale and miserable and wearing absolutely terrible clothes. Not that Tom\u2019s ever been a style king \u2014 but while he was with Lucy, he did acquire a veneer of OK-ness. In fact, his hair went through quite a groovy stage. But now it\u2019s back to greasy hair and the maroon jumper Janice gave him five Christmases ago.</p><p>\u201cSorry to hear about...\u201d I pause awkwardly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>He hunches his shoulders miserably and looks around at all the gardeners digging and clipping away behind me. \u201cSo, how are the wedding preparations going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... fine,\u201d I say brightly. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s all lists at this stage. Things to do, things to check, little details to... to... finalize...\u201d</p><p>Like which continent to get married in. Oh God. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cSo... er, how are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the preparations for our wedding.\u201d Tom shakes his head. \u201cSeems a million years ago now. Different people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s change the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the worst thing?\u201d says Tom, ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d Your hair, I nearly say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe worst thing is, I thought I understood Lucy. We understood each other. But all the time...\u201d He breaks off, reaches in his pocket for a handkerchief, and blows his nose. \u201cI mean, now I look back, of course I can see there were signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI just didn\u2019t pick up on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as...\u201d I prompt gently, trying not to give away how curious I am.</p> <p>\u201cWell.\u201d He thinks for a moment. \u201cLike the way she kept saying if she had to live in Reigate for one more minute she\u2019d shoot herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, slightly taken aback.</p><p>\u201cThen there was the screaming fit she had in Furniture Village...\u201d</p><p>\u201cScreaming fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe began yelling, \u2018I\u2019m twenty-seven! I\u2019m twenty-seven! What am I doing here?\u2019 Security had to come in the end, and calm her down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. I thought she loved Reigate! You two seemed so...\u201d</p><p>Smug is the word I\u2019m searching for.</p><p>\u201cSo... happy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was happy until all the wedding presents were unwrapped,\u201d says Tom thoughtfully. \u201cThen... it was like she suddenly looked around and realized... this was her life now. And she didn\u2019t like what she saw. Including me, I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe started saying she was sick of the suburbs, and she wanted to have a bit of life while she was young. But I thought, we\u2019ve just repainted the house, we\u2019re halfway through the new conservatory, this isn\u2019t a good time to move\u2014\u201d He looks up, his eyes full of misery. \u201cI should have listened, shouldn\u2019t I? Maybe I should even have got the tattoo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wanted you to get a tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo match hers.\u201d</p><p>Lucy Webster with a tattoo! I almost want to laugh. But then, as I look at Tom\u2019s miserable face, I feel a surge of anger. OK, Tom and I haven\u2019t always seen eye to eye over the years. But he doesn\u2019t deserve this. He is what he is. And if Lucy wasn\u2019t happy with that, then why did she get married to him in the first place?</p><p>\u201cTom, you can\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cIt sounds like Lucy was having her own problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She was very lucky to have you. More fool her, not appreciating it.\u201d Impulsively I lean across the fence and give him a hug. As I draw away again, he stares at me with huge eyes, like a dog.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always understood me, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve known each other a long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one else knows me like you do.\u201d</p><p>His hands are still round my shoulders, and he doesn\u2019t seem about to let go, so I step backward under the pretext of gesturing at the house, where a man in overalls is painting a window frame.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen all the work Mum and Dad are having done? It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. They\u2019re really pushing the boat out. I heard about the fireworks display. You must be very excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it,\u201d I say automatically. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve said at once, every time anyone\u2019s mentioned the wedding to me. But now, as I watch our old, familiar house being smartened up, like a lady putting on makeup, I start to feel a strange sensation. A strange tugging at my heart.</p><p>With a sudden pang, I realize I am looking forward to it.</p><p>I\u2019m looking forward to seeing our garden all bedecked with balloons. To seeing Mum all dressed up and happy. Getting ready in my own bedroom, at my own dressing table. Saying good-bye to my old life properly. Not in some impersonal suite in a hotel... but here. At home, where I grew up.</p><p>While I was in New York, I couldn\u2019t begin to envisage this wedding. It seemed so tiny and humdrum in comparison to the glamour of the Plaza. But now that I\u2019m here, it\u2019s the Plaza that\u2019s starting to seem unreal. It\u2019s the Plaza that\u2019s slipping away, like an exotic, far-off holiday, which I\u2019m already starting to forget. It\u2019s been a lot of fun playing the part of a New York princess bride, tasting sumptuous dishes and discussing vintage champagne and million-dollar flower arrangements. But that\u2019s the point. I\u2019ve been playing a part.</p><p>The truth is, this is where I belong. Right here in this English garden I\u2019ve known all my life.</p><p>So what am I going to do?</p><p>Am I really going to...</p><p>I can barely even think it.</p><p>Am I really even contemplating canceling that whole, huge, expensive wedding?</p><p>Just the thought of it makes my insides shrivel up.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice penetrates my thoughts and I look up dazedly, to see her standing at the patio doors, holding a tablecloth. \u201cBecky! There\u2019s a phone call for you inside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh. OK. Who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone called Robin,\u201d says Mum. \u201cHello, Tom, love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobin?\u201d I frown puzzledly as I walk back toward the house. \u201cRobin who?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure I know any Robins. Apart from Robin Anderson who used to work for Investment Monthly, but I hardly knew him, really\u2014</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t catch the surname, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d says Mum. \u201cBut she seems very nice. She said she was calling from New York...\u201d</p><p>Robyn?</p><p>I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m pinioned with horror to the patio steps.</p><p>Robyn is on the phone... here?</p><p>This is all wrong. Robyn doesn\u2019t belong in this world, she belongs in New York. This is like when people go back in time and mess up World War II.</p> <p>\u201cIs she a friend?\u201d Mum\u2019s saying innocently. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had a nice little chat about the wedding...\u201d</p><p>The ground wobbles beneath me.</p><p>\u201cWhat... what did she say?\u201d I manage.</p><p>\u201cNothing in particular!\u201d Mum stares at me in surprise. \u201cShe asked me what color I was going to wear... and she kept saying something odd about violinists. You don\u2019t want violinists at the wedding, do you, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d My voice rises shrilly. \u201cWhat would I want violinists for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, darling, are you all right?\u201d Mum peers at me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her you\u2019ll call back, shall I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! Don\u2019t talk to her again! I mean... it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>I hurry into the house, heart thumping. What am I going to say? Should I tell her I\u2019ve changed my mind?</p><p>As I pick up the phone, I see that Mum\u2019s followed me inside. Oh God. How am I going to manage this?</p><p>\u201cRobyn, hi!\u201d I attempt a natural tone. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>OK. I\u2019ll just get her off the phone, as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cHi! Becky! I\u2019m so glad I got a chance to speak with your mother!\u201d says Robyn. \u201cShe seems a lovely lady. I\u2019m so looking forward to meeting her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say as heartily as I can. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to... get together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough I was surprised she didn\u2019t know about the string orchestra. Tut tut! You really should keep your mom up-to-date, Becky!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI\u2019ve just been quite busy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d says Robyn sympathetically. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I send her an information package? It would be so easy to FedEx it over. Then she\u2019ll see the whole thing in front of her eyes! If you give me the address\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cry before I can stop myself. \u201cI mean... don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll pass everything on. Really. Don\u2019t... send anything. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a few menu cards? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to see those!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Nothing!\u201d</p><p>My hand is tight around the receiver and my face is sweating. I don\u2019t even dare look at Mum.</p><p>\u201cWell, OK!\u201d says Robyn at last. \u201cYou\u2019re the boss! Now, I\u2019ve spoken to Sheldon Lloyd about the table arrangements...\u201d</p><p>As she babbles on, I dart a glance at Mum, who is about three feet away from me. Surely she can hear the phone from there? Surely she just heard the word Plaza? Surely she just caught wedding and ballroom?</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, without taking in anything that Robyn\u2019s saying, \u201cThat all sounds fine.\u201d I twist the cord around my fingers. \u201cBut... but listen, Robyn. The thing is, I\u2019ve come home to get away from it all. So could you possibly not phone me here anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be updated?\u201d says Robyn in surprise.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s fine. You just... do your thing, and I\u2019ll catch up when I get back next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I understand. You need time out! Becky, I promise, unless it\u2019s an emergency, I\u2019ll leave you alone. You have a lovely break now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I will. Bye, Robyn.\u201d</p><p>I put the phone down, shaky with relief. Thank God she\u2019s gone.</p><p>But I don\u2019t feel safe. Robyn\u2019s got the number here now. She could phone at any time. I mean, what counts as an emergency in wedding planning? Probably anything. Probably a misplaced rose petal. She only has to say one wrong word to Mum, and both of them will realize what\u2019s been going on. Mum will immediately realize why I came back here, what I was trying to say.</p><p>She\u2019d be so hurt. I can\u2019t allow that to happen.</p><p>OK, I have two options. Number one: get Mum and Dad to move house immediately.

And she seemed obsessed by what color I was going to wear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s completely obsessed. So... if she ever rings again, just make an excuse and put the phone down. And whatever she says, even if it sounds quite plausible... don\u2019t believe a word of it. Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, love,\u201d says Mum, nodding. \u201cWhatever you say.\u201d</p><p>As she goes into the kitchen, I hear her saying \u201cPoor woman. You have to feel sorry for them, really. Graham, did you hear that? That lady from America who phoned for Becky. She\u2019s in love with Luke!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t cope with this anymore.</p> <p>I need to see Suze.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>I\u2019VE AGREED TO meet Suze at Sloane Square for a cup of tea. There\u2019s a crowd of tourists milling around when I arrive, and for a moment I can\u2019t see her. Then the throng disperses \u2014 and there she is, sitting by the fountain, her long blond hair haloed by the sun, and the hugest stomach I\u2019ve ever seen.</p><p>As I see her, I\u2019m all set to rush up to her, exclaim, \u201cOh God, Suze, it\u2019s all a nightmare!\u201d and tell her everything.</p><p>But then I stop. She looks like an angel, sitting there. A pregnant angel.</p><p>Or the Virgin Mary, perhaps. All serene and lovely and perfect.</p><p>And suddenly I feel all messed up in comparison. I\u2019d been planning to unburden the entire situation on Suze, like I always do, and wait for her to think of an answer. But now... I just can\u2019t. She looks so calm and happy. It would be like dumping toxic waste in some beautiful clear sea.</p><p>\u201cBex! Hi!\u201d As she sees me she stands up, and I feel a fresh shock at how... well, how big she looks.</p> <p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I hurry toward her and give her a huge hug. \u201cYou look amazing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling great!\u201d says Suze. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... I\u2019m fine!\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s all fine. Come on. Let\u2019s go and have some tea.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to tell her. This is it. For once in my life, I\u2019m going to sort out my problems on my own.</p><p>We go to Oriel and get a table by the window. When the waiter comes, I order hot chocolate, but Suze produces a tea bag and hands it to the waiter.</p><p>\u201cRaspberry leaf tea,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt strengthens the uterus. For labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod. \u201cLabor. Of course!\u201d</p><p>I feel a little shiver at the base of my spine and smile quickly to cover it.</p><p>Secretly, I\u2019m really not at all convinced about this whole giving birth thing. I mean, look at the size of Suze\u2019s bump. Look at the size of a full-grown baby. And then tell me that\u2019s going to fit through...</p><p>I mean, I know the theory. It\u2019s just... to be honest, I can\u2019t see it working.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you due again?\u201d I say, staring at Suze\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cFour weeks today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... it\u2019s going to grow even bigger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes!\u201d Suze pats her bump fondly. \u201cQuite a bit, I should think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say weakly, as a waiter puts a cup of hot chocolate in front of me. \u201cExcellent. So... how\u2019s Tarquin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine!\u201d says Suze. \u201cHe\u2019s up on Craie at the moment. You know, his Scottish island? They\u2019re lambing at the moment, so he thought he\u2019d go and help out. Before the baby comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right. And you didn\u2019t go with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it would have been a bit risky.\u201d Suze stirs her raspberry tea thoughtfully. \u201cAnd the thing is, I\u2019m not quite as interested in sheep as he is. I mean, they are really interesting,\u201d she adds loyally. \u201cBut you know, after you\u2019ve seen a thousand of them...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019ll be back in time, will he?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh yes.

I won\u2019t even be here.</p><p>\u201cCan I touch?\u201d I put my hand gingerly on Suze\u2019s stomach. \u201cI can\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d says Suze. \u201cI expect it\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know if it\u2019s a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found out.\u201d Suze leans forward earnestly. \u201cBut I kind of think it\u2019s a girl, because I keep being drawn to all these sweet little dresses in the shops. Like a kind of a craving? And they say in all the books, your body will tell you what it needs. So, you know, maybe that\u2019s a sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you going to call her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t decide. It\u2019s so hard! You know, you buy these books, and all the names are crap...\u201d She takes a sip of tea. \u201cWhat would you call a baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh! I don\u2019t know! Maybe Lauren, after Ralph Lauren.\u201d I think for a few moments. \u201cOr Dolce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDolce Cleath-Stuart,\u201d says Suze thoughtfully. \u201cI quite like that! We could call her Dolly for short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Vera. After Vera Wang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVera?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cI\u2019m not calling my baby Vera!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about your baby!\u201d I retort. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about mine. Vera Lauren Comme des Brandon. I think that\u2019s got a really good ring to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVera Brandon sounds like a character off Coronation Street! But I like Dolce. What about if it was a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarvey. Or Barney,\u201d I say after a little thought. \u201cDepending on whether it was born in London or New York.\u201d</p> <p>I take another sip of hot chocolate \u2014 then look up, to see Suze gazing at me seriously.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t really have a baby in America, would you, Bex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know. Who can tell? We probably won\u2019t have children for years yet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, we all really miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, not you, too, Suze.\u201d I give a half-laugh. \u201cI had Mum on at me today to move back to Oxshott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true! Tarkie was saying the other day, London just isn\u2019t the same without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I gaze at her, feeling ridiculously touched.</p><p>\u201cAnd your mum keeps asking me if I think you\u2019ll stay in New York forever... you won\u2019t, will you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cIt all depends on Luke... and his business...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the boss!\u201d says Suze. \u201cYou have a say, too. Do you want to stay out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I screw up my face, trying to explain. \u201cSometimes I think I do. When I\u2019m in New York, it seems like the most important place in the world. My job is fantastic, and the people are fantastic, and it\u2019s all wonderful. But when I come home, suddenly I think, Hang on, this is my home. This is where I belong.\u201d I pick up a sugar packet and begin to shred it. \u201cI just don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m ready to come home yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come back to England and have a baby!\u201d says Suze wheedlingly. \u201cThen we can be mummies together!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Suze!\u201d I take a sip of chocolate, rolling my eyes. \u201cLike I\u2019m really ready to have a baby!\u201d I get up to go to the ladies\u2019 room before she can say anything else.</p><p>On the other hand... she has got a point. Why shouldn\u2019t I have a baby? Other people do \u2014 so why not me? I mean, if I could somehow bypass the actual having it bit. Maybe I could have one of those operations where you go to sleep and don\u2019t feel anything. And then when I woke up I\u2019d have a baby!</p><p>I have a sudden pleasant vision of Suze and me walking up the road together, pushing prams. That might be quite fun, actually. I mean, you can buy loads of gorgeous baby things these days. Like cute little hats, and tiny denim jackets... And \u2014 yes \u2014 doesn\u2019t Gucci do a really cool baby sling?</p><p>We could have cappuccinos together, and walk round the shops, and... I mean, that\u2019s basically all mothers do, isn\u2019t it? Now that I think about it, I\u2019d be perfect at it!</p><p>I must definitely have a chat with Luke.</p><p>It\u2019s not until we\u2019re leaving Oriel that Suze says, \u201cSo, Bex, you haven\u2019t told me anything about the wedding!\u201d</p><p>My stomach gives a little swoop, and I turn my head away, under the pretense of putting on my coat.</p><p>I\u2019d kind of managed to forget about the whole wedding issue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWell, it\u2019s all... um... fine!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to bother Suze with my problems. I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cWas Luke all right about you getting married in England?\u201d She looks anxiously at me. \u201cI mean, it didn\u2019t cause a rift between you or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cI can honestly say that it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I hold the door open for her and we walk out into Sloane Square. A column of schoolchildren in corduroy knickerbockers is crowding the pavement, and we stand aside, waiting for them to pass.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you made the right decision.\u201d Suze squeezes my arm. \u201cI was so worried you were going to choose New York. What made you finally decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... this and that. You know. So, erm... did you read about these new proposals to privatize the water system?\u201d</p><p>But Suze ignores me. Honestly, isn\u2019t she interested in current affairs?</p><p>\u201cSo what did Elinor say when you called off the Plaza?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said... erm... well, she wasn\u2019t pleased, of course. She said she was very cross, and... er...\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery cross?\u201d Suze raises her eyebrows. \u201cIs that all? I thought she\u2019d be furious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was furious!\u201d I amend hurriedly. \u201cShe was so furious, she... burst a blood vessel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe burst a blood vessel?\u201d Suze stares at me. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn her... chin.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Suze is standing still in the street, her expression slowly changing. \u201cBex\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and look at baby clothes!\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cThere\u2019s that really sweet shop on the King\u2019s Road...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is!

You\u2019re hiding something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did call the American wedding off, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex?\u201d Her voice is as stern as I\u2019ve ever heard it. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Oh God. I can\u2019t lie any more.</p><p>\u201cI... I\u2019m going to,\u201d I say weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to?\u201d Suze\u2019s voice rises in dismay. \u201cYou\u2019re going to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known! I should have guessed! But I just assumed you must have called it off, because your mother kept on organizing her wedding, and no one said anything about New York, and I thought, oh, Bex must have decided to get married at home after all...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, please. Don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cJust stay calm... breathe deeply...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not worry about it!\u201d cries Suze. \u201cHow can I not worry? Bex, you promised me you were going to sort this out weeks ago! You promised!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! And I\u2019m going to. It\u2019s just... it\u2019s been so difficult. Deciding between them. They both seemed so perfect, in completely different ways\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex, a wedding isn\u2019t a handbag!\u201d says Suze incredulously. \u201cYou can\u2019t decide you\u2019ll treat yourself to two!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I know! Look, I\u2019m going to sort it out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re all lovely and serene and happy!\u201d I wail. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to spoil it with my stupid problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bex.\u201d Suze gazes at me silently \u2014 then puts an arm round me. \u201cSo... what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Elinor the New York wedding is all off. And I\u2019m going to get married here in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re completely sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure. After seeing Mum and Dad... and Mum was so sweet... and she has no idea what I\u2019ve been planning behind her back...\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cI mean, this wedding is everything to her. Oh God, Suze, I feel so stupid. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I don\u2019t want to get married at the Plaza. I don\u2019t want to get married anywhere else except at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t change your mind again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not this time. Honestly, Suze, this is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s said all along, it\u2019s up to me.\u201d</p><p>Suze is silent for a moment.

I thought pregnant women were supposed to take it easy.</p><p>\u201cTry again!\u201d she repeats after every three hundred feet. \u201cTry again!

She\u2019s stopped still on the pavement, ten yards behind me, and there\u2019s a puddle of water at her feet.</p><p>\u201cSuze... don\u2019t worry,\u201d I say awkwardly. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand!

Are you going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>This can\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I can see panic rising on Suze\u2019s face. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s possible... But it\u2019s four weeks early! It\u2019s too soon! Tarkie isn\u2019t here, nothing\u2019s ready... Oh God...\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Suze look so scared before. A choking dismay creeps over me, and I fight the temptation to burst into tears. What have I done now? As well as everything else, I\u2019ve sent my best friend into premature labor.</p><p>\u201cSuze, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I gulp.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault! Don\u2019t be stupid!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is! You were so happy and serene, and then you saw me. I should just stay away from pregnant people\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to go to the hospital.\u201d Suze\u2019s face is pale. \u201cThey said to come in if this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s go! Come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t got my bag, or anything. There\u2019s loads of stuff I need to take...\u201d She bites her lip worriedly. \u201cShall I go home first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got time for that!\u201d I say in a panic. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby clothes... nappies... stuff like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where do you...\u201d I look around helplessly, then, with a sudden surge of relief, spot the sign for Peter Jones.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, and grab her arm. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>As soon as we get into Peter Jones, I look around for an assistant. And thank goodness, here comes one, a nice middle-aged lady with red lipstick and gold spectacles on a chain.</p><p>\u201cMy friend needs an ambulance,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cA taxi will be fine, honestly,\u201d says Suze. \u201cIt\u2019s just that my waters have broken. So I should probably get to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness!\u201d says the lady. \u201cCome and sit down, dear, and I\u2019ll call a taxi for you...\u201d</p><p>We sit Suze down on a chair by a checkout desk, and a junior assistant brings her a glass of water. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cTell me what you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember exactly.\u201d Suze looks anxious. \u201cWe were given a list... Maybe they\u2019ll know in the baby department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be OK if I leave you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine! Contractions haven\u2019t even started.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d I glance nervously at her stomach.</p><p>\u201cBex, just go!\u201d</p><p>Honestly. Why on earth do they put baby departments so far away from the main entrances of shops? I mean, what\u2019s the point of all these stupid floors of clothes and makeup and bags, which no one\u2019s interested in? After sprinting up and down about six escalators, at last I find it, and come to a standstill, panting slightly.</p><p>For a moment I look around, dazed by all the names of things I\u2019ve never heard of.</p><p>Reception blanket?</p> <p>Anticolic teats?</p><p>Oh, sod it. I\u2019ll just buy everything. I quickly head for the nearest display and start grabbing things indiscriminately. Sleeping suits, tiny socks, a hat... a teddy, a cot blanket... what else? A Moses basket... nappies... little glove puppets in case the baby gets bored... a really cute little Christian Dior jacket... gosh, I wonder if they do that in grown-up sizes too...</p><p>I shove the lot onto the checkout desk and whip out my Visa card.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my friend,\u201d I explain breathlessly. \u201cShe\u2019s just gone into labor. Is this everything she needs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, I\u2019m afraid, dear,\u201d says the assistant, scanning a baby bath thermometer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a list here,\u201d says a nearby woman in maternity dungarees and Birkenstocks. \u201cThis is what the National Childbirth Trust recommends you take in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thanks!\u201d</p><p>She hands a piece of paper to me and I scan the endless typed list with growing dismay. I thought I\u2019d done so well \u2014 but I haven\u2019t got half the stuff they say here. And if I miss anything, it\u2019ll turn out to be completely vital, and Suze\u2019s whole birth experience will be ruined and I\u2019ll never forgive myself.</p><p>Loose T-shirt... Scented candles... Plant sprayer...</p><p>Is this the right list?</p><p>\u201cPlant sprayer?\u201d I say bewilderedly.</p><p>\u201cTo spray the laboring woman\u2019s face,\u201d explains the woman in dungarees. \u201cHospital rooms get very hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want the home department for that,\u201d puts in the assistant.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>Tape recorder... soothing tapes... inflatable ball...</p><p>\u201cInflatable ball? Won\u2019t the baby be a bit young to play with a ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the mother to lean on,\u201d says the woman kindly. \u201cTo alleviate the waves of pain. Alternatively she could use a large bean bag.\u201d</p><p>Waves of pain? Oh God. The thought of Suze in pain makes me feel all wobbly inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a ball and a bean bag,\u201d I say hurriedly. \u201cAnd maybe some aspirin. Extra-strong.\u201d</p><p>At last I stagger back to the ground floor, red in the face and panting. I just hope I\u2019ve got all this right. I couldn\u2019t find an inflatable ball in the whole of the stupid shop \u2014 so in the end I grabbed an inflatable canoe instead, and made the man pump it up for me. I\u2019ve got it wedged under one arm now, with a Teletubbies bean bag and a Moses basket stuffed under the other, and about six full carrier bags dangling from my wrists.</p><p>I glance at my watch \u2014 and to my utter horror I see that I\u2019ve already been twenty-five minutes. I\u2019m half expecting to see Suze sitting on the chair holding a baby in her arms.</p><p>But there she is, still on the chair, wincing slightly.</p><p>\u201cBex. There you are! I think my contractions have started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I took so long,\u201d I gasp. \u201cI just wanted to get everything you might need.\u201d A box of Scrabble falls out of one of the bags onto the ground, and I bend to pick it up. \u201cThat\u2019s for when you have an epidural,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cThe taxi\u2019s here,\u201d interrupts the lady with gold spectacles. \u201cDo you need some help with all that?\u201d</p><p>As we make our way out to the chugging taxi, Suze is staring at my load in utter bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cBex... why did you buy an inflatable canoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you to lie on. Or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a watering can?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a plant sprayer.\u201d Breathlessly I start shoving bags into the taxi.</p><p>\u201cBut why do I need a plant sprayer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, it wasn\u2019t my idea, OK?\u201d I say defensively. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somehow we cram everything into the taxi.

After waiting all this time. And doing the classes, and everything. He was really good at panting. The teacher made him do it in front of everyone else, he was so good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Suze.\u201d I feel like crying. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll take hours and hours, and he\u2019ll still make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d She suddenly turns in her seat. \u201cYou won\u2019t leave me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d I say, appalled. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you all the time, Suze.\u201d I hold both her hands tight. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know anything at all about giving birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... yes,\u201d I lie. \u201cLoads!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike... um... you need hot towels... and...\u201d Suddenly I spot a baby milk carton poking out of one of the bags. \u201c... and many babies require a vitamin K injection after the birth.\u201d</p><p>Suze stares at me, impressed. \u201cWow. How did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know stuff,\u201d I say, pushing the carton out of sight with my foot. \u201cYou see? It\u2019ll be fine!\u201d</p><p>OK, I can do this. I can help Suze. I just have to stay cool and calm and not panic.</p><p>I mean, millions of people give birth every day, don\u2019t they? It\u2019s probably one of those things that sounds really scary but is quite easy when it comes to it. Like a driving test.</p> <p>\u201cOh God.\u201d Suze\u2019s face suddenly contorts. \u201cHere it comes again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK! Hang on!\u201d In a flurry of alarm I scrabble inside one of the plastic bags. \u201cHere you are!\u201d</p><p>Suze opens her eyes dazedly as I produce a smart cellophaned box. \u201cBex \u2014 why are you giving me perfume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said get jasmine oil to help ease the pain,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t find any, so I got Romance by Ralph Lauren instead. It\u2019s got jasmine overtones.\u201d I rip off the packaging and squirt it at her hopefully. \u201cDoes that help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d says Suze. \u201cBut it\u2019s a nice smell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I say, pleased. \u201cAnd because I spent over thirty quid, I got a free beauty bag with exfoliating body mitt and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSt. Christopher\u2019s Hospital,\u201d says the driver suddenly, drawing up in front of a large redbrick building. We both stiffen in alarm and look at each other.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say. \u201cKeep calm, Suze. Don\u2019t panic. Just... wait there.\u201d</p> <p>I open the taxi door, sprint through an entrance marked \u201cMaternity,\u201d and find myself in a reception area with blue upholstered chairs. A couple of women in dressing gowns look up from the magazines they\u2019re reading, but other than that, there are no signs of life.</p><p>For God\u2019s sake. Where is everybody?</p><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s having a baby!\u201d I yell. \u201cQuick, everyone! Get a stretcher! Get a midwife!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d says a woman in white uniform, appearing out of nowhere. \u201cI\u2019m a midwife. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend\u2019s in labor! She needs help immediately!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d says Suze, struggling in through the door with three bags under one arm.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cDon\u2019t move. You should be lying down!

Go with the midwife and I\u2019ll come and find you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d says Suze urgently, suddenly turning round. \u201cWait, Bex!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never made that call.

Here goes.\u201d I take a deep breath as the bleep sounds. \u201cRobyn, this is Becky Bloomwood here... and I\u2019m canceling the wedding. Repeat, I\u2019m canceling the wedding. I\u2019m very sorry for all the inconvenience this is going to cause. I know what a lot you\u2019ve put into it and I can only guess at how angry Elinor will be...\u201d I swallow. \u201cBut I\u2019ve made my final decision \u2014 and it\u2019s that I want to get married at home in England. If you want to talk to me about this, leave a message at my home and I\u2019ll call you back. Otherwise, I guess this is good-bye. And... thanks. It was fun while it lasted.\u201d</p><p>I click off the phone and stare at it, silent in my hand.</p><p>I\u2019ve done it.</p><p>\u201cWell done,\u201d says the midwife to Suze. \u201cThat was a tough one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, Bex,\u201d says Suze, pink in the face. She squeezes my hand and gives me a tiny smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve done the right thing.\u201d She looks at the midwife. \u201cOK. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just go and... get the rest of the stuff,\u201d I say, and walk slowly toward the double doors leading out of the hospital.</p><p>As I step out into the fresh air I can\u2019t help giving a little shiver. So that\u2019s it. No more Plaza wedding. No more enchanted forest. No more magical cake. No more fantasy.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all gone.</p><p>But then... if I\u2019m really honest, it only ever was a fantasy, wasn\u2019t it? It never quite felt like real life.</p><p>This is real life, right here.</p><p>For a few moments I\u2019m silent, letting my thoughts drift, until the sound of an ambulance siren brings me back to the present. Hastily I unload the taxi, pay the driver, then stare at the mound of stuff, wondering how on earth I\u2019m going to get it all inside. And whether I really did need to buy a collapsible playpen.</p><p>\u201cAre you Becky Bloomwood?\u201d A voice interrupts my thoughts and I look up, to see a young midwife standing at the door.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I feel a tremor of alarm. \u201cIs Suze all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine, but her contractions are intensifying now, and we\u2019re still waiting for the anesthetist to arrive... and she\u2019s saying she\u2019d like to try using\u201d\u2014she looks at me puzzledly\u2014\u201cis it... a canoe?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>I can\u2019t even begin to... to... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s seven o\u2019clock in the evening, and I\u2019m completely shattered. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I had no idea it would be so\u2014</p><p>That Suze would be so\u2014</p><p>It took six hours altogether, which is apparently really quick. Well, all I can say is, I wouldn\u2019t like to be one of the slow ones.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. Suze has got a baby boy. A tiny, pink, snuffly baby boy. One hour old.</p> <p>He\u2019s been weighed and measured, and apparently he\u2019s a really healthy size, considering he came early. A nurse has dressed him in the most gorgeous white and blue baby suit and a little white blanket, and now he\u2019s lying in Suze\u2019s arms, all curled up and scrumpled, with tufts of dark hair sticking out over his ears. The baby that Suze and Tarquin made. I almost want to cry... except I\u2019m so elated. It\u2019s the weirdest feeling.</p><p>I meet Suze\u2019s eyes, and she beams euphorically. She\u2019s been beaming ever since he was born, and I\u2019m secretly wondering if they gave her a bit too much laughing gas.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he just perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect.\u201d I touch his tiny fingernail. To think that\u2019s been growing inside Suze, all this time.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d says a nurse, coming into the warm, bright room. \u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks very much,\u201d I say gratefully, stretching out a hand.</p><p>\u201cI meant Mum,\u201d says the nurse, giving me an odd look.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say flusteredly. \u201cYes, of course. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d says Suze. \u201cGive it to Bex. She deserves it.\u201d She gives me an abashed smile. \u201cSorry I got angry with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right.\u201d I bite my lip. \u201cSorry I kept saying, \u2018Does it really hurt?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were great. Seriously, Bex. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome flowers have arrived,\u201d says a midwife, coming in. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had a message from your husband. He\u2019s stuck on the island for the moment because of bad weather, but he\u2019ll be here as soon as he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d says Suze, managing a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>But when the midwife goes out again, her lips begin to tremble. \u201cBex, what am I going to do if Tarkie can\u2019t get back? Mummy\u2019s in Ulan Bator, and Daddy doesn\u2019t know one end of a baby from the other... I\u2019m going to be all on my own...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t!\u201d I quickly put an arm round her. \u201cI\u2019ll look after you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you have to go back to America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to go anywhere. I\u2019ll change my flight and take more vacation days.\u201d I give her a tight hug. \u201cI\u2019m staying here with you for as long as you need me, Suze, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to worry about the wedding any more. Suze, I\u2019m staying with you, and that\u2019s that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Suze\u2019s chin quivers. \u201cThanks, Bex.\u201d She shifts the baby cautiously in her arms, and he gives a little snuffle. \u201cDo you... know anything about babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know anything!\u201d I say confidently. \u201cYou just have to feed them and dress them up in nice clothes and wheel them around the shops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd anyway, just look at little Armani.\u201d I reach into the white bundle of blanket and touch the baby\u2019s cheek fondly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not naming him Armani!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever. He\u2019s an angel! He must be what they call an \u2018easy\u2019 baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is good, isn\u2019t he?\u201d says Suze, pleased. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even cried once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Suze, don\u2019t worry.\u201d I take a sip of tea and smile at her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a blast!\u201d</p><p>FINERMAN WALLSTEIN</p><p>Attorneys at Law</p><p>Finerman House</p><p>1398 Avenue of the Americas</p><p>New York, NY 10105</p><p>Miss Rebecca Bloomwood</p><p>251 W. 11th Street, Apt.

Is that you?\u201d I hear Danny\u2019s voice from above and the sound of his footsteps on the stairs.</p><p>I stare dazedly up, unable to focus. I feel like I\u2019ve run a marathon. No, make that six marathons. The last two weeks has been a blurry jumble of nights and days all run into one. Just me and Suze, and baby Ernest. And the crying.</p> <p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, I adore little Ernie. I mean, I\u2019m going to be his godmother, and everything.</p><p>But... God. That scream of his...</p><p>I just had no idea having a baby was like that. I thought it would be fun.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize Suze would have to feed him every single hour. I didn\u2019t realize he would refuse to go to sleep. Or that he would hate his crib. I mean, it came from the Conran Shop! All lovely beech, with gorgeous white blankets. You\u2019d think he would have loved it! But when we put him in it, all he did was thrash about, going \u201cWaaah!\u201d</p><p>Then I tried to take him shopping \u2014 and when we started out, it was fine. People were smiling at the pram, and smiling at me, and I was starting to feel quite proud of myself. But then we went into Karen Millen, and I was halfway into a pair of leather trousers when he started to yell. Not a cute little whimper. Not a plaintive little wail. A full-throated, piercing \u201cThis Woman Has Kidnapped Me, Call the Cops\u201d scream.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have any bottles or nappies or anything, and I had to run down the Fulham Road, and by the time I got home, I was red in the face and panting and Suze was crying and Ernest was looking at me like I was a mass murderer or something.</p><p>And then, even after he\u2019d been fed, he screamed and screamed all evening...</p><p>\u201cJesus!\u201d says Danny, arriving downstairs in the hall. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>I glance in the mirror and feel a dart of shock. I look pale with exhaustion, my hair is lank and my eyes are drained. Tarquin got home three days ago, and he did do his fair share \u2014 but that didn\u2019t mean I got any sleep. And it didn\u2019t help that when I finally got on the plane to fly home, I was seated next to a woman with six-month-old twins.</p><p>\u201cMy friend Suze had a baby,\u201d I say blearily. \u201cAnd her husband was stuck on an island, so I helped out for a bit...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke said you were on vacation,\u201d says Danny, staring at me in horror. \u201cHe said you were taking a rest!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLuke... has no idea.\u201d</p><p>Every time Luke phoned, I was either changing a nappy, comforting a wailing Ernie, comforting an exhausted Suze \u2014 or flat-out asleep. We did have one brief, disjointed conversation, but in the end Luke suggested I go and lie down, as I wasn\u2019t making much sense.</p><p>Other than that, I haven\u2019t spoken to anyone. Mum called to let me know that Robyn had left a message at the house that I should call her urgently. And I did mean to call back. But every time I had a spare five minutes to myself... somehow I just couldn\u2019t face it. I\u2019ve no idea what\u2019s been going on; what kind of arguments and fallout there\u2019s been. I know Elinor must be furious. I know there\u2019s probably the mother of all rows waiting for me.</p><p>But... I just don\u2019t care. All I care about right now is getting into bed.</p><p>\u201cHey, a bunch of boxes arrived from QVC.\u201d Danny looks at me curiously. \u201cDid you order a set of Marie Osmond dolls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say blankly. \u201cI expect so. I ordered pretty much everything they had.\u201d</p><p>I have a dim memory of myself at three in the morning, rocking Ernest on my lap so Suze could have a sleep, staring groggily at the screen.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how terrible the telly is in Britain at three in the morning?\u201d I rub my dry cheeks. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no point watching a film, because the minute it gets to a good bit, the baby cries and you have to leap up and start joggling him around, singing \u2018Old Macdonald Had a Farm, Ee-I Ee-I Oh...\u2019 and he still doesn\u2019t stop crying. So you have to go into \u2018Oh what a beautiful mooorr-rning...\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t work either...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Danny, backing away. \u201cI\u2019ll... take your word for it. Becky, I think you need a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So do I. See you later.\u201d</p><p>I stumble into the apartment, shove all the post on the sofa, and head for the bedroom, as single-minded as a junkie craving a hit.</p><p>Sleep. I need sleep...</p><p>A light is blinking on our message machine and as I lie down, I automatically reach out and press the button.</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky! Robyn here.

Robyn\u2019s voice chirps exactly the same message again, and the computer display informs me it was left yesterday.</p> <p>But... that doesn\u2019t make any sense. The New York wedding\u2019s off.</p><p>I look disorientedly around the dim apartment. My body clock\u2019s so screwed up, it could be any time at all. I pad into the kitchen for a glass of water and look blearily out of the window at the mural of dancers on the building opposite.</p><p>I canceled the wedding. There were witnesses. Why is Robyn still organizing table centerpieces? I mean, it wasn\u2019t as though I was vague about it.</p><p>What\u2019s happened?</p><p>I drink my water, pour another glass, and go into the living room. It\u2019s 4 P.M. according to the VCR clock, so there\u2019s still time to call her. Find out what\u2019s going on.</p> <p>\u201cHello! Wedding Events Ltd.!\u201d says a girl I don\u2019t recognize. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi! Excuse me, this is Becky Bloomwood. You\u2019re... you were organizing a wedding for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Becky! I\u2019m Kirsten, Robyn\u2019s assistant. Can I just say that I thought your Sleeping Beauty concept was totally inspired? I told all my friends about it, and they were all, like, \u2018I love Sleeping Beauty! That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do when I get married.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Er... thanks. Listen, Kirsten, this might seem like a strange question...\u201d</p><p>How am I going to put this? I can\u2019t say, Is my wedding still on?</p><p>\u201cIs my... wedding still on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI certainly hope so!\u201d says Kirsten with a laugh. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve had a row with Luke!\u201d Her tone suddenly changes. \u201cHave you had a row with Luke? Because we have a procedure if that happens...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I haven\u2019t! It\u2019s just... didn\u2019t you get my message?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich message was that?\u201d says Kirsten brightly.</p><p>\u201cThe message I left about two weeks ago!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. What with the flood...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlood?\u201d I stare at the phone in dismay. \u201cYou had a flood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sure Robyn had called you in England to let you know! It\u2019s OK, nobody was drowned. We just had to evacuate the office for a few days, and some of the telecoms were affected... plus unfortunately an antique ring cushion belonging to one of our clients was ruined...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t get the message?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas it the one about the hors d\u2019oeuvres?\u201d says Kirsten thoughtfully.</p><p>I swallow several times, feeling almost light-headed.</p><p>\u201cBecky, Robyn\u2019s just stepped in,\u201d Kirsten\u2019s saying, \u201cif you\u2019d like to speak to her...\u201d</p><p>No way. I\u2019m not trusting the phone anymore.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell her,\u201d I say, trying to keep calm, \u201cthat I\u2019m coming into the office. Tell her to wait. I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it urgent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s pretty urgent.\u201d</p><p>Robyn\u2019s offices are in a plushy building, right up on Ninety-sixth Street. As I knock on the door, I can hear her gurgling laugh, and as I cautiously open the door, I see her sitting at her desk, champagne glass in one hand, telephone in the other, and an open box of chocolates on the desk.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d she says. \u201cCome in! I won\u2019t be a second! Jennifer, I think we should go with the devore satin. Yes? OK. See you soon.\u201d She puts down the phone and beams at me. \u201cBecky, sweetheart. How are you? How was England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, thanks. Robyn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have just been to a delightful thank-you lunch given to me by Mrs. Herman Winkler at the Carlton. Now, that was a fabulous wedding. The groom gave the bride a schnauzer puppy at the altar! So adorable...\u201d Her brow wrinkles. \u201cWhere was I going with this? Oh yes! You know what? Her daughter and new son-in-law just left for England on their honeymoon! I said to her, perhaps they\u2019ll bump into Becky Bloomwood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobyn, I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. If it\u2019s about the dessert flatware, I\u2019ve spoken to the Plaza\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the flatware!\u201d I cry. \u201cRobyn, listen! While I was England, I canceled the wedding. I left a message! But you didn\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the plushy room.

If you canceled now, you\u2019d be in for a lot of money!\u201d She laughs gaily. \u201cWould you like some champagne?\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, momentarily halted. \u201cWhat do you mean, the prenup?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe contract you signed, sweetheart.\u201d She hands me a glass of champagne, and my fingers automatically close round it.</p><p>\u201cBut... but Luke didn\u2019t sign it.

Or, rather, Wedding Events Ltd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I swallow. \u201cRobyn, what are you talking about? I never signed anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did! All my brides do! I gave it to Elinor to pass along to you, and she returned it to me... I have a copy of it somewhere!\u201d She takes a sip of champagne, swivels on her chair, and reaches into an elegant wooden filing cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cHere we are!\u201d She hands me a photocopy of a document. \u201cOf course, the original is with my lawyer...\u201d</p><p>I stare at the page, my heart pounding. It\u2019s a typed sheet, headed \u201cTerms of Agreement.\u201d I look straight down to the dotted line at the bottom \u2014 and there\u2019s my signature.</p><p>My mind zooms back to that dark, rainy night. Sitting in Elinor\u2019s apartment. Indignantly signing every single sheet in front of me. Not bothering to read the words above.</p><p>Oh God. What have I done?</p><p>Feverishly I start to scan the contract, only half taking in the legal phrases.</p><p>\u201cThe Organizer shall prepare full plans... time frame to be mutually agreed... the Client shall be consulted on all matters... liaise with service providers... budget shall be agreed... final decisions shall rest with the Client... any breach or cancellation for any reason whatsoever... reimbursement... 30 days... full and final payment... Furthermore...\u201d</p> <p>As I read the next words, slugs are crawling up and down my back.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore, in the case of cancellation, should the Client marry within one year of the date of cancellation, the Client will be liable to a penalty of $100,000, payable to Wedding Events Ltd.\u201d</p><p>A hundred-thousand-dollar penalty.</p><p>And I\u2019ve signed it.</p><p>\u201cA hundred thousand dollars?\u201d I say at last. \u201cThat... that seems a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only for the silly girls who pretend to cancel and then get married anyway,\u201d says Robyn cheerily.</p><p>\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, if I plan a wedding, then I want that wedding to happen. We\u2019ve had girls pull out before.\u201d Her voice suddenly hardens. \u201cGirls who decided to go their own way. Girls who decided to use my ideas, my contacts. Girls who thought they could exploit my expertise and get away with it.\u201d She leans forward with glittering eyes, and I shrink back fearfully.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, you don\u2019t want to be those girls.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s crazy. The wedding planner\u2019s crazy.</p><p>\u201cG-good idea,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cYou have to protect yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Elinor could have signed it herself \u2014 but we agreed, this way, she\u2019s protecting her investment too!\u201d Robyn beams at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a neat arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery clever!\u201d I give a shrill laugh and take a slug of champagne.</p><p>What am I going to do? There must be some way out of this. There must be. People can\u2019t force other people to get married. It\u2019s not ethical.</p><p>\u201cCheer up, Becky!\u201d Robyn snaps back into cheery-chirrupy mood. \u201cEverything\u2019s under control. We\u2019ve been taking care of everything while you were in Britain. The invitations are being written as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvitations?\u201d I feel a fresh shock. \u201cBut they can\u2019t be. We haven\u2019t done a guest list yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you have, silly girl! What\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>She presses a couple of buttons on her computer and a list pops up, and I stare at it, my mouth open. Familiar names and addresses are scrolling past on the screen, one after another. Names of my cousins. Names of my old school friends. With a sudden lurch I spot \u201cJanice and Martin Webster, The Oaks, 41 Elton Road, Oxshott.\u201d</p><p>How does Robyn know about Janice and Martin? I feel as though I\u2019ve stumbled into some arch-villainess\u2019s lair. Any minute a panel will slide back and I\u2019ll see Mum and Dad tied to a chair with gags in their mouths. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere... where did you get those names?\u201d I ask, trying to make it sound like a lighthearted inquiry.</p><p>\u201cLuke gave us a list!

I have to post the invitations myself,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s a... a family tradition. The bride always, er... posts her own invitations.\u201d</p><p>I rub my hot face, trying to keep cool.

Of course not! I\u2019ll let Judith know,\u201d says Robyn, picking up the phone and flicking her Rolodex, and I subside, breathing hard.</p> <p>My head is spinning. Too much is happening. While I\u2019ve been closeted with Suze and Ernie, everything has been steaming ahead without me realizing it, and now I\u2019ve completely lost control of the situation. It\u2019s like this wedding is some big white horse that was trotting along quite nicely but has suddenly reared up and galloped off into the distance without me.</p><p>Robyn wouldn\u2019t really sue me. Would she?</p><p>\u201cHi, Judith? Yes, it\u2019s Robyn. Have you... you have? Well, that was quick work!\u201d Robyn looks up. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe this, but she\u2019s already finished them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I look up in horror.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at the mailbox already!

No, I don\u2019t know either.\u201d</p><p>She looks up with a careful smile, as though I\u2019m a tricky three-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m afraid a few already went into the mailbox.

I will. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>As I put my coat on, I can see Robyn and Kirsten exchanging glances.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Becky, you might want to chill out a little,\u201d says Robyn. \u201cEverything\u2019s under control. There\u2019s nothing for you to worry about!\u201d She leans forward cozily. \u201cAs I often say to my brides, when they get a little agitated... it\u2019s just a wedding!\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t even bring myself to reply.</p><p>The mailbox is off the corner of Ninety-third and Lexington. As I turn into the street I can see a woman who must be Judith, dressed in a dark raincoat, leaning against the side of a building. As I hurry toward her, I see her look at her watch, give an impatient shrug, and head toward the mailbox, a stack of envelopes in her hand.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d I yell, increasing my pace to a sprint. \u201cDon\u2019t post those!\u201d</p><p>I arrive by her side, panting so hard I can barely speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me those invitations,\u201d I manage to gasp. \u201cI\u2019m the bride.

THE REALLY vital thing is to keep a sense of proportion. I mean, let\u2019s face it, every wedding has the odd glitch. You can\u2019t expect the whole process to go smoothly. I\u2019ve just bought a new book, called The Realistic Bride, which I\u2019m finding very comforting at the moment. It has a huge chapter all about wedding hitches, and it says: \u201cNo matter how insurmountable the problem seems, there will always be a solution! So don\u2019t worry!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So the example they give is of a bride who loses her satin shoe on the way to the reception. Not one who has arranged two different weddings on the same day on different continents, is hiding half the invitations in a cocktail cabinet, and has discovered her wedding planner is a litigious nutcase.</p><p>But you know, I\u2019m sure the principle\u2019s broadly the same.</p><p>I\u2019ve been back in New York for a week now, and during that time I\u2019ve been to see about seventeen different lawyers about Robyn\u2019s contract. All of them have looked at it carefully, told me they\u2019re afraid it\u2019s watertight, and advised me in the future to read all documentation before signing it.</p><p>Actually, that\u2019s not quite true. One lawyer just said, \u201cSorry, miss, there\u2019s nothing we can do,\u201d as soon as I mentioned that the contract was with Robyn de Bendern. Another said, \u201cGirl, you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d and put the phone down.</p> <p>I can\u2019t believe there isn\u2019t a way out, though. As a last resort, I\u2019ve sent it off to Garson Low, the most expensive lawyer in Manhattan. I read about him in People magazine, and it said he has the sharpest mind in the legal world. It said he can find a loophole in a piece of concrete. So I\u2019m kind of pinning all my hopes on him \u2014 and meanwhile, trying very hard to act normally and not crumple into a gibbering wreck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having lunch with Michael today,\u201d says Luke, coming into the kitchen with a couple of boxes in his arms. \u201cHe seems to have settled into his new place well.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s taken the plunge and moved to New York, which is fantastic for us. He\u2019s working part time as a consultant at Brandon Communications, and the rest of the time, as he put it, he\u2019s \u201creclaiming his life.\u201d He\u2019s taken up painting, and has joined a group that power-walks in Central Park, and last time we saw him he was talking about taking a course in Italian cookery.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHe said we must come over soon...\u201d He peers at me. \u201cBecky, are you all right?\u201d</p> <p>Abruptly I realize I\u2019m drumming a pencil so hard it\u2019s making indentations in the kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely fine,\u201d I say with an overbright smile. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t said a word about anything to Luke. In The Realistic Bride it says the way to stop your fianc\u00e9 from getting bored with wedding details is to feed them to him on a need-to-know basis.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel Luke needs to know anything just yet.</p><p>\u201cA couple more wedding presents,\u201d he says. He dumps the boxes on the counter and grins at me. \u201cIt\u2019s getting closer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Yes it is!\u201d I attempt a laugh, not very successfully.</p> <p>\u201cAnother toaster... this time from Bloomingdale\u2019s.\u201d He frowns. \u201cBecky, exactly how many wedding lists have we got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. A few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the whole point of a wedding list was that we didn\u2019t end up with seven toasters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t got seven toasters!\u201d I point to the box. \u201cThis is a brioche grill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we also have... a Gucci handbag.\u201d He raises his eyebrows quizzically at me. \u201cA Gucci handbag for a wedding present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his-and-hers luggage!\u201d I say defensively. \u201cI put down a briefcase for you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich no one\u2019s bought for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my fault! I don\u2019t tell them what to buy!\u201d</p> <p>Luke shakes his head incredulously. \u201cDid you put down his-and-hers Jimmy Choos too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid someone get the Jimmy Choos?\u201d I say joyfully \u2014 then stop as I see his face. \u201cI\u2019m... joking.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cHere. Look at Suze\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve just had three rolls of film developed, mostly of Suze and Ernie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ernie in the bath...\u201d I point out, handing him photographs. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Ernie asleep... and Suze asleep... and Suze... hang on a minute...\u201d Hastily I pass over the ones of Suze breast-feeding with nothing on except a pair of knickers. She had actually bought a special breast-feeding top from a catalogue, which promised \u201cdiscretion and ease at home and in public.\u201d But she got so pissed off with the stupid concealed zip, she threw it away after one day. \u201cAnd look! That\u2019s the first day we brought him home!\u201d</p><p>Luke sits down at the table, and as he leafs through the pictures, a strange expression comes over his face.</p><p>\u201cShe looks... blissful,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d I agree. \u201cShe adores him. Even when he screams.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey seem bonded already.\u201d He stares at a photo of Suze laughing as Ernie grabs her hair.</p><p>\u201cOh, they are. Even by the time I left, he yelled if I tried to take him away from her.\u201d</p><p>I look at Luke, feeling touched. He\u2019s completely transfixed by these photographs. Which actually quite surprises me. I never thought he\u2019d be particularly into babies. I mean, most men, if you handed them a load of baby pictures\u2014</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any pictures of myself as a tiny baby,\u201d he says, turning to a picture of Ernie peacefully asleep on Suze.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you? Oh well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother took them all with her.\u201d</p><p>His face is unreadable, and tiny alarm bells start to ring inside my head.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say casually. \u201cWell, anyway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she wanted to keep them nearby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say doubtfully. \u201cMaybe she did.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. I should have realized these pictures would set Luke off brooding about his mother again.</p><p>I\u2019m not quite sure what happened between them while I was away. All I know is that eventually Luke managed to get through to her at the clinic. And apparently she came up with some lame explanation for why that newspaper article didn\u2019t mention Luke. Something about the journalist wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether Luke believed her. I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s forgiven her or not. To be honest, I don\u2019t think he knows. Every so often he goes all blank and withdrawn, and I can tell he\u2019s thinking about it.</p><p>Part of me wants to say, \u201cLook, Luke, just forget it! She\u2019s a complete cow and she doesn\u2019t love you and you\u2019re better off without her.\u201d</p><p>Then I remember something his stepmother, Annabel, said \u2014 when we had that chat, all those months ago. As we were saying good-bye, she said, \u201cAs hard as it may be to believe, Luke needs Elinor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t!\u201d I replied indignantly. \u201cHe\u2019s got you, he\u2019s got his dad, he\u2019s got me...\u201d</p><p>But Annabel shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s had this longing for Elinor ever since he was a child. It\u2019s driven him to work so hard; it\u2019s sent him to America; it\u2019s part of who he is now. Like a vine twisted round an apple tree.\u201d And she gave me this rather penetrating look and said, \u201cBe careful, Becky. Don\u2019t try to chop her out of his life. Because you\u2019ll damage him too.\u201d</p><p>How did she read my mind? How did she know that I was exactly picturing myself, and Elinor, and an ax...</p><p>I look at Luke, and he\u2019s staring, mesmerized, at a picture of Suze kissing Ernie on the tummy.</p><p>\u201cAnyway!\u201d I say brightly, gathering up the photos and shoving them back into the envelopes. \u201cYou know, the bond is just as strong between Tarquin and Ernie. You should have seen them together. Tarquin\u2019s making a wonderful dad. He changes nappies and everything! In fact, I often think a mother\u2019s love is overrated...\u201d</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s no good. Luke isn\u2019t even listening.</p><p>The phone rings, and he doesn\u2019t move, so I go into the sitting room to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello. Is that Rebecca Bloomwood?\u201d says a strange man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYes it is,\u201d I say, noticing a new catalogue from Pottery Barn on the table. Perhaps I should register there too. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Garson Low, from Low and Associates.\u201d</p><p>My whole body freezes. Garson Low himself? Calling me at home?</p><p>\u201cI apologize for calling so early,\u201d he\u2019s saying.</p><p>\u201cNo! Not at all!\u201d I say, coming to life and quickly kicking the door shut so Luke can\u2019t hear. \u201cThanks for calling!\u201d</p><p>Thank God. He must think I have a case. He must want to help me take on Robyn. We\u2019ll probably make groundbreaking legal history or something, and stand outside the courtroom while cameras flash and it\u2019ll be like Erin Brockovich!</p><p>\u201cI received your letter yesterday,\u201d says Garson Low. \u201cAnd I was intrigued by your dilemma. That\u2019s quite a bind you\u2019ve got yourself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it is,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your fianc\u00e9 aware of the situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cI\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be able to find a solution first \u2014 and then tell him. You understand, Mr. Low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly do.\u201d</p><p>This is great. We\u2019ve got rapport and everything.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d says Garson Low, \u201clet\u2019s get down to business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I feel a swell of relief. You see, this is what you get when you consult the most expensive lawyer in Manhattan. You get quick results. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFirst of all, the contract has been very cleverly drawn up,\u201d says Garson Low.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nod.</p><p>\u201cThere are several extremely ingenious clauses, covering all eventualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve examined it thoroughly.

I just know I\u2014</p><p>Hang on.</p><p>I saunter casually into the kitchen, where Luke has stopped gazing at the pictures of Suze and is staring broodingly into space instead.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, running a hand along the back of his chair. \u201cHey, Luke.

That\u2019s not necessarily the same as money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I wave my hand impatiently. \u201cAnd we\u2019re getting married. You know, \u2018All thy worldly goods\u2019 and everything. So in a way...\u201d I pause carefully, \u201cit\u2019s mine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeee-s. Is this going anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo... if I asked you for some money, would you give it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect so. How much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... a hundred thousand dollars,\u201d I say, trying to sound nonchalant.</p><p>Luke raises his head. \u201cA hundred thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I mean, it\u2019s not that much really\u2014\u201d</p><p>Luke sighs. \u201cOK, Becky. What have you seen? Because if it\u2019s another customized leather coat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a coat! It\u2019s a... a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred-thousand-dollar surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say after a pause. But even I don\u2019t sound that convinced.</p><p>Maybe this isn\u2019t a brilliant solution after all.</p><p>\u201cBecky, a hundred thousand dollars is that much. It\u2019s a lot of money!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cI know. Look... OK... it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d And I hurry out before he can question me further.</p><p>OK, forget the lawyers. Forget the money. There has to be another solution to this. I just need to think laterally.</p><p>I mean, we could always elope. Get married on a beach and change our names and never see our families again.</p><p>No, this is it. I go to the Oxshott wedding. And Luke goes to the New York wedding. And we each say we\u2019ve been jilted... and then we secretly meet up...</p><p>No! I have it! We hire standins!

People Luke and I barely know. We could get the bride look-alike to wear a really thick veil... and the Luke look-alike could say he\u2019d cut his face shaving, and wear a huge bandage... and meanwhile we\u2019d have flown back to England...</p><p>\u201cWatch out, Becky!\u201d says Christina with a smile, and I look up, startled.

Seeing your mom... catching up with home...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was... great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s admirable the way you\u2019re so laid-back.\u201d Christina takes a sip of coffee. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely mentioned the wedding to any of us since you\u2019ve been back! In fact, you\u2019ve almost seemed to be avoiding the subject!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding it!\u201d I say, my smile fixed. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome brides seem to make so much of a wedding. Almost let it take over their life. But you seem to have it all under control\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely!\u201d I say, even more brightly. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll just get ready for my first client\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I had to switch your appointments around,\u201d says Christina as I open the door of my room. \u201cYou have a first-timer at ten. Amy Forrester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like yellow or orange.\u201d Amy Forrester\u2019s voice is still droning on. \u201cAnd when I say dressy, I mean not too dressy. Just kind of formal... but sexy. You know what I mean?\u201d She snaps her gum and looks at me expectantly.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes!\u201d I say, not having a clue what she\u2019s talking about. I can\u2019t even remember what she wants. Come on, Becky. Concentrate.</p><p>\u201cSo, just to recap, you\u2019re after... an evening dress?\u201d I risk, scribbling on my notebook.</p><p>\u201cOr a pantsuit. Whatever. I can pretty much wear any shape.\u201d Amy Forrester gazes complacently at herself in the mirror, and I give her a surreptitious Manhattan Onceover, taking in her tight lilac top and turquoise stirrup leggings. She looks like a model in an ad for some dodgy piece of home exercise equipment. Same tacky blond haircut and everything.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a wonderful figure!\u201d I say, realizing a bit late that she\u2019s waiting for a compliment.</p><p>\u201cThank you! I do my best.\u201d</p><p>With the help of Rollaflab! Just roll away that flab...</p><p>\u201cI already bought my vacation wardrobe.\u201d She snaps her gum again. \u201cBut then my boyfriend said, why not buy a few more little things? He loves to treat me. He\u2019s a wonderful man. So \u2014 do you have any ideas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, finally forcing myself to concentrate. \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019ll just go and fetch some pieces that I think might suit you.\u201d</p><p>I go out onto the floor and start gathering up dresses. Gradually, as I wander from rail to rail, I begin to relax. It\u2019s a relief to focus on something else; to think about something other than weddings...</p><p>\u201cHi, Becky!\u201d says Erin, passing by with Mrs. Zaleskie, one of her regular clients. \u201cHey, I was just saying to Christina, we have to plan your shower!\u201d</p><p>Oh God.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, my daughter works at the Plaza,\u201d puts in Mrs. Zaleskie. \u201cShe says everyone\u2019s talking about your wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cWell, it\u2019s really no big deal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal? Are you kidding? The staff is fighting over who\u2019s going to serve! They all want to see the enchanted woodland!\u201d She peers at me through her spectacles. \u201cIs it true you\u2019re having a string orchestra, a DJ, and a ten-piece band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friends are so jealous I\u2019m going,\u201d says Erin, her face all lit up. \u201cThey\u2019re like, you have to show us the pictures afterward!

I\u2019ve been in trouble before. I\u2019ve been stupid before. But never on this level. Never so large, so expensive, so important...</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d says Amy, staring at herself critically. \u201cBut is there enough cleavage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr...\u201d I look at her. It\u2019s a black chiffon dress, slashed practically to the navel. \u201cI think so. But we could always have it altered...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t have time for that!\u201d says Amy. \u201cI\u2019m only in New York for one more day. We go on vacation tomorrow and then we\u2019re moving to Atlanta. That\u2019s why I came out shopping. They\u2019re packing up the apartment and it\u2019s driving me nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I say absently.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend adores my body,\u201d she says smugly as she clambers out of it. \u201cBut then, his wife never bothered with her appearance at all. Ex-wife, I should say. They\u2019re getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say politely, handing her a white and silver sheath dress.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he put up with her for so long. She\u2019s this completely jealous harridan. I\u2019m having to take legal action!\u201d Amy steps into the sheath dress. \u201cYou know, she mailed me this really offensive letter. It was like a list of completely insulting stuff about me! Our lawyer says we have an excellent case.\u201d</p> <p>That sounds familiar. I look up, my brain starting to tweak. \u201cYou\u2019re sure it was her who sent it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes! I mean, she signed it and everything. Plus it was definitely her writing. William recognized it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her, my skin prickling. \u201cWhat... what did you say your boyfriend\u2019s name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam.\u201d Her lip curls scornfully. \u201cShe called him Bill.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>It is. It\u2019s the blond intern. Right here in front of me.</p> <p>OK. Just... keep smiling. Don\u2019t let her know you suspect anything.</p><p>Inside I\u2019m hot with outrage. This is the woman Laurel was cast aside for? This stupid, tacky airhead?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re moving to Atlanta,\u201d Amy says, examining her reflection complacently. \u201cWe want to start a new life together, so William asked the firm for a transfer. You know, discreetly. We don\u2019t want the old witch following us.\u201d She frowns. \u201cNow, I like this one better.\u201d</p><p>She bends down farther and I freeze. Hang on. She\u2019s wearing a pendant. A pendant with a... is that green stone an emerald?</p><p>\u201cAmy, I just have to make a call,\u201d I say casually. \u201cKeep trying on the dresses!\u201d And I slide out of the room.</p><p>When I eventually get through to Laurel\u2019s office, her assistant, Gina, tells me she\u2019s in a meeting with American Airlines and can\u2019t be disturbed.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I say. \u201cGet her out. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is American Airlines,\u201d says Gina. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t understand! It really is crucial!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, a new skirt length from Prada is not crucial,\u201d says Gina a little wearily. \u201cNot in the world of airplane leasing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clothes!\u201d I say indignantly \u2014 then hesitate for a second, wondering how much Laurel confides in Gina. \u201cIt\u2019s Amy Forrester,\u201d I say at last in a lowered voice. \u201cYou know who I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d says Gina in a voice that makes me thinks she knows even more than I do. \u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have her? What do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in my fitting room right now!\u201d I glance behind me to make sure no one can hear. \u201cGina, she\u2019s wearing this pendant with an emerald in it! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s Laurel\u2019s grandmother\u2019s! The one the police couldn\u2019t find.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Gina at last. \u201cI\u2019ll get Laurel out of the meeting.

Then I head back to my fitting room, trying to look as natural as possible.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d I say breezily as I go in. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to trying on dresses! And remember, Amy, just take your time over each one. As long as you like. We can take all day, if we need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to try on any more,\u201d says Amy, turning round in a tight red sequined dress. \u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say blankly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great!

You have a very good eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!

Or... or this halter neck...\u201d</p><p>Amy Forrester gives me an impatient look. \u201cI\u2019m taking this one. Please, will you help me out of it?\u201d</p><p>What can I do? I can\u2019t force her to stay.</p> <p>I glance surreptitiously at my watch. Laurel\u2019s office is only a block or two away.

She\u2019s trapped! The stiff red fabric covers her face completely, but the rest of her is clad only in underwear and high heels. She looks like a Barbie doll crossed with a Christmas cracker.</p><p>\u201cHey. It\u2019s gotten stuck.\u201d She waves one of her arms fruitlessly, but it\u2019s pinned to her head by the dress.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I exclaim innocently. \u201cOh dear. They do that sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get me out!\u201d She takes a couple of steps, and I back away nervously in case she grabs my arm. I feel like I\u2019m six years old and playing blindman\u2019s bluff at a birthday party.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d comes a furious muffled voice. \u201cGet me out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just... trying to...\u201d Gingerly I give a little tug at the dress. \u201cIt\u2019s really stuck,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cMaybe if you bent over and wriggled...\u201d</p><p>Come on, Laurel. Where are you? I open my fitting room and have a quick glance out, but nothing.</p> <p>\u201cOK! I\u2019m getting somewhere!\u201d</p><p>I look up and feel a plunge of dismay. Amy\u2019s hand has appeared out of nowhere and somehow she\u2019s managed to grasp the zip with two manicured nails. \u201cCan you help me pull the zipper down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm... I can try...\u201d</p><p>I take hold of the zip and start pulling it in the opposite direction from the way she\u2019s tugging.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stuck!\u201d she says in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019m trying to get it undone...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Her voice is suddenly suspicious. \u201cWhich way are you pulling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... the same way as you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Laurel,\u201d I suddenly hear Christina saying in surprise. \u201cAre you all right?

And there\u2019s Laurel, cheeks flushed with animation, wearing her new Michael Kors skirt with a navy blue blazer, which looks completely wrong.</p><p>How many times have I told her? Honestly, I should do more spot-checks on my clients. Who knows what they\u2019re all wearing out there?</p><p>\u201cHere she is,\u201d I say, nodding toward the Barbie-doll-Christmas-cracker hybrid, who is still trying to unzip the dress.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d says Laurel, coming into the fitting room. \u201cYou can leave her to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?

If I manage to dodge one, I\u2019ll only get hit by the other.</p><p>I stare at Laurel\u2019s warm, open face, and all I want to do is bury my head in her shoulder and wail, \u201cSort out my life for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want,\u201d says Laurel again, and squeezes my shoulders.</p><p>As I walk slowly back to my fitting room, the adrenaline has gone. I can feel a familiar, wearying anxiety creeping over me. Another day has gone by, and I\u2019m no nearer to a brilliant solution. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do. And I\u2019m running out of time.</p><p>Maybe the truth is, I can\u2019t solve this on my own, I think, sinking heavily down in my chair. Maybe I need help. Fire rescue trucks and SWAT teams.</p><p>Or maybe just Luke.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>AS I ARRIVE home, I\u2019m surprisingly calm. In fact, I almost feel a sense of relief. I\u2019ve tried everything \u2014 and now I\u2019m at the end of the line. There\u2019s nothing else I can do but confess everything to Luke. He\u2019ll be shocked. Angry too. But at least he\u2019ll know.</p><p>I stopped in a caf\u00e9 on the way, had a coffee, and thought very carefully about how I was going to tell him. Because everyone knows, it\u2019s all in the presentation. When the president\u2019s going to raise taxes, he doesn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m going to raise taxes.\u201d He says, \u201cEvery American citizen knows the value of education.\u201d So I\u2019ve written out a speech, a bit like the State of the Union address, and I\u2019ve memorized it word for word, with gaps for interjections from Luke. (Or applause. Though that\u2019s a bit unlikely.) As long as I stick to my text, and no one brings up the question of Ugandan policy, then we should be all right.</p><p>My legs are trembling slightly as I climb the stairs to our apartment, even though Luke won\u2019t be back yet; I still have time to prepare. But as I open the door, to my shock, there he is, sitting at the table with a pile of papers and his back to me.</p><p>OK, Becky, come on. Ladies and gentlemen of Congress. Four score and thingummy. I let the door swing shut behind me, get out my notes, and take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I begin in a grave, grown-up voice. \u201cI have something to tell you about the wedding. It\u2019s quite a serious problem, with no easy solution. If there is a solution, it will be one that I can only achieve with your help. Which is why I\u2019m telling you this now \u2014 and asking that you listen with an open mind.\u201d</p><p>So far so good. I\u2019m quite proud of that bit, actually. The \u201clisten with an open mind\u201d bit was especially inspired, because it means he can\u2019t shout at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn order to explain my current predicament,\u201d I continue, \u201cI must take you back in time. Back to the beginning. By which I mean not the creation of Earth. Nor even the big bang. But tea at Claridges.\u201d</p><p>I pause \u2014 but Luke is still silent, listening. Maybe this is going to be OK.</p><p>\u201cIt was there, at Claridges, that my problem began. I was presented with an impossible task. I was, if you will, that Greek god having to choose between the three apples. Except there were only two \u2014 and they weren\u2019t apples.\u201d I pause significantly. \u201cThey were weddings.\u201d</p><p>At last, Luke turns round in his chair. His eyes are bloodshot, and there\u2019s a strange expression on his face. As he gazes at me, I feel a tremor of apprehension.</p> <p>\u201cBecky,\u201d he says, as though with a huge effort.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I gulp.</p><p>\u201cDo you think my mother loves me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, thrown.</p><p>\u201cTell me honestly. Do you think my mother loves me?\u201d</p> <p>Hang on. Has he been listening to a single word I\u2019ve been saying?</p><p>\u201cEr... of course I do!\u201d I say. \u201cAnd speaking of mothers, that is, in a sense, where my problem originally lay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a fool.\u201d Luke picks up his glass and takes a swig of what looks like whiskey. \u201cShe\u2019s just been using me, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, discomfited \u2014 then notice the half-empty bottle on the table. How long has he been sitting here? I look at his face again, taut and vulnerable, and bite back some of the things I could say about Elinor.</p><p>\u201cOf course she loves you!\u201d I put down my speech and go over to him. \u201cI\u2019m sure she does. I mean, you can see it, in the way she... um...\u201d I tail off feebly.</p><p>What am I supposed to say? In the way she uses your staff with no recompense or thanks? In the way she stabs you in the back, then disappears to Switzerland?</p> <p>\u201cWhat... why are you...\u201d I say hesitantly. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI came across something earlier on.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cI was at her apartment to pick up some papers for the foundation. And I don\u2019t know why \u2014 maybe it was after seeing those photographs of Suze and Ernie this morning.\u201d He looks up. \u201cBut I found myself searching in her study for old pictures. Of me as a child. Of us. I don\u2019t really know what I was looking for. Anything, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d</p><p>Luke gestures to the papers littering the table and I squint puzzledly at one. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re letters. From my father. Letters he wrote to my mother after they split up, fifteen, twenty years ago. Pleading with her to see me.\u201d His voice is deadpan and I look at him warily.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that he begged her to let me visit,\u201d says Luke evenly. \u201cHe offered to pay hotel bills. He offered to accompany me. He asked again and again... and I never knew.\u201d He reaches for a couple of sheets and hands them to me. \u201cLook, read for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Trying to hide my shock, I start to scan them, taking in phrases here and there.</p> <p>Luke is so desperate to see his mother... cannot understand your attitude...</p><p>\u201cThese letters explain a lot of things. It turns out her new husband wasn\u2019t against her taking me with them, after all. In fact, he sounds like a pretty decent guy. He agreed with my dad, I should come and visit. But she wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cWhy should she be, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>... an intelligent loving boy... missing out on a wonderful opportunity...</p><p>\u201cLuke, that\u2019s... terrible,\u201d I say inadequately.</p><p>\u201cThe worst thing is, I used to take it all out on my parents. When I was a teenager. I used to blame them.\u201d</p><p>I have a sudden vision of Annabel, and her kind, warm face; of Luke\u2019s dad, writing these letters in secret \u2014 and feel a pang of outrage toward Elinor. She doesn\u2019t deserve Luke. She doesn\u2019t deserve any family.</p><p>There\u2019s silence except for the rain drumming outside. I reach out and squeeze Luke\u2019s hand, trying to inject as much love and warmth as I can.</p><p>\u201cLuke, I\u2019m sure your parents understood. And...\u201d I swallow all the things I really want to say about Elinor. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Elinor wanted you to be there really. I mean, maybe it was difficult for her at the time, or... or maybe she was away a lot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve never told you,\u201d interrupts Luke. \u201cOr anybody.\u201d He raises his head. \u201cI came to see my mother when I was fourteen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stare at him in astonishment. \u201cBut I thought you said you never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a school trip to New York. I fought tooth and nail to go on it. Mum and Dad were against it, of course, but in the end they gave in. They told me my mother was away, that, of course, otherwise, she would have loved to see me.\u201d</p><p>Luke reaches for the whiskey bottle and pours himself another drink. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, I had to try and see her. Just in case they were wrong.\u201d He stares ahead, running his finger round the rim of his glass. \u201cSo... toward the end of the trip, we had a free day. Everyone else went up the Empire State Building. But I sneaked off. I had her address, and I just came and sat outside her building. It wasn\u2019t the building she\u2019s in now, it was another one, farther up Park Avenue. I sat on a step, and people kept staring at me as they went by, but I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He takes a gulp of his drink and I gaze back at him, rigid. I don\u2019t dare make a sound. I hardly dare breathe.</p> <p>\u201cThen, at about twelve o\u2019clock, a woman came out. She had dark hair, and a beautiful coat. I knew her face from the photograph. It was my mother.\u201d He\u2019s silent for a few seconds. \u201cI... I stood up. She looked up and saw me. She stared at me for less than five seconds. Then she turned away. It was as though she hadn\u2019t seen me. She got into a taxi and went off, and that was it.\u201d He closes his eyes briefly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a chance to take a step forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat... what did you do?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI left. And I walked around the city. I persuaded myself that she hadn\u2019t recognized me. That\u2019s what I told myself. That she had no idea what I looked like; that she couldn\u2019t possibly have known it was me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s true!\u201d I say eagerly. \u201cHow on earth would she have\u2014\u201d</p><p>I fall silent as he reaches for a faded blue airmail letter with something paper-clipped to it at the top.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the letter my father wrote her to tell her I was coming,\u201d he says. He lifts up the paper and I feel a small jolt. \u201cAnd this is me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m looking into the eyes of a teenaged boy. A fourteen-year-old Luke. He\u2019s wearing a school uniform and he has a terrible haircut; in fact he\u2019s barely recognizable. But those are his dark eyes, gazing out at the world with a mixture of determination and hope.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing I can say. As I stare at his gawky, awkward face, I want to cry.</p><p>\u201cYou were right all along, Becky. I came to New York to impress my mother. I wanted her to stop dead in the street and turn round and... and stare... and be proud...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is proud of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t.\u201d He gives me a tiny half-smile. \u201cI should just give up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, a little too late. I reach out and take Luke\u2019s arm, feeling completely helpless. Completely sheltered and pampered in comparison. I grew up knowing that Mum and Dad thought I was the best thing in the whole wide world; knowing that they loved me, and always would, whatever I did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Luke at last. \u201cI\u2019ve gone on too much about this. Let\u2019s forget it. What did you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say at once. \u201cIt... doesn\u2019t matter. It can wait.\u201d</p><p>The wedding seems a million miles away, suddenly. I screw up my notes into a tight ball and throw them in the bin. Then I look around the cluttered room. Letters spread out on the table, wedding presents stacked up in the corner, paraphernalia everywhere. It\u2019s impossible to escape your own life when you live in a Manhattan apartment.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out and eat,\u201d I say, standing up abruptly. \u201cAnd see a movie or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. This is place is just too... crowded.\u201d I take Luke\u2019s hand and tug at it. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here. And just forget about everything. All of it.\u201d</p><p>We go out and walk, arm in arm, down to the cinema and lose ourselves in a movie about the Mafia. Then when it\u2019s over we walk a couple of blocks to a small, warm restaurant we know, and order red wine and risotto.</p> <p>We don\u2019t mention Elinor once. Instead, we talk about Luke\u2019s childhood in Devon. He tells me about picnics on the beach, and a tree house his father built for him in the garden, and how his little half-sister Zoe always used to tag along with all her friends and drive him mad. Then he tells me about Annabel. About how fantastic she\u2019s always been to him, and how kind she is to everyone; and how he never ever felt she loved him any less than Zoe, who was truly hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We talk tentatively about things we\u2019ve never even touched on. Like having children ourselves. Luke wants to have three. I want... well after having watched Suze go through labor, I don\u2019t think I want any, but I don\u2019t tell him that. I nod when he says \u201cor perhaps even four\u201d and wonder whether maybe I could pretend to be pregnant and secretly adopt them.</p><p>By the end of the evening, I think Luke is a lot better. We walk home and fall into bed and both go straight to sleep. During the night I half wake, and I think I see Luke standing by the window, staring out into the night. But I\u2019m asleep again before I\u2019m sure.</p><p>I wake up the next morning with a dry mouth and an aching head. Luke\u2019s already got up and I can hear clattering from the kitchen, so maybe he\u2019s making me a nice breakfast. I could do with some coffee, and maybe some toast. And then...</p><p>My stomach gives a nervous flip. I\u2019ve got to bite the bullet. I\u2019ve got to tell him about the weddings.</p> <p>Last night was last night. Of course I couldn\u2019t do anything about it then. But now it\u2019s the morning and I can\u2019t wait any longer. I know it\u2019s terrible timing, I know it\u2019s the last thing he\u2019ll want to hear right now. But I just have to tell him.</p><p>I can hear him coming along the corridor, and I take a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves.</p><p>\u201cLuke, listen,\u201d I say as the door swings open. \u201cI know this is a bad time. But I really need to talk to you. We\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d says Robyn, coming into the room. \u201cNothing to do with the wedding, I hope!\u201d She\u2019s wearing a powder-blue suit and patent leather pumps and carrying a tray of breakfast things. \u201cHere you go, sweetheart. Some coffee to wake you up!\u201d</p><p>Am I dreaming? What\u2019s Robyn doing in my bedroom?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get the muffins,\u201d she says brightly, and disappears out of the room. I subside weakly onto my pillow, my head pounding, trying to work out what she might be doing here.</p><p>Suddenly last night\u2019s Mafia film jumps into my mind and I\u2019m struck with terror. Oh my God. It\u2019s obvious.</p><p>She\u2019s found out about the other wedding \u2014 and she\u2019s come to murder me.</p><p>Robyn appears through the door again, with a basket of muffins, and smiles as she puts it down. I stare back, transfixed with fear.</p><p>\u201cRobyn!\u201d I say huskily. \u201cI... didn\u2019t expect to see you. Isn\u2019t it a bit... early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to my clients, there is no such thing as too early,\u201d says Robyn, with a twinkle. \u201cI am at your service, day and night.\u201d She sits down on the armchair next to the bed and pours me out a cup of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cBut how did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked the lock. Only kidding! Luke let me in on his way out!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m alone in the apartment with her. She\u2019s got me trapped.</p><p>\u201cLuke\u2019s gone to work already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he was going to work.\u201d Robyn pauses thoughtfully. \u201cIt looked more like he was going jogging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJogging?\u201d</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t jog.</p><p>\u201cNow, drink up your coffee \u2014 and then I\u2019ll show you what you\u2019ve been waiting for. What we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\u201d She looks at her watch. \u201cI have to be gone in twenty minutes, remember!\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her dumbly.</p><p>\u201cBecky, are you all right? You do remember we have an appointment?\u201d</p><p>Dimly a memory starts filtering back into my mind, like a shadow through gauze. Robyn. Breakfast meeting. Oh yes.</p><p>Why did I agree to a breakfast meeting?</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember!\u201d I say at last. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit... you know, hung over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain!\u201d says Robyn cheerily. \u201cFresh orange juice is what you need. And a good breakfast. I say the same thing to all my brides: you must take care of yourself! There\u2019s no point starving yourself and then fainting at the altar. Have a muffin.\u201d She rummages in her bag. \u201cAnd look! At last we have it!\u201d</p><p>I look blankly at the scrap of shimmering silver material she\u2019s holding up.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the fabric for the cushion pads!\u201d says Robyn. \u201cFlown in especially from China. The one we had all the problems with over customs! You can\u2019t have forgotten, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! No, of course not,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cYes, it looks... lovely. Really beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Becky, there was something else,\u201d says Robyn. She puts the fabric away and looks up with a serious expression. \u201cThe truth is... I\u2019m getting a little concerned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel a fresh spasm of nerves and take a sip of coffee to hide it. \u201cReally? What... what are you concerned about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a single reply from your British guests. Isn\u2019t that strange?\u201d</p><p>For a moment I\u2019m unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes,\u201d I manage at last. \u201cVery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcept Luke\u2019s parents, who accepted a while ago.

This is good, if I do say so myself! Now, I don\u2019t want to accuse anyone of lacking manners. But we need to start getting some numbers in. So is it OK if I make a few tactful calls to England? I have all the phone numbers in my database...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say, suddenly waking up. \u201cDon\u2019t call anybody! I mean... you\u2019ll get the replies, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just so odd!\u201d Robyn muses. \u201cTo have heard nothing...

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just an oversight.\u201d I start pleating the sheet between finger and thumb. \u201cYou\u2019ll have some replies within a week.

Before she finds anything else.</p><p>Abruptly I throw back the sheets and leap out of bed.</p> <p>\u201cActually, Robyn, I\u2019m still not feeling quite right. Maybe we could... could reschedule the rest of this meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She pats my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d I say casually as we reach the front door. \u201cI was just wondering... You know that financial penalty clause in your contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Robyn beams at me.</p><p>\u201cOut of interest.\u201d I give a little laugh. \u201cHave you ever actually collected it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, only a few times!\u201d says Robyn. She pauses reminiscently. \u201cOne silly girl tried to run off to Poland... but we found her in the end... See you, Becky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you!\u201d I say, matching her bright tone, and close the door, my heart thumping hard.</p><p>She\u2019ll get me. It\u2019s only a matter of time.</p><p>As soon as I get to work, I call Luke at work and get his assistant, Julia.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, \u201ccan I speak to Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke called in sick,\u201d says Julia, sounding surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>I stare at the phone, taken aback. Luke\u2019s taken a sickie? Blimey. Maybe his hangover was even worse than mine.</p><p>Shit, and I\u2019ve nearly given the game away.</p><p>\u201cOh, right!\u201d I say quickly. \u201cYes! Now you mention it... of course I knew! He\u2019s dreadfully sick, actually. He\u2019s got a terrible fever. And his... er... stomach. I just forgot for a moment, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, give him all the best from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will!\u201d</p><p>As I put the phone down, I realize I might have overreacted a teeny bit. I mean, it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to give Luke the sack, is it? After all, it\u2019s his company.</p><p>In fact, I\u2019m pleased he\u2019s having a day off.</p><p>But still. Luke getting sick. He never gets sick.</p><p>And he never jogs. What\u2019s going on?</p><p>I\u2019m supposed to be going out for a drink after work with Erin, but I make an excuse and hurry home instead. When I let myself in, the apartment\u2019s dim, and for a moment I think Luke isn\u2019t back. But then I see him, sitting at the table in the gloom, wearing track pants and an old sweatshirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last.

I called your work and they said you were ill.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the right frame of mind to go to work,\u201d says Luke at last.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do all day? Did you really go jogging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went for a long walk,\u201d says Luke. \u201cAnd I thought a great deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout... your mother?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>\u201cYes. About my mother. About a lot of other things too.\u201d He turns for the first time and to my surprise I see he hasn\u2019t shaved. Mmm. I quite like him unshaven, actually.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the question,\u201d he says after a pause. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably just drank a bit too much last night.\u201d I take off my coat, marshaling my words. \u201cLuke, listen. There\u2019s something really important I need to tell you. I\u2019ve been putting it off for weeks now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, have you ever thought about the grid of Manhattan?\u201d says Luke, interrupting me. \u201cReally thought about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no,\u201d I say, momentarily halted. \u201cI can\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like... a metaphor for life. You think you have the freedom to walk anywhere. But in fact...\u201d He draws a line with his finger on the table. \u201cYou\u2019re strictly controlled. Up or down. Left or right. No other options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cAbsolutely. The thing is, Luke\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLife should be an open space, Becky. You should be able to walk in whichever direction you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked from one end of the island to the other today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I stare at him. \u201cEr... why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked up at one point, and I was surrounded by office blocks. Sunlight was bouncing off the plate-glass windows. Reflected backward and forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d I say inadequately.</p><p>\u201cDo you see what I\u2019m saying?\u201d He fixes me with an intense stare, and I suddenly notice the purple shadows beneath his eyes. God, he looks exhausted. \u201cThe light enters Manhattan... and becomes trapped. Trapped in its own world, bouncing backward and forward with no escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes, I suppose. Except... sometimes it rains, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd people are the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the world we\u2019re living in now. Self-reflecting. Self-obsessed. Ultimately pointless. Look at that guy in the hospital. Thirty-three years old \u2014 and he has a heart attack. What if he\u2019d died? Would he have had a fulfilled life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I had a fulfilled life? Be honest, Becky. Look at me, and tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... um... of course you have!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d He picks up a nearby Brandon Communications press release and gazes at it. \u201cThis is what my life has been about. Meaningless pieces of information.\u201d To my shock, he starts to rip it up. \u201cMeaningless fucking bits of paper.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I notice he\u2019s tearing up our joint bank statement too.</p><p>\u201cLuke! That\u2019s our bank statement!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? What does it matter? It\u2019s only a few pointless numbers. Who cares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but...\u201d</p><p>Something is wrong here.</p><p>\u201cWhat does any of it matter?\u201d He scatters the shreds of paper on the floor, and I force myself not to bend down and pick any of them up. \u201cBecky, you\u2019re so right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right?\u201d I say in alarm.</p><p>Something is very wrong here.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all too driven by materialism. With success. With money. With trying to impress people who\u2019ll never be impressed, whatever you...\u201d He breaks off, breathing hard. \u201cIt\u2019s humanity that matters. We should know homeless people. We should know Bolivian peasants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... yes,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cBut still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you said a while back has been going round and round in my head all day. And now I can\u2019t forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I say nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou said...\u201d He pauses, as though trying to get the words just right. \u201cYou said that we\u2019re on this planet for too short a time.

Knowing that a few meaningless figures balanced \u2014 or knowing that you were the person you wanted to be?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I gape at him.\u201cBut... but that was just stuff I made up!

Unfortunately they must decline, as their dog has just died.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>THIS IS GETTING beyond a joke. Luke hasn\u2019t been to work for over a week. Nor has he shaved. He keeps going out and wandering around God knows where and not coming home until the early hours of the morning. And yesterday I arrived back from work to find he\u2019d given away half his shoes to people on the street.</p><p>I feel so helpless. Nothing I do seems to work. I\u2019ve tried making him bowls of nourishing, homemade soup. (At least, it says they\u2019re nourishing and homemade on the can.) I\u2019ve tried making warm, tender love to him. Which was great as far as it went. (And that was pretty far, as it happens.) He seemed better for a little while \u2014 but in the end it didn\u2019t change anything. Afterward, he was just the same, all moody and staring into space.</p><p>The thing I\u2019ve tried the most is just sitting down and talking to him. Sometimes I really think I\u2019m getting somewhere. But then he either just reverts back into depression, or says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d and goes out again. The real trouble is, nothing he says seems to be making any sense. One minute he says he wants to quit his company and go into politics, that\u2019s where his heart lies and he should never have sold out. (Politics? He\u2019s never mentioned politics before.) The next moment he\u2019s saying fatherhood is all he\u2019s ever wanted, let\u2019s have six children and he\u2019ll stay at home and be a house-husband.</p><p>Meanwhile his assistant keeps phoning every day to see if Luke\u2019s better, and I\u2019m having to invent more and more lurid details. He\u2019s practically got the plague by now.</p><p>I\u2019m so desperate, I phoned Michael this morning and he\u2019s promised to come over and see if he can do anything. If anyone can help, Michael can.</p><p>And as for the wedding...</p><p>I feel ill every time I think about it. It\u2019s three weeks away. I still haven\u2019t come up with a solution.</p><p>Mum calls me every morning and somehow I speak perfectly normally to her. Robyn calls me every afternoon and somehow I also speak perfectly normally to her. I even made a joke recently about not turning up on the day. We laughed, and Robyn quipped, \u201cI\u2019ll sue you!\u201d and I managed not to sob hysterically.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m in free fall. Plummeting toward the ground without a parachute.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019ve slipped into a whole new zone, beyond normal panic, beyond normal solutions. It\u2019s going to take a miracle to save me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which is basically what I\u2019m pinning my hopes on now. I\u2019ve lit fifty candles at St. Thomas\u2019s, and fifty more at St. Patrick\u2019s, and I\u2019ve put up a petition on the prayer board at the synagogue on Sixty-fifth, and given flowers to the Hindu god Ganesh. Plus a group of people in Ohio who I found on the Internet are all praying hard for me.</p><p>At least, they\u2019re praying that I find happiness following my struggle with alcoholism. I couldn\u2019t quite bring myself to explain the full two-weddings story to Father Gilbert, especially after I read his sermon on how deceit is as painful to the Lord as is the Devil gouging out the eyes of the righteous. So I went with alcoholism, because they already had a page on that.</p><p>There\u2019s no respite. I can\u2019t even relax at home. The apartment feels like it\u2019s closing in on me. There are wedding presents in huge cardboard boxes lining every room. Mum sends about fifty faxes a day, Robyn\u2019s taken to popping in whenever she feels like it, and there\u2019s a selection of veils and headdresses in the sitting room that Dream Dress sent to me without even asking.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d I look up from my breakfast coffee to see Danny wandering into the kitchen. \u201cThe door was open. Not at work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He reaches for a piece of cinnamon toast and takes a bite. \u201cSo, how\u2019s the patient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d For a moment Danny looks genuinely concerned, and I feel myself unbend a little. \u201cHas Luke snapped out of it yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I admit, and his eyes brighten.</p> <p>\u201cSo are there any more items of clothing going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cThere aren\u2019t. And don\u2019t think you can keep those shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrand-new Pradas? You must be kidding! They\u2019re mine. Luke gave them to me. If he doesn\u2019t want them anymore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does. He will. He\u2019s just... a bit stressed at the moment. Everyone gets stressed! It doesn\u2019t mean you can take their shoes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody gets stressed. Everybody doesn\u2019t give away hundred-dollar bills to total strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I look up anxiously. \u201cHe did that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw him at the subway. There was a guy there with long hair, carrying a guitar... Luke just went up to him and handed him a wad of money. The guy wasn\u2019t even begging. In fact, he looked pretty offended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know my theory? He needs a nice, long, relaxing honeymoon. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>Oh no. Into free fall again. The honeymoon. I haven\u2019t even booked one yet. How can I? I don\u2019t know which bloody airport we\u2019ll be flying out of.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re... it\u2019s a surprise,\u201d I say at last. \u201cWe\u2019ll announce it on the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you cooking?\u201d Danny looks at the stove, where a pot is bubbling away. \u201cTwigs? Mm, tasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Chinese herbs. For stress. You boil them up and then drink the liquid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019ll get Luke to drink this?\u201d Danny prods the mixture.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not for Luke. They\u2019re for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you? What have you got to be stressed about?\u201d The buzzer sounds and Danny reaches over and presses the entry button without even asking who it is.</p><p>\u201cDanny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExpecting anyone?\u201d he says as he replaces the receiver.</p><p>\u201cOh, just that mass murderer who\u2019s been stalking me,\u201d I say sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Danny takes another bite of cinnamon toast. \u201cI always wanted to see someone get murdered.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door, and I get up to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d change into something snappier,\u201d says Danny. \u201cThe courtroom will see pictures of you in that outfit. You want to look your best.\u201d</p><p>I open the door, expecting yet another delivery man. But it\u2019s Michael, wearing a yellow cashmere jumper and a big smile. My heart lifts in relief just at the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cMichael!\u201d I exclaim, and give him a hug. \u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been here sooner if I\u2019d realized how bad it was,\u201d says Michael. He raises his eyebrows. \u201cI was in at the Brandon Communications offices yesterday, and I heard Luke was sick. But I had no idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, I haven\u2019t exactly been spreading the news. I thought it would just blow over in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is Luke here?\u201d Michael peers into the apartment.</p><p>\u201cNo, he went out early this morning. I don\u2019t know where.\u201d I shrug helplessly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive him my love when he comes back,\u201d says Danny, heading out of the door. \u201cAnd remember, I\u2019ve got dibs on his Ralph Lauren coat.\u201d</p><p>I make a fresh pot of coffee (decaffeinated \u2014 that\u2019s all Michael\u2019s allowed these days) and stir the herbs dubiously, then we pick our way through the clutter of the sitting room to the sofa.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he says, removing a stack of magazines and sitting down. \u201cLuke\u2019s feeling the strain a little.\u201d He watches as I pour the milk with a trembling hand. \u201cBy the looks of things, you are too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m OK,\u201d I say quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s Luke.

I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve seen this coming for a while,\u201d says Michael, taking his coffee from me. \u201cThat man of yours pushes himself too hard.

He won\u2019t go to work, he won\u2019t talk about it, Elinor\u2019s still in Switzerland, his colleagues keep ringing up to ask how he is, and I don\u2019t want to say, \u2018Actually, Luke can\u2019t come to the phone, he\u2019s having a midlife crisis right now...\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going in to the office today.

He\u2019s very able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he be OK, though?\u201d I look at Michael fearfully. \u201cHe won\u2019t rip Luke off?\u201d</p> <p>The last time Luke took his eye off his company for more than three minutes, Alicia Bitchface Billington tried to poach all his clients and sabotage the entire enterprise. It was nearly the end of Brandon Communications.</p><p>\u201cGary will be fine,\u201d says Michael reassuringly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not doing much at the moment. I can keep tabs on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say in horror. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t work too hard! You must take it easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I\u2019m not an invalid!\u201d says Michael with a tinge of annoyance. \u201cYou and my daughter are as bad as each other.\u201d</p><p>The phone rings, and I leave it to click onto the machine.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are the wedding preparations going?\u201d says Michael, glancing around the room.</p><p>\u201cOh... fine!\u201d I smile brightly at him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a call from your wedding planner about the rehearsal dinner. She told me your parents won\u2019t be able to make it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cNo, they won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. What day are they flying over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm...\u201d I take a sip of coffee, avoiding his eye. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the exact day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice resounds through the room on the machine, and I jump, spilling some coffee on the sofa. \u201cBecky, love, I need to talk to you about the band. They say they can\u2019t do \u2018Dancing Queen\u2019 because their bass player can only play four chords. So they\u2019ve sent me a list of songs they can play\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck. I dive across the room and grab the receiver.</p><p>\u201cMum!\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cHi. Listen, I\u2019m in the middle of something, can I call you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, love, you need to approve the list of songs! I\u2019ll send you a fax, shall I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.

I mean, they only look like a swan for about two seconds...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d exclaims Mum in shock. \u201cHow can you talk like that! Janice went on a napkin-arranging course especially for your wedding! It cost her forty-five pounds, and she had to take her own packed lunch\u2014\u201d</p><p>Remorse pours over me.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Mum, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just a bit preoccupied. Let\u2019s go for... bishops\u2019 hats. And tell Janice I\u2019m really grateful for all her help.\u201d I put down the receiver just as the doorbell rings.</p><p>\u201cIs Janice the wedding planner?\u201d says Michael interestedly.</p><p>\u201cEr... no. That\u2019s Robyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have mail!\u201d pipes up the computer in the corner of the room.</p><p>This is getting to be too much.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019ll just get the door...\u201d</p><p>I swing open the front door breathlessly, to see a delivery man holding a huge cardboard box.</p><p>\u201cParcel for Bloomwood,\u201d he says. \u201cVery fragile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say, awkwardly taking it from him.</p><p>\u201cSign here, please...\u201d He hands me a pen, then sniffs. \u201cIs something burning in your kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck. The Chinese herbs.</p><p>I dash into the kitchen and turn off the burner, then return to the man and take the pen. Now I can hear the phone ringing again. Why can\u2019t everyone leave me alone?</p><p>\u201cAnd here...\u201d</p><p>I scribble on the line as best I can, and the delivery man squints suspiciously at it. \u201cWhat does that say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloomwood! It says Bloomwood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I can hear Michael saying. \u201cNo, this is Becky\u2019s apartment. I\u2019m Michael Ellis, a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to sign again, lady. Legibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m Luke\u2019s best man. Well, hello!

I close the door with my foot and stagger into the living room just in time to hear Michael saying, \u201cI\u2019ve heard about the plans for the ceremony. They sound quite spectacular!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d I mouth.</p><p>\u201cYour mom,\u201d mouths back Michael with a smile.</p><p>I nearly drop the box on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all run smoothly on the day,\u201d Michael\u2019s saying reassuringly. \u201cI was just saying to Becky, I really admire your involvement with the wedding. It can\u2019t have been easy!\u201d</p><p>No. Please, no.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Michael, looking surprised. \u201cAll I meant was, it must be difficult. What with you based in England... and Becky and Luke getting married in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael!\u201d I say desperately, and he looks up, startled. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He puts his hand over the receiver. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mum. She... she doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, agonized. At last he turns to the phone. \u201cMrs. Bloomwood, I\u2019m going to have to go.

He plucks the page from the machine and starts to read it.</p><p>\u201cPlaylist for Rebecca and Luke\u2019s wedding. Date: 22nd June. Venue: The Pines, 43 Elton Road... Oxshott...\u201d He looks up, a frown on his face. \u201cBecky, what is this? You and Luke are getting married at the Plaza. Right?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t answer. Blood is pumping through my head, almost deafening me.</p> <p>\u201cRight?\u201d repeats Michael, his voice becoming sterner.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say at last in a tiny voice.</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know where you\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>He surveys the fax again.

This is even worse than Suze finding out. I mean, Suze has known me for so long. She knows how stupid I am and she always forgives me. But Michael. I swallow. Michael\u2019s always treated me with respect. He once told me I was sharp and intuitive. He even offered me a job with his company. I can\u2019t bear for him to find out what a complete mess I\u2019ve got into.</p><p>\u201cDoes your mom know anything about the Plaza?\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cDoes Luke\u2019s mother know about this?\u201d He hits the fax.</p><p>I shake my head again.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know?

I didn\u2019t mean for it to happen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to deceive two entire families? Not to mention the expense, the effort... You realize you\u2019re in big trouble here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll work itself out!\u201d I say desperately.</p><p>\u201cHow is it going to work itself out? Becky, this isn\u2019t a double-booked dinner date! This is hundreds of people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDing-dong, ding-dong!\u201d suddenly chimes my wedding countdown alarm clock from the bookshelf. \u201cDing-dong, ding-dong! Only twenty-two days to go till the Big Day!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I say tensely.</p> <p>\u201cDing-dong, ding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I cry, and hurl it onto the floor, where the clock face shatters.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two days?\u201d says Michael. \u201cBecky, that\u2019s only three weeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think of something! A lot can happen in three weeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll think of something? That\u2019s your only answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a miracle will happen!\u201d</p><p>I try a little smile, but Michael\u2019s face doesn\u2019t react. He still looks just as astounded. Just as angry.</p><p>I can\u2019t stand Michael being angry with me. My head\u2019s pounding and I can feel tears pressing hotly at my eyes. With trembling hands I grab my bag and reach for my jacket.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d His voice sharpens. \u201cBecky, where are you going?\u201d</p><p>I stare back, my mind feverishly racing. I need to escape. From this apartment, from my life, from this whole hideous mess. I need a place of peace, a place of sanctuary. A place where I\u2019ll find solace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Tiffany,\u201d I say with a half-sob, and close the door behind me.</p><p>Five seconds after I\u2019ve crossed the threshold of Tiffany, I\u2019m already calmer. My heart rate begins to subside. My mind begins to turn less frantically. I feel soothed, just looking around at the cases full of glittering jewelry. Audrey Hepburn was right: nothing bad could ever happen in Tiffany.</p><p>I walk to the back of the ground floor, dodging the tourists and eyeing up diamond necklaces as I go. There\u2019s a girl about my age trying on a knuckle-duster of an engagement ring, and as I see her exhilarated face, I feel a painful pang inside.</p><p>It seems like a million years ago that Luke and I got engaged. I feel like a different person. If only I could rewind. God, if I could just have the chance. I\u2019d do it all so differently.</p><p>There\u2019s no point torturing myself with how it might have been. This is what I\u2019ve done \u2014 and this is how it is.</p><p>I get into the elevator and travel up to the third floor \u2014 and as I step out, I relax even more. This really is another world. It\u2019s different even from the crowded, touristy floor below. It\u2019s like heaven.</p><p>The whole floor is tranquil and spacious, with silver, china, and glassware displayed on mirror-topped cabinets. It\u2019s a world of quiet luxury. A world of glossy, cultured people who don\u2019t have to worry about anything. I can see an immaculate girl in navy blue examining a glass candlestick. Another girl, heavily pregnant, is looking at a sterling silver baby\u2019s rattle. No one\u2019s got any problems here. The only major dilemma facing anyone is whether to have gold or platinum edging their dinner service. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As long as I stay here I\u2019ll be safe.</p><p>\u201cBecky? Is that you?\u201d My heart gives a little flicker and I turn round, to see Eileen Morgan beaming at me. Eileen is the lady who showed me around the floor when I registered my list here. She\u2019s an elderly lady with her hair in a bun, and reminds me of the ballet teacher I used to have when I was little.</p><p>\u201cHi, Eileen,\u201d I say. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well. And I have good news for you!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood news?\u201d I say stupidly.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember the last time I heard a piece of good news.</p><p>\u201cYour list has been going very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d In spite of myself I feel the same twinge of pride I used to when Miss Phipps said my pli\u00e9s were going well.</p><p>\u201cVery well, indeed. In fact, I was planning to call you. I think the time has come...\u201d Eileen pauses momentously, \u201c... to go for some larger items. A silver bowl. A platter. Some antique hollowware.\u201d</p> <p>I stare at her in slight disbelief. In wedding list terms, this is as though she\u2019s said I should try for the Royal Ballet.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly think I\u2019m in that... league?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, the performance of your list has been very impressive. You\u2019re right up there with our top brides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t know what to say. I never thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever underestimate yourself!\u201d says Eileen with a warm smile, and gestures around the floor. \u201cBrowse for as long as you like and let me know what you\u2019d like to add. If you need any help, you know where I am.\u201d She squeezes my arm. \u201cWell done, Becky.\u201d</p><p>As she walks away, I feel my eyes pricking with grateful tears. Someone doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a disaster. Someone doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ve ruined everything. In one area, at least, I\u2019m a success.</p> <p>I head toward the antiques cabinet and gaze up at a silver tray, filled with emotion. I won\u2019t let Eileen down. I\u2019ll register the best damn antique hollowware I possibly can. I\u2019ll put down a teapot, and a sugar bowl...</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I say, turning round. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite decided\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then I stop, my words shriveling on my lips. It\u2019s not Eileen.</p><p>It\u2019s Alicia Bitch Longlegs.</p><p>Out of the blue, like a bad fairy. She\u2019s wearing a pink suit and holding a Tiffany carrier bag and hostility is crackling all around her.</p><p>Of all the times.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, Becky. I suppose you\u2019re feeling pretty pleased with yourself, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEr... no. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Bride of the Year. Miss Enchanted Bloody Forest.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at her puzzledly. I know Alicia and I aren\u2019t exactly best buddies \u2014 but isn\u2019t this a bit extreme?</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her voice rises shrilly. \u201cWhat could be wrong? Maybe the fact that my wedding planner has dumped me with no warning. Maybe that\u2019s irking me a little!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why has she dumped me? So she can concentrate on her big, important, Plaza-wedding client. Her extra-special, spare-no-expense client Miss Becky Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her in horror. \u201cAlicia, I had no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy whole wedding\u2019s in pieces. I couldn\u2019t get another wedding planner. She\u2019s bad-mouthed me all over town. Apparently the rumor is I\u2019m \u2018difficult.\u2019 Fucking \u2018difficult\u2019! The caterers aren\u2019t returning my calls, my dress is too short, the florist is an idiot...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I say helplessly. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t know about this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure you weren\u2019t sniggering in Robyn\u2019s office while she made the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t! I wouldn\u2019t! Look... I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all turn out OK.\u201d I take a deep breath. \u201cTo be honest, my wedding isn\u2019t going that smoothly either...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break. I\u2019ve heard all about your wedding. The whole bloody world has.\u201d She turns on her heel and stalks away, and I gaze after her, shaken.</p><p>I haven\u2019t just ruined my own wedding, I\u2019ve ruined Alicia\u2019s too.</p><p>I try to turn my attention back to the antiques cabinet but I feel upset and jittery. OK, come on. Let\u2019s pick a few things. That might cheer me up. A nineteenth-century tea strainer. And a sugar bowl with inlaid mother-of-pearl. I mean, that\u2019ll always come in handy, won\u2019t it?</p><p>And look at this silver teapot. Only $5,000. I scribble it down on my list and then look up to see if there\u2019s a matching cream jug. A young couple in jeans and Tshirts have wandered over to the same cabinet, and suddenly I notice they\u2019re staring up at the same teapot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d says the girl. \u201cA five-thousand-dollar teapot.

He says you\u2019re still getting married in New York! Bex, I can\u2019t believe you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shout at me! I\u2019m in Tiffany!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in Tiffany? You should be sorting this mess out! Bex, you\u2019re not going to get married in America. You just can\u2019t! It would kill your mum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know! I\u2019m not going to! At least...\u201d I push a hand distractedly through my hair. \u201cOh God, Suze. You just don\u2019t know what\u2019s been going on. Luke\u2019s having a midlife crisis... the wedding planner\u2019s threatened to sue me... I feel like I\u2019m all on my own...\u201d</p><p>To my horror I feel my eyes welling up with tears. I creep round the back of the cabinet and sink onto the carpeted floor, where no one can see me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve ended up with two weddings and I can\u2019t do either of them! Either way, people are going to be furious with me. Either way it\u2019s going to be a disaster. It\u2019s supposed to be the best day of my life, Suze, and it\u2019s going to be the worst! The very worst!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Bex, don\u2019t get into a state,\u201d she says, relenting slightly. \u201cHave you really gone through all the options?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of everything. I\u2019ve thought of committing bigamy, I\u2019ve thought of hiring look-alikes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea,\u201d says Suze thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I really want to do?\u201d My throat tightens with emotion. \u201cJust run away from all of this and do it on a beach. Just the two of us and a minister and the seagulls. I mean, that\u2019s what really counts, isn\u2019t it? The fact that I love Luke and he loves me and we want to be together forever.\u201d As I picture Luke kissing me against a Caribbean sunset, I feel tears welling up again. \u201cWho cares about having a posh dress? Who cares about a grand reception and getting lots of presents? None of it is important! I\u2019d just wear a really simple sarong, and we\u2019d be in bare feet, and we\u2019d walk along the sand, and it would be so romantic\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBex!\u201d I jump in fright at Suze\u2019s tone. She sounds as angry as I\u2019ve ever heard her. \u201cJust stop it! Stop right there! God, you\u2019re a selfish cow sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I falter. \u201cI just meant all the trappings weren\u2019t important...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are important! People have made a lot of effort over those trappings! You\u2019ve got two weddings that most people would die to have. OK, you can\u2019t do both. But you can do one. If you don\u2019t do either of them, then... you don\u2019t deserve them. You don\u2019t deserve any of it. Bex, these weddings aren\u2019t just about you! They\u2019re about all the people involved. All the people who have made an effort and put time and love and money into creating something really special. You can\u2019t just run away from that! You have to face this out, even if it means apologizing to four hundred people individually, on bended knee. If you just run away, then... then you\u2019re selfish and cowardly.\u201d</p><p>She stops, breathing hard, and I hear Ernie begin to wail plaintively in the background. I feel completely shocked, as though she\u2019s slapped me in the face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say at last.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, and she sounds quite upset too. \u201cBut I am right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d I rub my face. \u201cLook... I will face this out. I don\u2019t know how. But I will.\u201d Ernie\u2019s wailing has increased to lusty screaming, and I can barely hear myself over the noise. \u201cYou\u2019d better go,\u201d I say. \u201cGive my godson my love.

At last I get to my feet, brush myself down, and walk back out onto the shop floor.</p><p>Alicia\u2019s standing five yards away.</p><p>My stomach gives a little flip. How long has she been there for? What did she hear?</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I say, my voice crackly with nerves.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she says. Very slowly she walks toward me, her eyes running over me appraisingly</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she says pleasantly. \u201cDoes Robyn know you\u2019re planning to run off to get married on a beach?\u201d</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cI\u2019m not planning to run off to a beach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded to me like you were.\u201d Alicia examines a nail. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a clause about that in her contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was joking! It was... you know, just being funny...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if Robyn would find it funny.\u201d Alicia gives me her most ingratiating smile. \u201cTo hear that Becky Bloomwood doesn\u2019t care about having a grand reception. To hear that her favorite, goody-two-shoes Little Miss Perfect client... is going to fly the coop!\u201d</p><p>I have to keep calm. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t say anything to Robyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t! You just...\u201d I break off, trying to stay composed. \u201cAlicia, we\u2019ve known each other a long time. And I know we haven\u2019t always... seen eye to eye... but come on. We\u2019re two British girls in New York. Both getting married. In a way, we\u2019re... we\u2019re practically sisters!\u201d</p><p>I force myself to place a hand on her pink boucl\u00e9 sleeve. \u201cSurely we have to show solidarity? Surely we have to... support each other?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause as Alicia runs contemptuous eyes over me. Then she jerks her arm away from my hand and starts to stride away.</p><p>\u201cSee you, Becky,\u201d she says over her shoulder.</p><p>I have to stop her. Quick.</p> <p>\u201cBecky!\u201d Eileen\u2019s voice is behind me and I turn round in a daze. \u201cHere\u2019s the pewterware I wanted to show you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say dazedly. \u201cI just have to...\u201d</p><p>I turn back \u2014 but Alicia\u2019s disappeared.</p><p>Where did she go?</p><p>I hurry down the stairs to ground level, not bothering to wait for the lift. As I enter the floor I pause and look around desperately, searching for a flash of pink. But the whole place is crowded with an influx of excited, yabbering tourists. There are bright colors everywhere.</p><p>I push my way through them, breathing hard, telling myself Alicia wouldn\u2019t really say anything to Robyn; she wouldn\u2019t really be so vindictive. And at the same time, knowing that she would.</p><p>I can\u2019t see her anywhere on the whole floor. At last I manage to squeeze past a group of tourists clustered round a case full of watches and reach the revolving doors. I push my way out and stand on the street, looking from left to right. I can barely see anything. It\u2019s a blindingly bright day, with low sunlight glinting off plate-glass windows, turning everything into silhouettes and shadows.</p><p>\u201cRebecca.\u201d I feel a hand suddenly pulling sharply at my shoulder. In confusion, I turn round, blinking in the brightness and look up.</p><p>As my gaze focuses, I\u2019m gripped by pure, cold terror.</p><p>It\u2019s Elinor.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>I SHOULD NEVER HAVE stepped outside Tiffany.</p><p>\u201cRebecca, I need to talk to you,\u201d says Elinor coldly. \u201cAt once.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s wearing a long black coat and oversized black sunglasses and looks exactly like a member of the Gestapo. Oh God, she\u2019s found out everything, hasn\u2019t she? She\u2019s spoken to Robyn. She\u2019s spoken to Alicia. She\u2019s come to haul me in front of the commandant and condemn me to hard labor.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where I was?\u201d I falter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMichael Ellis told me,\u201d she replies crisply.</p><p>Michael told her?

It\u2019s only a wedding. Compared to things like, you know, foreign treaties...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to discuss the wedding.\u201d Elinor frowns. \u201cI wish to discuss Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d I stare at her, taken aback. \u201cHow come... have you spoken to him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI had several disturbing messages from him in Switzerland. And yesterday a letter. I returned home immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the letter say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to see Luke now,\u201d says Elinor, ignoring me. \u201cI would be glad if you accompany me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMichael Ellis went to search for Luke this morning and found him at my apartment. I\u2019m on my way there now. Apparently Luke wishes to speak to me.\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut I wanted to talk to you first, Rebecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p> <p>Before she can answer, a group of tourists comes out of Tiffany and for a moment we\u2019re submerged by them. I could make my getaway under their cover. I could escape.</p><p>But now I\u2019m curious. Why does Elinor want to talk to me?</p><p>The crowd melts away and we stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She nods toward the curb. \u201cMy car is waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, and give a tiny shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Once inside Elinor\u2019s plushy limousine, my terror recedes. As I gaze at her pale, impenetrable face, I feel a slow hatred growing inside me instead.</p><p>This is the woman who screwed up Luke. This is the woman who ignored her own fourteen-year-old son. Sitting calmly in her limousine. Still behaving as though she owns the world; as though she\u2019s done nothing wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo what did Luke write in his letter?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt was... confused,\u201d she says. \u201cRambling and nonsensical. He seems to be having some sort of...\u201d She gestures regally.</p><p>\u201cBreakdown? Yes, he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d I retort, unable to keep a sarcastic edge out of my voice.</p><p>\u201cHe works very hard,\u201d says Elinor. \u201cPerhaps too hard sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the work!\u201d I say, unable to stop myself. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d She frowns.</p><p>\u201cYes, you! It\u2019s the way you\u2019ve treated him!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. Then Elinor says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She sounds genuinely taken aback. Is she really that insensitive?</p><p>\u201cOK... where shall I start? With your charity! The charity that he has spent all his bloody waking hours working for. The charity that you promised him would benefit the profile of his company. But funnily enough didn\u2019t... because you took all the credit yourself!\u201d</p><p>God, that felt good. Why have I never spoken my mind to Elinor before?</p><p>Her nostrils flare slightly and I can tell she\u2019s angry, but all she says is, \u201cThat version of events is skewed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not skewed! You used Luke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never complained about the amount of work he was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t complain! But you must have seen how much time he was giving you for nothing! You used one of his staff, for God\u2019s sake! I mean, that alone was bound to get him into trouble\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d says Elinor.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m momentarily halted.</p><p>\u201cTo use staff from Brandon Communcations was not my idea. Indeed, I was against it. It was Luke who insisted. And as I have explained to Luke, the newspaper article was not my fault. I was given the option of a last-minute interview. Luke was unavailable. I told the journalist at great length about Luke\u2019s involvement and gave him Brandon Communications promotional literature. The journalist promised to read it but then used none of it. I assure you, Rebecca, it was out of my control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRubbish!\u201d I say at once. \u201cA decent journalist wouldn\u2019t completely ignore something like...\u201d</p><p>Hmm. Actually... maybe they would. Now that I think about it, when I was a journalist I always ignored half the stuff the interviewees told me. I certainly never read any of the stupid heavy literature they gave me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cMaybe that wasn\u2019t entirely your fault. But that\u2019s not the main issue. That\u2019s not why Luke\u2019s so upset. A few days ago, he went looking for family photos in your apartment. But he didn\u2019t find any. Instead, he found some letters from his dad. All about how you didn\u2019t want him when he was a child. How you weren\u2019t interested in meeting him, even for ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Elinor\u2019s face flinches slightly but she says nothing.</p><p>\u201cAnd that brought back a lot of other really painful stuff. Like when he came to see you in New York and sat outside your building and you refused to acknowledge him? Remember that, Elinor?\u201d</p><p>I know I\u2019m being harsh. But I don\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cThat was him,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cOf course it was him! Don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t know it was him. Elinor, why do you think he pushes himself so hard? Why do you think he came to New York in the first place? To impress you, of course! He\u2019s been obsessed for years! No wonder he\u2019s gone over the edge now. To be honest, given the childhood he had, I\u2019m amazed he\u2019s lasted this long without cracking!\u201d</p><p>As I break off for breath, it occurs to me that maybe Luke wouldn\u2019t want me discussing all his secret neuroses with his mother.</p><p>Oh well, too late now. Anyway, someone\u2019s got to let Elinor have it.</p><p>\u201cHe had a happy childhood,\u201d she says, staring rigidly out of the window. We\u2019ve stopped at a crossing and I can see the reflection of people walking past the car in her sunglasses.</p> <p>\u201cBut he loved you. He wanted you. His mother. But you just didn\u2019t want to see him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s angry! You leave him behind and go off to America, not even caring about him, as happy as a clam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy.\u201d Elinor turns her head. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m happy, Rebecca?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m halted. With a very slight twinge of shame I realize it\u2019s never occurred to me to think about whether Elinor is happy or not. I\u2019ve only ever thought about what a cow she is.</p><p>\u201cI... don\u2019t know,\u201d I say at last.</p> <p>\u201cI made my decision. I stuck to it. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>She takes off her sunglasses and I try not to give away my shock at the way she looks. Her skin is stretched even more tightly than ever and there\u2019s slight bruising around her eyes. Although she\u2019s just had a face-lift, to my eye she looks older than she did before. And kind of more vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cI did recognize Luke that day,\u201d she says in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you go over to him?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence in the car \u2014 and then, her lips barely moving, she says, \u201cI was apprehensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApprehensive?\u201d I echo disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cGiving up a child is a tremendous step. Taking a child back into one\u2019s life is... equally momentous. Particularly after such a long time. I wasn\u2019t prepared for such a step. I wasn\u2019t prepared for seeing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to talk to him, though? Didn\u2019t you want to... to get to know him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe I did.\u201d</p><p>I can see a slight quivering, just below her left eye. Is that an expression of emotion?</p><p>\u201cSome people find it easy to embrace new experiences. Others shrink away. It may be difficult for you to understand that, Rebecca. I know you are an impulsive, warm person. It\u2019s one of the things I admire about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d I say sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Elinor,\u201d I say, rolling my eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s not play games. You don\u2019t like me. You never have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I don\u2019t like you?\u201d</p><p>She cannot be serious.</p><p>\u201cYour doorpeople don\u2019t let me into my own party... you try to make me sign a prenup... you\u2019re never ever nice to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret the incident at the party. That was an error on the part of the party planners.\u201d She frowns slightly. \u201cBut I have never understood your objection to a prenuptial contract. No one should get married without one.\u201d She looks out of the window. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>The car stops and the driver comes round to open the passenger door. Elinor looks at me.</p><p>\u201cI do like you, Rebecca. Very much.\u201d She gets out of the car and her eye rests on my foot. \u201cYour shoe is scuffed. It looks shoddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d I say in exasperation. \u201cYou see what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She gives me a blank stare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, I give up.</p><p>Elinor\u2019s apartment is bright with shafts of morning sun, and completely silent.

He\u2019s standing at the picture window, staring out with a deep frown.</p><p>\u201cLuke, are you OK?\u201d I say cautiously, and he wheels round in shock.</p><p>\u201cBecky.

One of which has been that I\u2019ve been somewhat... deluded over the years. You never really wanted me to live with you, did you? Yet you\u2019ve allowed me to believe that you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Luke,\u201d says Elinor after a pause. \u201cThe situation was far more complicated than you might imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve played on my... my weakness. You\u2019ve used me. And my company. You\u2019ve treated me like a...\u201d He breaks off, breathing heavily, and takes a couple of moments to calm himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s a little sad is that one of the reasons I came to New York was to spend time with you. Perhaps get to know you as well as Becky knows her mother.\u201d</p><p>He gestures toward me and I look up in alarm. Don\u2019t bring me into this!</p> <p>\u201cWhat a waste of time.\u201d His voice harshens. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019re even capable of that kind of relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d says Elinor. \u201cLuke, I can\u2019t talk to you when you\u2019re in this state.\u201d</p><p>As he and Elinor face each other, I see that they\u2019re more alike than I\u2019ve ever realized. They both get that blank, scary expression when things are going badly. They both set themselves impossibly high standards. And they\u2019re both more vulnerable than they want the outside world to know.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk to me,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now. You won\u2019t see me or Becky again.\u201d</p><p>My head jerks up in shock. Is he serious?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense,\u201d says Elinor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sent a letter of resignation to the trustees of the Elinor Sherman Foundation. There should be no other reason for our paths to cross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have forgotten the wedding,\u201d says Elinor crisply.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we haven\u2019t. I haven\u2019t forgotten it at all.\u201d Luke takes a deep breath and glances at me. \u201cAs of now, Becky and I will be making alternative arrangements for our marriage. Naturally, I\u2019ll pay whatever expenses you\u2019ve incurred.\u201d</p><p>Wh\u2014</p><p>What did he say? I stare at Luke, gobsmacked.</p><p>Did he really just say what I\u2014</p><p>Did he really just...</p><p>Am I hallucinating?</p><p>\u201cLuke,\u201d I say, trying to keep calm, trying to keep steady. \u201cLet me just get this... Are you saying you want to pull out of the Plaza wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, I know I haven\u2019t discussed this with you yet.\u201d Luke comes over and takes my hands. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been planning this wedding for months. It\u2019s a lot to ask you to pull out. But under the circumstances, I just don\u2019t feel I can go through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to pull out of the wedding.\u201d I swallow. \u201cYou do know there\u2019s a financial penalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... you don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t care.</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant!\u201d says Luke, seeing my expression. \u201cI do care! Of course I care about us. But to stand up in public, and pretend to be a loving son to...\u201d He glances at Elinor. \u201cIt would be farcical. It would debase the whole thing. Can you understand that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuke... of course I understand,\u201d I say, trying to keep the exhilaration out of my voice. \u201cIf you want to pull out, then I\u2019m happy to go along.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it.

Either him or Ganesh.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot do this.\u201d For the first time there\u2019s a tremor of emotion in Elinor\u2019s voice. \u201cYou cannot simply abandon the wedding I have organized for you. Funded for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a highly significant event! We have four hundred people coming! Important people. Friends of mine, of the charity\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll just have to make my excuses.\u201d</p><p>Elinor takes a few steps toward him, and I see to my astonishment that she\u2019s shaking with rage. \u201cIf you do this, Luke, I can promise you. We will never speak again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine by me. Come on, Becky.\u201d He tugs at my hand and I follow him, stumbling slightly on the rug.</p> <p>I can see Elinor\u2019s face twitching again, and to my extreme astonishment, I feel a bit sorry for her. But then, as we turn and stride together out of the apartment, I squash it. Elinor\u2019s been mean enough to me and my parents. She deserves all she gets.</p><p>We walk downstairs in silence. I think we\u2019re both completely shell-shocked. Luke lifts his hand for a cab, gives our address to the driver, and we both get in.</p><p>After about three blocks we look at each other. Luke is pale and shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were brilliant,\u201d I say firmly. \u201cShe had it coming.\u201d</p><p>He swivels in his seat and looks at me earnestly. \u201cBecky, I\u2019m so sorry about the wedding. I know how much you\u2019ve been looking forward to it. I\u2019ll make it up to you. I promise. Just tell me how.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, my mind working fast. OK. I have to play this one very carefully. If I make the wrong move, everything could still fall about my ears.</p><p>\u201cSo... you do still want to get married? You know, in principle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I do!\u201d Luke looks shocked. \u201cBecky, I love you. Even more than I did before. In fact, I\u2019ve never loved you as much as I did in that room. When you made that incredible sacrifice for me, without even a moment\u2019s hesitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, the wedding! Yes.\u201d I compose my features hastily. \u201cYes, well. It was quite a lot to ask of me. And um... speaking of... weddings...\u201d</p><p>I almost can\u2019t bring myself to say it. I feel as though I\u2019m trying to balance the last card on top of the pyramid. I have to get it exactly right.</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel about getting married in... Oxshott?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOxshott. Perfect.\u201d Luke closes his eyes and leans back on his seat, looking exhausted.</p><p>I\u2019m numb with disbelief. It\u2019s all fallen into place. The miracle is complete.</p><p>As we drive down Fifth Avenue I look out of the window of the cab, suddenly taking in the world outside. Noticing for the first time that it\u2019s summer. That it\u2019s a beautiful sunshiny day. That Saks has a new window display of swimwear. Little things I haven\u2019t been able to see, let alone appreciate, because I\u2019ve been so preoccupied, so stressed.</p><p>I feel as though I\u2019ve been walking around with a heavy weight on my back for such a long time, I\u2019ve forgotten what it\u2019s like to walk upright. But at last the burden is lifted, and I can cautiously stand up and stretch, and start to enjoy myself. The months of nightmaresville are over. Finally, I can sleep easy.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>EXCEPT I DON\u2019T.</p><p>In fact, I don\u2019t sleep at all.</p><p>Long after Luke\u2019s crashed out, I\u2019m staring at the ceiling, feeling uncomfortable. There\u2019s something wrong here. I\u2019m just not quite sure what.</p><p>On the surface, everything\u2019s perfect. Elinor is out of Luke\u2019s life for good. We can get married at home. I don\u2019t have to worry about Robyn. I don\u2019t have to worry about anything. It\u2019s like a great big bowling ball has arrived in my life and knocked down all the bad ninepins in one fell swoop, leaving only good ones behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We had a lovely celebration supper, and cracked open a bottle of champagne, and toasted the rest of Luke\u2019s life, and the wedding, and each other. Then we started talking about where we should go on our honeymoon, and I made a strong case for Bali and Luke said Moscow and we had one of those laughing, almost hysterical arguments you have when you\u2019re high on exhilaration and relief. It was a wonderful, happy evening. I should be completely content.</p><p>But now that I\u2019m in bed and my mind\u2019s settled down, things keep niggling at me. The way Luke looked tonight. Almost too exhilarated. Too bright-eyed. The way we both kept laughing, as though we didn\u2019t dare stop.</p><p>And other things. The way Elinor looked when we left. The conversation I had with Annabel, all those months ago.</p><p>I should feel triumphant. I should feel vindicated. But... somehow this doesn\u2019t feel right.</p> <p>At last, at about three in the morning, I slide out of bed, go into the living room, and dial Suze\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bex!\u201d she says in surprise. \u201cWhat time is it there?\u201d I can hear the tinny sound of British breakfast television on in the background, and little gurgles from Ernie. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry I gave you a hard time yesterday. I\u2019ve been feeling really bad ever since\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. Honestly, I\u2019ve forgotten all about it.\u201d I huddle on the floorboards, pulling my dressing gown tightly around me. \u201cListen, Suze. Luke had a huge bust-up with his mum today. He\u2019s pulled out of the Plaza wedding. We can get married in Oxshott after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Suze\u2019s voice explodes down the line. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible! That\u2019s fantastic! Bex, I\u2019ve been so worried! I honestly didn\u2019t know what you were going to do. You must be dancing on the ceiling! You must be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Kind of.\u201d</p> <p>Suze comes to a breathless halt. \u201cWhat do you mean, kind of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know everything\u2019s worked out. I know it\u2019s all fantastic.\u201d I wind my dressing gown cord tightly round my finger. \u201cBut somehow... it doesn\u2019t feel fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I can hear Suze turning the volume down. \u201cBex, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel bad,\u201d I say in a rush. \u201cI feel like... I\u2019ve won but I don\u2019t want to have won. I mean, OK, I\u2019ve got everything I wanted. Luke\u2019s had it out with Elinor, he\u2019s going to pay off the wedding planner, we can have the wedding at home... On the one hand it\u2019s great. But on the other hand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other hand?\u201d says Suze. \u201cThere isn\u2019t another hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is. At least... I think there is.\u201d I start to nibble my thumbnail distractedly. \u201cSuze, I\u2019m worried about Luke. He really attacked his mother. And now he says he\u2019s never going to talk to her again...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what? Isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Is it?\u201d I stare at the floor for a few moments. \u201cHe\u2019s all euphoric at the moment. But what if he starts feeling guilty? What if this screws him up just as badly in the future? You know, Annabel, his stepmum, once said if I tried to chop Elinor out of Luke\u2019s life it would damage him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t chop her out of his life,\u201d points out Suze. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe he\u2019s damaged himself. Maybe it\u2019s like... he\u2019s chopped his own arm off or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErr, gross!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now there\u2019s this huge wound, which nobody can see, and it\u2019ll fester away, and one day it\u2019ll erupt again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBex! Stop it! I\u2019m eating my breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, sorry. I\u2019m just worried about him. He\u2019s not right. And the other thing is...\u201d I close my eyes, almost unable to believe I\u2019m about to say this. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of... changed my mind about Elinor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou what?\u201d screeches Suze. \u201cBex, please don\u2019t say things like that! I nearly dropped Ernie on the floor!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her or anything,\u201d I say hastily. \u201cBut we had this talk. And I do think maybe she loves Luke. In her own weird, icebox Vulcan way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she abandoned him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But she regrets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so what! She bloody well ought to regret it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, I just think... maybe she deserves another chance.\u201d I gaze at my fingertip, which is slowly turning blue. \u201cI mean... look at me. I\u2019ve done millions of stupid, thoughtless things. I\u2019ve let people down. But they\u2019ve always given me another chance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBex, you\u2019re nothing like bloody Elinor!

I\u2019ll kill you. I really will. If you tell me now that you want to get married in New York\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuze, I don\u2019t want to get married in New York. Of course I don\u2019t!

Luke is standing there in his boxers and T-shirt, staring in bleary puzzlement at me.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say, putting a hand over the receiver. \u201cJust talking to Suze. You go back to bed. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p> <p>I wait until he\u2019s gone and then shuffle closer to the radiator, which is still giving out a feeble heat.</p><p>\u201cOK, Suze, listen,\u201d I say. \u201cJust... just hear me out. I\u2019m not going to fuck anything up. I\u2019ve been thinking really hard, and I\u2019ve had this genius idea...\u201d</p><p>By nine the next morning I\u2019m at Elinor\u2019s apartment. I\u2019ve dressed very carefully and am wearing my smartest linen U.N. diplomatic envoy-style suit, together with a pair of nonconfrontational rounded-toe shoes. Although I\u2019m not sure Elinor quite appreciates the effort I\u2019ve made. As she answers the door she looks even paler than usual and her eyes are like daggers.</p><p>\u201cRebecca,\u201d she says stonily.</p><p>\u201cElinor,\u201d I reply, equally stonily. Then I remember I\u2019ve come here in order to be conciliatory. \u201cElinor,\u201d I repeat, trying to inject the word with some warmth. \u201cI\u2019ve come to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo apologize,\u201d she says, heading down the corridor.</p><p>God, she is a cow. And anyway, what did I do? Nothing! For a moment I consider turning round and leaving. But I\u2019ve decided to do this, so I will.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I say. \u201cJust to talk. About you. And Luke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has regretted his rash actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wishes to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He doesn\u2019t! He\u2019s hurt and angry and he has no desire to go near you again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause... I think it would be a good thing if the two of you tried to make up. Or at least talk to each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to Luke,\u201d replies Elinor. \u201cI have nothing to say to you. As Luke indicated yesterday, the relationship is terminated.\u201d</p><p>God, they are so like each other.</p><p>\u201cSo... have you told Robyn yet about the wedding being off?\u201d This is my secret fear, and I hold my breath for an answer.</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought I would give Luke a chance to reconsider. Clearly this was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ll get Luke to go through with the wedding. If you apologize to him.\u201d My voice is a little shaky. I can\u2019t quite believe I\u2019m doing this.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Elinor turns and stares at me.</p><p>\u201cYou apologize to Luke and tell him... well, basically, that you love him. And I\u2019ll persuade him to get married at the Plaza. You\u2019ll have your big smart wedding for all your friends. That\u2019s the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re... bargaining with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes.\u201d I turn to face her square-on and clench my fists tightly by my sides. \u201cBasically, Elinor, I\u2019m here for completely selfish reasons. Luke has been screwed up about you all his life. Now he\u2019s decided he never wants to see you again. Which is all fine and good \u2014 but I\u2019m worried that\u2019s not the end. I\u2019m worried in two years\u2019 time he\u2019ll suddenly decide he\u2019s got to come back to New York and find you and see if you really are as bad as he thinks you are. And it\u2019ll all start again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is preposterous.

You\u2019re here because you want to get married at the Plaza.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s why I\u2019m here?\u201d I gape at her. \u201cBecause I\u2019m upset that the Plaza wedding was canceled?\u201d</p><p>I almost feel like laughing hysterically. I almost want to tell her the whole truth, right from the beginning.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Elinor,\u201d I say at last. \u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I can live without the Plaza wedding. Yes, I was looking forward to it and it was exciting. But if Luke doesn\u2019t want it... that\u2019s it. I can drop it just like that. It\u2019s not my friends. It\u2019s not my home city. I really don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another sharp silence. Elinor moves away to a polished side table and, to my utter astonishment, takes out a cigarette and lights it. She\u2019s kept that habit very quiet!</p><p>\u201cI can persuade Luke,\u201d I say, watching her put the box away. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are... beyond belief,\u201d she says. \u201cUsing your own wedding as a bargaining tool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I am. Is that a yes?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve won. I can see it in her face. She\u2019s already decided.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what you have to say.\u201d I get out a piece of paper from my bag. \u201cIt\u2019s all the stuff Luke needs to hear. You have to tell him you love him, you have to say how much you missed him when he was a child, how you thought he\u2019d be better off in Britain, how the only reason you didn\u2019t want to see him was you were afraid of disappointing him...\u201d I hand the paper to Elinor. \u201cI know none of it is going to sound remotely natural. So you\u2019d better start off by saying \u2018These words don\u2019t come naturally to me.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Elinor stares blankly at the sheet. She\u2019s breathing heavily and for a moment I think she\u2019s going to throw it at me. Then, carefully, she folds up the piece of paper and puts it on the side table. Is that another twitch of emotion beneath her eye? Is she upset? Livid? Or just disdainful?</p><p>I just can\u2019t get my head round Elinor. One minute I think she\u2019s carrying round a huge untapped love deep inside her \u2014 and the next I think she\u2019s a coldhearted cow. One minute I think she completely hates me. Then I think, maybe she just has no idea how she comes across. Maybe, all this time, she\u2019s genuinely believed she was being friendly.</p> <p>I mean, if no one\u2019s ever told her what an awful manner she has... how\u2019s she to know?</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean by saying that Luke might decide to come back to New York?\u201d she says frostily. \u201cAre you planning to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it yet,\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cBut yes. I think we might. New York\u2019s been great, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good place for us to be anymore. Luke\u2019s burned out. He needs a change of scene.\u201d</p><p>He needs to be away from you, I add silently.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Elinor draws on her cigarette. \u201cYou appreciate I had arranged an interview with the co-op board of this building? At considerable effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Luke told me. But to be honest, Elinor, we would never have lived here.\u201d</p><p>Her face flickers again, and I can tell she\u2019s suppressing some kind of feeling. But what? Is it fury with me for being so ungrateful? Is it distress that Luke\u2019s not going to live in her building after all? Part of me is desperately curious, wants to pick away at her facade, nose in, and find out all about her.</p><p>And another, more sensible part of me says, just leave it, Becky. Just leave it.</p> <p>As I reach the door, though, I can\u2019t resist turning round. \u201cElinor, you know how they say inside every fat person there\u2019s a thin person struggling to get out? Well... the more I think about you, the more I think there might \u2014 possibly \u2014 be a nice person inside you. But as long as you keep being mean to people and telling them their shoes are shoddy, no one\u2019s ever going to know.\u201d</p><p>There. She\u2019ll probably kill me now. I\u2019d better get out. Trying not to look as though I\u2019m running, I head down the corridor and out of the apartment. I close the door behind me and lean against it, my heart thudding.</p><p>OK. So far so good. Now for Luke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have absolutely no idea why you want to go to the Rainbow Room.\u201d Luke leans back in his taxi seat and scowls out of the window.</p><p>\u201cBecause I never have, OK? I want to see the view!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why now? Why today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not today?\u201d I glance at my watch and then survey Luke anxiously.</p> <p>He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s happy. He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s liberated. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s brooding.</p><p>Superficially, things have started to get slightly better. At least he hasn\u2019t given away any more items of clothing, and this morning he actually shaved. But he\u2019s still far from his old self. He didn\u2019t go into work today but sat all day watching a triple bill of old black-and-white films starring Bette Davis.</p><p>Funnily enough, I\u2019d never seen the resemblance between Bette Davis and Elinor before.</p><p>The truth is, Annabel was right, I think as I watch him. Well, of course she was. She knows her stepson as though he were her own child. And she knows that Elinor is right inside Luke, part of his very being. He can\u2019t just cut her out and move on. He needs at least the chance of some kind of resolution. Even if it is painful.</p><p>I shut my eyes and send a silent plea to all gods. Please let this work. Please. And then maybe we\u2019ll be able to draw a line under all of it and get on with our lives.</p> <p>\u201cRockefeller Center,\u201d says the taxi driver, pulling up, and I smile at Luke, trying to hide my nerves.</p><p>I tried to think of the least likely place that Elinor would ever be found \u2014 and came up with the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center, where tourists go to drink cocktails and gawk at the view over Manhattan. As we head up to the sixty-fifth floor in the lift, we\u2019re both silent, and I pray desperately that she\u2019ll be there, that it\u2019ll all work out, that Luke won\u2019t get too pissed off with me\u2014</p><p>We walk out of the lift... and I can already see her. Sitting at a window table in a dark jacket, her face silhouetted against the view.</p><p>As he spots her, Luke gives a start.</p><p>\u201cBecky. What the fuck\u2014\u201d He turns on his heel and I grab his arm.</p><p>\u201cLuke, please. She wants to talk to you. Just... give her a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou set this up?\u201d His face is white with anger. \u201cYou brought me here deliberately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to! You wouldn\u2019t have come otherwise. Just five minutes. Listen to what she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth should I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think the two of you need to talk. Luke, you can\u2019t leave it like you did. It\u2019s eating you up inside! And it\u2019s not going to get any better unless you talk to her... Come on, Luke.\u201d I loosen my grip on his arm and look at him pleadingly. \u201cJust five minutes. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>He has to agree. If he stalks out now, I\u2019m dead.</p><p>A group of German tourists have come up behind us and I watch them milling around at the window, gasping admiringly at the view.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d says Luke at last. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Slowly he walks across the room and sits down opposite Elinor. She glances over at me and nods, and I turn away, my heart beating fast. Please don\u2019t let her fuck this one up. Please.</p><p>I walk out of the bar and make my way into an empty function room, where I stand at the floor-length window, gazing out over the city. After a while I glance at my watch. It\u2019s been five minutes and he hasn\u2019t stormed out yet.</p> <p>She\u2019s delivered on her side of the deal. Now I have to deliver on mine.</p><p>I get out my mobile phone, feeling sick with dread. This is going to be hard. This is going to be really hard. I don\u2019t know how Mum\u2019s going to react. I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to say.</p><p>But the point is, whatever she says, however furious she gets, I know Mum and I will last. Mum and I are there for the duration.</p><p>Whereas this could be Luke\u2019s only chance to reconcile with Elinor.</p><p>As I listen to the ringing tone, I stare out over the endless silvery blocks and towers of Manhattan. The sun\u2019s glinting off one building, only to be reflected off another, just like Luke said. Backward and forward, never leaving. The yellow taxis are so far down they look like Tonka toys and the people scurrying about are like tiny insects. And there in the middle is the green rectangular form of Central Park, like a picnic rug laid down for the children to play on.</p><p>I gaze out, mesmerized by the sight. Did I really mean what I said to Elinor yesterday? Do I really want for Luke and me to leave this amazing city?</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Mum\u2019s voice breaks my thoughts, and my head jolts upward. For a moment I\u2019m paralyzed with nerves. I can\u2019t do this.</p><p>But I have to.</p><p>I have no choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi, Mum,\u201d I say at last, digging my nails into the palm of my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s Becky.

B251 W. 11th Street</p><p>New York, NY 10014</p><p>Dear Miss Bloomwood:</p><p>Thank you very much for your wedding invitation addressed to Walt Pitman.</p><p>After some discussion we have decided to take you into our confidence. Walt Pitman does not in fact exist. It is a generic name, used to represent all our customer care operatives.</p> <p>The name \u201cWalt Pitman\u201d was chosen after extensive focus group research to suggest an approachable yet competent figure. Customer feedback has shown that the continual presence of Walt in our customers\u2019 lives has increased confidence and loyalty by over 50 percent.</p><p>We would be grateful if you would keep this fact to yourself.

My birthday is March 5th and my favorite color is blue.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Bernard Lieberman</p><p>Senior Vice-President</p><p>Twenty</p><p>OK. DON\u2019T PANIC. This is going to work. If I just keep my head and remain calm, it\u2019ll work.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll never work,\u201d says Suze\u2019s voice in my ear.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d I say crossly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll never work in a million years. I\u2019m just warning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be warning me! You\u2019re supposed to be encouraging me!\u201d I lower my voice. \u201cAnd as long as everyone does what they\u2019re supposed to, it will work. It has to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m standing at the window of a twelfth-floor suite at the Plaza, staring at Plaza Square below. Outside, it\u2019s a hot sunny day. People are milling around in Tshirts and shorts, doing normal things like hiring horse carriages to go round the park and tossing coins into the fountain.</p><p>And here am I, dressed in a towel, with my hair teased beyond recognition into a Sleeping Beauty style, and makeup an inch thick, walking around in the highest white satin shoes I\u2019ve ever come across in my life. (Christian Louboutin, from Barneys. I get a discount.)</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d comes Suze\u2019s voice again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I watch a woman with denim shorts sit down on a bench and snap open a can of Coke, completely unaware she\u2019s being watched. \u201cTo try to get a grip on normality, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormality?\u201d I hear Suze splutter down the phone. \u201cBex, it\u2019s a bit late for normality!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf normality is planet earth, do you know where you are right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... the moon?\u201d I hazard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fifty million light-years away. You\u2019re... in another galaxy. A long long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do feel a bit like I\u2019m in a different world,\u201d I admit, and turn to survey the palatial suite behind me.</p><p>The atmosphere is hushed and heavy with scent and hairspray and expectation. Everywhere I look there are lavish flower arrangements, baskets of fruit and chocolates, and bottles of champagne on ice. Over by the dressing table the hairdresser and makeup girl are chatting to one another while they work on Erin. Meanwhile the reportage photographer is changing his film, his assistant is watching Madonna on MTV, and a room-service waiter is clearing away yet another round of cups and glasses.</p><p>It\u2019s all so glamorous, so expensive. But at the same time, what I\u2019m reminded of most of all is getting ready for the summer school play. The windows would be covered in black material, and we\u2019d all crowd round a mirror getting all overexcited, and out the front we\u2019d hear the parents filing in, but we wouldn\u2019t be allowed to peek out and see them...</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d comes Suze\u2019s voice again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStill looking out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop looking out the window!

It\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you haven\u2019t told anyone,\u201d she says for the millionth time. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told Danny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I\u2019m not that stupid!\u201d I edge casually into a corner where no one can hear me. \u201cOnly Michael knows. And Laurel. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one suspects anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d I say, just as Robyn comes into the room. \u201cHi, Robyn! Suze, I\u2019ll talk to you later, OK\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I put the phone down and smile at Robyn, who\u2019s wearing a bright pink suit and a headset and carrying a walkie-talkie.</p><p>\u201cOK, Becky,\u201d she says in a serious, businesslike way. \u201cStage one is complete. Stage two is under way. But we have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I swallow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of Luke\u2019s family have arrived yet. His father, his stepmother, some cousins who are on the list... You told me they\u2019d spoken to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they did.\u201d I clear my throat. \u201cActually... they just called again. I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s a problem with their plane. They said to seat other people in their places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Robyn\u2019s face falls. \u201cThis is too bad! I\u2019ve never known a wedding to have so many last-minute alterations! A new maid of honor... a new best man... a new officiant... it seems like everything\u2019s changed!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, and I know it\u2019s meant a lot of work.\u201d I cross my fingers behind my back. \u201cIt just suddenly seemed so obvious that Michael should marry us, rather than some stranger. I mean, since he\u2019s such an old friend and he\u2019s qualified to do it and everything. So then Luke had to have a new best man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut to change your minds three weeks before the wedding! And you know, Father Simon was quite upset to be rejected. He wondered if it was something to do with his hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not! It\u2019s nothing to do with him, honestly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then your parents both catching the measles. I mean, what kind of odds is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d I pull a rueful face. \u201cSheer bad luck.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a crackle from the walkie-talkie and Robyn turns away.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? No! I said radiant yellow light! Not blue! OK, I\u2019m coming...\u201d As she reaches the door she looks back.</p><p>\u201cBecky, I have to go. I just needed to say, it\u2019s been so hectic, what with all the changes, there are a couple of tiny additional details we didn\u2019t have time to discuss. So I just went ahead with them. OK?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say. \u201cI trust your judgment. Thanks, Robyn.\u201d</p><p>As Robyn leaves, there\u2019s a tapping on the door and in comes Christina, looking absolutely amazing in pale gold Issey Miyake and holding a champagne glass.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the bride?\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cFeeling nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really!\u201d I say.</p><p>Which is kind of true.</p><p>In fact, it\u2019s completely true. I\u2019m beyond nervous. Either everything goes to plan and this all works out. Or it doesn\u2019t and it\u2019s a complete disaster. There\u2019s not much I can do about it.</p><p>\u201cI just spoke to Laurel,\u201d she says, taking a sip of champagne. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was so involved with the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s not really,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s just this tiny little favor she\u2019s doing for me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d Christina eyes me over her glass, and I suddenly wonder how much Laurel has said to her.</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you... what the favor was?\u201d I say casually.</p><p>\u201cShe gave me the gist. Becky, if you pull this off...\u201d says Christina. She shakes her head. \u201cIf you pull this off, you deserve the Nobel Prize for chutzpah.\u201d She raises her glass. \u201cHere\u2019s to you. And good luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Christina!\u201d We both look round to see Erin coming toward us. She\u2019s already in her long violet maid-of-honor dress, her hair up in a medieval knot, eyes lit up with excitement. \u201cIsn\u2019t this Sleeping Beauty theme cool? Have you seen Becky\u2019s wedding dress yet? I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the maid of honor! I was never a maid of honor before!\u201d</p><p>I think Erin\u2019s a tad excited about her promotion. When I told her my best friend, Suze, couldn\u2019t make it, and would she like to be maid of honor, she actually burst into tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Becky\u2019s wedding dress yet,\u201d says Christina. \u201cI hardly dare to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice!\u201d I protest. \u201cCome and look.\u201d</p><p>I lead her into the sumptuous dressing area, where Danny\u2019s dress is hanging up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in one piece,\u201d observes Christina laconically. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChristina,\u201d I say. \u201cThis isn\u2019t like the Tshirts.

Although I\u2019d never admit it to Christina, I wasn\u2019t exactly counting on wearing his dress. In fact, to be perfectly honest, I was having secret Vera Wang fittings right up until a week ago.</p><p>But then one night Danny knocked on the door, his whole face lit up with excitement. He dragged me upstairs to his apartment, pulled me down the corridor, and flung open the door to his room. And I was speechless.</p><p>From a distance it looks like a traditional white wedding dress, with a tight bodice, full, romantic skirt, and long train. But the closer you get, you more you start spotting the fantastic customized details everywhere. The white denim ruffles at the back. The trademark Danny little pleats and gatherings at the waistline. The white sequins and diamante and glitter scattered all over the train, like someone\u2019s emptied a candy box over it.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen a wedding dress like it. It\u2019s a work of art.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d says Christina. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. When you told me you were wearing a creation by young Mr. Kovitz, I was a little worried. But this...\u201d She touches a tiny bead. \u201cI\u2019m impressed. Assuming the train doesn\u2019t fall off as you walk down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d I assure her. \u201cI walked around our apartment in it for half an hour. Not even one sequin fell off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to look amazing,\u201d says Erin dreamily. \u201cJust like a princess. And in that room...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe room is spectacular,\u201d says Christina. \u201cI think a lot of jaws are going to be dropping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d I say. \u201cRobyn didn\u2019t want me going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you should take a look,\u201d says Erin. \u201cJust have a peek. Before it gets filled up with people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t! What if someone sees me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d says Erin. \u201cPut on a scarf. No one\u2019ll know it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>I creep downstairs in a borrowed hooded jacket, averting my face when I pass anyone, feeling ridiculously naughty. I\u2019ve seen the designer\u2019s plans, and as I push open the double doors to the Terrace Room, I think I know roughly what I\u2019m expecting to see. Something spectacular. Something theatrical.</p><p>Nothing could have prepared me for walking into that room.</p><p>It\u2019s like walking into another land.</p><p>A silvery, sparkling, magical forest. Branches are arching high above me as I look up. Flowers seem to be growing out of clumps of earth. There are vines and fruits and an apple tree covered with silver apples, and a spider\u2019s web covered with dewdrops... and are those real birds flying around up there?</p><p>Colored lights are dappling the branches and falling on the rows of chairs. A pair of women are methodically brushing lint off every upholstered seat. A man in jeans is taping a cable to the carpet. A man on a lighting rig is adjusting a silvery branch. A violinist is playing little runs and trills, and there\u2019s the dull thud of timpani being tuned up.</p><p>This is like being backstage at a Broadway show.</p> <p>I stand at the side, staring around, trying to take in every detail. I have never seen anything like this in my life before, and I don\u2019t think I ever will again.</p><p>Suddenly I see Robyn entering the room at the far end, talking into her headpiece. Her eyes scan the room, and I shrink into my hooded jacket. Before she can spot me, I back out of the Terrace Room and get into the lift to go up to the Grand Ballroom.</p><p>As the doors are about to close, a couple of elderly women in dark skirts and white shirts get in.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the cake?\u201d says one of them. \u201cThree thousand dollars minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherman,\u201d says the first woman. \u201cElinor Sherman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is the Elinor Sherman wedding.\u201d</p><p>The doors open and they walk out.</p><p>\u201cBloomwood,\u201d I say, too late. \u201cI think the bride\u2019s name is Becky...\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t listening, anyway.</p><p>I cautiously follow them into the Grand Ballroom. The enormous white and gold room where Luke and I will lead the dancing.</p><p>Oh my God. It\u2019s even huger than I remember. It\u2019s even more gilded and grandiose. Spotlights are circling the room, lighting up the balconies and chandeliers. They suddenly switch to strobe effects, then flashing disco lights, playing on the faces of waiters putting finishing touches to the tables. Every circular table has an ornate centerpiece of cascading white flowers. The ceiling has been tented with muslin, festooned with fairy lights like strings of pearls. The dance floor is vast and polished. Up on the stage, a ten-piece band is doing a sound check. I look round dazedly and see two assistants from Antoine\u2019s cake studio balancing on chairs, sticking the last few sugar tulips into the eight-foot cake. Everywhere is the smell of flowers and candle wax and anticipation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I jump aside as a waiter wheels a cart past.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d says a woman with a Plaza badge on her lapel.</p><p>\u201cI was just, er... looking around...\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cLooking around?\u201d Her eyes narrow suspiciously.</p> <p>\u201cYes! In case I ever... er... want to get married.\u201d I back away before she can ask any more. I\u2019ve seen enough, anyway.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to get back to the suite from here, and this place is so huge I\u2019m bound to get lost, so I head back down to the ground floor and walk as inconspicuously as I can past the Palm Court to the elevators.</p><p>As I pass an alcove containing a sofa, I stop. There\u2019s a familiar dark head. A familiar hand, holding what looks like a gin and tonic.</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d He turns round and peers at me blankly \u2014 and I suddenly realize my face is half hidden. \u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d I hiss.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d he says incredulously. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to see it all. Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d I look around to see if I\u2019m being observed, then slide into the chair opposite him. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>He looks more than great. He\u2019s looking completely gorgeous, in an immaculate dinner jacket and crisp white dress shirt. His dark hair is glossy under the lights, and I can just smell the familiar scent of his aftershave. As he meets my eyes, I feel something release inside me, like a coil unwinding. Whatever happens today \u2014 whether I pull this off or not \u2014 the two of us are together. The two of us will be all right.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking to each other, you know,\u201d he says with a little smile. \u201cIt\u2019s bad luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say, and take a sip of his gin and tonic. \u201cBut to be honest, I think we\u2019re beyond superstition by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh... nothing.\u201d I count to five, psyching myself up, then say, \u201cDid you hear about your parents being delayed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I was told.\u201d Luke frowns. \u201cDid you speak to them? Do you know when they\u2019ll get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, soon, I expect,\u201d I say vaguely. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, they said they would definitely be there to see you walk down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>Which is true. In its way.</p><p>Luke doesn\u2019t know anything of my plans. He\u2019s had enough to deal with as it is. For once, I\u2019m the one in charge.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019ve seen a completely different Luke over the last few weeks. A younger, more vulnerable Luke, whom the rest of the world doesn\u2019t know anything about. After he had that meeting with Elinor, he was very quiet for a while. There was no huge emotional outburst, no dramatic scene. In some ways, he simply went back to normal. But he was still fragile, still exhausted. Still nowhere near being able to go to work. For about two weeks, he just slept and slept, fourteen or fifteen hours a day. It was as though ten years of driving himself too hard were finally catching up with him.</p><p>Now he\u2019s gradually becoming his usual self. He\u2019s getting back that veneer of confidence. That blank expression when he doesn\u2019t want people to know what he\u2019s feeling. That abrupt, businesslike manner. He\u2019s been into the office during the past week, and it\u2019s been like old times.</p><p>Although not quite. Because although the veneer\u2019s back, the point is, I\u2019ve seen underneath it. I\u2019ve seen the way Luke works. The way he thinks and what he\u2019s scared of and what he really wants out of life. Before all this happened, we\u2019d been together for over two years. We\u2019d lived together, we were a successful couple. But now I feel I know him in a way I never did before.</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking back to that conversation I had with my mother,\u201d he says, frowning into his drink. \u201cUp in the Rainbow Room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I say warily. \u201cWhat exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still find it confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConfusing?\u201d I say after a pause. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard her speak that way before. It didn\u2019t seem real.\u201d He looks up. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should believe her.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and take his hand. \u201cLuke, just because she\u2019s never said those things to you before, it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>This is what I\u2019ve said to him nearly every day since he had the meeting with Elinor. I want to stop him picking away at it. I want him to accept what she said, and be happy. But he\u2019s too intelligent for that. He\u2019s silent for a few moments, and I know he\u2019s replaying the conversation in his mind.</p><p>\u201cSome of the things she said seemed so true, and others, so false.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhich bits sounded false?\u201d I say lightly. \u201cOut of interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she told me that she was proud of everything I\u2019d done, from the founding of my company to choosing you as a wife. It just didn\u2019t quite... I don\u2019t know...\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was rather good!\u201d I retort before I can stop myself. \u201cI mean... you know... quite a likely thing for her to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then she said something else. She said there wasn\u2019t a single day since I was born that she hadn\u2019t thought about me.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cAnd the way she said it... I really believed her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said that?\u201d I say, taken aback.</p><p>There was nothing about that on the piece of paper I gave Elinor. I reach for Luke\u2019s gin and tonic and take a sip, thinking hard.</p><p>\u201cI really do think she meant what she said,\u201d I say at last. \u201cIn fact... I know it. The point is, she wanted to tell you she loved you. Even if everything she said didn\u2019t sound completely natural, that\u2019s what she wanted you to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d He meets my eyes. \u201cBut still. I can\u2019t feel the same way about her. I can\u2019t go back to where I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say after a short silence. \u201cWell... I think that\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>The spell\u2019s been lifted. Luke has finally woken up.</p><p>I lean over and kiss him, then take another sip of his drink. \u201cI should go and put my frock on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wearing that fetching anorak?\u201d says Luke with a grin.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to. But now you\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ll just have to find something else, I suppose...\u201d I get up to go \u2014 then hesitate. \u201cListen, Luke. If things seem a bit strange today, just... go with it, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Luke in surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise.\u201d He gives me a sideways look. \u201cBecky, is there anything I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no,\u201d I say innocently. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. See you in there.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE I\u2019VE made it to this moment. I honestly can\u2019t believe it\u2019s really happening.</p><p>I\u2019m wearing a wedding dress and a sparkly tiara in my hair.</p><p>I\u2019m a bride.</p><p>As I\u2019m led by Robyn down the empty, silent Plaza corridors, I feel a bit like the president in a Hollywood movie. \u201cThe Beauty is on the move,\u201d she\u2019s muttering into her headset as we walk along the plushy red carpet. \u201cThe Beauty is approaching.\u201d</p><p>We turn a corner and I catch a glimpse of myself in a huge antique mirror, and feel a dart of shock. Of course I know what I look like. I\u2019ve just spent half an hour staring at myself in the suite upstairs, for goodness\u2019 sake. But still, catching myself unawares, I can\u2019t quite believe that girl in the veil is me. It\u2019s me.</p> <p>I\u2019m about to walk up the aisle at the Plaza. Four hundred people watching every move. Oh God.</p><p>Oh God. What am I thinking?</p><p>As I see the doors of the Terrace Room, I start to panic, and my fingers tighten around my bouquet. This is never going to work. I must be mad. I can\u2019t do it. I want to run away.</p><p>But there\u2019s nowhere to run. There\u2019s nothing else to do but go forward.</p><p>Erin and the other bridesmaids are waiting, and as we draw near, they all begin to coo over my dress. I\u2019ve no idea what their names are. They\u2019re daughters of Elinor\u2019s friends. After today I\u2019ll probably never see them again.</p><p>\u201cString orchestra. Stand by for Beauty,\u201d Robyn is saying into her headset.</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d I look up, and thank God, it\u2019s Danny, wearing a brocade frock coat over leather trousers, and carrying a taupe and bronze Ceremony Program. \u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Do I look OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpectacular,\u201d says Danny firmly. He adjusts the train, stands back for a look, then takes out a pair of scissors and snips at a piece of ribbon.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d says Robyn.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say, feeling slightly sick.</p><p>The double doors swing open, and I hear the rustle of four hundred people turning in their seats. The string orchestra starts to play the theme from Sleeping Beauty, and the bridesmaids begin to walk up the aisle.</p><p>And suddenly I\u2019m walking forward. I\u2019m walking into the enchanted forest, carried on the swell of the music. Little lights are twinkling overhead. Pine needles are giving off their scent under my feet. There\u2019s the smell of fresh earth and the sound of birds chirruping, and the trickle of a tiny waterfall. Flowers are magically blooming as I take each step, and leaves are unfurling, and people are gasping as they look up. And there\u2019s Luke up ahead, my handsome prince, waiting for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, I start to relax. To savor it.</p><p>As I take each step, I feel as though I\u2019m a prima ballerina doing the perfect arabesque at Covent Garden. Or a movie star arriving at the Oscars. Music playing, everyone looking at me, jewels in my hair and the most beautiful dress I\u2019ve ever worn. I know I will never experience anything like this again in my life. Never. As I reach the top of the aisle, I slow my pace right down, breathing in the atmosphere, taking in the trees and the flowers and the wonderful scent. Trying to impress every detail on my mind. Relishing every magical second.</p><p>I reach Luke\u2019s side and hand my bouquet to Erin. I smile warmly at Gary, Luke\u2019s new best man \u2014 then take Luke\u2019s hand. He gives a little squeeze, and I squeeze it back.</p><p>And here\u2019s Michael stepping forward, wearing a dark, vaguely clerical-looking suit.</p> <p>He gives me a tiny, conspiratorial smile, then takes a deep breath and addresses the congregation.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved. We are gathered here together to witness the love between two people. We are here to watch them pledging their love for each other. And to join with them in celebrating the joy of their sharing of that love. God blesses all who love, and God will certainly bless Luke and Becky today as they exchange their vows.\u201d</p><p>He turns to me, and I can hear the rustling behind me as people try to get a good view.</p><p>\u201cDo you, Rebecca, love Luke?\u201d he says. \u201cDo you pledge yourself to him for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health? Do you put your trust in him now and forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I say, unable to stop a tiny tremor in my voice.</p> <p>\u201cDo you, Luke, love Rebecca? Do you pledge yourself to her for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health? Do you put your trust in her now and forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d says Luke firmly. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay God bless Luke and Becky and may they have happiness always.\u201d Michael pauses and looks around the room, as though daring anyone to argue with him, and my fingers tighten around Luke\u2019s. \u201cMay they know the joy of a shared understanding, the delight of a growing love, and the warmth of an everlasting friendship. Now let us applaud the happy couple.\u201d He smiles at Luke. \u201cYou may kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>As Luke bends to kiss me, Michael determinedly begins to clap. There\u2019s a slightly uncertain pause... then a smattering of people join in, and soon the whole room is applauding.</p><p>Gary is murmuring something in Luke\u2019s ear, and he turns to me, looking puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the ring?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention the ring,\u201d I say through a fixed smile.</p><p>My heart is beating so hard, I can barely breathe. I keep waiting for someone to stand up. For someone to say, \u201cHang on a minute...\u201d</p><p>But no one does. No one says anything.</p><p>It\u2019s worked.</p><p>I meet Michael\u2019s eye for an instant \u2014 then look away before anyone notices. I can\u2019t relax yet. Not quite yet.</p><p>The photographer comes forward and I take Luke\u2019s arm firmly in mine, and Erin gives me my bouquet, wiping away her tears as she does so.</p><p>\u201cThat was such a beautiful ceremony!\u201d she says. \u201cThe bit about the warmth of an everlasting friendship really got to me. You know, because that\u2019s all I want.\u201d She clasps my bouquet to her chest. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it,\u201d I say, and give her a hug. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me, miss?\u201d says the photographer. \u201cIf I could just get the bride and groom...\u201d</p><p>Erin gives me my flowers and ducks out of the way, and I adopt my most radiant, newlywed expression.</p><p>\u201cBut, Becky,\u201d Luke says. \u201cGary says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the ring from Gary,\u201d I say without moving my head. \u201cSay you\u2019re really embarrassed that it got left out, and we\u2019ll do it later.\u201d</p><p>Some guests have come forward to take photographs, and I rest my head on Luke\u2019s shoulder and smile happily at them.</p><p>\u201cSomething else is wrong,\u201d Luke is saying. \u201cMichael didn\u2019t proclaim us husband and wife. And don\u2019t we have to sign something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssshh!\u201d There\u2019s a bright flash, and we both blink.</p><p>\u201cBecky, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He pulls me round to face him. \u201cAre we married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good shot!\u201d says the photographer. \u201cStay like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we married?\u201d Luke\u2019s eyes scan my face intently.</p><p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d I say reluctantly. \u201cAs it happens, we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s another blinding flash. When my eyes focus again, Luke\u2019s gazing at me incredulously. \u201cWe\u2019re not married?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, just trust me, OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!

Are my flowers talking to me?</p><p>Suddenly my eyes zoom in on a tiny speaker, attached to a rose-bud. Robyn\u2019s planted a speaker in my bouquet?</p><p>\u201cBride and groom! Walk!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK!\u201d I say to the flowers. \u201cWe\u2019re going!\u201d</p><p>I grab Luke\u2019s arm tight and begin to walk down the aisle, back through the enchanted forest.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not married,\u201d Luke is saying disbelievingly. \u201cA whole bloody forest, four hundred people, a big white dress, and we\u2019re not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh!\u201d I say crossly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell everybody! Look, you promised if things were a bit strange you\u2019d go with it. Well, go with it!\u201d</p><p>As we walk along arm in arm, rays of sunlight are piercing the branches of the forest, dappling the floor. Suddenly there\u2019s a whirring noise, and to my astonishment the branches creakily begin to retreat, to reveal rainbows playing on the ceiling. A heavenly chorus breaks into song, and a fluffy cloud descends from the sky, on which a pair of fat pink doves are reposing.</p><p>Oh God. I\u2019ve got the giggles. This is too much. Are these the tiny additional details Robyn was talking about?</p> <p>I look up at Luke, and his mouth is twitching suspiciously too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of the forest?\u201d I say brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s cool, isn\u2019t it? They flew the birch trees over from Switzerland especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d says Luke. \u201cWhere did they fly the doves over from?\u201d He peers up at them. \u201cThose are too big to be doves. They must be turkeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not turkeys!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove turkeys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, shut up,\u201d I mutter, trying desperately not to giggle. \u201cThey\u2019re doves.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re passing row after row of smartly dressed guests, all smiling warmly at us except the girls, who are giving me the Manhattan Onceover.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell are all these people?\u201d says Luke, surveying the rows of smiling strangers.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI thought you might know some of them.\u201d</p><p>We reach the back of the room for a final session of photographs, and Luke looks at me quizzically. \u201cBecky, my parents aren\u2019t here. And neither are yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... no. They\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo family. No ring. And we\u2019re not married.\u201d He pauses. \u201cCall me crazy \u2014 but this isn\u2019t quite how I expected our wedding to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t our wedding,\u201d I say, and kiss him for the cameras.</p><p>I can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re getting away with it. No one\u2019s said anything. No one\u2019s questioned a thing. A couple of people have asked to see the ring, and I\u2019ve just flashed them the band of my engagement ring, turned round.</p><p>We\u2019ve eaten sushi and caviar. We\u2019ve had an amazing four-course dinner. We\u2019ve drunk toasts. It\u2019s all gone according to plan. We cut the cake with a huge silver sword and everybody cheered, and then the band started to play \u201cThe Way You Look Tonight\u201d and Luke led me onto the dance floor and we started dancing. That was one of those moments I\u2019ll keep in my scrapbook forever. A whirl of white and gold and glitter and music, and Luke\u2019s arms around me, and my head giddy from champagne, and the knowledge that this was it, this was the high, and soon it would be over.</p><p>And now the party\u2019s in full swing. The band\u2019s playing a jazzy number I don\u2019t recognize, and the dance floor\u2019s full. Amid the throng of well-dressed strangers, I can pick out a few familiar faces. Christina\u2019s dancing with her date, and Erin is chatting to one of the groomsmen. And there\u2019s Laurel, dancing very energetically with... Michael!</p><p>Well now. That\u2019s a thought.</p><p>\u201cSo. Guess how many people have asked for my card?\u201d says a voice in my ear. I turn round, to see Danny looking triumphant, a glass of champagne in each hand and a cigarette in his mouth. \u201cTwenty! At least! One wanted me to take her measurements, right then and there. They all think the dress is to die for. And when I told them I\u2019d worked with John Galliano...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny, you\u2019ve never worked with John Galliano!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI passed him a cup of coffee once,\u201d he says defensively. \u201cAnd he thanked me. That was, in its way, an artistic communication...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d I grin at him happily. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you enjoying yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother-in-law is in her element.\u201d</p> <p>We both turn to survey Elinor, who is sitting at a nearby table, surrounded by smart ladies. There\u2019s a slight glow to her cheek and she looks about as animated as I\u2019ve ever seen her. She\u2019s wearing a long sweeping pale green dress and huge quantities of diamonds, and looks like the belle of the ball. Which, in a way, she is. These are her friends. This is really her party, not Luke\u2019s or mine. It\u2019s a wonderful spectacle. It\u2019s a wonderful occasion to be a guest at.</p><p>And that\u2019s kind of what I feel I am.</p><p>A group of women go by, chattering loudly, and I hear snatches of conversation.</p><p>\u201cSpectacular...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo imaginative...\u201d</p> <p>They smile at me and Danny, and I smile back. But my mouth is feeling a bit stiff. I\u2019m tired of smiling at people I don\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great wedding,\u201d says Danny, looking around the glittering room. \u201cReally spectacular. Although it\u2019s less you than I would have thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not fantastic. It\u2019s very slick, very lavish. It\u2019s just... not like I imagined you\u2019d have your wedding. But I was wrong,\u201d he adds hastily as he sees my expression. \u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>I look at his wiry, comical, unsuspecting face. Oh God. I have to tell him. I can\u2019t not tell Danny.</p><p>\u201cDanny, there\u2019s something you should know,\u201d I say in an undertone.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout this wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, kids!\u201d</p><p>I break off guiltily and turn around \u2014 but it\u2019s only Laurel, all flushed and happy from dancing.</p><p>\u201cGreat party, Becky,\u201d she says. \u201cGreat band. Christ, I\u2019d forgotten how much I love to dance.\u201d</p><p>I survey her appearance in slight dismay.</p><p>\u201cLaurel,\u201d I say. \u201cYou don\u2019t roll up the sleeves of a thousand-dollar Yves St. Laurent dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hot,\u201d she says with a cheerful shrug. \u201cNow, Becky, I hate to tell you.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to have to get going pretty soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready?\u201d I look instinctively at my wrist, but I\u2019m not wearing a watch.</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s waiting outside,\u201d says Laurel. \u201cThe driver has all the details. He\u2019ll take you to Teterboro Airport and show you where to go. It\u2019s a different procedure for private planes, but it should be straightforward. Any problems, you call me.\u201d She lowers her voice to a whisper, and I glance at Danny, who\u2019s pretending not to be listening. \u201cYou should be in England in plenty of time. I really hope it all works out.\u201d</p><p>I reach out and hug her tightly. \u201cLaurel... you\u2019re a star,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, believe me. This is nothing. After what you did for me, you could have had ten planes.\u201d She hugs me back, then looks at her watch. \u201cYou\u2019d better find Luke. I\u2019ll see you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>After she\u2019s gone there\u2019s a short, interested silence.</p><p>\u201cBecky, did I just catch the words private plane?\u201d says Danny.</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. Yes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re flying on a private plane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I try to sound nonchalant. \u201cWe are. It\u2019s Laurel\u2019s wedding present to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe snapped up the private jet?\u201d Danny shakes his head. \u201cDamn. You know, I was planning to get you that myself. It was between that and the eggbeater...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdiot! She\u2019s president of a plane company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. A private plane. So... where are you heading? Or is it still a big secret?\u201d I watch as he takes a drag from his cigarette, and feel a sudden huge wave of affection for him.</p><p>I don\u2019t just want to tell Danny what\u2019s going on.</p><p>I want him to be part of this.</p><p>\u201cDanny,\u201d I say. \u201cHow do you feel about going on a little trip?\u201d</p><p>It takes me a while to find Luke. He\u2019s been trapped in a corner by two corporate financiers, and leaps up gratefully as soon as I appear. We go around the huge crowded room, saying good-bye and thank you for coming to all the guests we know. To be honest, it doesn\u2019t take that long.</p><p>Last of all, we approach the top table and interrupt Elinor as discreetly as we can.</p><p>\u201cMother, we\u2019re going now,\u201d says Luke.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Elinor frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s too early.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell... we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for a wonderful wedding,\u201d I say sincerely. \u201cIt was really amazing.

We\u2019re off.

The music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... maybe we could forget the exit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the exit?\u201d Robyn stares at me. \u201cAre you joking?

Cue fanfare,\u201d she mutters into her headpiece. \u201cLighting crew, prepare exit spotlight.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a sudden loud fanfare of trumpets, and the guests on the dance floor all jump. The lighting changes from disco beat to a radiant pink glow, and the band starts to play \u201cSome Day My Prince Will Come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo, Beauty and Prince,\u201d says Robyn, giving me a little shove. \u201cGo! One two three, one two three...\u201d</p><p>Exchanging looks, Luke and I make it onto the dance floor, where the guests part to let us through. The music is all around us, a spotlight is following our path, and all of a sudden, rose petals start falling gently from the ceiling.</p><p>This is rather lovely, actually. Everyone\u2019s beaming benevolently, and I can hear some \u201cAahs\u201d as we go by. The glow of pink light is like being inside a rainbow, and the rose petals smell wonderful as they land on our heads and arms and drift to the floor. Luke and I are smiling at each other, and there\u2019s a petal in his hair\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>As I hear the voice, I feel a sudden chill, right to the marrow of my bones.</p><p>The double doors have opened, and there she is, standing in the doorway.

I need someone to zap her with twinkle dust.</p><p>Laurel shoots me a horrified look.</p><p>Christina puts down her champagne glass.</p><p>\u201cCode red, Code red,\u201d I hear Robyn\u2019s voice crackling from the bouquet. \u201cUrgent. Code red.\u201d</p><p>Now Alicia\u2019s walking around the dance floor, taking her time, relishing the attention.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is,\u201d she says pleasantly, \u201cthis is all a bit of a sham. Isn\u2019t it, Becky?\u201d</p><p>My eye flickers behind her. Two burly minders in tuxedos are approaching the dance floor. But they\u2019re not going to get there in time. It\u2019s all going to be ruined.</p><p>\u201cIt all looks so lovely. It all looks so romantic.\u201d Her voice suddenly hardens. \u201cBut what people might like to know is that this so-called perfect Plaza wedding is actually a complete and utter... arrrgh!\u201d Her voice rises to a scream. \u201cPut me down!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t believe it.

She starts kicking Luke with her pointy boots, and he raises his eyebrows but doesn\u2019t stop striding.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fake!\u201d she shrieks as they reach the door. \u201cIt\u2019s a fake! They\u2019re not really\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door slams, cutting her off, and there\u2019s a silent, shocked moment. No one moves, not even Robyn. Then, slowly, the door opens again, and Luke reappears, brushing his hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like gate-crashers,\u201d he says dryly.</p><p>\u201cBravo!\u201d shouts a woman I don\u2019t recognize. Luke gives a little bow, and there\u2019s a huge, relieved laugh, and soon the whole room is applauding.</p><p>My heart is thumping so hard I\u2019m not sure I can keep standing. As Luke rejoins me, I reach for his hand and he squeezes mine hard. I just want to go now. I want to get away.</p> <p>Now there\u2019s an interested babble around the room, and I can hear people murmuring things like \u201cderanged\u201d and \u201cmust be jealous.\u201d A woman in head-to-toe Prada is even saying brightly, \u201cYou know, exactly the same thing happened at our wedding\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh God, and now here come Elinor and Robyn, side by side like the two queens in Alice in Wonderland.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d says Robyn as soon as she gets near. \u201cDon\u2019t let it upset you, sweetheart. She\u2019s just a sad girl with a grudge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d says Elinor with a frown. \u201cDid you know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA disgruntled ex-client,\u201d says Robyn. \u201cSome of these girls become very bitter. I\u2019ve no idea what happens to them! One minute they\u2019re sweet young things, the next minute they\u2019re throwing lawsuits around! Don\u2019t worry, Becky. We\u2019ll do the exit again. Attention, orchestra,\u201d she says urgently. \u201cReprise \u2018Some Day\u2019 at the signal. Lighting crew, stand by with emergency rose petals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have emergency rose petals?\u201d I say in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cSweetheart, I have every eventuality covered.\u201d She twinkles at me. \u201cThis is why you hire a wedding planner!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobyn,\u201d I say honestly, \u201cI think you\u2019re worth every penny.\u201d I put an arm round her and give her a kiss. \u201cBye. And bye again, Elinor.\u201d</p><p>The music swells through the air again, we start walking again, and more rose petals start cascading from the ceiling. I really have to hand it to Robyn. People are crowding around and applauding \u2014 and is it my imagination, or do they look a bit friendlier, following the Alicia incident? At the end of the line I spot Erin leaning eagerly forward, and I toss my bouquet into her outstretched hands.</p><p>And then we\u2019re out.</p><p>The heavy double doors close behind us and we\u2019re in the silent, plushy corridor, empty but for the two bouncers, who stare studiously ahead.</p><p>\u201cWe did it,\u201d I say, half laughing in relief; in exhilaration. \u201cLuke, we did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gather,\u201d says Luke, nodding. \u201cWell done, us.

You\u2019re sure that pilot knew where he was going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty sure,\u201d I say, getting out my lipstick.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says doubtfully. \u201cThis looks a lot more like France to me.\u201d</p><p>We pull up at a traffic light and he winds down the window.</p><p>\u201cBonjour,\u201d he says to a startled woman. \u201cComment allez-vous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... I wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d says the woman, and hurries across the road.</p><p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d says Danny. \u201cBecky, I hate to break it to you... but this is France.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Oxshott, you idiot,\u201d I retort. \u201cAnd... here\u2019s our road.\u201d</p><p>I feel a huge spasm of nerves as I see the familiar sign. We\u2019re nearly there.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says the driver. \u201cElton Road. Which number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumber 43. The house over there,\u201d I say. \u201cThe one with the balloons and the bunting... and the silver streamers in the trees...\u201d</p><p>Blimey. The whole place looks like a fairground. There\u2019s a man up in the horse chestnut tree at the front, threading lightbulbs through the branches, and a white van parked in the drive, and women in green and white stripy uniforms bustling in and out of the house.</p><p>\u201cLooks like they\u2019re expecting you, anyway,\u201d says Danny. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say \u2014 and it\u2019s ridiculous, but my voice is shaking.</p><p>The car comes to a halt, and so does the other car behind, which is carrying all our luggage.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d says Luke, staring out at all the activity, \u201cis how you managed to shift an entire wedding forward by a day. At three weeks\u2019 notice. I mean, you\u2019re talking the caterers, you\u2019re talking the band, you\u2019re talking a million different very busy professionals...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, this isn\u2019t Manhattan,\u201d I say, opening the car door. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>As we get out, the front door swings open, and there\u2019s Mum, wearing tartan trousers and a sweatshirt reading \u201cMother of the Bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d she cries, and runs over to give me a hug.</p><p>\u201cMum.\u201d I hug her back. \u201cIs everything OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s under control, I think!\u201d she says a little flusteredly. \u201cWe had a problem with the table posies, but fingers crossed, they should be on their way... Luke! How are you? How was the financial conference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went er... very well,\u201d he says. \u201cVery well indeed, thank you. I\u2019m just sorry it\u2019s caused so much trouble with the wedding arrangements\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right!\u201d says Mum. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I was a bit taken aback when Becky phoned. But in the end, it didn\u2019t take much doing! Most of the guests were staying over for Sunday brunch, anyway. And Peter at the church was most understanding, and said he didn\u2019t usually conduct weddings on a Sunday, but in this case he\u2019d make an exception\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about... the catering, for instance? Wasn\u2019t that all booked for yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lulu didn\u2019t mind! Did you, Lulu?\u201d she says to one of the women in green and white stripes.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d says Lulu brightly. \u201cOf course not. Hello, Becky! How are you?\u201d</p><p>Oh my God! It\u2019s Lulu who used to take me for Brownies.</p><p>\u201cHi!\u201d I say, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you did catering!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well.\u201d She makes a self-deprecating little gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s just to keep me busy, really. Now that the children are older...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, Lulu\u2019s son Aaron is in the band!\u201d says Mum proudly. \u201cHe plays the keyboards!

You know, filo pastry is very in now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d Lulu nods knowledgeably. \u201cNo one has shortcake tartlets anymore.

The vol-au-vent is toast, if you will. May I ask where you stand on the asparagus roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum, this is Danny,\u201d I put in quickly. \u201cMy neighbor, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. B., it\u2019s an honor to meet you,\u201d says Danny, kissing Mum\u2019s hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind my tagging along with Becky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d says Mum. \u201cThe more the merrier! Now, come and see the marquee!\u201d</p><p>As we walk round to the garden, my jaw drops. A huge silver and white striped marquee is billowing on the lawn. All the flower beds read \u201cBecky and Luke\u201d in pansies. There are fairy lights strung up in every available bush and shrub. A uniformed gardener is polishing a new granite water feature, someone else is sweeping the patio, and inside the marquee I can see lots of middle-aged women sitting in a semicircle, holding notebooks.</p> <p>\u201cJanice is just giving the girls the team briefing,\u201d says Mum in an undertone. \u201cShe\u2019s really got into this wedding organizing lark now. She wants to start doing it professionally!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d I hear Janice saying as we approach. \u201cThe emergency rose petals will be in a silver basket by Pillar A. Could you all please mark that on your floorplans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think she\u2019ll be a success,\u201d I say thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cBetty and Margot, if you could be in charge of buttonholes. Annabel, if you could please take care of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d says Luke, peering into the marquee incredulously.</p><p>Oh my God. It\u2019s Annabel! It\u2019s Luke\u2019s stepmum, sitting there along with everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cLuke!\u201d Annabel looks round and her entire face lights up. \u201cJanice, excuse me for a moment\u2014\u201d</p><p>She hurries toward us and envelops Luke in a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. I\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d She peers anxiously into his face. \u201cAre you all right, darling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d says Luke, \u201cI think. A lot\u2019s been going on...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand,\u201d says Annabel, and gives me a sharp look. \u201cBecky.\u201d She reaches out with one arm and hugs me, too. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a long chat with you later,\u201d she says into my ear.</p><p>\u201cSo... you\u2019re helping with the wedding?\u201d says Luke to his stepmother.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s all hands to the deck around here,\u201d says Mum gaily. \u201cAnnabel\u2019s one of us now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s Dad?\u201d says Luke, looking around.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to get some extra glasses with Graham,\u201d says Mum. \u201cThose two have really hit it off. Now, who\u2019s for a cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting on well with Luke\u2019s parents!\u201d I say, following Mum toward the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re super!\u201d she says happily. \u201cReally charming. They\u2019ve already invited us down to stay in Devon. Nice, normal, down-to-earth people. Not like... that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re quite different from Elinor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t seem at all interested in the wedding,\u201d says Mum, her voice prickling slightly. \u201cYou know, she never even replied to her invitation!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Damn. I thought I\u2019d done a reply from Elinor.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen much of her recently?\u201d says Mum.</p><p>\u201cEr... no,\u201d I say. \u201cNot much.\u201d</p><p>We carry a tray of coffee upstairs to Mum\u2019s bedroom, and open the door to find Suze and Danny sitting on the bed, with Ernie lying between them, kicking his little pink feet. And hanging on the wardrobe door opposite, Mum\u2019s wedding dress, as white and frilly as ever.</p><p>\u201cSuze!\u201d I exclaim, giving her a hug. \u201cAnd gorgeous Ernie! He\u2019s got so big\u2014\u201d I bend down to kiss his cheek, and he gives me an enormous gummy smile.</p><p>\u201cYou made it.\u201d Suze grins at me. \u201cWell done, Bex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuze has just been showing me your family heirloom wedding dress, Mrs. B.,\u201d says Danny, raising his eyebrows at me. \u201cIt\u2019s... quite unique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis dress is a real survivor!\u201d says Mum delightedly. \u201cWe thought it was ruined, but all the coffee came out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a miracle!\u201d says Danny.</p><p>\u201cAnd even just this morning, little Ernie tried to throw apple puree over it\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d I say, glancing at Suze, who flushes slightly.</p><p>\u201cBut luckily I\u2019d covered it in protective plastic!\u201d says Mum. She reaches for the dress and shakes out the frills, slightly pink about the eyes. \u201cThis is a moment I\u2019ve been dreaming about for so long. Becky wearing my wedding dress. I am a silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not silly,\u201d I say, and give her a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s what weddings are all about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bloomwood, Becky described the dress to me,\u201d says Danny. \u201cAnd I can honestly say she didn\u2019t do it justice. But you won\u2019t mind if I make a couple of teeny tiny alterations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all!\u201d says Mum, and glances at her watch. \u201cWell, I must get on. I\u2019ve still got to chase these posies!\u201d</p> <p>As the door closes behind her, Danny and Suze exchange glances.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says Danny. \u201cWhat are we going to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could cut the sleeves off, for a start,\u201d says Suze. \u201cAnd all those frills on the bodice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, how much of it do we actually need to keep?\u201d Danny looks up. \u201cBecky, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. I\u2019m staring out of the window into the garden. I can see Luke and Annabel walking round the garden, their heads close together, talking. And there\u2019s Mum talking to Janice, and gesturing to the flowering cherry tree.</p><p>\u201cBecky?\u201d says Danny again.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d I say, turning round.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything to it.\u201d I smile at Danny\u2019s appalled face. \u201cJust leave it as it is.\u201d</p><p>By ten to three I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m wearing the sausage roll dress. My face has been made up by Janice as Radiant Spring Bride, only slightly toned down with a tissue and water. I\u2019ve got a garland of bright pink carnations and gypsophila in my hair, which Mum ordered along with my bouquet. The only remotely stylish thing about me is my Christian Louboutin shoes, which you can\u2019t even see.</p><p>And I don\u2019t care. I look exactly how I want to look.</p><p>We\u2019ve had our photos taken by the flowering cherry tree, and Mum has wept all down her \u201cSummer Elegance\u201d makeup and had to be retouched. And now everyone has gone off to the church. It\u2019s me and Dad, waiting to go.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he says, as a white Rolls-Royce purrs into the drive.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d I say, a slight wobble to my voice.</p> <p>I\u2019m getting married. I\u2019m really getting married.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m doing the right thing?\u201d I say, only half joking.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think so.\u201d Dad looks into the hall stand mirror and adjusts his silk tie. \u201cI remember saying to your mother, the very first day I met Luke, \u2018This one will keep up with Becky.\u2019 \u201d He meets my eye in the mirror. \u201cWas I right, love? Does he keep up with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d I grin at him. \u201cBut... he\u2019s getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Dad smiles back. \u201cThat\u2019s probably all he can hope for.\u201d</p><p>The driver is ringing the doorbell, and as I open the door, I peer at the face under the peaked cap. I don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s my old driving instructor, Clive.</p><p>\u201cClive! Hi! how are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky Bloomwood!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cWell, I never! Becky Bloomwood, getting married! Did you ever pass your test, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEr... yes. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would have thought it?\u201d He shakes his head, marvelingly. \u201cI used to go home to the wife and say, \u2018If that girl passes her test, I\u2019m a fried egg.\u2019 And then of course, when it came to it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, anyway\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat examiner said he\u2019d never known anything like it. Has your husband-to-be seen you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he still wants to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say crossly.</p><p>Honestly. This is my wedding day. I shouldn\u2019t have to be reminded about stupid driving tests that happened years ago.</p><p>\u201cShall we get in?\u201d says Dad tactfully. \u201cHello, Clive. Nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>We walk out into the drive, and as we reach the car I look back at the house. When I see it again I\u2019ll be a married woman. I take a deep breath and step into the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStooooop!\u201d comes a voice. \u201cBecky!

This doesn\u2019t make any sense. Tom Webster from next door is pelting toward us in his morning suit. What does he think he\u2019s doing? He\u2019s supposed to be ushering at the church.</p> <p>\u201cBecky, I can\u2019t stand by and watch,\u201d he says breathlessly, planting a hand on the Rolls-Royce. \u201cThis could be the biggest mistake of your life. You haven\u2019t thought it through.\u201d</p><p>Oh, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have,\u201d I say, and try to elbow him out of the way.</p><p>But he grabs my shoulder. \u201cIt hit me last night. We belong together. You and me. Think about it, Becky. We\u2019ve known each other all our lives. We\u2019ve grown up together. Maybe it\u2019s taken us a while to discover our true feelings for each other... but don\u2019t we deserve to give them a chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom, I haven\u2019t got any feelings for you,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m getting married in two minutes. So can you get out of my way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re letting yourself in for! You have no idea of the reality of marriage! Becky, tell me honestly. Do you really envisage yourself spending the rest of your days with Luke? Day after day, night after night? Hour after endless hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, losing my temper. \u201cI do! I love Luke very much and I do want to spend the rest of my days with him! Tom, it has taken a lot of time and effort and trouble for me to get to this moment. More than you can possibly imagine. And if you don\u2019t get out of my way right now and let me get to my wedding, I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom,\u201d puts in Dad. \u201cI think the answer\u2019s no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tom is silent for a moment. \u201cWell... OK.\u201d He gives an abashed shrug. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never did have any sense of timing, Tom Webster,\u201d says Clive scornfully. \u201cI remember the first time you ever pulled out into a roundabout. Nearly killed us both, you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK. No harm done. Can we go now?\u201d I step into the car, arranging my dress around me, and Dad gets in beside me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there, then, shall I?\u201d says Tom mournfully, and I raise my eyes heavenward.</p><p>\u201cTom, do you want a lift to the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks. That\u2019d be great. Hi, Graham,\u201d he says awkwardly to my father as he clambers in. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite all right, Tom,\u201d says my father, patting him on the back. \u201cWe all have our little moments.\u201d He pulls a face at me over Tom\u2019s head and I quell a giggle.</p><p>\u201cSo. Are we all set?\u201d says Clive, turning in his seat. \u201cAny sudden changes of heart? Any more last-minute protestations of love? Any three-point turns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing else. Let\u2019s go already!\u201d</p><p>As we arrive at the church, the bells are ringing, the sun is shining, and a couple of last-minute guests are hurrying in. Tom opens the car door and dashes down the path without a backward glance, while I fluff out my train to the admiring glances of passersby.</p><p>God, it is fun being a bride. I\u2019m going to miss it.</p> <p>\u201cAll set?\u201d says Dad, handing me my bouquet.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d I grin at him and take his outstretched arm.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d says Clive, then nods ahead. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a couple of late ones here.\u201d</p><p>A black taxi is pulling up in front of the church, and both passenger doors are flung open. I stare ahead incredulously, wondering if I\u2019m dreaming, as Michael gets out, still in his evening dress from the Plaza. He extends a hand back into the taxi, and the next moment Laurel appears, still in her Yves St. Laurent with the sleeves rolled up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let us put you off!\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll just sneak in somewhere\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... but what the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLanguage,\u201d says Clive reprovingly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being in control of a hundred private jets if you can\u2019t fly wherever you want?\u201d says Laurel as she comes over to hug me. \u201cWe decided we wanted to see you get married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real,\u201d says Michael into my ear. \u201cHats off to you, Becky.\u201d</p><p>Dad and I wait until they\u2019ve disappeared into the church, then make our way down the path to the porch where Suze is excitedly waiting. She\u2019s wearing a silvery blue dress and carrying Ernie, who\u2019s wearing a matching romper suit. As I peep inside the church, I can see the gathered faces of all my family, all my old friends, all Luke\u2019s friends and relations. Sitting side by side, happy and expectant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The organ stops playing, and I feel a stab of nerves.</p><p>It\u2019s finally happening. I\u2019m finally getting married. For real.</p><p>Then the \u201cBridal March\u201d starts and Dad gives my arm a squeeze, and we start to walk up the aisle.</p><p>Twenty-three</p> <p>WE\u2019RE MARRIED.</p><p>We\u2019re really married.</p><p>I look down at the shiny wedding band that Luke slid onto my finger in the church. Then I look around at the scene before me. The marquee is glowing in the summer dusk, and the band is playing a ropy version of \u201cSmoke Gets in Your Eyes,\u201d and people are dancing. Maybe the music isn\u2019t as smooth as it was at the Plaza. And maybe the guests aren\u2019t all as well dressed. But they\u2019re ours. They\u2019re all ours.</p><p>We had a lovely dinner of watercress soup, rack of lamb, and summer pudding, and we drank lots of champagne and the wine that Mum and Dad got in France. And then Dad rattled his fork in a glass and made a speech about me and Luke. He said that he and Mum had often talked about the kind of man I would marry, and they\u2019d always disagreed on everything except one thing\u2014\u201che\u2019ll have to be on his toes.\u201d Then he looked at Luke, who obligingly got up and turned a pirouette, and everyone roared with laughter. Dad said he\u2019d become very fond of Luke and his parents and that this was more than just a marriage, it was a joining of families. And then he said he knew I would be a very loyal and supportive wife, and told the story of how when I was eight I wrote to Downing Street and proposed my father as prime minister \u2014 and then a week later wrote again to ask why they hadn\u2019t replied \u2014 and everyone laughed again.</p><p>Then Luke made a speech about how we met in London when I was a financial journalist, and how he noticed me at my very first press conference, when I asked the PR director of Barclays Bank why they didn\u2019t make fashion checkbook covers like they have for mobile phones. And then he confessed that he\u2019d started sending me invitations to PR events even when they weren\u2019t relevant to my magazine, just because I always livened up proceedings.</p> <p>(He\u2019s never told me that before. But now it all makes sense! That\u2019s why I kept being invited to all those weird conferences on commodity brokering and the state of the steel industry.)</p><p>Last of all, Michael stood up, and introduced himself in his warm, gravelly voice, and spoke about Luke. About how fantastically successful he is but how he needs someone by his side, someone who really loves him for the person he is and will stop him from taking life too seriously. Then he said it was an honor to meet my parents, and they\u2019d been so friendly and welcoming to a pair of complete strangers, he could see where I got what he called the \u201cBloomwood bloom\u201d of good-hearted happiness. And he said that I\u2019d really grown up recently. That he\u2019d watched me cope with some very tricky situations, and he wouldn\u2019t go into details, but I\u2019d had quite a few challenges to deal with and somehow I\u2019d managed to solve them all.</p><p>Without using a Visa card, he added, and there was the hugest roar of laughter, all around the marquee.</p><p>And then he said he\u2019d attended many weddings in his time, but he\u2019d never felt the contentment he was feeling right now. He knew Luke and I were meant to be with each other, and he was extremely fond of us both, and we didn\u2019t know how lucky we were. And if we were blessed with children, they wouldn\u2019t know how lucky they were, either.</p><p>Michael\u2019s speech nearly made me cry, actually.</p><p>Now I\u2019m sitting with Luke on the grass. Just the two of us, away from everyone else for a moment. My Christian Louboutins are all smeared with grass stains, and Ernie\u2019s strawberry-covered fingers have left their mark on my bodice. I should think I look a complete mess. But I\u2019m happy.</p> <p>I think I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my life.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Luke. He leans back on his elbows and stares up at the darkening blue sky. \u201cWe made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made it.\u201d My garland of flowers is starting to fall down over one eye, so I carefully unpin it and place it on the grass. \u201cAnd no casualties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know... I feel as though the past few weeks have been a weird dream,\u201d says Luke. \u201cI\u2019ve been in my own, preoccupied world, with no idea what was happening in real life.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI think I nearly went off the rails back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then. I did go off the rails.\u201d He turns to look at me, his dark eyes glowing in the light from the marquee. \u201cI owe a lot to you, Becky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything,\u201d I say in surprise. \u201cWe\u2019re married now. It\u2019s like... everything\u2019s a joint account.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s a rumbling sound from the side of the house, and I look up to see Dad loading our suitcases into the car. All ready for us to go.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d says Luke, following my gaze. \u201cOur famous honeymoon. Am I allowed to know where we\u2019re going yet? Or is it still a secret?\u201d</p><p>I feel a spasm of nerves. Here it comes. The last bit of my plan. The very last cherry on top of the cake.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, and take a deep breath. \u201cHere goes. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about us recently, Luke. About being married, about where we should live. Whether we should stay in New York or not. What we should do...\u201d I pause, carefully marshaling my words. \u201cAnd what I\u2019ve realized is... I\u2019m not ready to settle down. Tom and Lucy tried to settle down too early, and look what happened to them. And I adore little Ernie, but seeing what it was like for Suze... It made me realize I\u2019m not ready for a baby either. Not yet.\u201d I look up apprehensively. \u201cLuke, there are so many things I\u2019ve never done. I\u2019ve never really traveled. I\u2019ve never seen the world. Neither have you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lived in New York,\u201d points out Luke.</p><p>\u201cNew York is a great city and I do love it. But there are other great cities, all over the world. I want to see those too. Sydney. Hong Kong... and not just cities!\u201d I spread my arms. \u201cRivers... mountains... all the sights of the world...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d says Luke amusedly. \u201cSo, narrowing this all down to one honeymoon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d I swallow hard. \u201cHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve... I\u2019ve cashed in all the wedding presents we got in New York. Stupid silver candlesticks and teapots and stuff. And I\u2019ve... I\u2019ve bought us two first-class tickets round the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRound the world?\u201d Luke looks genuinely taken aback. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! Round the world!\u201d I plait my fingers together tightly. \u201cWe can take as long as we like. As little as three weeks, or as long as...\u201d I look at him, tense with hope. \u201cA year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year?\u201d Luke stares back at me. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I\u2019ve told Christina I may or may not come back to work at Barneys. She\u2019s fine about it. Danny will clear out our apartment for us and put it all in storage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky!\u201d says Luke, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice idea. But I can\u2019t possibly just up sticks and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can. You can! It\u2019s all set up. Michael will keep an eye on the New York office. The London office is running itself anyway. Luke, you can do it. Everyone thinks you should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone?\u201d</p> <p>I count off on my fingers. \u201cYour parents... my parents... Michael... Laurel... Clive, my old driving instructor...\u201d</p><p>Luke stares at me.</p><p>\u201cClive, your old driving instructor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say hastily, \u201cdon\u2019t bother about him. But everyone whose opinion you respect. They all think you need a break. You\u2019ve been working so hard, for so long...\u201d I lean forward earnestly. \u201cLuke, this is the time to do it. While we\u2019re still young. Before we have children. Just picture it. The two of us, wandering through the world. Seeing amazing sights. Learning from other cultures.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s silence. Luke gazes at the ground, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to Michael,\u201d he says at last. \u201cAnd he\u2019d really be willing to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d be more than willing. He\u2019s bored living in New York with nothing to do except go power walking! Luke, he said even if you don\u2019t go away, you need a long breathing space. You need a proper holiday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d says Luke, rubbing his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s more than a holiday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt could be shorter. Or longer! The point is, we can decide as we go along. We can be free spirits, for once in our lives. No ties, no commitments, nothing weighing us down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky, love,\u201d calls Dad from the car. \u201cAre you sure they\u2019ll let you take six suitcases?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll just pay the excess baggage\u2014\u201d I turn back to Luke. \u201cCome on. How about it?\u201d</p><p>Luke says nothing for a few moments \u2014 and my heart sinks. I have a horrible feeling he\u2019s going to revert back to old Luke. Old, workaholic, single-minded, corporate Luke.</p><p>Then he looks up \u2014 and there\u2019s a wry little smile on his face. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grab his hand in relief. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019re going round the world!

This is our one chance to have a year of escape. A year of... simplicity. Just us. Nothing else!\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. Luke looks at me, his mouth twitching.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re taking two great big empty suitcases with us because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you never know,\u201d I explain. \u201cWe might pick a few things up along the way. Travelers should always support the local economies\u2014\u201d I break off as Luke starts to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Luke wipes his eyes. \u201cI know it is. Becky Bloomwood, I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Becky Brandon now, remember!\u201d I retort, glancing down at my lovely new ring. \u201cMrs. Rebecca Brandon.\u201d</p> <p>But Luke shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s only one Becky Bloomwood. Never stop being her.\u201d He takes both hands in mine and gazes at me with a strange intensity. \u201cWhatever you do, never stop being Becky Bloomwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell... OK,\u201d I say, taken aback. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecky! Luke!\u201d Mum\u2019s voice comes across the lawn. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cut the cake!

Very.\u201d He gives me a kiss, then stands up and helps me to my feet. \u201cCome on, Becky B.
